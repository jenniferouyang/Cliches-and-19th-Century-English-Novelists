she did not put the sacramental phrase on her cards as no invitations were sent out these were delivered verbally by boarders desirous of seeing their friends present on friday evening mrs jersey dignified her gatherings with the name of at homes but in truth the term was too majestic for the very mild entertainment she provided weekly it was really a scratch party of nobodies and they assembled as usual in the drawing room on this especial evening to play and not to work mrs taine laid aside her eternal knitting miss bull dispensed with her game of patience mr granger sang his one song of the early victorian epoch sometimes twice when singers were scarce and mr harmer wore his antiquated dress suit on these festive occasions it was tacitly understood that all were to be more or less dressy as mrs jersey put it and her appearance in the diamonds signalized the need of unusual adornment these jewels were the smallest and most inferior of stones but diamonds they undeniably were and the boarders alluded to them as they would have done to the kohinoor in her black silk gown her lace cap and the diamonds mrs jersey looked so they assured her quite the lady was she a lady no one ever asked that leading question as it would have provoked an untruth or a most unpleasant reply she admitted in expansive moments to having seen better days but what her actual past had been and from her looks she had one none ever discovered the usual story produced by an extra glass of negus varied so greatly in the telling that the most innocent boarder doubted but mrs jersey was always treated with respect and the boarders called her madame in quite a french way why they should do so no one ever knew and mrs jersey herself could not have explained but the term had become traditional and in that conservative mansion tradition was all powerful few friends presented themselves on this particular friday evening for it was extremely foggy and none of them could afford cabs even those who patronized the nearest bus line had some distance to walk before they knocked at the jersey door and thus ran a chance of losing their way either in light or darkness the house was hard to find for it occupied the corner of a particularly private square far removed from the oxford street traffic as a kind of haven or back water it received into its peace those who found the current of the river of life running too strong decayed ladies disappointed spinsters superannuated clerks retired army officers bankrupt dreamers these were the derelicts which had drifted hither mrs jersey called these social and commercial failures paying guests which flattered their pride and cost nothing she was something of a humbug and always ready with the small change of politeness it was quite an asylum for old age none of the guests were under fifty save a newcomer who had arrived the previous week and they wondered why he came amongst them he was young though plain looking he was fashionably dressed though stout and he chatted a west end jargon curiously flippant when contrasted with their prim conversation this was the first time he had been present at madame's reception and he was explaining his reasons for coming to bloomsbury mrs jersey introduced him as leonard train the distinguished novelist although he had published only one book at his own cost and even that production was unknown to the boarders they read thackeray and his contemporaries and manifested a proper scorn for the up to date novelist and his analytical methods mr train with a complacency which showed that he entertained the highest opinion of his own powers stood on the hearth rug and delivered himself of his errand to bloomsbury fashionable novelists said he in a still small voice which contrasted curiously with his massive proportions have overdone the business of society and epigrams we must revert to the dickens style i have therefore taken up my residence here for a brief period to study old world types here he looked round with a beaming smile i am glad to find so rich a field to glean this doubtful compliment provoked weak smiles the boarders did not wish to be rude but they felt it was impossible to approve of the young man not being sufficiently modern to court notoriety one and all disliked the idea of being put in a book mrs taine conscious of her weak grammar looked uneasily at miss bull who smiled grimly and then glared at train granger drew himself up and pulled his gray mustache he was the buck of the establishment and harmer nodded saying well well his usual remark when he did not understand what was going on only madame spoke train had taken a sitting room as well as a bedroom therefore he must be rich and as he had not haggled over terms it was necessary that he should be flattered mrs jersey saw a chance of making money out of him how delightful she said in her motherly manner i hope you will say nice things about us mr train i shall tell the truth madame the truth does not flatter mrs jersey became still more motherly and paid a compliment that depends mr train if the truth were spoken about you for instance it was really a very nice compliment but miss bull with malice aforethought spoilt it in the utterance by laughing pointedly train who had already set his face for a smile grew red and madame darted a look at miss bull quite out of keeping with her motherly manner more than this she spoke her mind i hope mr train that you will speak the whole truth of some of us miss bull shrugged her thin shoulders and in direct contradiction to the traditions of the evening produced her pack of cards she played a complicated game called the demon and never went to bed until she had achieved success at least thrice even when driven from the drawing room she would finish the game in her bedroom and sometimes sat up half the night when her luck was bad to abstain on this society evening always annoyed her and since madame had been rude miss bull seized the opportunity to show her indifference and enjoy by doing so her favorite pastime she was a small thin dry old maid with a pallid face and bright black eyes her mouth was hard and smiled treacherously no one liked her save margery the niece of mrs jersey but margery was supposed to be queer so her approval of miss bull mattered little perhaps mr granger will oblige us with a song suggested madame smoothing her face but still inwardly furious mr granger who had been waiting for this moment was only too happy he knew but one song and had sung it dozens of times in that very room it was natural to suppose that he knew it by heart all the same he produced his music and read the words as he sang margery played his accompaniment without looking at the notes she was as familiar with them as she was with the moment when mr granger's voice would crack this night he cracked as usual apologized as usual and his hearers accepted the apology as usual so it was all very pleasant 'the death of nelson' said granger is a difficult song to sing when the singer is not in voice the fog you know quite so murmured train politely do you know 'will o the wisp' mr granger mr granger did not much to his regret and mr harmer joined in the conversation now there's a song said he 'will o the wisp' i knew a man who could bring the roof down with that song such lungs i don't love that loud shouting myself said mrs taine in her fat voice give me something soft and low like 'my pretty jane' ah you should have heard sims reeves sing it said harmer i have heard him said leonard to whom the remark was addressed harmer was annoyed perhaps you have heard grisi and mario also no sir but my grandfather did probably said harmer glancing at his fresh face and bald head in a near mirror i was a mere child myself when i heard them do you know much about music mr train i have heard it a good deal talked about replied leonard with the air of saying something clever and great rubbish they talk put in mrs taine smoothing one hand over the other in my young days we talked of wagner and weber now it is all vagner and veber such affectation ah manners are not what they used to be sighed another old lady who prided herself on her straight back and clear eyesight nor singers said mr granger there are no voices nowadays none what about calve and melba asked leonard those are foreigners said mr granger getting out of the difficulty i speak of our native talent sir melba comes from australia she is not english a foreigner i tell you don't talk to me sir mr granger was becoming restive at being thus contradicted and privately thought leonard an impertinent young man madame seeing that the old gentleman was ruffled hastily intervened if mrs taine will play us the 'canary bird quadrilles' how pleased we shall be mrs taine obliged and harmer hung over the piano quite enraptured at these airs which recalled his hot youth afterward he begged for the mabel waltz meantime margery was sitting in the corner with miss bull and both were engrossed with patience madame under cover of the music talked with train you mustn't mind the guests she said they are old and require to be humored it's most amusing madame i shall stop here three weeks to pick up types oh you must stay longer than that said madame smiling and patting his hand still in a motherly way now that you have found us out we cannot lose you by the way here mrs jersey's eyes became very searching how did you find us out it was a friend of mine madame he knew that i wanted to get into the dickens world and suggested this house i am not disappointed oh not at all and leonard glanced at margery who was fat dull and stupid in her looks she certainly resembled one of dickens's characters but he could not recollect which at the moment do i know the gentleman asked madame who seemed anxious i don't think so but he is coming to see me to night you must ask him in here and introduce him i should like to thank him for having recommended my house we were going to have a conversation in my room said train dubiously he's such a shy fellow that i don't think he'll come in oh but he must i love young people madame looked round and shrugged it is rather dreary here at times mr train i can quite believe that replied leonard who already was beginning to find the dickens types rather boring who is that tall old man with the long hair hush he may hear you his name is rasper a great inventor a most distinguished man what has he invented oh all sorts of things replied mrs jersey vaguely his name is quite a household word in clapham see he's inventing something now mr rasper who had rather a haggard appearance as though he used his brains too much was glooming over the back of an envelope and the stump of a pencil he frowned as he chewed this latter and seemed bent upon working out an abstruse problem but it will really will not do mr train said madame shaking her head till the diamonds twinkled this is our evening of relaxation but miss bull against all precedent is playing 'patience' and here is mr rasper inventing she rose to interrupt mr rasper but remained to ask leonard if his friend was stopping the night he will if he comes at all replied leonard looking at his watch but if the fog is very thick i don't know if he'll turn up it is now nine o'clock we usually disperse at eleven said madame but on this night i must break up at ten as i have she hesitated i have business to do i won't trouble you madame said train my friend and i can have supper in my room that's just it said madame and her voice became rather hard i beg mr train that you and your friend will not sit up late why not we both wish to smoke and talk you can do that in the daytime mr train but my house is most respectable and i hope you will be in bed before eleven leonard would have protested as he objected to this sort of maternal government but mrs jersey rustled away and he was left to make the best of it before he could collect his wits a message came that he was wanted by jove it's george he said and hurried out of the room mrs jersey overheard the name i suppose his friend is called george she thought and frowned her recollections of that name were not pleasant however she thought no more about the matter but rebuked mr rasper for his inattention to the 'mabel waltz' it is so sweet of mrs taine to play it i beg pardon beg pardon stuttered rasper putting away his envelope and looking up with a dreamy eye i was inventing a new bootjack i hope to make my fortune out of it madame smiled pityingly she had heard that prophecy before but poor rasper's inventions had never succeeded in getting him the house in park lane he was always dreaming about but she patted his shoulder and then sailed across to miss bull the music doesn't please you miss bull she said in rather an acid tone it's very nice replied the old maid dealing the cards but i have heard the 'mabel waltz' before you may not have the chance of hearing it again said madame miss bull shrugged her shoulders to signify that it did not matter i suppose that means mrs taine is about to leave us she said there may be changes in the establishment soon miss bull it's a world of change replied miss bull in her sharp voice margery was that a heart margery pointed a fat finger to the card in question and miss bull muttered something about her eyesight getting worse madame knew that this was just done to annoy her as miss bull's sight was excellent to revenge herself she took margery away go and tell the servants to send up the negus and sandwiches she said sharply margery rose heavily she was a huge girl of twenty years of age and apparently very stupid why sharp little miss bull who loved no one had taken to her no one knew but the two were inseparable seeing this madame usually kept margery hard at work in other quarters so as to part her from the old maid but with the cunning of an animal and margery was very much of that type the girl managed to see a great deal of her one friend madame had an idea of the reason for this but at the present moment did not think it was necessary to interfere she was quite capable of crushing miss bull when the need arose meantime she vented her temper by sending margery away the girl departed with a scowl and an angry look at her aunt but miss bull never raised her eyes though she was well aware of what was going on madame was not to be beaten i tell you what dear miss bull she said smiling graciously since you have broken through our rule and have produced the cards you shall tell all our fortunes yours asked miss bull looking up for the first time madame shook her head i know mine tell mr rasper if his invention will succeed or perhaps mr granger i am at miss bull's service said the polite old gentleman bowing miss bull swept the cards into a heap i'm quite willing she said in a voice almost pleasant for her anything to oblige dear madame mrs jersey smiled still more graciously and sailed away to send mr harmer to the cards but she wondered inwardly why miss bull had given way so suddenly there was some reason for it as miss bull never did anything without a reason but mrs jersey kept her own counsel and still continued to smile she had quite made up her mind how to act ladies and gentlemen she said standing in the middle of the drawing room we must disperse to night at ten i have some business to attend to so i request you will all retire at that hour in the mean time miss bull has kindly consented to tell your fortunes it was extraordinary to see how those withered old people crowded round the table their several fates had long since been settled so what they could expect the cards to tell them save that they would one and all die soon it is difficult to say yet so ineradicable is the wish to know the future in the human breast that they were as eager as youth to hear what would befall them and miss bull wholly unmoved by their senile excitement dealt the cards with the air of a sphinx madame meantime retired to her throne and saw that the servants arranged the tray properly she had a gigantic chair which was jokingly called her throne and here she received strangers in quite a majestic way it was a sort of lady blessington reception on a small scale as mr harmer assured her and as he had been to gore house in his youth he knew what he was talking about knowing his courtly manners and being greedy of compliments mrs jersey always tried to make him say that she resembled lady blessington but this mr harmer refused to do not that mrs jersey was bad looking she had a fresh colored face bright black eyes and plenty of white hair like spun silk her figure was stout but she yet retained a certain comeliness which showed that she must have been a handsome woman in her youth her manners were motherly but she showed a stern face toward margery and did not treat the girl so kindly as she might have done as a rule she had great self command but sometimes gave way to paroxysms of passion which were really terrifying but margery alone had been witness of these and mrs jersey passed for a dear gentle old lady mr harmer is to be married announced mrs taine leaving the circle round the card table how extraordinary so extraordinary that it can't possibly be true said mr harmer dryly unless madame will accept me he added bowing i should recommend miss bull replied madame very sweetly but with a venomous note in her voice she might as well have thought to rouse the dead for miss bull paid not the slightest attention in many ways the self composed old maid was a match for madame at this moment train entered and after him came a tall young man fair haired and stalwart he was handsome but seemed to be ill at ease and pulled his yellow mustache nervously as train led him to the throne this is my friend said leonard presenting him he just managed to get here for the fog is so thick here he was interrupted madame cried mrs taine what is the matter mr harmer the water wine quick there was need of it mrs jersey had fallen back on the throne with a white face and twitching lips she appeared as though about to faint but restraining herself with a powerful effort she waved her hand to intimate that she needed nothing at the same time her eyes were fastened not so much on the face of the stranger as on a piece of yellow holly he wore in his coat i am perfectly well said mrs jersey this is only one of my turns i am glad to see you mr brendon said the stranger who seemed astonished at this reception george brendan interpolated train who was alive with curiosity have you seen him before madame mrs jersey laughed artificially certainly not she replied calmly and yours is not a face i should forget mr brendon she uttered the name with a certain amount of hesitation as though she was not sure it was the right one george nodded my name is brendan he said rather unnecessarily and mrs jersey nodded in her most gracious manner i bid you welcome sir any friend of mr train's is also my friend if there is anything to amuse you here she waved her hand we are simple people fortune telling a little music and the company of my guests mrs taine mr harmer she introduced them but every now and then her eyes were on the yellow holly brendan remarked it you are noticing my flower mrs jersey he said it is rather rare most extraordinary replied mrs jersey coolly i have seen holly with red berries before but this yellow there was a great bush of it in my father's garden said mr harmer but i have not seen any for years perhaps you would like it mrs jersey said brendan taking it from his coat she hastily waved her hand no no i am too old for flowers keep it mr brendan it suits better with your youth she looked at his face keenly i have seen a face like yours before brendan laughed i am of a commonplace type i fear he said no not so very common fair hair and dark eyes do not usually go together perhaps i have met your father perhaps replied george phlegmatically or your mother persisted mrs jersey i dare say then he turned the conversation what a delightful old house you have here mrs jersey bit her lip on finding her inquiries thus baffled but taking her cue expanded on the subject of the house it was a fashionable mansion in the time of the georges she said some of the ceilings are wonderfully painted and there are all kinds of queer rooms and cupboards and corners in it and so quiet i dare say she went on this room was filled with beaux and belles in powder and patches what a sight mr brendon what a sight will you have some negus port wine negus mr brendan she was evidently talking at random and offered him a glass of negus with a trembling hand brendan evidently more and more astonished at her manner drank off the wine he made few remarks being a man who spoke little in general company train had long ago gone to hear miss bull tell fortunes and from the laughter it was evident that his future was being prophesied no no cried train i shall never marry a literary man should keep himself away from the fascinations of female society do you agree with that mr brendan asked mrs jersey curiously he shook his head and laughed i am not a hermit mrs jersey then miss bull must prophesy about your marriage come at first brendon was unwilling to go but after some persuasion he submitted to be led to the table miss bull was quite willing to do what was asked of her and spread out the cards brendon waited beside mrs jersey with a most indifferent air she was far more anxious to hear the fortune than he was you are in trouble announced miss bull in a sepulchral tone and the trouble will grow worse but in the end all will be well she will aid you to get free and will bestow her hand on you she asked brendon looking puzzled miss bull did not raise her eyes the lady you are thinking of brendon was rather taken aback but seeing mrs jersey's curious look he crushed down his emotion at my age we are always thinking of ladies he said laughing train touched his arm it is he began but brendon frowned and leonard was quick enough to take the hint miss bull went on telling the fortune there were the usual dark and fair people the widow the journey the money and all the rest of the general events and happenings which are usually foretold but there was always trouble trouble and again trouble but you will come out right in the end said miss bull keep a brave heart i am sure mr brendon will do that said madame graciously while george bowed to the compliment miss bull again shuffled the cards and fastened her keen black eyes on madame will you have your fortune told she asked coldly oh certainly said mrs jersey in a most gushing manner anything to amuse but my fortune has been told so often and has never come true never and she sighed in an effective manner miss bull continued her mystic counting she told madame a lot of things about the house which were known to most present mrs jersey laughed and sneered suddenly miss bull turned up a black card you will meet with a violent death she said and every one shuddered chapter ii brendon's story if miss bull wished to make madame uncomfortable she certainly succeeded from being voluble mrs jersey became silent the fresh color died out of her face and her lips moved nervously twice did she make an effort to overcome her emotion but each time failed afterward she took a seat by the fire and stared into the flames with an anxious look as though she saw therein a fulfillment of the dismal prophecy her depression communicated itself to the rest of the company and shortly before ten the friends took their departure the idea of being alone seemed to cheer mrs jersey and she accompanied her departing guests to the front door it was a comparatively thick fog yet not so bad but that the visitors might hope to reach their homes for some time mrs jersey stood in the doorway at the top of the steps and shook hands with those who were going the boarders who were old and chilly were too wise to venture outside on such a dreary night so mrs jersey had the door step all to herself if you lose your ways she called out to the visitors come back you can tell the house by the red light she pointed to the fanlight of crimson glass behind which gas was burning i will keep that alight for another hour the voices of thanks came back muffled by the fog but leonard and george waited to hear no more they walked upstairs to train's sitting room which was on the first floor the windows looked out on to a back garden wherein grew a few scrubby trees so that the prospect was not cheering but on this night the faded crimson curtains were drawn the fire was lighted and a round table in the middle of the apartment was spread for supper on one side a door led to leonard's bedroom on the other side was the room wherein george was to sleep as the fire light played on the old fashioned furniture and on the mellow colors of curtains and carpet leonard rubbed his hands it is rather quaint he said cheerfully and lighted the lamp not such a palace as your diggings in duke street said brendon stretching his long legs on the chintz covered sofa one must suffer in the cause of art said train putting the shade on the lamp i am picking up excellent types here what do you think there's plenty of material growled brendon getting out his pipe don't smoke yet george interposed train glancing at the clock we must have supper first after that we can smoke till eleven and then we must go to bed you keep early hours here leonard i don't mrs jersey asked me particularly to be in bed at eleven why brendon started and looked hard at his friend i don't know but she did is it an understood thing that you retire at that hour train shook his head and drew in his chair by no means i have sat up till two before now but on this night mrs jersey wants the house to be considered respectable and therefore asked me to retire early perhaps it's on account of you old man here he smiled in an amused manner she hopes to get you as a boarder i wouldn't come here for the world retorted brendon with quite unnecessary violence why not have some tongue thanks responded george passing his plate because i don't like the house and i don't care for mrs jersey why did you advise me to come here then asked train pouring out a glass of claret well you wanted something in the style of dickens and this was the only place i knew how did you know about it george deliberated for a moment and then fastened his eyes on his plate i lived here once he said in a low voice dear me gasped train what an extraordinary thing why so one must live somewhere but you didn't like mrs jersey she was not here then who was here my grandfather on the mother's side that's fifteen years ago leonard looked at the handsome moody face of his friend musingly i never knew you had a grandfather he said at last do you know anything at all about me asked brendon no now i come to think of it i don't i met you three years ago at mrs ward's house and we have been friends ever since acquaintances rather men are not friends until they become confidential with one another well train george pushed back his chair and wiped his mouth to night i intend to turn you from a mere acquaintance into a friend i shall be delighted said train rather bewildered won't you have more supper brendon shook his head lighted his pipe and again stretched himself on the sofa train being curious to know what he had to say was on the point of joining him but he was yet hungry so could not bring himself to leave the table he therefore continued his supper and as brendon seemed disinclined to talk held his peace train's parents were dead and had left him a snug little income of five thousand a year not being very strong minded and being more than a trifle conceited as to his literary abilities his money speedily attracted round him a number of needy hangers on who flattered him to the top of his bent they praised him to his face sneered at him behind his back ate his meat borrowed his money and kept him in a fools' paradise regarding human nature poor leonard thought that all women were angels and all men good fellows with a harmless tendency to borrow such a simple simon could not but be the prey of every scoundrel in london and it said much for his moral nature that he touched all this pitch without being defiled he was called a fool by those he fed but none could call him a rogue it was this simplicity which inspired brendon with a pitying friendship and brendon had done much to save him from the harpies who preyed on this innocent in several cases he had opened train's eyes at the cost of quarreling with those who lost by the opening but george was well able to hold his own and none could say that he benefited pecuniarily by the trust and confidence which leonard reposed in him to avert all suspicion of this sort he had refused to become train's secretary and companion at an excellent salary brendon was poor and wanted that salary but he valued his independence and so preferred to fight for his own hand however he continued his services to leonard as a kind of unofficial mentor now that train came to think of it brendon was rather a mysterious person he lived by writing articles for the papers and was always well dressed his rooms were in kensington and he seemed to know many people whom he did not cultivate train would have given his ears to enter the houses at which brendon was a welcome guest but for the most part george preferred to live alone with his pipe and his books he was writing a novel and hoped to make a successful career as a literary man but as he was barely thirty years of age and had been settled only five years in london his scheme of life was rather in embryo he appeared to have some secret trouble but what it was train never knew as brendon was a particularly reticent man why he should propose to be frank on this especial night leonard could not understand after supper he put the question to him well said brendon without moving or taking his eyes from the fire it's this way train i know you are a kind hearted man and although you talk very freely about your own affairs yet i know you can keep the secret of a friend you can depend upon that george anything you tell me will never be repeated brendon nodded his thanks also he continued i wish you to lend me three hundred pounds a thousand if you will three hundred will be sufficient i'll repay you when i come into my property train opened his eyes are you coming into money he asked that i can't say it all depends do you know why i suggested this house to you leonard he asked suddenly to help me in my literary work that was one reason certainly but i had another and more selfish one connected george sat up to finish the sentence connected with mrs jersey he said quietly this remark was so unexpected that leonard did not know what to say for the moment i thought you did not know her he gasped out nor do i does she know you not as george brendon or as i am now what do you mean train was more puzzled than ever it's a long story i don't know that i can tell you the whole train looked annoyed trust me all in all or not at all finished brendon quite so he paused and drew hard at his pipe since i want money i must trust you is it only for that reason that you consider me worthy of your confidence asked leonard much mortified george leaned forward and patted him on the knee no old man i wish you to help me also in what way with dorothy ward replied george looking closely at his pipe was she in your mind to night when that old maid was telling the cards asked train sitting up with a look of interest brendon nodded but i do not wish you to mention her name that was why i know i was foolish well she's a pretty girl and as good as she is pretty which is marvelous said brendon considering the fashionable mother she has train smiled mrs ward is certainly a leader of fashion and as heartless as any woman i know observed brendon he glanced affectionately at the yellow holly dorothy gave me this to night did you see her before you came here yes i went to afternoon tea we brendon examined his pipe again we understand one another he said leonard sprang to his feet my dear chap i congratulate you thanks but it's too early for congratulation as yet mrs ward wants her daughter to make a good marriage george brendon will not be the husband of her choice but lord derrington does she want her daughter to marry that old thing you don't understand leonard i mean that if i become lord derrington when the old man dies mrs ward will consent train sat down helplessly and stared i don't understand he said i'll put the thing in a nutshell explained brendon lord derrington is my grandfather your but he never lived here no the grandfather who lived here and with whom i stayed was my mother's father he was called lockwood derrington is my father's father now do you understand not quite how can you become lord derrington when he has a grandson that young rip walter vane walter vane is the son of my father's brother and my father was the elder and the heir to the title then if lord derrington dies you become exactly but the difficulty is that i have to establish my birth leonard jumped up and clutched his hair here's a mystery he said staring at his friend what does it all mean sit down and i'll tell you leonard resumed his seat and glanced at the clock we have a quarter of an hour he said but i think we'll defy mrs jersey and sit up this night no said brendon hastily we may as well do what she wants i wish to conciliate her she is the only person who can help to prove my mother's marriage humph i thought there was something queer about her who was she my mother's maid but i had better tell you from the beginning train sat down and produced a cigarette go on he said no wait i want to know before you begin why mrs jersey was so struck with that yellow holly this time it was brendon who looked puzzled i can't say leonard do you think she connected it with some disaster asked train from her looks when she set eyes on it i should think so does miss ward know mrs jersey no she knows nothing about her and it was miss ward who gave you the yellow holly yes when i was at afternoon tea then i can't see why mrs jersey should have made such a spectacle of herself said leonard lighting his cigarette tell your story i'll do so as concisely as possible said brendon staring into the fire my mother was the daughter of anthony lockwood who was a teacher of singing and lived here she i am talking of my mother was very beautiful and also became famous as a singer at concerts the son of lord derrington percy vane saw her and loved her he subsequently eloped with her she died in paris two years later shortly after i was born and you came to live here not immediately i was but an infant in arms but my father would not part with me he kept mrs jersey she was my mother's maid remember as my nurse and we went to monte carlo i am afraid my poor father was a bit of a scamp he was at all events a gambler and lost all his money at the tables he became poor and his father lord derrington refused to help him he was angry at the marriage i suppose that's the point was there a marriage but to make things clear i had better go on as i started my father went to san remo and from that place he sent me home to my grandfather lockwood with mrs jersey no by that time mrs jersey had left i had another nurse and it was she who took me to this house my grandfather was delighted to have me as he always insisted that there was a marriage i grew up here and went to school afterward to college my grandfather died but there was just enough money to finish my education the house was sold and by a curious coincidence mrs jersey took it as a boarding establishment where she got the money i don't know but i passed out of her life as a mere infant and i don't suppose she thought anything more about me perhaps she recognized me to night from my likeness to my father as she mentioned that she had seen my face before but i can't say what became of your father that is the tragic part of the story he was murdered at a masked ball at san remo the assassin was never discovered but it was supposed to be some passionate italian lover my grandfather lockwood was so angry at the way in which his daughter had been treated that he never stood up for my rights i would not do so either but that i love miss ward now it is my intention to see mrs jersey to morrow and get the truth out of her what does she know she knows where the marriage was celebrated and can prove that my birth is legitimate that is why i came here leonard why did you not speak to her to night i think it is better she should be in a quieter frame of mind said brendon she has never seen me since i was a small child and my name of brendon is quite unknown to her why do you call yourself brendon asked train george began to pace up and down the room pride made me do that he declared when my father was murdered at san remo lord derrington denied the marriage and refused to do anything for me my grandfather lockwood gave me his own name and i was called george lockwood for many a long day at the age of fifteen mr lockwood died and then a note came to my guardian saying that lord derrington proposed to allow me a small income for what reason i can't say perhaps it was remorse train shook his head i have met lord derrington and if such an old tartar feels remorse then there is a chance that pigs may fly that's an elegant illustration leonard observed george with a smile but to continue as i see it is nearly eleven even as a boy i felt the indignity put upon me i refused with the permission of my guardian the offered sum and continued at school when i left to go to college i changed my name so that lord derrington should not have the chance of insulting me further or of knowing who i was my guardian suggested brendon so as that was as good a name as another i took it hence mrs jersey can't possibly know me or why i came to see her she will be wiser in the morning added brendon grimly but she evidently saw in you some likeness to your father evidently from all i have heard mrs jersey was in love with my father even though she was only a lady's maid but i know very little about her my business here is to learn but why has she kept silent all these years brendon shrugged his shoulders she has had no inducement to speak out he said that is why i wish you to lend me three hundred pounds leonard she will require a bribe and a larger one than that george a woman like mrs jersey would not part with such a secret for so small a sum oh i can pay her what she demands when in possession of the estates but at present she will want to see the color of my money train stared into the fire meditating on this queer story which was quite a romance then he saw an obstacle george he said even if you prove that you are the heir you won't get any money lord derrington is still living yes and from all accounts he means to go on living like the truculent old tyrant he is but the estates are entailed and must come to me when he dies and of course the title is mine too when he is done with it if mrs jersey learns these facts she will come to terms on a promise of money when i inherit then you will speak to her in the morning yes she is the only person who can right me but i mean to be the husband of dorothy ward and my only chance to get round the mother is to prove my legitimacy i don't think miss ward cares much for her mother who could asked brendon cynically she is a worthless little canary bird but i tell you leonard that frivolous as mrs ward appears to be she is a most determined woman with an iron will she will make her daughter do as she is bid and will sell her to the highest bidder as lord derrington's grandson and acknowledged heir i have a good chance as george brendon he stopped as the clock struck eleven as george brendon i am going to bed train rose to light the candles which stood on a side table yawning as he did so he was much interested in brendon's story but the telling of it had tired him i shall sleep like a top to night well get to bed i'll put out the lamp said george and did so no said leonard taking a candlestick in either hand i'll see you to your virtuous couch and he preceded him into the bedroom it was a quaint apartment with heavy mahogany furniture and a turkey carpet entering from the sitting room george saw that the bed was directly opposite the door it's been moved since my time what cried leonard setting down the candles is the furniture the same your grandfather had yes mrs jersey bought the house and its contents they are old fashioned enough in all conscience look at that ugly wardrobe he pointed to one against the inner wall and opposite the window the mirror in that used to frighten me as a little chap it looked so ghostly in the moonlight humph it's years and years since i slept in my old bed said brendon taking off his coat i should dream the dreams of childhood now that i am back again but you needn't say anything of this leonard of course not replied the other and you need not smash your yellow holly by leaving it in your coat all night put it in water no george stopped the too officious leonard dorothy put it into my coat and there it shall remain the berries are firm and won't fall i'll see to that hush what's the matter asked train startled for answer brendon quickly extinguished both candles and pointed to the door of the sitting room which stood half open not a word he murmured to train grasping his wrist to enforce attention i heard a footstep the two men stood in the darkness silent and with beating hearts a glimmer of light came from the fire and struck across into the bedroom leonard listened with all his ears he distinctly heard stealthy footsteps coming along the passage which was on the other side of the wall against which stood the wardrobe the footsteps paused at the sitting room door they heard this open and scarcely dared to breathe some one entered the room and waited for a moment or so evidently listening then the door was opened and closed again and the footsteps died away even then brendon stopped leonard from lighting the candles go to bed in the dark he said softly was it mrs jersey asked leonard of course it was she came to see if you were in bed but why should she i can't say there's something queer about that old woman get to bed leonard you can light your candle in your own room i shall not light mine train was bursting with indignation but it's absurd to be treated like a couple of schoolboys he said taking his candlestick there's more in it than that said brendon pushing him to the door get to bed and make no noise we can talk in the morning train darted across the sitting room and retired brendon closed his door softly and listened again there was no return of the footsteps so he slipped into bed without relighting the candle the clock in the sitting room chimed a quarter past eleven chapter iii the next morning fogs and smokes and chokes said the fat cook her elbows on the table and a saucer of tea at her lips i wish i were back in essex that i do the fogs come from there cried jarvey who was page boy in the jersey mansion and knew more than was good for him if they drained them marshes fogs wouldn't come here old rasper says so and knows a lot he does he don't know essex grunted the cook a lovely county for frogs sniggered jarvey devouring his slice of bread the housemaid joined in and declared for devon whence she came the swiss manservant talked of his native mountains and was sneered at by the company generally as a foreigner jarvey was particularly insolent and poor fritz was reduced to swearing in his own language whereupon they laughed the more it was a most inspiriting beginning to the day's work the kitchen in the basement was a large stone apartment and even on the brightest of days not very well lighted on this particular morning the gas was burning and was likely to continue alight during the day as the fog was as thick as ever the servants collected round the table were having an early cup of tea to assist the progress of digestion they conversed as above and gradually drifted into talking of their mistress and of the boarders miss bull in particular seemed to be disliked she's a sly cat with that white face of hers said the cook twice she said the soup was burnt i never liked her madame don't either said jarvey ruffling his short hair they've been quarreling awful i shouldn't wonder if madame gave her notice ah miss margery will have something to say to that chimed in the housemaid she likes miss bull 'cause miss bull makes much of her and no one else does well for my part said the cook i'm always civil to miss bull though she is a cat if the mistress died miss margery would govern the house and miss bull governs her i don't want to lose no good situation through bad manners madame ain't likely to die said jarvey she's as healthy as a stray dog and as sharp i don't care for old miss bull or for stopping here as i'm a going to get a place as waiter at a club ach leetle boy you will be no vaiter said fritz shut your mouth froggy snapped jarvey and produced a cigarette don't you smoke here you brat shrieked the cook and snatching it from his mouth flung it into the fire here's madame's tea take it to her sitting room she's sure to be up and waiting jarvey showed fight at first but as the cook had a strong arm he thought discretion the better part of valor and went grumbling up the stairs mrs jersey was an early riser and usually had a cup of tea in her sitting room at seven o'clock after this refresher she gave audience to the cook looked over her tradesmen's books and complained generally that the servants were not doing their duty madame was not at her best in the morning and jarvey went up most unwillingly the housemaid should have gone but when she could she sent jarvey and when he refused to go fritz was dispatched to bear the brunt of madame's anger she usually scolded fritz in french when the boy went the servants continued chatting and eating it was just on seven and they were reluctantly rising to begin their duties when a crash was heard and then a clatter of boots there cried the cook that brat's been and smashed the tray won't madame give it to him mercy mercy her voice leaped an octave he's mad this was because jarvey with his hair on end and his face perfectly white tore into the kitchen he raced round and round the table his eyes starting from his head the servants huddled together in fear and the cook seized the toasting fork they all agreed with her that the page was mad suddenly jarvey tumbled in a heap and began to moan with his face on the floor oh the blood the blood what's he saying about blood asked the scared cook jarvey leaped to his feet she's dead she's murdered he shrieked i see her all covered with blood oh mother oh i want my mother and down he dropped on the floor again kicking and screaming the boy was scared out of his life and fritz laid hold of him while the other servants headed by the valiant cook ran up the stairs and burst into madame's sitting room which was on the ground floor and no great distance from the front door the next moment they were out again all shrieking murder and calling loudly for the police the sleeping boarders took the alarm and in the lightest of attire appeared on the stairs with white faces the terrible word shrieked by a dozen voices through the silent house curdled the blood in their aged veins what with the early hour the fog the gas and the crying of the servants it was like a nightmare an hour later the police were in the house summoned by miss bull who alone of the boarders retained her head as margery who was next in command after her aunt could not be brought to do anything miss bull took charge it was miss bull who first ventured into the sitting room where madame huddled up in a chair drawn to the table lay face downward in such a position as to reveal a gaping wound in her neck and it was miss bull who sent the servants back to the kitchen who closed the door of the death chamber and who told jarvey to fetch the nearest policeman consequently it was miss bull whom the inspector addressed as she seemed to be the sole person in authority mrs taine retreated to her bedroom with a prayer book mr granger went for a walk in the fog margery sat in a stupor her eyes dull and her slack mouth awry the little old maid from being a nonentity became a person of first class importance she displayed perfect tact and self control in dealing with the terrified old men and women and no one would have given her credit for such generalship but the hour had come for miss bull to assert herself and she proved to be equal to the occasion now then said the inspector when he had posted his men and was alone with miss bull in the drawing room what do you know of this miss bull her face white and drawn her eyes sharper than ever and her manner perfectly composed shook her head i know absolutely nothing she said in her monotonous voice last night we had our usual reception but it broke up at ten o'clock madame dismissed the guests at that hour and stood in the doorway to do so i retired to my bedroom with madame's niece and after a game of 'patience' i went to bed does mrs jersey's niece sleep with you margery no she sleeps in a room above it was a few minutes to eleven when she left me i was in bed shortly after the clock struck the hour i am sure margery had nothing to do with it she was quite devoted to her aunt and as the poor girl has no money i don't know how she will live now that madame is dead the inspector thought for a moment he was a tall thin man rather military in appearance and with a wooden expressionless face which he found of great service in hiding his thoughts when examining those he suspected he certainly did not suspect miss bull and seemed inclined to make her his coadjutor in proof of this he made her accompany him to the room wherein mrs jersey lay dead it's not far from the front door mused inspector quex could any one have entered no i am sure of that put in miss bull emphatically madame always locked the front door every night herself and kept the key it could not be opened in the morning until she chose who opened it this morning i did i knew that the key would be in madame's pocket and it was yes she must have locked the door as usual and then have gone to put the light out in her sitting room before going upstairs was that before eleven i can't say i did not leave my room after ten but margery may have seen some one as she went up to her bedroom when she left me i'll question the girl said quex and entered the sitting room it was of no great size with one window which looked out onto the square this was locked and even if it had not been no one could have climbed in as quex saw that the area was below and madame chained the area gate every night with her own hands explained miss bull who was watching him the inspector turned suddenly toward her it seems to me that the deceased was over cautious was she afraid i think she was admitted miss bull she had a habit of looking over her shoulder and as i have stated was particular as to bolts and bars but she was a secretive woman and never said anything to me about her fears if she had any were you great friends no replied the old maid bluntly we were not madame behaved in an extremely rude manner and had she lived i should have given her notice i never liked her added miss bull with feminine spite you'll be all the more likely to speak the truth then said quex cynically and turned to examine the body madame was still in the black silk dress which she wore on the previous night seated at the round center table she had evidently been struck from behind and killed before she had time to cry out her arms were on the table and her head had fallen forward the furniture of the room was not in disorder the red table cloth was not even ruffled the murder had been committed without haste or noise as quex pointed out to miss bull whosoever murdered her must have been a friend said he it doesn't seem a friendly act to kill a defenseless woman said miss bull looking coldly on the limp figure you don't quite understand what i mean is that mrs jersey knew the person who killed her miss bull shook her head i don't agree with you she observed and quex was astonished that she should dare to contradict she was struck from behind before she had time to turn her head quite so but the assassin must have entered the room and unless the deceased was deaf madame had particularly sharp ears then that makes it all the more certain had any one unexpected entered she would have been on the alert there would have been a struggle now we see that the furniture is not disturbed therefore we can argue from this that mrs jersey was in friendly conversation with the assassin she was seated at the table and the assassin was at her back which shows a certain amount of trust in fact miss bull the person who committed this murder was the last person mrs jersey expected to hurt her in any way she had no enemies that i knew of i talk rather of friends said quex coolly you have not been listening to my argument oh i quite understand but i don't fancy that madame had any friends either she was a woman who kept very much to herself do you know anything of her past absolutely nothing she took this house some fourteen or fifteen years ago i believe i have been here ten and was very comfortable save that madame and i disagreed on many points she was always rude to me and i don't think she was a lady miss bull drew herself up my father was a general she declared proudly but quex was too busy examining the room to attend to miss bull's family history he searched for the weapon with which the crime had been committed but could find none there was no blood on the furniture although some had trickled down from the wound onto the table cloth the blow must have been struck strongly and surely and with the power of a deadly hatred it was at this moment that the doctor arrived and turning the body over to him quex conducted miss bull back to the drawing room where he examined all who were in the house has any one left this morning he asked jarvey had seen mr granger go out and said so even while he was speaking mr granger returned and filled with suspicion quex examined him first granger when he saw what the inspector was bent upon expressed the greatest indignation how dare you accuse a gentleman of such a thing he cried i went out to compose my nerves into the fog asked quex doubtfully yes sir and i should have gone out into snow and hail if i had desired there was no intimation that none were to leave the house had a notice been given to that effect i should have remained i beg your pardon said quex seeing that the old gentleman was fuming and seeing also that such a senile creature with so sheeplike a face was innocent enough but it is my duty to be suspicious but not to accuse innocent people of a crime sir no but for the sake of an example will you tell me what you did with yourself since leaving the drawing room last night at ten certainly i have no reason to conceal my doings officer said mr granger angrily i retired to my bedroom at ten and to bed the last i saw of madame she was standing on the door step bidding farewell to her guests in the morning i was awakened by the news of the murder and went out to walk off the horror produced by the sight of that poor woman did you see the body we all saw the body till miss bull i turned them out and locked the door put in miss bull sharply it was as well that nothing should be disturbed in the room till the police arrived that was my argument and a very good one said quex approvingly you have a head on your shoulders miss my father was a general replied the old maid nodding and i inherit his talent for organization the next witness examined was margery and she refused to open her mouth unless she sat by miss bull the old maid held margery's hand and coaxed her into answering when she proved recalcitrant quex could not but admire the way in which miss bull managed the lumpish creature you left the drawing room with this lady he asked indicating miss bull and speaking in a persuasive tone yes we played 'patience' in miss bull's bedroom i did it twice at what time did you leave about eleven just before it did the clock strike the hour when you were in your own bedroom no said margery trying to collect her wits when i was in the passage what were you doing in the passage it would only take you a few minutes to get to your room would it not yes put in miss bull my bedroom is on the second floor and margery's is on the fourth right above my head you could easily have got to your room before the clock struck margery i did try to admitted the girl but my aunt kept me talking quex sat up did you speak to your aunt at that hour yes she met me walking up to my room and scolded me for being out of bed at that hour i said i had been with miss bull and and madame made polite remarks about me said the old maid grimly oh i can well understand what she said but it would seem mr inspector that margery was the last person to see madame alive we'll see said quex who was not going to be taught his business even by so clever a person as miss bull was there any one else about he asked margery no my aunt said that every one was in bed but me and that she would not have it the clock struck eleven and she called me names she then took me by the arm and pushed me into my room and locked the door yes she did nodded margery vindictively she locked the door why did she do that asked quex staring i don't know i wasn't doing anything grumbled margery but she said she wouldn't have me wandering about the house at all hours of the night and locked me in i couldn't get out this morning till miss bull let me out margery usually brings me my cup of tea explained miss bull and as she did not come this morning as usual i was anxious when the alarm came i went to look for margery in her room the key was in the door but the door was locked i released margery oh the key was in the door mused quex it would seem then that the deceased simply turned the key and left it humph i wonder why she locked the girl in miss bull shrugged her thin shoulders it was spite on her part she said madame never cared to see margery with me because i love you so said the girl with an adoring look and miss bull patted her hand fondly it was strange thought the inspector that so clever and refined a woman should love so stupid and coarse looking a girl but like does not always draw to like while quex was thus examining the witnesses train and brendon were seated in the sitting room of the former discussing the crime brendon was gloomy for in the unexpected death of mrs jersey he saw the downfall of his hopes of proving his legitimacy there's no chance of my marrying dorothy now he said with a sigh i'll remain plain george brendon to the end of my days and a bachelor at that it's awful gasped leonard who was white and haggard i never expected that my search for types would lead me into the neighborhood of a tragedy who could have killed her i can't say i wonder if her death has anything to do with your affairs brendon looked up suddenly and with a stern flushed face train he said sharply whatever you do say nothing about what i told you last night yes but what you told me might lead to the discovery of the assassin i don't care if it does said brendon angrily and rising to his feet to emphasize his determination you are to keep my confidence oh i shan't say anything but do you think i think nothing but i am sure that my affairs have nothing to do with this death i came to see mrs jersey and this morning i should have had the truth out of her but she is dead and so all my projects go to the four winds but i don't want them spoken of you can depend upon me said leonard dominated by the strong will of his friend but who could have i tell you i don't know cried george restlessly how you do harp on that subject it is the subject of the hour retorted train and a most unpleasant one here i shall have to remain until that police officer questions me what story will you tell any story but the one i told to you retorted brendon well said leonard after a pause you can rely upon me i shall not say anything to get you into trouble brendon laughed but not pleasantly my good fellow i have done nothing wrong even if my tale were told i could not be accused of having to do anything with this murder oh i didn't mean that for one moment protested train uneasily i know you didn't nevertheless if this police inspector knew that i told you he might get it into his stupid head that well brendon broke off abruptly i don't know what he mightn't think however i shall answer his questions as to my visit here and then go away i'll go also said train with a shudder i can't stop here after what has occurred it's terrible to think of that poor woman murdered how lucky i locked my door last night brendon stopped in his walk and looked sharply at the young man why did you lock your door he asked surprised well you see after mrs jersey came into the sitting room i didn't like to think of her prowling about one is so helpless when one is asleep and train shuddered did you expect her to murder you asked brendon derisively i didn't expect anything retorted leonard rather nettled but i didn't want her to come into my rooms so i got out of bed and locked the sitting room door not your bedroom door no the sitting room door so both you and i were quite safe from her prying brendon looked steadily at train and gave a short laugh yes as you locked the sitting room door she could as little enter as you or i could go out leonard he paused and pinched his lip i do not think it will be wise for you to tell the inspector this why not you and i are innocent that goes without the saying answered george sharply but the less we have to do with this unpleasant matter the better i suppose we in common with every one else here will be called to give evidence at the inquest once that is done and mrs jersey is safely buried i wash my hands of the whole affair train shuddered so do i said he i am the last man in the world to wish to pursue the subject but who can be guilty it must be some one in the house i suppose so replied brendon unless mrs jersey had a visitor last night till have had said leonard when i locked the sitting room door and that was about half past eleven i think i heard the closing of the front door the deuce you did yes i put my head out and listened to see if all was quiet i distinctly heard the front door close she must have had a visitor said brendon thoughtfully yet as she alone could have let that visitor out and as she must have been alive to do so the visitor cannot be the assassin the visitor might have killed her and then have closed the door himself himself how do you know the visitor was a man it might have been a woman besides miss bull told me that the door was locked as usual and that she took the key this morning to open it from mrs jersey's pocket no train the person who killed mrs jersey is in the house but were i you i should say as little as possible to the inspector about this leonard took this advice and when questioned simply stated that he had retired to bed at eleven and had heard nothing brendon made a similar statement and quex saw no reason to doubt their evidence he questioned all the boarders and all the servants but could learn nothing likely to throw any light on the darkness which concealed the crime no one had heard a noise in the night no one had heard a scream and it was conclusively proved that every one in the house was in bed by eleven o'clock the majority indeed before that hour jarvey had been the last to retire at half past ten o'clock and then he had left madame in her sitting room with a book and a glass of negus she sent him off in a hurry and with as he expressed it a flea in his ear being somewhat out of temper it was thus apparent that margery who saw madame at the striking of the hour was the last person to see her alive mrs jersey went to her own sitting room and there had been struck down it was about twelve o'clock that she was stabbed said the doctor after he had made his examination but i can go only by the condition of the body i should say a little before or after twelve she was stabbed in the neck with a sharp instrument with a knife said the inspector no rejoined the doctor decisively it was with a dagger by a kind of stiletto it was not by an ordinary knife that the wound was inflicted and then the doctor who loved to hear himself talk went into technical details about the death he proved beyond doubt that mrs jersey must have died almost immediately with hardly a groan for some reason quex took one and all into the chamber of death and showed them the corpse perhaps he expected that the sight would shake the nerves of the murderer supposing the murderer was among those who saw the body but no one flinched in the way he expected mrs jersey was as dead as a door nail but no one knew and no one could prove who had struck the blow chapter iv a nine days' wonder on account of its mystery the murder of mrs jersey made a great sensation the season was dull and there was nothing of interest in the newspapers therefore the mysterious crime was a godsend to the reporters they flocked in shoals to amelia square and haunted the jersey mansion like unquiet ghosts whenever any boarder went out for a walk he or she would be questioned by eager gentlemen of the press idle sightseers of a morbid turn of mind came to look at the place where the crime had been committed and pictures of the house appeared in several papers from being a peaceful neighborhood amelia square became quite lively the boarders found all this most unpleasant this rude awakening from their sleepy life was too much for them and the majority made preparations to leave as soon as the inquest was over until then they were under police surveillance and could not leave the neighborhood a restriction which in itself was sufficiently unpleasant brendon found it particularly so as he was anxious to get back to his own rooms at kensington and to his work but even when he told inspector quex that he was merely a visitor and knew nothing about the matter that zealous officer objected to his going perhaps had brendon insisted he might have gained his point but he did not think it was worth while to make the fact of his stay in the jersey mansion too public and therefore held his peace he stopped with leonard as usual but the two men were not such friends as they had been why train had changed toward him brendon could not understand but ever since leonard had been submitted to the ordeal of seeing the corpse he had been an altered man from being gay he was now dull instead of talking volubly as he usually did he was silent for hours at a stretch and he appeared to shun brendon's company george knew that train was impressionable and sensitive and thought that the sight of the dead and the ordeal of the examination had been too much for his weak nerves this might have been the case but leonard never gave him the satisfaction of knowing if his diagnosis was correct after a time george ceased to ply him with questions and contented himself with the usual courtesies of life but in his heart he felt the change deeply fool as train was brendon liked him sufficiently to resent his altered demeanor at the inquest nothing was discovered likely to elucidate the mystery the boarders all gave the same evidence they had already given to quex certainly it came out that miss bull had prophesied that madame would die a violent death but when questioned on this point she merely said that she had done so because the death card had been turned up taken in conjunction with another card according to the reading employed by fortune tellers a violent death was assuredly prophesied but as miss bull said no one was more astonished than herself at the speedy fulfillment of the prediction i told the fortunes on that night for amusement only she said as i do not believe there is any sense in such things it was mere chance nothing more i am not a believer in cards as prophets but the coincidence was so extraordinary that several of the newspapers hinted that the old maid knew more than she chose to tell miss bull was up in arms at once and after consulting her solicitor threatened actions for libel until such statements were withdrawn and certainly on the face of it the accusation was absurd the majority of people who did believe in fortune telling by the cards insisted that miss bull was quite an adept several urged her to set up in business promising her their patronage but the little old maid drew herself up and mentioning that her father had been a general refused to entertain the idea beyond this episode there was little interest to be found in the details of the inquest it appeared that every one was in bed by eleven that every one had slept soundly more or less and that all were astonished and shocked when the tragedy came to light next morning train could have created a sensation by stating that he had heard the front door open after eleven but true to his promise to george he said nothing about this miss bull on the other hand declared that the front door was locked as usual and that she had taken the key from the dead woman's pocket to open it when the police entered it would appear that mrs jersey had been murdered by some one in the house yet not one scrap of evidence could be found to show that any one in the house could possibly be guilty the boarders were all old the servants all ordinary human beings and no motive could be assigned to any one person for the committal of so cruel a crime moreover the fact that the instrument used was a stiletto and the doctor held to that showed that the crime must have been committed by a foreigner the only foreign person in the house on the night in question was fritz the swiss waiter but he would not have killed a fly and moreover exculpated himself entirely with the aid of jarvey in whose room he slept the jury brought in a verdict of murder against some person or persons unknown and that was all that could be done toward the elucidation of the amelia square crime there's only one thing that wasn't spoken of said quex when he saw the boarders in the drawing room for the last time it seems that mrs jersey always put out the light above the door at eleven or when the guests departed on this occasion it burned all night and as it shines behind crimson glass such a red window might be a guide to any one who did not know the house but who had been given that sign whereby to distinguish it i can explain that said granger who was present when madame was bidding farewell to her guests she thought that some of them might be lost in the fog therefore she called out after them that she would let the light burn later so that any might be able to retrace their steps well said quex scratching his head that explanation is clear and there is no use for it put in miss bull since the front door was locked and no one entered the house on that night that's just it said the inspector sagaciously as all you ladies and gentlemen are clearly innocent the crime must have been committed by some one from outside now is there any one to whom madame gave a latch key none of us had latch keys said harmer madame would not allow such a thing oh i don't mean you or those like you mr harmer at your age a latch key is not necessary but mrs jersey may have given one to a friend of hers who came to see her on that night had she any friend in whom she would place such confidence no said miss bull decisively she trusted no one that far and i don't think she had a single friend outside this house and very few in it muttered mrs taine who on various occasions had suffered from madame's tongue in that case said quex rising to take his leave there is nothing more to be discussed who killed mrs jersey or why she was killed will probably never be known ladies and gentlemen good day and the inspector bowed himself stiffly out of the room with the air of a man who washed his hands of the whole concern and after all what could he do there was no proof likely to indicate any one as the assassin and since leonard kept silent on the point of the front door having been opened after eleven it was impossible to say that the criminal had entered the house had mr inspector known of this he might have made further inquiries but he knew nothing and departed extremely perplexed the amelia square crime was one of those mysterious murders which would have to be relegated to obscurity for sheer want of evidence when are you going back to duke street asked brendon as he took his leave of train this very day replied the young man gloomily i don't want to stop a moment longer than i can help in this awful house i expect many of the others are of your way of thinking train but so far as i can see there is no hope of learning who killed the woman if you had only allowed me to tell quex about the door being opened he might have traced the assassin i don't think so brendon shook his head it was a foggy night and whosoever entered would be able to slink away without being seen i am not so sure of that there is only one outlet to the square and there stands a policeman on guard the policeman would not be there all the time argued brendon to say nothing of the fog which would hide any one desirous of evading recognition as the assassin assuredly must have wished all the same i wish i had told quex well then tell him if you like said george vexed with this pertinacity but you asked me not to only because i fear with your weak nature that one question will lead to another until the whole of my private affairs will come to light i don't want those to be known at scotland yard let alone the chance that i might be accused of the crime oh that's ridiculous you could not have left the sitting room unless i had let you out and there is no door from your bedroom that is true enough answered brendon with an ironical smile the significance of which was lost on train but if the whole of my story came to light you might be accused of helping me to get rid of the woman i leonard's hair almost rose on end how could i be mixed up in it well see here argued brendon who thought it just as well to make train's own safety depend upon the discretion of too free a tongue i tell you about this house and on my recommendation you come here i come to stop with you and reveal my reasons for coming these have to do with the possession of a secret by the murdered woman all that to a policeman would be suspicious what would be easier than for me to go down the stairs and when the woman refused to confess as to my legitimacy to stab her then i could return to my bed and you could prove an alibi on my behalf by your tale of having locked the sitting room door train shuddered i see how easily we can get into trouble i shall say nothing i wish i had not come here i shall go abroad until all blows over why said brendon in scorn what is there to blow over no more will be heard of this matter if you hold your tongue the inquest is at an end the woman will be buried shortly and you will be back leading your own life so far as i am concerned you know that i am not guilty and that i could not have left my room since you locked that special door then as to hearing the front door open that may have been a hallucination on your part no i am sure it wasn't i heard distinctly well brendon shrugged his shoulders but seemed uncomfortable i dare say the assassin came and went in that way but if he or she did the door was found fast locked in the morning unless miss bull is telling a lie she might be i don't see what she has to gain but there's no use talking any further the matter is ended so far as i am concerned what will you do now i am going to see dorothy said brendon and tell her that there is no chance of our marriage nor is there for i cannot see my way to prove my legitimacy we must part and i shall probably go down the country for six months or so to finish my novel and to get rid of my heartache train remained silent looking at the ground then he glanced at his friend in a doubtful way what has become of your yellow holly brendon produced it from his pocket it withered so i took it out of my coat and put it into this envelope do you know if miss ward gave any one else a piece of yellow holly brendon stared at this strange question not to my knowledge why do you ask train shuffled his feet and looked down again it is an exceptionally rare sort of thing he said uneasily and its effect on mrs jersey was so strange that i wondered if she connected it with any trouble or disaster you made the same remark before said brendon dryly and we could arrive at no conclusion but in any case i don't see that miss ward giving me the holly has anything to do with mrs jersey's alarm if indeed she was alarmed i think she was said train decisively and if i were you i would ask miss ward why she gave you the yellow holly what would be the sense in that you might learn why mrs jersey was startled brendon laughed and shrugged his shoulders your active brain is building up a perfect romance he declared there can be no connection between dorothy and mrs jersey did she know you were coming to stop here on that night yes i told her so when i met her in the park in the morning it was then that she asked me to afternoon tea and at the afternoon tea she gave you the holly yes you seem to think she did it on purpose that mrs jersey train interrupted him quickly it is you who are building up a romance now he said i never thought anything of the sort but i do say that the coincidence is strange what coincidence that you should have in your coat a flower i suppose one can call berried holly a flower which awakens unpleasant recollections in mrs jersey's breast in a word train you fancy that an inquiry into the circumstances of the yellow holly may lead to a detection of the assassin i don't go so far as that but i should not be surprised if something of that sort did eventuate then you do go so far as that said brendon with a shrug however there is nothing more to be said my advice to you is to hold your tongue lest we should both get into trouble i am absolutely innocent so am i if it comes to that all the same the less said the better train shook hands with more cordiality than he had hitherto displayed i'll be silent for my own sake as well as for yours he said and the two parted leonard to pack up and brendon to journey with his bag for kensington both men were conscious of a relief when they took leave of each other i wish he hadn't come here said train when brendon departed i wish i had held my tongue muttered george when he was in his cab that fool seems to think i know something about this matter of course the economy of the mansion was disordered when the crime was committed but thanks to the firm handling of miss bull who now took the reins which had fallen from the hands of madame a few days put a different complexion on affairs margery knew where her aunt kept the money and miss bull made several of the boarders behindhand pay up thus there was enough money to go on with and miss bull decided to wait until after the funeral before deciding what she intended to do herself when mrs jersey was buried her lawyer made his appearance with the will it was read to margery and miss bull stopped beside the poor girl as the only friend she had in the world the will was short and concise as it seemed that there was very little to leave the lawyer read it and then looked at margery to hear what she had to say the girl simply stared at him blankly as though not comprehending his meaning and miss bull touched her elbow do you hear what he says she asked rebukingly yes replied margery but i don't understand haven't i any money the lawyer would have read the will again but miss bull held up her hand she is stunned with grief said miss bull and is not capable of attending to business go and lie down margery and i will speak to this gentleman you do exactly what you like dear miss bull said margery rising and then turned to the lawyer let miss bull do exactly as she likes i leave all in her hands the most sensible thing you can do said the legal adviser under his breath and when margery had left the room he turned to the old maid is she an idiot by no means but she is not very clever i have taken a great interest in her as to tell you the truth mr james she was badly treated by her aunt if you will explain the will to me i will see what can be done to put things straight i am sorry for the girl and she is devoted to me it is lucky she has such a friend said mr james heartily he did not care much for miss bull whose very presence seemed to inspire mistrust but she was acting very well on this occasion moreover as margery was not likely to prove a lucrative client mr james was anxious to shuffle the business onto miss bull's shoulders and get out of it as fast as he could what is it you wish to know he asked about this will said miss bull laying one thin finger on the document madame leaves to margery watson her niece the money in the green box in her sitting room and also the jewels which i presume mean the diamonds yes also if you will recollect the clothes of the deceased lady is there nothing else asked miss bull raising her black eyes inquiringly what of the lease of this house that is the property of lord derrington and he only let the house to mrs jersey by the year is not that rather strange very strange but the whole connection of lord derrington with my late client is strange i know that she received from him an annuity of five hundred a year and the lease of this house by the year remember from december to december now she is dead the annuity lapses and the lease naturally will not be renewed after next month it is now the end of november said miss bull quite composed i understand you to say that the lease expires when december it ends on the st of december explained james and as mrs jersey is dead it will not be renewed lord derrington so far as i know has no interest in miss margery watson what interest had he in mrs jersey asked miss bull scenting a scandal and her eyes brightening i can't tell you that and if i could i would not quite right i beg your pardon for asking but you see in the interests of that poor girl i wish to know exactly how matters stand they stand as i tell you said james and rose to go i have nothing more to do in the matter and my connection with the late mrs jersey ceases here one moment said miss bull quietly what of the furniture that is also the property of lord derrington he bought the house as it stood from the executor of the last owner mr anthony lockwood fifteen years ago mrs jersey wished to set up a boarding house so lord derrington placed her in here every stick in the place belongs to him should miss watson leave she goes with the jewels the money in the green box and with her deceased aunt's clothes a very poor outfit to start life on at her age said miss bull rising in her prim manner by the way mr james what is the name of the late mr lockwood's executor roger ireland replied the lawyer looking rather surprised why do you ask for my own satisfaction mr james if no one else will assist this poor girl i shall do so good day james departed with a better opinion of miss bull although at any time he had no reason to have a bad one but her manner inspired mistrust and kindly as she appeared to be acting towards margery he could not help thinking that there was more in her action than mere philanthropy you're a deep one thought james i shouldn't wonder if we heard more of you but so far as james was personally concerned he heard no more of the little woman miss bull collected the boarders in the drawing room after dinner and made a speech she said that it was margery watson's intention to keep on the house and that the terms would be as before if any chose to stop they would be welcome but those who decided to go could have their bills made out at once having thus acted as the mouthpiece of margery miss bull took the girl away to the sitting room of the late mrs jersey the very one in which the tragedy had taken place margery was unwilling to enter much less hold a conversation there but miss bull who had no nerves to speak of and a very strong will laughed her out of this folly now my dear margery she said when the girl was seated i want you to pay the greatest attention to what i am about to say and to repeat nothing of my conversation you are my best friend said margery looking at the peaked white face with adoring eyes i shall do whatever you say good child said miss bull patting the hand that was laid confidingly on her lap listen child lord derrington is the owner of this house and he leased it to your aunt by the year a very strange arrangement for which there ought to be some explanation i am going to seek it from lord derrington but he won't tell you anything miss bull the old maid tightened her thin lips i think he will she said in a rather ominous manner at all events there is no harm in my trying with regard to the annuity what annuity i forgot you don't know about that well there is no need that you should but it seems that lord derrington allowed your late aunt an annuity of five hundred a year i don't know the reason why he did so and as such reason is not pertinent to matters in hand i do not wish to know but the annuity must lapse it is not likely that lord derrington will continue it to you she paused and looked at the girl your parents are dead i believe margery yes for many years i have been with my aunt she was my only relative dear miss bull all the better i don't want other people interfering said miss bull in her icy way well margery i shall see if i can get lord derrington to renew the lease to you and i shall be your security with the money in hand i have counted it and with that in the bank it amounts to two hundred pounds we can continue the boarding house a few of the boarders will go but many will remain as they will not get anywhere so cheap a place you will be the nominal head of the house but in reality i shall manage do you agree i am your slave cried margery with melodramatic intensity you are my friend said miss bull her thin lips relaxing i am a lonely woman margery though i still have a surviving sister her lips tightened again as she said this and i love you my dear for your goodness well we shall keep on the boarding house and you poor child will be preserved from the terrible life which would otherwise be your portion how good you are how good you are a little selfish also said miss bull kissing the girl i do not wish to leave this place or lose you i am growing old and a change would break my heart she said this as though she really believed that she possessed such an organ mrs jersey always said that a heart was lacking in miss bull's maiden breast but certainly the way in which the old woman was treating the helpless girl showed that she was better than she looked and perhaps as mr james considered miss bull had an ax to grind on her own account however this might be from that moment miss bull was in charge of the amelia square establishment whatever means she used to induce lord derrington to consent she certainly managed to get the lease renewed in margery's name some of the boarders went but others came in their place and these being younger added to the gayety of the house so all was settled and miss bull became a person of importance she was the power behind the throne and ruled judiciously in this way did she do away with the reputation of the house as a place where a crime had been committed in a year all was forgotten chapter v a lovers' meeting every one who was any one knew the honorable mrs ward she was a fluffy haired kitten of a woman more like a dresden china shepherdess than a mere human being nothing could be prettier than her face and figure and nothing more engaging than her manners with her yellow hair her charming face and her melting blue eyes she managed to hold her own against younger women the late mr ward lord ransome's son had been a fast young man devoted to the turf and to his pretty wife but he was killed when riding in a steeplechase two years after his marriage and left his widow alone in the world with one daughter for consolation in her affliction mrs ward being in want of money for her deceased father had been a general with nothing but his pay played her cards so well with regard to her father in law that he allowed her a good income and thought she was the most perfect of women but lord ransome was the only one of the family who thought so for the other relatives fought rather shy of the pretty pleading widow not that mrs ward minded she characterized the women as frumps and the men as fools and having enough to live on comfortably set up a house in curzon street it was thought that she would marry again and probably she would have done so had a sufficiently rich husband with a title been forthcoming but somehow no one worth capturing ever came mrs ward's way and as time went on she chose to assume the role of a devoted mother and as she phrased it to live again in her daughter this was quite wrong as dorothy ward was a slim serious minded girl of nineteen not given to gayety and was one who was anxious to marry a husband with mind rather than with money how frivolous little mrs ward came to have such a puritan daughter no one ever could make out she resembled her mother neither in face nor in manner nor in tastes mrs ward openly lamented that dorothy was such a difficult girl to manage which meant that dorothy had refused several good matches and had declined to be guided entirely by her mother's opinion when the earl of summerslea proposed and was not accepted mrs ward was furious but dorothy said steadily that she would never marry a brute with a title you'll marry any one i choose said mrs ward when the two were discussing the matter certainly not lord summerslea rejoined dorothy steadily and certainly not that penniless george brendon retorted her mother you shall not throw yourself away on him he is a good man and a clever man and a man whom any woman might be proud of winning mother and a man with no money and no position who is he what is his family no one ever heard of him they will one day when he becomes famous oh as a writing person as though any one cared two pins about that sort of thing i want to see you a countess you shall never see me the countess of summerslea i know all about that man he is bad and dissipated o lord as if that mattered cried mrs ward with supreme contempt your father was the same yet we got on all right i am sure you did said dorothy with bitter meaning upon which mrs ward showed her claws her friends called her a kitten but she was a cat in reality and could scratch on occasions but all her scratching could not make dorothy lady summerslea hating brendon and knowing that her daughter liked him it was supposed by mrs ward's friends that the young man would be sent to the right about and that dorothy would be kept out of his way but mrs ward knew her daughter too well to take such a disastrous course my dear she said to an intimate friend if i did that dorothy is just the kind of annoying girl to run away with him and live in a garret if i let them meet they will not think of marriage and i dare say dorothy will get tired of brendon he is so shabby in his dress and so poor that after a time she will cease to like him no no i'll let him follow her wherever he likes and meet her on all occasions they will grow sick of one another in an ordinary case this recipe might have answered but dorothy respected as well as loved george brendon and every time she met him grew to admire and love him more mrs ward became quite exasperated and redoubled her efforts to sicken dorothy of the creature as she called brendon she took to praising him on all occasions and sometimes asked him to dinner at the same time she constantly abused young walter vane who was lord derrington's grandson and heir he was the man she wished dorothy to marry as one day he would have a title and fifteen thousand a year but in spite of this machiavellian policy dorothy still continued to love george and expressed a hearty dislike for walter vane whom she characterized as a weakling if he had only the grit of his grandfather i might respect him mrs ward turned pale under her rouge when she heard this oh no no lord derrington is a terrible old man were walter such as he is i should not ask you to marry him you would marry me to the prince of darkness himself if it suited your purpose said her daughter calmly from which speech it will be seen that miss ward had small respect for her fascinating mother the two did not assimilate as their dispositions were so different mrs ward complained that dorothy was too religious and dorothy found the frivolous world in which her mother moved dull beyond words it so happened that dorothy stayed mostly at home or went out with one of her aunts who was something of her type while mrs ward enjoyed herself at hurlingham and monte carlo the little woman always managed to keep on the right side as she had no notion of losing her position in society or the income which lord ransome allowed her but within limits she was extremely fast she generally had a number of young men at her heels and made use of them in betting and in getting boxes for the theaters for suppers at the cecil and gloves when nothing else was to be had but she managed all these things so discreetly that no one had a word to say and the general impression was that she was a dear little woman with a stiff daughter quite a trial and if some old frumps did praise up dorothy and condemn the mother they were in the minority things were in this position when the murder of mrs jersey took place dorothy read about it in the papers and knowing that george had gone to stop in the house with train was extremely anxious to hear particulars she wrote to his kensington address asking him to call but received no reply then she saw that he gave evidence at the inquest and two days later george made his appearance at the curzon street house mrs ward who had been voluble in her expressions regarding brendon's love for low company so she put it sailed toward him with open hands she always welcomed brendon in this bright girlish kittenish way as it was part of her scheme she thought so serious a man would never relish a frivolous mother in law and hoped to get rid of him in this way but brendon was too much in love with dorothy to mind the vagaries of her fashionable parent my dear mr brendon cried mrs ward in her usual gushing manner i am so glad to see you the murder you know i saw your name in the papers how exciting how romantic tell us all about it there is nothing to tell mrs ward said george glancing round the room and seeing that dorothy was absent all i know is set forth in the papers mrs ward arranged herself on the sofa and laughed joyously quite exciting it is she said i wonder who killed the poor woman and how did you come to be there on the very night she died this last question was asked sharply and with a keen glance george was rather taken aback but not thinking she had any intention in what she said answered soberly enough i went to see a friend mrs ward it was unfortunate that i chose that night well of course you didn't know said mrs ward artlessly but fancy knowing any one living in an out of the way place like that but you do know such queer people george thought he knew none queerer than mrs ward herself but he suppressed this speech as impolite my friend is mr leonard train really i think i have met him his father made a fortune out of mustard or coke or something horrid what was he doing there looking for characters for a book oh mrs ward opened her eyes did he find any i believe so but he has left the house now i should think every one would leave it after the murder said mrs ward dorothy will be down soon but meantime tell me the whole thing from your own clever point of view she was so pertinacious that brendon had reluctantly to yield he detailed events as they had been reported by the press but concerning the confidence of leonard he kept silent mrs ward expressed her disappointment when he finished you tell me nothing new i warned you that i would not replied brendon wondering at her petulant speech but surely you can throw some light on the matter said mrs ward brendon shook his head i fear not i went to bed at eleven and slept soundly until i was awakened by the clamor mrs ward thought for a moment does mr train know anything nothing more than i have told you declared brendon uncomfortably he disliked deviating from the truth even in the smallest particular but he dare not risk the story of his birth becoming public property it was strange he thought that mrs ward should take such a profound interest in this case he had never before heard her talk on such a subject to add to his perplexity he saw that in spite of her rouge in spite of the shaded windows she looked haggard yet it was impossible that she could be connected with the matter in any way he ventured a leading question why are you so anxious to know about this case mrs ward's reply rather astonished him i am not blind she said quietly and i know well enough that you admire my daughter you are poor you are unknown and should dorothy marry you she would make a very bad match i am aware of that began george but wait cried mrs ward raising her hand i have not yet done notwithstanding all these disadvantages i made up my mind to place no bar to your union with my daughter as she seems to like you she loves me mrs ward nonsense dorothy is too young to know the meaning of the word i say she likes you so we can let it stand at that but in spite of your poverty and obscurity brendon winced for mrs ward's tone was insolent in the extreme i am not willing that you should marry dorothy unless she hesitated unless queried george looking steadily at her now we come to the point unless your character is above suspicion what do you mean you know well enough here you go to a low house and while you are there the mistress of it is murdered george rose with some indignation good heavens mrs ward you don't suspect me he cried oh dear no but it would be unpleasant for my daughter to have a husband mixed up with such a shady affair i am not mixed up with it mrs ward it's unpleasant said mrs ward willfully holding to her opinion i don't like it find out who killed that woman and i say nothing but until you do find out and until the assassin is brought to justice i must ask you to discontinue your visits to dorothy brendon saw that she was simply making an excuse to rid herself of his presence so as to leave the way clear for walter vane but he was too strong a man to be foiled in this way and speedily made up his mind how to act shall we leave the matter to miss ward that means you wish to see her said the mother cleverly oh well there is no reason why you should not but it will be for the last time remember your character must bear inspection i think it does cried george rather nettled mrs ward who by this time was nearly at the door turned lightly and replied in her most kittenish way ah my dear mr brendon i know more than you think lola velez lola velez george looked and felt uneasy you change color oh i have heard all about you and that dancer i assure you that my connection with that lady is perfectly innocent mrs ward scoffed lady she said sneering what next however i do not wish to hear the particulars such creatures are nothing to me and if you clear yourself of this very shady business in amelia square by discovering the true assassin i shall overlook lola velez there is no need to overlook her or me i think there is said mrs ward frigidly and with a wave of her slim hand there is no more to be said mr brendon you know my decision and as dorothy's mother i have some power i hope now i will send her to you and you can say what you like in fact you can communicate to her the state of my feelings but added mrs ward shooting a parthian arrow i should not mention lola velez if i were you good by i shall not see you for many a long day i expect and hope said brendon much mortified and hope replied mrs ward coolly you are the last man in the world i should like for my son in law marry that dancer and with a shrill unpleasant laugh mrs ward vanished brendon paced the room waiting for dorothy how mrs ward had learned of his connection with lola velez he could not understand brendon was perfectly innocent and what he had done for the dancer was dictated by pure kindness but even if he explained the whole circumstances of his meeting and of his philanthropy to dorothy she was a woman when all was said and done and might not believe him on the whole he decided to take mrs ward's advice and hold his tongue on the subject of the dancer on some future occasion he might be able to explain and at the present moment he had the satisfaction of knowing that his conscience was clear he had just arrived at this decision when dorothy entered the room the next moment she was in his arms and the two entered paradise at once my dearest i am so glad to see you said dorothy in her soft voice as they sat down i wrote but you did not come i was engaged darling dorothy nodded i know at the inquest which was held on that poor creature why do you take an interest in the case dorothy oh because you went to stop at the house and it was so strange that she should have died on that very night so your mother says said george uncomfortably i really think she believes that i have something to do with the matter oh that's nonsense said dorothy serenely but mother does not like you very much george and she hates me you mean well responded miss ward candidly if you ask me to tell the truth i think she does but you know what my mother is i no if i cannot say good of her let me at least say nothing bad but i love you george you know that my own heart and brendon took her in his strong arms thanking god for the gift of so steadfast a heart for a few minutes silence reigned and the lovers looked at one another with fond affection dorothy was tall and slim and dark with a spanish face of that delicate high bred cast which is seen to perfection among the women of andalusia judging by her large black eyes and the serious expression of her lips dorothy ward might have had moorish blood in her veins perhaps she had as one of her father's ancestors when ambassador to madrid in the reign of the first james had brought back with him a spanish wife and dorothy inherited all the iberian beauty of that lady she should have been called inez or paquita for the purely english name of dorothy suited her badly that is a milkmaid's name and miss ward was more of the court than of the pasture her dark beauty contrasted well with the fair comeliness of george brendon and seated side by side on the sofa they looked an extremely handsome couple certainly they might have appeared happier for dorothy was downcast and in brendon's blue eyes there lurked a worried look he was wondering how he could communicate mrs ward's decision to the girl dorothy looked at him and smiled a penny for your thoughts george she said taking his hand i'll sell them as bankrupt stock said brendon drawing her closer and then he took his courage in both hands for the necessary confession this may be my last visit dorothy he said she looked at him in surprise why do you say that your mother oh never mind my mother broke in the girl petulantly i know she objects to our marriage so on the contrary she told me that she would not object if i could clear myself of complicity in this crime george did she accuse you of not in so many words interrupted the lover but i saw very plainly what she meant the fact that i slept in that house on the night mrs jersey was murdered is to her mind a proof that i have something to do with the matter but you can prove conclusively that you have not insisted dorothy certainly mr train with whom i was stopping can prove that i did not leave my room the key of the sitting room door was in his possession and to get out i should have had to make use of him george paused and thought for a moment but there is one thing what is it asked dorothy seeing that he hesitated i don't know if i ought to tell you whatever concerns you concerns me she said pressing his hand to her heart you know that i love you as dearly as you love me and nothing you tell me shall ever part us oh i don't think what i am about to say will have that effect was brendon's reply but i have a confession to make about my my birth dorothy looked at him in amazement about your birth she repeated yes you may as well know all and i know you will not betray me even to your mother to her least of all said dorothy vehemently tell me quick encouraged by her faith and by the tender clasp of her hand george related to her the story of his birth and of his connection with lord derrington also he detailed how he had gone to seek mrs jersey and how she had been murdered before he could get the truth out of her or even see her finished george and now you know dearest why i do not wish you to repeat this story if your mother knew it she might think think well she certainly would not let you marry me she has made her mind up already so far as that is concerned said dorothy quickly it is mr vane whom she wishes me to marry my cousin although he does not know it said george quietly but i want your advice dorothy and will be guided by it what shall i do you see now that mrs jersey is dead there is no chance of getting at the truth why not advertise i have tried that for some months in every country paper in the kingdom but there has been no response my father and mother must have been married in some out of the way village in some lonely church the parson and those who know about the marriage may be dead in fact it is extremely probable that they are mrs jersey was present as my mother's maid and she might have been able to tell me where the church is i only want to find the register of the marriage and get the certificate then i shall see lord derrington and insist on my rights being recognized he can't leave either the title or the money away from me have you seen him at all yet not to speak to but he was pointed out to me i hear he is an old tyrant dorothy shuddered a most terrible old man he always reminds me of one of those italian despots there is nothing he would not do provided that the law could not touch him and i dare say from your description the things he desires to do are of the kind that the law would make him answerable for george said dorothy after a pause do you think he has anything to do with this murder brendon turned slightly pale and set his lips firmly no dearest was his reply but delivered with some uncertainty he does not know at all events from me that i am seeking for a restitution of my rights and therefore would have no reason to rid himself of this woman besides i don't know if he is aware of her existence it will be seen that brendon was ignorant that lord derrington was the owner of the jersey mansion and had allowed madame an annuity had he known this much he might have been able to shape his course better but being in the dark he had to do the best he could with dorothy's assistance he had asked for her advice and she gave it george i should get back my birthright if i were you but i may be dragged into this murder case no mr train can save you from being accused of that it is only right that you should take your proper position in society you know i would marry you as you are and defy my mother and the world but you owe it to your dead mother and to yourself to show that you have the right to your father's name in that case i shall do what you advise cried george taking heart from her firm tone and the first thing i shall do will be to see mr ireland who is he george my guardian he took charge of me after my grandfather lockwood died and it was by his advice that i changed my name to baffle the inquiries of lord derrington he will know all about the marriage and may be able to indicate where my parents went when they eloped i have never asked him for a detailed statement but i shall do so now once i find a clew i shall not rest until i prove my legitimacy for your sake my dear for your sake and he kissed her and for your own said dorothy as they rose i shall say nothing to my mother or to any one george but tell me all that you do i shall make a regular report replied brendon but we will probably have to meet elsewhere as your mother has asked me to discontinue my visits here i shall speak to her said dorothy angrily no do not do that she will only grow angry and make things harder for you my own heart good by and god bless you they kissed and parted at the door brendon was just stepping out into the hall when a thought occurred to him he re entered and closed the door dorothy he asked in a low whisper why did you give me the yellow holly on that night she looked surprised it was to please you she said softly and to tell you the truth george i thought that the holly was a proof that my mother was relenting toward you how do you mean dorothy it was my mother who gave me the holly she explained i came from the park and told her you were going to stop with mr train and that she could set her mind at rest as i should not see you for a few days she seemed pleased and taking the yellow holly from a vase in her boudoir she gave me a sprig saying that i could give it to you for consolation did you tell her that you had fastened it in my coat yes but she only laughed and said it would please you why do you ask me this george there is no reason for my asking he replied suppressing the truth but yellow holly is rare very rare i don't know where my mother got the sprig after this they parted and brendon walked thoughtfully away mrs jersey had been startled by the sight of the holly mrs ward had given the sprig to dorothy who had presented it to him he asked himself if there was a reason for mrs ward's action chapter vi what mr ireland knew after his disagreeable experience in the bloomsbury district brendon was not very anxious to go there again but it was necessary that he should do so if he wanted to see his guardian from force of habit he still continued to call him so although mr ireland had long since ceased to act in that capacity george had a sincere respect for him and frequently paid him a visit usually it was one of ceremony or of enjoyment but on this occasion the young man went in search of knowledge ireland was an eccentric character who collected of all things bill posters most collectors turn their attention to stamps to snuff boxes to autographs and such like trifles but mr ireland hunted for those gigantic and gaudy pictures which make gay the thoroughfares of the city when george entered the dull old house in an equally dull bloomsbury street he found the hall decorated with an immense advertisement of bovril proceeding upstairs he was met on the landing by the famous cats who serve to draw attention to nestle's milk and finally entered a large room on the first floor where mr ireland sat at his desk surrounded by a perfect art gallery here was fry's chocolate there the magic carpet of cook and the wall opposite to the three windows looking out onto the street was plastered with theatrical advertisements more or less crude in color and out of drawing these were not modern but had been acquired by ireland in the dark ages when street art was in its infancy the effect of the whole was bizarre and striking but george was too used to the spectacle to pay much attention to the gallery the room was very bare so as to give space for the collection mr ireland sat at a mahogany desk in the center which was placed on a square of carpet beside this desk stood a chair and in one corner of the room was a safe painted green other furniture there was none and what with the huge pictures the bare floor and the want of curtains to the windows the effect was comfortless and dreary but mr ireland did not seem to mind in the least he was a tall old man with rather long white hair and a clean shaven benign face his unusual height did away with the impression of his excessive stoutness for he appeared to be as fat as daniel lambert george often wondered at his size considering that the man ate comparatively little mr ireland was dressed in glossy broadcloth scrupulously brushed and wore an old fashioned gladstone collar he had mild blue eyes rather watery and a large mouth with full red lips this hint of sensuality was contradicted by the serenity and pallor of his face and by his life which was as correct as his dress and as methodical as his hours never was there so methodical a man he lived by the clock and with him one day exactly resembled another he rose at a certain hour and retired precisely when the hand on the clock indicated another his meals were always regular and he had stated hours for walking when he went out whether it was wet or fine sunny or foggy the man was like a machine and george when living with him in his early days had often found these restrictions irksome it was one o'clock when brendon called and mr ireland had just finished his luncheon at two precisely he would leave the house for his one hour's constitutional brendon was aware of this and had timed his visit accordingly nevertheless ireland looked at his watch and mentioned the fact i can only give you an hour george he said you know my habits an hour will be sufficient replied brendon taking the one chair you are not looking very well sir he added noting the fagged air of the old man i have not been sleeping so soundly as usual rejoined ireland producing a box of cigars and passing them at my age and i am now seventy five i can't be expected to enjoy my bed so much as a young person take a cigar the old brand said brendon selecting one i never vary replied his guardian gravely pass that matchbox george have you a light good now we can talk for the next fifty five minutes what is it as time was short and mr ireland would be sure to terminate the interview exactly at the stated hour george plunged immediately into the business which had brought him hither i wish to hear the story of my parents he said deliberately the cigar fell from the fat fingers of ireland and he stared in amazement at the young man it is rather late in the day for that is it not he asked picking up the cigar and recovering himself better late than never quoted george puffing a cloud of smoke a proverb is no answer said ireland testily then if you wish to know sir i am in love that is no answer either it will lead to a very explicit answer rejoined the young man coolly love leads to marriage and in my case marriage cannot take place unless i know that i am legitimate of course you are i have always maintained that you are what proof have you asked george eagerly ireland hesitated and wiped his mouth in quite an unnecessary manner with a red silk handkerchief your father always declared that miss lockwood was his lawful wife and treated her with every respect did my father ever tell you where the marriage was celebrated no i never asked nor did your grandfather lockwood it was not till after your mother's death that lord derrington denied the marriage then mr vane was in italy and never troubled about the matter he should have done so for my sake said george indignantly certainly and i urged him to do so said mr ireland heavily i was in italy at the time and you were only an infant in arms who was my nurse then jane fraser the scotch nurse who afterward brought you to your grandfather lockwood when mr vane was murdered do you remember the other nurse the first one i had mr ireland grew indignant and puffed angrily at his cigar i do indeed he said wrathfully a vulgar forward hussy she was not bad looking either and set up for being a lady here he began to laugh would you believe it george my boy she was in love with your father and showed it so plainly that he was obliged to get rid of her what was her name eliza stokes and she was handsome in a bouncing way what became of her i can't tell you said ireland with sudden reserve did you see her after she was dismissed ireland turned his cigar slowly and did not look at george when he replied yes i did when and where it does not matter but it does matter to me cried brendon anxiously it is to know about her that i came here to see you to day i thought you came about your birth said ireland sharply that among other things the old man looked down again and appeared to be in deep thought he was turning over in his own mind how much or how little he should tell george and the young man looked at him anxiously much depended upon the speech of mr ireland at last the silence was broken and by a most unexpected remark i loved your mother said ireland i never knew that said brendon softly for he saw that the man was moved at the recollection of some early romance i never spoke of it before was the reply and ireland laid down his cigar to speak the more freely yes i loved rosina lockwood with all my heart and soul i was not bad looking in those days george and i had a good income but she preferred that scamp and he struck his hand heavily on the table with glowing eyes you are talking of my father sir said brendon stiffly i ask your pardon but if you wish me to tell the story of that most unfortunate affair you cannot hope that i shall keep my temper i was very badly treated by well with a glance at george ireland nodded let the dead rest in peace i think it will be as well said brendon coldly ireland again struck the table his pallid skin became a deep crimson and his eyes flashed george rose in alarm for the old man struggled to speak with such an obvious effort that he thought an apoplectic fit would end the conversation he hastily poured out a glass of water and begged ireland to loosen his neckcloth but the man shook his head and going to one of the windows opened it for a few moments he inhaled the air and returned to his seat more composed i beg your pardon george he gasped when he recovered his voice but if you wish me to tell you anything you must not speak to me like that i have a bad temper i never knew that said brendon in a soothing tone you were always kind to me i have a superlatively bad temper repeated ireland but you were her child how could i be angry with her child wait wait i shall tell you all i can give me a few moments he was so moved with emotion and with the recollection of the past that he buried his head in his arms which were resting on the table brendon respecting this feeling walked to the end of the room and stared at a picture which represented a star of the ballet but he did not see the saucy face the twirling skirts he was thinking how strange it was that ireland should never have confessed this love before certainly he had never displayed such emotion a change had come over the man whereby he more plainly revealed his feelings than he was wont to do george put this down to old age and to less self control consequent on the same shortly he heard ireland calling to him and returned to his seat to find the old man smoking quietly and rather ashamed of his outbreak but you shall see no more of that he said i am sorry to be obliged to ask you for a story of the past said brendon apologetically but it means so much to me i'll tell you all i can said ireland taking no notice of the apology but looking at the ash on his cigar he paused for a moment to collect his thoughts and then began abruptly i first met your mother at her father's house in amelia square where i went to take lessons in singing lockwood was famous for his method in those days and his fame was increased by the appearance of your mother rosina at many concerts she was a most beautiful creature and was as much admired for her beauty as for her voice ah what a voice it was like the trill of a lark flexible and silvery and with an immense range she was quite the rage for a season and was called the english jenny lind many offers were made to her for the operatic stage i dare say she would have accepted in the end had she not met with percy vane and he ireland's hand clenched my father said george willfully disregarding this sign of temper how did he meet her he saw her at a concert and fell in love with her then he came to take singing lessons with the voice of a frog bah it was a mere blind it was rosina lockwood he was after i saw it oh yes the eyes of love are keen and although rosina would not waste a look on me i watched her every action many a night have i paced amelia square watching her window when she sang i was entranced when she smiled here the old man shook his head and made an effort to recover himself brendon saw that the recital was painful to him and but that he was so anxious to get at the proofs of his birth would have asked him to desist but there was too much at stake for such consideration to be shown go on he said softly and ireland resumed percy vane was a handsome man and rich i warned lockwood that he was in love with rosina but the old man would not heed he was flattered by the attention rosina received all through that season vane was in attendance on rosina at the end of it he eloped with her yes he met her outside st james's hall and they eloped where did they go to asked brendan eagerly that i cannot say rosina wrote three weeks afterward from paris signing herself vane and stating that she was the wife of percy was my grandfather angry yes and no he was angry that he should have lost her for she was of use to him as an advertisement of his method of singing and also she earned a great deal of money the house in amelia square was large and required a good deal to keep it up besides anthony lockwood was extravagant that was why you were left so badly off brendon shrugged his shoulders it was good of my grandfather to leave me anything he said but in what way was my mr lockwood pleased you hinted that he was not quite angry well said ireland slowly twirling the cigar in his fingers you see he was flattered that his daughter should have married into the aristocracy then there was no question of the marriage then no lord derrington said nothing till your mother was dead and even then he said very little it was when vane was murdered at san remo that he first decisively asserted that no marriage had taken place he did so because lockwood insisted that derrington should acknowledge you as the heir he refused to do so and said that his second son was the heir that is walter vane's father exactly and now the father is dead walter vane stands in your shoes i wish you could prove the marriage my boy said ireland shaking his head but it will be a difficult task i don't care how difficult it is replied brendon resolutely i am determined to learn the truth who is the lady asked ireland miss dorothy ward you don't know anything of her ireland shook his head i left the adoration of the aristocracy to lockwood he said with something like a sneer but that's neither here nor there my boy to make a long story short i met your mother in paris and shortly afterward she died giving birth to you eliza stokes was with her when she died and you were given into the charge of that woman your mother was buried in pre la chaise vane put up a stone to her oh he behaved very well i don't deny that added ireland but with a dark face he was really fond of her and i suppose there was a marriage did my mother ever say anything about it never you asked me that before it was an accepted fact after the death of rosina her husband went to italy i was there too and it was at milan that the episode occurred which led to the dismissal of eliza stokes what was that why there was a young english waiter quite a boy he was who fell in love with eliza when she was taking charge of you at the htel de ville she refused to marry him and hinted that she loved your father vane heard of this and taxed her with impertinence the end of it was that eliza said too much and was dismissed and jane fraser was sent from england by vane's mother to nurse you that looks as though lady derrington believed in the marriage it does admitted brendon hopefully she would not have sent a nurse had anything been wrong on the other hand if she had been quite certain about the marriage she might have offered to take charge of me she did i believe but your father was so fond of you for your mother's sake that he could scarcely bear you out of his sight however eliza went and jane came and then your father went to san remo you were then two years of age did not my father return to england during all that time no when he left england with your mother he never returned she died in paris and with you in charge of a nurse vane wandered about the continent i was twice in italy and saw him the second time it was at san remo if you disliked my father so much why did you seek him out to see you george you were her child and i loved rosina so dearly ireland stopped gulped down his emotion and proceeded more calmly yes i was at san remo when your father was murdered you never told me that before said brendon i never told you anything before replied ireland dryly and i should not tell you now but that my health is getting so bad that i may not live long i have an incurable disease which will sooner or later carry me off no i don't want sympathy let me finish the story and then we need not refer to it again i had intended to leave a written statement behind me for you george but this is better as you can ask me questions about what you do not understand i understand all so far said george thoughtfully but about this murder mr ireland who killed my father that was never discovered he went to a masked ball and was seen leaving the room in the company of a blue domino his body was found on the stones of the beach early next morning he had been stabbed to the heart with a stiletto asked brendon recollecting the manner of mrs jersey's death yes hence it was supposed that he had been stabbed by some jealous italian who had followed him and the lady but the truth was never known i think myself that vane was murdered on the parade and that his body was thrown over onto the beach the man who killed him must then have taken away the lady who was the lady the blue domino no one ever learned she was cloaked and masked your father was a gay man george and it was rumored that he was in love with the wife of a certain officer it might be that the husband but of course i cannot say the blue domino may not have been the woman in question the whole thing is a mystery your father's body was taken to england and as lord derrington refused to acknowledge the marriage lockwood took charge of you i remember and jane fraser was my nurse for many years she was at san remo when the murder took place yes and so was eliza stokes what was she doing there well this waiter by the way his name was george also although you were called after lockwood's father well george rates seeing that eliza was dismissed got her a situation at a hotel in san remo he came there also during the season and i believe the two married but eliza stokes never came near your father what became of her afterward ireland hesitated i can't say he said but i can observed george coolly she was murdered the other day at the amelia square house as mrs jersey i heard of that crime but how do you identify eliza stokes with mrs jersey my old nurse jane fraser told me when i began these inquiries i looked up jane who now lives in a little essex village she told me all she could which was not much but she stated that when here one day on a visit to you she had met eliza stokes and in spite of her age and gray hairs she had recognized her eliza told her that she was called mrs jersey and had taken a boarding house in amelia square i then determined to speak to mrs jersey whom i thought might have been present at the marriage or at all events might know where it had been celebrated it is probable she did said ireland as she was with your mother as maid when the elopement took place did you see mrs jersey or eliza stokes as i still regard her i saw her but she was murdered before i could manage to speak to her on the subject did you know i know that eliza stokes had changed her name to mrs jersey and was in amelia square said ireland but i only learned this the other day who told you a woman called miss bull said ireland miss bull repeated george i remember that was the boarder who foretold a violent death to mrs jersey but you read about that in the papers ireland nodded i did he said and i also saw that you were in the house when mrs jersey was murdered you were a witness i can tell you about that i there is no need to tell me i have not the time ireland looked at his watch in ten minutes i leave for my walk george remonstrated but this is so important not so important as my health i can give you only the ten minutes george this miss bull called to ask me about the lease of the house to mrs jersey i knew nothing about that when lockwood died i sold the house to lord derrington what to my grandfather yes but had i known he was the purchaser i should not have let him have it he bought it through an agent since then i heard nothing more about the house i did not even know it was a boarding establishment until it appeared as such in the papers the other day i wondered what you were doing at the inquest i can explain ireland held up his hand i need no explanation i know that mrs jersey was really eliza stokes i gathered that from the description given by miss bull in the course of our conversation my suspicions were aroused by the fact that lord derrington had leased the amelia square house to mrs jersey why did he do that george spoke more to himself than to ireland well said the old man rising it is my belief that lord derrington knows there was a marriage and assisted mrs jersey so that she should hold her tongue now there is no more time i must go out and ireland walked to the door george followed knowing it was vain to attempt to turn him from his purpose as the old man was most obstinate one moment he said on the door step this blue domino connected with my father's murder was she never traced no there was no means of tracing her except that she wore a piece of holly she carried no distinguishing mark holly cried george astounded yellow holly yes i don't know how you come to mention it but the holly worn by the blue domino with whom your father went away had yellow berries chapter vii the red man as brendon was in the neighborhood of amelia square he paid a visit to the boarding house having learned from ireland that miss bull had informed him how lord derrington was connected with the late mrs jersey george thought it just as well that she should be questioned certainly miss bull who appeared to be a dour and secretive sort of person might not speak on the other hand if he could induce her to be frank he might learn from her presuming she knew the reason why lord derrington had leased the amelia square house to mrs jersey it was a forlorn hope but brendon was so eager to learn the truth that he clutched even at this straw therefore on leaving ireland he turned his steps in the direction of the boarding house much as he disliked entering it again it was necessary that he should do so on his way brendon meditated on ireland's remarks about the holly he remembered the agitation of mrs jersey when she saw the sprig in his coat she had been at san remo when his father was stabbed and ireland had mentioned that the woman with whom the deceased man had left the ballroom wore a sprig of yellow holly had the berries been red george might not have thought so much of the matter but yellow holly is comparatively rare and evidently mrs jersey's alarm had been caused by her recollection of the murder the sight of the holly had revived her memory i wonder if she had anything to do with the murder mused george as he turned into amelia square could she have been the woman in the blue domino certainly she was a servant and my father would have had nothing to do with her but at the ball she would wear a domino and be closely masked but even so by what means could she have induced my father to leave the room with her i don't suppose she murdered him herself for she had no reason to do so unless it was jealousy which for a woman in her position was absurd bah i am making a mountain out of a mole hill eliza stokes probably never went to the ball and had nothing to do with the blue domino or with the matter of the crime from what ireland says however a piece of yellow holly was mentioned in connection with the murder and mrs jersey then eliza stokes probably heard of it that was why she shivered and turned pale when she saw the sprig in my coat having thus decided the question though not in a very satisfactory way george rang the bell and was admitted into the house by jarvey the boy welcomed him with a grin as george had given him half a crown when he left the mansion after the inquest miss bull sir yes sir said jarvey step this way and he introduced mr brendon into the sitting room in which the murder had taken place it was empty but jarvey departed immediately to fetch miss bull george knew the room well it had been used by his grandfather as a breakfast room and many a meal had he enjoyed at that very table as the furniture had been sold to lord derrington together with the house the table was the very article of furniture at which mrs jersey had been stabbed when seated brendon looked from the table to the door and wondered if the assassin had entered stealthily with a bared weapon and had stabbed the wretched woman before she had time to turn her head but on second thoughts he was inclined to think that the assassin had been in friendly conversation with mrs jersey before inflicting the fatal stroke even in the short distance between table and door mrs jersey would have had time to spring to her feet and give the alarm no thought george as he seated himself what i said to train is correct the assassin engaged mrs jersey in friendly conversation and then watched for an opportunity to strike from behind he would have continued trying to puzzle out the circumstances of the crime but that miss bull entered accompanied by margery the little old maid looked whiter and more haggard than ever but her eyes gleamed brightly and she seemed to be in perfect health margery now being the nominal head of the house appeared more important but she kept her eyes on miss bull's face and in all things took her orders from this superior being miss bull was a despot although kindly enough and margery was her slave how are you mr brendon said miss bull smiling in her prim way but without offering her hand i did not expect to see you again why not asked george quickly miss bull shrugged her thin shoulders and fastened her beady eyes on his face many of the boarders left on account of madame's murder so i thought you had done the same i was only a visitor miss bull had i been a boarder i should not have left the murder did not scare me no replied miss bull indifferently i don't suppose it did i only talked for the sake of talking brendon knew this was untrue as miss bull was not a woman to waste words besides the old maid's eyes were fixed with a certain amount of curiosity on his face and he could not conceive why this was so he was rather embarrassed how to begin the conversation especially as margery was present something of this showed itself in his manner for miss bull drew margery's hand within her own and nodded affably miss watson is the head of the house she said do you come to see her or me mr brendon i come to see you said george hoping she would send the inconvenient third away but she did nothing of the sort in that case margery can stop as my friend mr brendon anything you say before her will go no further she keeps my secrets always always cried margery her eyes on the old maid i would rather die than reveal your secrets miss bull rather tragic my dear rather tragic replied the elder patting the hand she held i have really no secrets worth revealing a lonely old woman mr brendon solaced by the friendship and devotion of this lonely girl margery who had flushed at the rebuke stopped and kissed the old maid's hand miss bull patted her head and turned cheerfully to her visitor yes mr brendon she said in an interrogative manner again george felt awkward but judged it best to plunge into the middle of the matter and get it over as soon as possible you called to see a certain mr ireland he said about the lease of this house i have to come to ask you why you did so miss bull stopped patting margery's hand and her lips tightened i don't see what business that is of yours she said tartly on the face of it miss bull i admit that the question sounds impertinent but i am anxious to learn something about mrs jersey's early life and since you know something i know nothing interrupted miss bull quickly absolutely nothing i came here as a boarder many years ago and as is my custom i kept myself to myself madame and i did not get on well together she was not a lady do you know what she was asked brendon shrewdly i have already said that i know nothing replied miss bull coldly evidently it was impossible to learn anything from so secretive a woman nevertheless george tried another tack do you know if mrs jersey left any writings behind her he asked this because it struck him that mrs jersey might have been tempted to write out her relations with the vane family it was apparent that lord derrington had given her a lease of the house to silence her about the possible marriage so for the sake of her niece mrs jersey might have left some confession which would secure its renewal and that the lease had been renewed was evident from the fact that the boarding house was still being carried on in the old way and by the niece miss bull did not reply to this question herself that is not my business she said miss watson took possession of her aunt's papers they were in a green box said margery artlessly what did they consist of asked brendon you need not answer that question margery said miss bull quickly and from that moment margery preserved a lumpish silence george rose in despair you will not help me he said taking up his hat so far as i can see there is no reason why we should help you was miss bull's reply and she rose in her turn brendon saw nothing for it but to go yet he hesitated to abandon the chance of learning something from miss bull he stared at her pinched white face and wondered if it would be any good appealing to that love of romance which is inherent in the heart of every woman old and withered as miss bull was she might soften under the influence of a love tale brendon disliked telling his business to strangers especially anything regarding dorothy whom he looked upon as a sacred vestal not to be lightly mentioned however so much was at stake that he determined to speak openly on the bare chance of miss bull yielding but he could not speak in the presence of the girl margery she was such a sullen animal that to mention his love in her presence would be like casting pearls before swine he therefore turned to miss bull who stood with folded hands eyeing him frigidly if i could see you alone said brendon miss bull cast a shrewd glance at him rapidly made up her mind and told margery to go the girl looked at him tigerishly as she was evidently jealous and sulkily withdrew when the door was closed brendon resumed his seat but miss bull remained standing this was not a good sign but george was now committed to a certain course and had to follow it miss bull he said deliberately what i am about to tell you being my own private business i must ask you to keep to yourself i don't want to hear it said miss bull i never care for other people's secrets this is not a secret miss bull it is merely that i am engaged to be married indeed and what interest can that have for me mr brendon this much you are a woman and must feel interested to a certain extent in a love romance i am aware that i am appealing to you in a way which you may regard as foolish but i am so anxious for certain information and from what mr ireland said you alone can give it to put the thing in a nutshell i am in love and you can forward my marriage if you will miss bull heard him in silence but as he talked a faint crimson flushed her face and a softer light shone in her hard eyes she put her hand to her heart as though she felt a cruel pain and sank into a chair alarmed by her pallor which had now returned george would have called for assistance but she stopped him i shall be all right shortly she muttered in faint tones marriage love what have i to do with such things she paused and then continued her voice gathering strength as she proceeded who is the bride mr brendon she is not a bride yet she never may be replied the young man gloomily for if she does not become my wife she will accept no one else i can trust her implicitly her name is dorothy ward miss bull rose with an ejaculation and her face grew red is her mother the honorable mrs ward who married lord ransome's son yes do you know her asked george surprised at her emotion i have heard of her replied miss bull resuming her seat with feigned indifference but with barely concealed agitation dorothy ward a handsome girl i have seen her in the park she is as good as she is beautiful cried brendon enthusiastically i'll take your word for that said miss bull in a softer tone mr brendon i will help you don't ask me why perhaps it is on account of your romance perhaps because because her hand clenched itself and she fought down an outburst no matter i will do what i can to forward the marriage what do you wish to know about mrs jersey in relation to lord derrington yes he was the landlord of this house i believe he was and is it was leased to mrs jersey furniture and all by the year by the year said brendon surprised why not a seven years' lease in the ordinary way i cannot say i am only telling you what mrs jersey's lawyer told me lord derrington bought this house from mr ireland with the furniture as it stood and as it stood he gave it to mrs jersey she turned it into a boarding house some fifteen years ago i don't think she added or took away any furniture it is in the same condition as when it left mr ireland's hands and he i believe sold it on account of the last owner he did admitted george the last owner was mr anthony lockwood he was george had it in his mind to state that lockwood was his father but the time was not yet ripe for such a disclosure and he said nothing at the moment he was a singing master he finished rather lamely mr ireland told me all about him that is all correct so far as i know mr brendon i dare say you wish to know why i saw mr ireland i did so on behalf of margery watson as i wanted the girl to continue the boarding house i like the poor creature and when her aunt died she was left very badly off didn't mrs jersey leave any money no she lived principally on an annuity from lord derrington ah said brendon his suspicions becoming more and more confirmed so he allowed her an annuity why i can't tell you that but with the death of mrs jersey the annuity naturally ceased i asked mr ireland about the lease and then sought out lord derrington i represented to him the position of margery watson and he was good enough to renew the lease in her name on my security still by the year asked george still by the year so now the poor girl can live you are a good woman miss bull to help her in this way i am not good cried miss bull vehemently god knows i have enough sins to repent of don't call me good mr brendon i am only a desolate old woman who has had a hard life i should have been married and settled but but she shook her head and the tears came into her hard eyes god help me i have had sorrows and will have them till i die that shows you have a good heart said george alluding not to her sorrows but to her actions toward margery well miss bull he rose you have told me what i want to know i hope to make use of it in return for your confidence i should tell you tell me nothing cried the old maid quickly i don't wish to hear your secrets the less said the soonest mended when miss ward becomes mrs brendon she added with a dry smile you can send me a piece of wedding cake she will not become mrs brendon said george shaking his head i will be frank with you miss bull my name is not brendon she rose from her seat and looked at him steadily perusing every line in his face i thought i had seen some one like you before i see now now don't tell me your name is is but it's impossible my real name is george vane i am lord derrington's grandson the little woman looked at him wildly for a moment and then quietly slipped to the ground she had fainted in real earnest and george rang the bell for assistance margery who had evidently been lurking outside rushed in when she saw her friend extended pale and lifeless on the carpet she turned on george with a furious face what have you been doing to the poor darling she demanded you you she raised her hand to strike but brendon caught her by the wrist i have been doing nothing he declared quelling the rage of the she bear by the power of his glance miss bull fainted unexpectedly thank goodness here is some one it was one of the servants but margery waved her off no one but me no one but me she cried and took the slender form of her friend up in her arms wait here she added to george i'll be down soon when she left the room george looked at the servant who was a quiet respectable old woman is that girl mad he asked she's queer poor soul sir replied the woman and entirely devoted to miss bull and well she may be for it is miss bull who manages the house the girl is a natural sir she looks like it replied george sitting down you can go i shall wait here until miss bull recovers yes sir replied the woman and departed but as she closed the door george heard her muttering something to herself about the danger of margery's claws scratching him brendon did not feel very comfortable on this point himself he saw that margery was a kind of untamed animal who had been brought into subjection by miss bull no other person could manage her and should she return still in a passion brendon feared lest she should use physical violence still he held his ground as he was anxious to learn how the old maid was feeling and still more anxious to find out if possible why she had fainted on hearing his name i wonder if mrs jersey told her anything muttered george as he looked out of the window but that's impossible mrs jersey would keep her own secret so as to terrorize over derrington besides miss bull declared that she recognized my face i wonder if she knew my father and if she can throw any light on the murder it is strange that she should be connected with the matter and live in the same house as mrs jersey upon my word said george in disgust it seems as though there were a gang of shady people here connected with my affairs and she was moved by the mention of dorothy's name i wonder what that meant but whatever it did mean he did not learn that day margery returned and stated that miss bull was better but was too faint to resume the conversation she begged mr brendon to call another day margery gave this message in quite a friendly way and nodded smilingly to the astonished george you are better disposed toward me he said taking up his hat miss bull told me to be kind to you she declared still smiling and then with a burst of good nature i will be kind do you want to know about the papers if you choose to tell me said george artfully but rejoicing at the opportunity this offered of learning something yes i do choose said margery she asked me to be kind to you well then tell me replied george humoring her there was a lease in the green box and many bills said margery a few photographs and that was all i couldn't see the story what story miss watson margery nodded with a cunning smile and answered in a whisper as though her aunt was still alive and within hearing she told me it was a story she was writing oh such a long story sheets and sheets of a story foolscap sheets she kept them in a long blue envelope and would not let me see them george reflected that evidently mrs jersey had been writing out an account of her early life and margery's next words put the matter beyond a doubt my aunt said that she would let me have the story to read after she died but i could not find it in the green box perhaps you did not look thoroughly suggested george yes i did and i looked in all other places but i could not find it the story was italian went on margery staring at him for when my aunt wasn't looking i peeped san remo is in italy isn't it i believe so replied george more and more convinced that mrs jersey had left a confession behind her did you tell miss bull margery nodded she said i wasn't to say a word about it but she will not be angry at my telling you she likes you and says you are like some one she once knew and loved brendon did not pursue the conversation he was afraid lest margery might say too much and miss bull might be angry and it was necessary that he should keep on good terms with miss bull evidently she had known his father she may even have loved him but george had heard so much that day that his brain was quite bewildered and he wanted to be alone to think the matter out only one last request he made of margery will you show me the photographs which were in the green box he asked persuasively i can't she replied drawing down her lip like a child miss bull has them but she'll show them to you brightening for she likes you i like you too you are so handsome with a laugh and a blush at this nave compliment george left the house promising to call again with his head filled with many thoughts consequent on his two interviews he emerged from amelia square and walked down to oxford street a shout aroused him from his day dreams as he reached the corner he saw a tall red headed man crossing the road and a cab was bearing down on him the man stood paralyzed in the center and it was apparent that the horse would soon be on him george almost without thinking dashed into the street and seizing the animal reined it back on its haunches with a powerful hand there was a shout of admiration from the throng on the footpath a few oaths from the driver of the hansom and the next minute the red headed man was thanking his preserver on the pavement and shaking his hand violently don't you think i'll forget it sir he said with rather an american accent you have saved bawdsey and bawdsey can help you at a pinch brendon was too bewildered by this extraordinary address to take it all in besides the admiring crowd pressed around seeing this bawdsey took him by the arm and ran him round the corner into a quiet street george recovered and looked at the man he had saved he was a tall man with a thin face though his body was rather stout his hair was red his eyes were blue and he had an alert manner about him which made brendon wonder how such a sharp person ever came to place himself in the position of being run over but bawdsey gave him no time to think what is your name he asked george brendon bawdsey stepped back and a look of genuine surprise overspread his freckled face and he was apparently more astonished than he showed as brendon guessed by the trembling of his hands i have lived over fifty years in the world said bawdsey and this is the queerest thing i ever dropped across and i drop across many queer things stranger well mr bawdsey if that is your name said george good humoredly it is a good thing i have saved your life but you seem as though you could i can i can interrupted bawdsey anticipating the remark but have you ever heard of that disease fear of open spaces no replied brendon what is it i shan't give you the medical name said bawdsey as you would not understand but it is a dread to cross any open space at times it takes me unexpectedly and i get a sort of paralysis of the will and cannot move that was why i stopped in the middle of the road i should have been killed but for you perhaps i had better see you home then said brendon no i shall take a cab it is only now and then that the thing takes me it can't be cured and maybe it will get worse at present it does not prevent me attending to my work come home with me and i'll tell you more i live in no amelia square what in that house cried george for this was the number of the jersey mansion yes what do you know of it nothing oh yes you do but you won't trust me however i'll see you again and i'll trust you take care of lola velez she means you harm the next moment he was gone and george was staring after him chapter viii a bacchante lola velez was the rage for a season she sprang into fame in a single night and thenceforth held an undisputed position as the favorite of the london public she was not exceptionally handsome nor was her dancing distinguished by any special grace but about her there was something weird and original which appealed to her audience such an extraordinary dancer had never been seen on the stage she capered like one in a frenzy with mad leaps and bounds and throughout her orgiastic performance behaved as one possessed it was not so much the poetry of motion as the madness of movement george brendon had been instrumental in introducing her to the public and she owed her position as much to his kindness as to her own genius it was a snowy winter's night when brendon found her he had just entered pembroke square where he had lodgings when he heard a moan turning aside into the shadow of a wall he found a woman lying there exhausted with cold and hunger always anxious to do good he brought the poor creature to his rooms under the influence of food and wine and warmth she revived sufficiently to tell her story her name she stated was lola velez she was spanish by birth but had lived many years in italy trained as a dancer she had appeared at several of the best theaters with more or less success but owing to her violent temper she had lost all chance of gaining a permanent position but that lola was rendered weak by privations she would not have told george the exact truth but she confessed to her temper to a certain episode connected with the stabbing of a woman of whom she was jealous and to the many quarrels which had resulted in her being thrown out of employment finding italy too hot to hold her she had danced her way to paris through various small towns but here as elsewhere her temper proved her ruin then she had crossed the channel only to find that the market was overstocked with dancers unable to obtain employment and having very little money the unfortunate woman had fallen lower and lower until she was reduced to begging in the streets finally she was turned out of her poor lodgings and had expended her last sixpence on food it was shortly after this that brendon found her he acted the part of a good samaritan giving her a sovereign he sent her away restored in a measure to her right mind the next day he saw the proprietor of a music hall with whom he was acquainted and procured her an engagement in a ballet it was a dresden china piece and the violent dancing of lola was by no means suited to the watteau costumes and stately dances of the powder and patches type but the manager a shrewd jew called kowlaski saw in his new recruit the possibilities of success he staged a ballet adapted from the bacchanals of euripides and lola danced the part of agave the mother of pentheus who is rendered insane by bacchus her success was immediate she enacted the part with a reckless abandon and a wild frenzy which thrilled the house for the moment lola was not herself but the wild theban queen raging in the orgies of the wine god all london came to see the frantic revels over which lola presided and night after night the little music hall was filled to overflowing lola made good use of her fame she insisted that her salary should be raised took modest lodgings in bloomsbury and for a time saved her money as a provision against old age and poverty on the stage she was a dancing demon but at home no one could have been more modest there was not a breath of scandal against her in spite of mrs ward's hint to brendon this change in the formerly reckless woman was caused by love and gratitude to george he had saved her from starvation from death he had procured her the engagement which had led to her success and present ease and figuratively speaking she cast herself and all she had at his feet brendon found this excessive gratitude rather trying even then he was in love with dorothy whom he had met twice or thrice and he was not disposed to accept the wild passion which lola so freely offered to him he tried to make her see reason to look upon him as a friend and not as a lover but in her insane way she resolutely refused to regard him as other than the man she intended to marry in spite of her tempers and her wild career lola had never erred and so far brendon could well have made her his wife but he did not love her and hardly relished the idea of taking this wild creature to his heart and home lola could not understand this coldness she was accustomed to see men at her feet and to spurn them now that she was willing to surrender her liberty and to give her love it exasperated her to think that the one man she had chosen would have none of her as yet she knew nothing of brendon's love for dorothy but with the instinct of a jealous woman guessed that some such passion engrossed the mind of the man she desired to marry again and again she deluged george with questions which he always refused to answer so she could learn nothing wearied of her persistency brendon stopped away and for a few weeks lola did not see him she followed him to his rooms but found him absent then she saw his name in the papers connected with the amelia square tragedy and wrote to him he accepted her invitation and came to supper less because of her desire than because he wished to speak to her about bawdsey the name of lola velez on the lips of the red man had startled brendon almost as much as the fact that bawdsey appeared to be acquainted with him george could not recall meeting the man and as he was not yet sufficiently famous for his name to be on the lips of the public he wondered how it came about that bawdsey knew of his existence anxious to know who the man was he sent a note marked private to miss bull and received a reply stating that mr bawdsey was a new boarder and so far as she knew a gentleman who lived on his income but this did not satisfy brendon as it did not account for bawdsey's knowledge there remained lola to question and to lola george went a night or two after the rescue of the red man george made up his mind and a strong mind it was that he would not leave lola until he knew positively how her name came to be mentioned by bawdsey at eleven o'clock lola was anxiously awaiting his arrival and when he entered her little sitting room she flew to kiss his hand her usual extravagant form of greeting george like all englishmen hated scenes and these lola was always making in vain had he tried to break her of these melodramatic tendencies her hot southern blood would not cool and she overwhelmed him with protestations of more than friendship of these he took no notice and as it takes two to make love as well as to make a quarrel lola was yet far from gaining her heart's desire this was a formal offer of marriage having just returned from the music hall lola wore a loose tea gown of scarlet trimmed with glittering jet it was a bizarre garment but the vivid color suited her dark face and southern looks she was rather tall very slender and she moved with the dangerous grace of a pantheress her face was oval sallow and thin with ever changing expressions she was never two minutes the same but her prevailing mood was one of fierce intensity the smoldering fire in her great black eyes blazed into passionate love as she swept forward to greet her visitor my deliverer my adored she cried in moderately good english and kissed his hand with burning lips george snatched it away don't lola you know i hate that sort of thing and so saying he threw down his coat and hat on the sofa at the far end of the room lola shrugged her shoulders and coiled up a tress of her black hair which had come loose putting it in its place she glanced into the mirror over the fireplace to see that her comb was at the right angle she wore a diamond comb in the spanish fashion so fond was she of jewels that george sometimes fancied she must have jewish blood in her veins all her savings went in jewels diamonds for choice they are pretty lola would say when brendon remonstrated with her and when i am poor they can be changed into money oh yes why not ah but you are a cold blood you english man she said in allusion to brendon's action but what would you it is the fogs and cold snows come my friend to the table to the table she clapped her hands and seizing george by the arm forced him into a seat the supper looked very tempting lola had an eye for the beautiful and arranged the table herself a tall silver lamp with a pink shade shed a roseate light on the white cloth the glittering crystal and the quaint silver spoons and forks lola had picked up these things at odd times and displayed very good taste in her selection in the center of the table was an oval silver dish filled with pink roses what extravagance said george ah bah i got them from san remo from a friend of mine said lola removing a dish cover they cost me not one sou george my dear friend the chianti is in the flask there and this macaroni eh george passed his plate the viands were cooked in the italian fashion and there was a foreign air about the supper which was grateful after a long course of english cooking what with the foreign dishes the pink shaded lamp and the candles likewise in pink shades on mantelpiece and sideboard george felt as though he were in a soho restaurant the night was cold he was hungry and the supper with its surroundings was novel he therefore made a good meal lola watched him eat with satisfaction ah you like my housekeepers she said meaning housekeeping it is to your mind yes eh my friend i could feed you as fat as pigs if you would but allow me i don't want to be fat retorted george reaching for the chianti give me a cigarette lola she produced her own case and not only supplied him with one but insisted on placing it between his lips and on lighting it george wriggled uncomfortably but it was no use objecting to lola's ways she would indulge her whims at any price and he did not wish to leave until he had accomplished his mission there little friend cried lola when he was seated comfortably by the fire and she was puffing also at a cigarette now we must talk why have you not been oh you wicked young boy i have been engaged replied george secretly admiring the careless grace with which she was half lying half sitting in the armchair opposite she showed a dainty foot encased in a red stocking and a red shoe lola was all in crimson from head to foot save for the jet and her dark face and hair she looked like some sorceress bent upon unholy conjurations engaged she repeated with a flash of her wonderful eyes that is words for 'i don't want to come' george laughed shook his head and changed the subject her remark about having a friend in san remo ran in his mind have you ever been there he asked naming the town ah bah have i been anywhere all italy i know all all you know it better than spain yet you are spanish i am whatever you desire my george yes i am of spain of cadiz where my parents sold oil to their ruin they came to italy to milan and made money to live from wine i was trained to the dance they died and i my friend you told me all this before interrupted brendon ruthlessly i ask if you have ever been to san remo why yes assuredly and why not she looked at him with narrowing eyes as she put the question blinking like a cat there is no reason only i was thinking he paused eh you think of what oh something which does not concern you lola all that is of you is to me she responded i love you lola be reasonable pschutt i mock myself of your reason she cried snapping her fingers and speaking in quite a french way i leave reasons to your chilly english ladies i eh but you know i am of the south to you to you my adored preserver do i give myself george grew angry if you talk like this lola i shall go away ah then good night to you let it be adieu and never come back not at all be a reasonable woman and sit down give me some more wine and a cigarette i want to ask you a question lola poured out the wine and tossed him a cigarette but she refused to sit down or to compose herself in a flaming temper she whirled about the room talking all the time ah yes but it is so always i am a fool to love you cold one pig of an englishman that's grateful said george quietly and she was at his feet ah but no i am a bad womans i am entirely all wicked you are an angel of the good god dearest my own she stretched adoring hands and her eyes glittered like stars george reasoned with her lola do you wish me to be pleased with you assuredly and why not then sit down in your chair like a christian and talk sensibly she sat down or rather flung herself into the chair with a whirl of scarlet draperies decidedly i am a christian i go to mass i confess yes i confess to the priest how i love you do you really love me lola i was told that you wished me harm she started from her chair with a passionate gesture who says it is liars of the worst tell me who speak that i may tear and scratch no no i don't want a scandal for her sakes oh yes she subsided sulkily i am nothings for whose sake asked brendon rather alarmed for he did not wish this tigress to know about dorothy the other woman's oh yes there is some one else i know you are mine all and would be but for the other womans imbecile that i am to think of you who kick me hard hard and i can learn nothing nothing if i did if i knew i she stopped and breathed hard i wonder you don't have me watched said george thoroughly angry at her unreasonable attitude lola tossed her head and her expression changed to one of alarm brendon saw the change and guessed its meaning you did have me watched and what if i did she demanded defiantly you are mine i am not yours he retorted angrily i have given you no cause to think that i would marry you lola burst into tears you took me from the stones and snows she wept with extravagant grief why did i not die you fed me with foods and made me shine in this london you win my heart and then then pschutt she snapped her fingers you toss it aside why did you have me watched asked george sternly i want to know of the other woman she replied sullenly there is no he broke off it has nothing to do with you lola sprang to her feet with fierce eyes then there is another another oh you cruel name of names but i shall find her i shall tell her you shall tell her nothing you shall not see her but i will eh yes you do not know me this with a stamp i know you cannot behave decently lola if you have me watched again if you dare to to bah george stamped in his turn i have had enough of this behave or i go and will not return she flung herself at his feet with a wail ah but no she sobbed i do love you so dearly i will die if you love me not george drew himself roughly away and taking her by the hands placed her in a chair where she hid her face and sobbed who was it you got to watch me you hired to watch me george advisedly used the word hired as he thought she might have engaged one of her friends to do the dirty work instead of engaging a professional yet he knew she was quite capable of going to a private inquiry office i shall not tell you said lola sitting up with a hard expression on her mouth and in her eyes did you pay him much asked brendon dexterously i paid him what i chose retorted lola falling into the trap ah then it was a professional detective you engaged you have been to one of those inquiry offices that is my business said lola who seeing she had made a slip became more obstinate than ever more to show her calmness she lighted a fresh cigarette and smoked it defiantly george shrugged his shoulders he was not going to argue with her remembering that bawdsey had mentioned her name and that bawdsey appeared to know all about himself he began to put two and two together certainly he might be wrong and bawdsey might have nothing to do with the matter still it was worth while trying to startle lola into a confession by the use of his name his rescue of bawdsey hinted that the long arm of coincidence might be at work well i don't know where he comes from began george lola snapped him up ah yes and you think it is a man bah why not a woman my dear she sneered oh you may have half a dozen at work male and female both said george taking his seat but i should have thought that the red man was clever enough to she threw away her cigarette and rose to her feet with such manifest alarm that george knew his guess was correct you talk foolish george looked at her angry face serenely did bawdsey when he said you wished me harm what she flung up her hands with blazing eyes did he say i do wish you harm was it that that cow pig don't call names lola and don't distress yourself it was bawdsey lola saw that she had gone too far and had vulgarly speaking given herself away she tried to recover lost ground i do not know his names she said sullenly then burst out but i wish you no harm eh will you believe that my preserver i'll believe nothing if you will not tell me the truth said brendon a little cruelly come lola admit that you paid bawdsey to watch me i did not pay no not one sou he did it for love oh indeed so bawdsey is in love with you lola threw back her head defiantly yes he is and i care not one two three little trifles for him chup he is old he is red he is one big fool that i can twist and twist and you apparently have done so well then lola did you get him from a private inquiry office no i did not so he loved me and sent me flowers oh many many flowers those roses she pointed to the silver dish so you can't tell the truth even in that said george deliberately what of the friend in san remo it is his friend he had flowers from his friend he told that brendon sat up with an eager look in his eyes so bawdsey knew some one in san remo probably he had been there and bawdsey was acquainted with his name brendon began to think that there was some meaning in all these things and plied lola with questions she was sulky at first and would not answer but brendon knew how to manage her and before the conclusion of the conversation he got the whole truth out of her this was accomplished by using what the americans call bluff so bawdsey knows san remo and he is fifty or over fifty years of age h'm he knows all the history of the place i suppose i know not nothing do i know ah that's a pity bawdsey could tell you some nice tales he fixed a keen glance on her about some yellow holly for instance lola winced for the shot had gone home but she still held to her declaration of ignorance i know nothings absolutely but apparently this man knows a great deal he is in love with you and must have told you much did he inform you of a certain murder which took place at san remo ah bah why should he i knew of all already you how did you know my father and my mothers they lived in san remo when oh they did tell me all of that englishman did they know who murdered him asked george marveling at this unexpected discovery no no one know anythings was there no suspicion not one suspicions i know nothings she repeated doggedly it strikes me that you do how did you and bawdsey come to be talking of this matter we did not talk lola looked down at her foot as she told the lie and moved it restlessly george rose and took up his hat throwing his coat over his arm he moved toward the door good night mademoiselle she sprang to her feet and flew after him no no she cried in lively alarm you must not go my dearest dear what is the use of my stopping when you will not show your gratitude toward me by telling the truth george hated to make such a speech as this but it was the only way in which he could move her i will tell i will tell sit down the coat you shall not go i will say all ask what you will sit my little cabbage a wine in the glass ah yes and a cigarette come be good am i mademoiselle no said george smiling on her pleading face you are my friend lola now that you are sensible ah only friend she said sadly but i speak yes george began at once to question her lest the yielding mood should pass away you made the acquaintance of bawdsey at the hall lola nodded he loved me he sent me flowers he was made a presentation to me by kowlaski i learn that he looks after people what you call a a un mouchard a spy yes go on and i made him watch you i told him your name did he know my name asked brendon quickly he knew everything oh yes all all brendon was taken aback all all what he asked amazed why lola twirled her fingers all what you would not tell to me my dear that your names is vane and milor derrington did bawdsey mention lord derrington yes oh many times he speaks of milor i speaks of san remo this this bawdsey ask me of the blue domino of the holly of the murder in fact it is quite so my friend of the murder of your father what george started from his seat did he know that the man who was murdered at san remo was my father yes and that it was difficult about the marriages that also he appears to know the whole story and he mentioned lord derrington that is how he comes to be acquainted with these facts a spy derrington is employing him and the man is boarding in amelia square george struck his hands together by jove it's a conspiracy and i never knew anything i do not wish you to have the marriages right george said lola with a pout if you are as what you are then you will marry me she will not be madame she who the woman you you love lola got out the word with difficulty and burst into extravagant rage but she will not have you no you are mine you will be brendons as i know you and not vane never milor i will not let it if you are milor you marry her did bawdsey tell you the name of the lady no but he will tell but she is a well born one and i am of the gutter but i love you ah yes i love you she threw her arms round him be still brendons and not milor and i am yours no no george took her arms from his neck and spoke more soberly lola hold your tongue about what you have told me and i'll see you again if you speak i see you no more i will be silent she said as brendon put on his coat but you are cruel wicked you shall never be milor never how do you know asked george contemptuously lola's eyes blazed i know i know you will never be milor chapter ix clever mrs ward an invitation an invitation to dinner by jove i never thought i'd get that far the honorable mrs ward too hurrah leonard train made these remarks over a letter which had come by the morning post it was a delicate perfumed friendly note begging dear mr train to come to dinner the next evening without ceremony i have just learned that your dear mother was at school with me wrote mrs ward in her most gushing style so you will see why i write informally do come the do was underlined and leonard could hardly contain himself for joy at this proof that a member of the aristocracy was disposed to be friendly a woman of the highest fashion too chuckled leonard to account for train's exuberant joy which seemed out of all proportion to its reason it must be explained that notwithstanding his money and what he regarded as his talents he had never managed to enter the fashionable world as he was as vain as a peacock and anxious to shine and be admired among people worth knowing this was a great grief to him george took him to several houses but leonard did not seem to be a success for after one visit he was never asked again although he left cards assiduously this invitation of mrs ward's was purely voluntary as she had met him only once and had snubbed him when she did meet him at the time he had thought her a horrid woman but now he was prepared to bow down and worship leonard's father had been in trade and the nice little income he inherited had been made out of a patent medicine most drastic in its effects that claimed to cure all diseases train senior a shrewd innkeeper had bought it from one of his customers a drunken doctor meant for better things but who had fallen on evil days by judicious advertisement and with the aid of many bought testimonials from penniless members of the aristocracy train managed to make the drug a success train's trump pill was seen on every boarding and mr ireland possessed one of the original posters soon train senior became rich very rich and having improved his manners and suppressed his parents he was taken up by people of good position who needed ready money he bought his way into the fringe of the fashionable world and finally married a rather elderly lady who had blue blood extravagant tastes and no money she presented him with leonard and then thinking she had done her duty arranged to enjoy herself mrs train spent the proceeds of the trump pill recklessly and before her husband died she managed to get through the greater part of his wealth train settled an income of five thousand a year on his son and let mrs train do what she liked with the rest then he died and mrs train sent leonard to eton afterward to college when he was thus off her hands she enjoyed herself amazingly and finally died in paris after spending every penny of the principal and interest of the large fortune left by her husband leonard mourned his mother although he had seen very little of her then he settled in london on his five thousand a year and posed as a literary man but the desire of his life was to be fashionable hence his delight at the letter of course i'll go soliloquized leonard when calmer i wonder if george will be there he loves that ward girl so he might mrs ward does not approve of the match so he might not i wonder if there is a regular engagement if not i might have a shot myself the honorable mrs train no that would be the mother it will be seen that leonard was not very faithful to his absent friend but the fact is that train was less devoted to brendon than he had been the episode of amelia square made him fight rather shy of george the story of the marriage was shady and in some way leonard couldn't exactly explain how seemed to be connected with the murder of mrs jersey moreover leonard knew something which he had not mentioned to brendon and would not have mentioned it for the fashionable world however he had said nothing about george's history and so far had kept faith but brendon saw that leonard was no longer so pleased to see him as formerly he therefore avoided the fat young man and leonard did not seem to mind the avoidance indeed he appeared to be rather relieved than otherwise brendon never asked himself the reason of this behavior as he thought it best to let sleeping dogs lie that leonard would speak never entered his head and leonard never intended to speak being weak but honorable in his own foolish way but when mrs ward's invitation came he walked blindfolded into a trap set by that clever little woman she asked train to dinner not because she had known his mother although that was true enough but for the simple reason that she wished to hear what he knew about the amelia square tragedy brendon had told her much but it was probable that train being a weak idiot in the hands of a pretty woman like herself would tell her more mrs ward was by no means reconciled to the possibility of brendon marrying her daughter and wished to find some scandal smirching george that she might induce dorothy to break the engagement she would have utilized the tales about lola and brendon but that she was not sure of her ground in this particular direction and moreover having seen the spanish dancer feared lest so passionate a woman should make an open scandal it was the aim of mrs ward's life to do wrong things and to avoid troubles arising from them therefore she for the time being put lola on the shelf and arranged in her own scheming mind to make use of leonard i can work him like a lump of putty said mrs ward contemptuously a vulgar illustration but a true one besides she said it in the solitude of her own room when she was dressing for dinner so no one heard its vulgarity or its truth when leonard entered the drawing room he was welcomed by dorothy who told him that mrs ward would be down shortly it is only a small dinner mr train she said mr vane is coming no one else i expected to find my friend brendon here said leonard thinking how beautiful she looked no mr brendon is very busy at the present time with his book he would have come otherwise all things should give way where a lady is concerned said train gallantly miss ward laughed she had heard much of train from brendon and thought him a kindly but foolish young man i am not a woman of that sort mr train i have no desire that a man should neglect his work for frivolity you are a great friend of mr brendon the greatest he has and he was stopping with you in the house where that tragedy took place he told me about it train secretly wished that george had held his tongue on this particular point as he had his own reasons for not wishing to be questioned with the very best intentions as to holding his tongue he knew his weakness for babbling well enough and found it easier to abstain from talking altogether than to be temperate in speech brendon certainly stopped with me he said reservedly but we were sound asleep when the murder took place neither of us heard anything after the inquest we both returned to the west end it was a most unpleasant experience said dorothy thoughtfully very assented train wiping his face i shall never go in search of types again you can find amusing types in the west end remarked dorothy in a low voice here is one the young man who entered the room was a small attenuated precise atom of a creature immaculately dressed and with a rather shrill voice he answered to the name of the hon walter vane and was the cousin of brendon although he did not know of the relationship but dorothy and train both knew and compared vane's physique disadvantageously with that of brendon the one man was a splendid specimen of humanity the other a peevish hypochondriac walter vane had been fast in his time and although he was not yet thirty he was now suffering from the consequences of his rapid ways he was in the twenties yet he was bald he was as nervous as an old woman and finicky as an elderly spinster lord derrington who was a bluff old giant of the country squire type sneered at his degenerate descendant all the same he would not replace him by george who was a man in looks and tastes after the old lord's own heart beastly night lisped vane greeting dorothy and taking no notice of leonard i think there will be snow i hope i won't get a bad cold i am so subject to cold mr train mr vane said dorothy introducing the two vane stared and muttered something about pleasure leonard caught no other word he then continued his conversation with miss ward i sneezed twice at the merry music hall the other night that is where velez dances said leonard determined to speak vane stared again and it was dorothy who answered my mother went to see her and says she is a most extraordinary dancer oh clever in a sort of mad way and a regular bad one chuckled the little man dorothy turned away she did not like this conversation as it offended her taste but the next words of vane made her pause i saw your friend brendon at the hall miss ward the writing man you know a fine looking chap but sulky the best man in the world said leonard whereupon dorothy gave him an approving look she wondered what vane would say did he know that the man he criticised so freely was his cousin and the legitimate heir to the derrington title if he had his rights well he has his larks like every one else they say he is sweet on the dancer mr vane cried dorothy the blood rushing to her face the little man became confused conscious that he had transgressed the bounds of good breeding he knew that brendon admired dorothy and that dorothy took pleasure in his society but he was unaware that any deeper feeling existed mrs ward had kept that sort of thing from him as she did not want vane to leave the coast clear for brendon and vane was so egotistical that he never for one moment dreamed that george was his rival even if he had he would have laughed the idea to scorn in his eyes brendon was merely a writing fellow and not to be named in the same breath with his noble attenuated rickety self well good people cried mrs ward entering the room at this very opportune moment are you all here mr vane i am pleased mr train how good of you to come ah mrs ward sighed you have your dear mother's eyes and lovely eyes they were having slipped in this compliment to put leonard at his ease and throw him off his guard mrs ward delivered him to dorothy and took vane into a shady corner dinner will be ready soon she said fanning herself although it was a cold winter's night i hope you are hungry mr vane i was admitted her guest but i have to nurse my appetite carefully you know mrs ward and i am rather put out not by mr train i hope he is a nice fellow really very nice with money made out of pigs or whisky or something said mrs ward vaguely for she was not certain what did he say he said nothing but miss ward did mrs ward shrugged oh well you know dear dorothy has such odd ideas and all that sort of thing i suppose it was something about books or philosophies or grammar or something enough to spoil any one's appetite i'm sure no but i mentioned that brendon you know the writing fellow yes i know said mrs ward viciously and at once on the alert well i said that it was rumored he was sweet on lola velez and miss ward fired up is she so great a friend of his as all that oh by no means responded mrs ward vivaciously a mere acquaintance you know they talk books i believe and how moths get wings like those animals before the flood she thinks he is goody goody i'm sure he's dull enough lola velez oh a perfect dear how she can kick so mr brendon is in well i never should have thought it of him but these quiet men are always the worst so mrs ward rattled on in her incoherent manner but perfectly clear in her own mind as to the good vane's injudicious observation would do if dorothy once got it into her brain that george was an admirer of lola then there would be a chance of breaking the engagement before vane could make any more remarks the gong thundered mrs ward rose at once rather glad of the stoppage of conversation she liked a lively man and vane was a fool but for all that she was quite prepared to give him dorothy as she would have given her to a prize idiot provided the idiot was sufficiently rich you take in dorothy she said to vane thus getting him off her shoulders but not hoping to find leonard a pleasant change i will take mr train under my wing in this order they entered the dining room mrs ward trying to stifle a yawn and wondering how she would get through such a dull evening luckily vane mentioned that his grandfather had expressed his intention of looking in during the course of the evening if you will not mind mrs ward he said politely oh i'm rather glad replied the little woman drawing off her gloves such a delightful old gentleman his anecdotes are quite in the best style he told one to a bishop the other day said vane laughing really how amusing and what did the bishop say he said nothing but he looked sermons ah sighed mrs ward bishops are so particular i find them delightful said dorothy filling in the pause of course my dear because they talk of renan and missionaries and those sort of dry things i remember the bishop of timbuctoo or central africa or some of those places one never heard of telling me how his old curate was eaten alive by blacks and mosquitoes i quite forget which but he was eaten i trust the blacks and mosquitoes didn't find the curate tough i'm sure i don't know he was just thirty i believe and bald you said he was an old curate oh dear me dorothy how can you expect me to explain what i mean at dinner too i mean he was young in years and old in saintliness do try this dish mr train it is so good leonard did try it and did full justice to the merits of mrs ward's cook she kept a particularly good chef as she knew the value of good cooking people like nice things to eat she explained to leonard while dorothy labored to entertain vane it makes one so popular if one's chef can always be relied upon i have known a woman's position ruined by inattention to the kitchen one can break all the ten commandments if only one feeds the men then thinking she had said too much she added sweetly but of course i am only joking mr train as one must be good and all that sort of thing i'm sure you are all that is good and kind mrs ward now that's really very nice of you mr brendon would never say a really nice thing like that of course he's a great friend of yours isn't he and he stopped with you when that poor woman leonard uttered an ejaculation it seemed to him that he was pursued by the amelia square tragedy first dorothy and now her mother was there no other topic of conversation he would have answered an ordinary person rudely being wearied of being questioned but mrs ward having the key of the door which led into the fashionable world was to be conciliated he replied to her almost in the same words as he had used to dorothy mr brendon did stop with me he said but we were asleep when the murder took place how extraordinary said mrs ward languidly yet with a keen eye on the change in leonard's face i wonder who killed her no one knows replied train shortly does no one suspect any one i believe not the police are quite at fault oh the police said mrs ward in a proper tone of contempt they never do anything except make love to cooks do you suspect any one leonard flushed i mrs ward why should i suspect any one oh i don't know you have a clever face just the kind of a face that one would think a brilliant detective would have you must have some suspicions again her eyes searched his face no he protested i was asleep i know nothing about the matter how stupid of you said mrs ward beginning to think that her condescension in asking leonard to dinner was wasted but you men are always so blind poor dears what kind of a woman was mrs jersey a nice motherly old creature i know like a monthly nurse was mr brendon introduced to her yes i took him into the drawing room really have they drawing rooms in bloomsbury how nice and civilized well did mrs jersey and mr brendon get on well together i want to know because you see mr train he admires dorothy and it is such a sign of a man's good nature if he gets on well with strangers i suppose mrs jersey liked him i think she did replied leonard on whose weak head the claret was beginning to take effect but she was rather startled when she saw him first mrs ward's eyes flashed so brightly that leonard would have been warned of his indiscretion had he not been looking at his plate oh how very interesting but she never saw him before why should she be startled it wasn't at him exactly said leonard but at a piece of yellow holly he wore in his coat yellow holly repeated mrs ward with feigned surprise why of course mr brendon wore a sprig my daughter gave it to him so he told me mrs ward and i gave it to dorothy continued mrs ward who for some reason wished to make an explicit statement it is very rare you know and a man who lives in devonshire sent me a bunch dorothy mentioned that mr brendon had begged for a piece yes he would naturally wear it on that night as he had just left my house but why was this unfortunate woman surprised i can't say but she was answered train she turned white and we all thought she was about to faint did she give any explanation no in a few moments she recovered and nothing more was said oh mrs ward seemed disappointed was that all why leonard turned his dull eyes on her flushed face what else did you expect to hear mrs ward nothing nothing she said hurriedly for she did not wish to make him suspicious but it seems so odd dorothy giving the holly you know and that mrs jersey should be upset we must continue this conversation mr train it is really most interesting but you literary men are quite fascinating after dinner in the drawing room mr train dorothy she signaled with her fan and her daughter arose don't be too long over your wine said mrs ward as she left the room we can't spare you mr train leonard believed that all this attention was due to his own fascinations his head was still heated with the wine he had drunk yet he began to regret that he had said anything about the yellow holly certainly he had not promised george to be silent on this especial point but he nevertheless thought it wiser to hold his tongue about all that had taken place in amelia square on the night of the murder warned in this way by his mother sense train took no more wine but after a rather dull conversation with vane he went into the drawing room dorothy was at the piano and thither repaired vane but mrs ward seated near the fire called leonard to her side i must introduce you lord derrington mr train the grandfather of george was a huge man burly red faced white haired and with a rather truculent expression he was over seventy yet carried his years like a boy under his bushy white eyebrows he shot a quick glance at leonard from a pair of keen gray eyes and summed him up at once as a fool but lord derrington had been a diplomatist many years before and knew that even fools are sometimes useful moreover he had learned from mrs ward's aimless chatter that train was a great friend of brendon's and he knew more about george than george thought however derrington after that one glance of contempt was very civil to leonard i am glad to meet you he said with a nod you go in for books i understand from mrs ward he had a deep raucous voice like that of an early starling and spoke in an abrupt staccato kind of way train who stood before him like a rabbit before a snake compared him in his own mind with becky sharp's friend the marquis of steyne derrington was quite as wicked and savage and unscrupulous as that celebrated nobleman i do write a little said leonard nervously i believe in action rather than in writing said derrington there are far too many books written dreamers all of you dreams may come true and when they do come true what is the use of them bah in my young days we lived now people dream i'm sure there's no dreaming about society nowadays said mrs ward laughing every one is as sharp as a needle to get the better of his or her neighbor mutual deception society said derrington you give me so much and i'll let you go so far that's the sort of thing but there is a great deal of philanthropy nowadays and what good does philanthropy do mr train said derrington only makes people lazy people are too sentimental i would give half these paupers the cat if i had my way train was quite sure that he would for with his red face and heavy jowl and savage air of command he looked the picture of a roman emperor derrington had the instincts of a despot and leonard could imagine him slaying and burning and doing all manner of evil things he wondered how brendon ever came to have such a villainous grandfather it was on the tip of his tongue to say something about brendon just to observe the effect on derrington but his courage failed him and he held his peace and at that moment fate intervened the drawing room door opened and a servant announced mr brendon the next moment george came face to face with his grandfather chapter x diplomacy it was a most awkward meeting dorothy train and brendon knew the truth but mrs ward and vane were ignorant as to lord derrington himself george was not sure after his conversation with lola he had a vague idea that since bawdsey was connected in some way with his grandfather lord derrington must have somehow learned that brendon was the name his grandson had taken there was no other way of accounting for the mention of derrington's name by the private inquiry agent however this might be lord derrington was too clever a man to betray himself george felt that the old man knew who he was but he could not be sure for derrington welcomed him with a well bred air as he would have done a stranger mrs ward watched the meeting curiously and brendon noticed her inquiring gaze but he put this down to his knowledge that derrington knew he was a suitor for dorothy's hand and wished the girl to marry vane leonard was the only person in the room who displayed any visible disturbance he grew red and restless brendon was perfectly calm how delightful of you to come mr brendon said mrs ward rising and apparently forgetting that she had forbidden him the house i must introduce you lord derrington mr brendon and you know mr train we are old friends said george calmly miss ward he bowed to dorothy who emulated his serenity although she felt anxious but when she saw her lover's composure she knew that nothing disagreeable would occur and her apprehensions were relieved there ensued a general conversation relative to the weather to the doings of a certain politician and to sundry other subjects more or less vague george talked excellently and was conscious that derrington was listening with approval again and again he wondered if the old man really knew who he was and again and again he failed to arrive at any conclusion after a time leonard went with dorothy to the piano where she played for his delectation and mrs ward seized the opportunity to show vane some new photographs of herself derrington and brendon were practically alone and the old lord appeared anxious to make himself agreeable george was watchful for the cloven hoof but it did not peep out truculent tyrant as derrington was yet he could play the part of a highly bred polished gentleman of the old school to perfection he did so on this occasion i have heard of you from mrs ward he said in his harsh tones which no amount of politeness could render agreeable but i do not think we have met before no i cannot recall any meeting replied george wondering if the other was about to hint that he had seen some one resembling him i have seen you in the distance however distance lends enchantment to the view in my case you are pleased to say so lord derrington i generally do say what i please responded the old man shooting a sharp glance at george are you related to the brendons of shropshire no i have not that privilege derrington chuckled at this reply he thought george had a good deal of the man in him when he answered thus fearlessly i have seen your name somewhere lately he observed but i can't recall where or in what connection brendon laughed quite at his ease although he did not know if this was an attempt to make him speak out however he did speak out with the idea of seeing what would happen i can supply the connection said he lightly but keenly observant of the old man's face my name appeared as a witness at an inquest a week or so back ah now i remember mr brendon quite so it was that amelia square murder you have a good memory lord derrington in this case you flatter me mr brendon there is no difficulty in my remembering the especial case as mrs jersey was a tenant of mine george was not supposed to know this and displayed suitable surprise indeed he said then you have lost a good tenant possibly replied derrington rather grimly she always paid her rent regularly you saw her yes my friend mr train was stopping in the house that young man derrington cast a look in leonard's direction i did not know he was there on that night he was a witness also said brendon significantly i can't remember all the names sir well i stopped for the night with mr train and during the night mrs jersey was murdered you heard nothing you saw nothing i was sound asleep the whole time said brendon calmly humph derrington pulled at his gray mustache in the very same way as george did when he was reflective what a pity you might have discovered the assassin i don't think the assassin will ever be discovered that's luck for the assassin rejoined the old lord cynically you appear to be very certain mr brendon george shrugged his shoulders no more certain than the police are he replied they examined every one in the house and no one could be accused there was absolutely no evidence and the assassin could not have entered the house as the door was locked and the key was in the pocket of the murdered woman derrington for some reason appeared to be rather relieved i read all that in the papers he said roughly you are telling me nothing new but there you didn't say you would by the way you stopped at that house do you know a miss bull george nodded she told my fortune he said she told mrs jersey's fortune also and a very true fortune did she tell said derrington grimly what did she prophesy about you the usual thing said brendon curtly trouble i suppose these card people generally prophesy trouble as it is certain to occur there was trouble and enemies and the promise that i should get my wish said brendon with a quick look derrington laughed what is your wish if i tell it i won't get it replied george also laughing but i don't believe in fortune telling it is rubbish it wasn't in mrs jersey's case said the other who appeared to be a trifle superstitious oh that was a mere coincidence but you asked me about miss bull sir do you know her derrington nodded she came to me on behalf of mrs jersey's niece and wished the lease renewed i heard her story and consented i dare say the niece will be quite as good a tenant as the aunt this conversation was all very well but there was nothing to be learned from it on either side brendon could not discover if his grandfather knew to whom he was speaking and derrington found it impossible to learn if george could tell him anything of the case which had not been reported in the papers for some reason derrington wished to know what had transpired and brendon felt convinced that this anxiety was more than that of a landlord for the loss of a good tenant he wondered if derrington knew that mrs jersey had written out a confession and that it was missing he would had liked to find out but since he could not reveal himself as derrington's grandson there was no chance of getting this information besides derrington appeared to grow weary of discussing the murder it is worn threadbare he said all the papers have been talking about it i agree with you mr brendon that the assassin will never be discovered never said george looking full at the determined face of the old man are you quite sure i am sure of nothing in this world save that you said so yourself mr brendon however there are pleasanter subjects to talk of what about yourself your aims your ambitions your chances of success are those pleasant subjects laughed brendon to an old man such as i am nodded the other i like to hear of the castles in the air which youth builds i am afraid my castles will never turn to bricks and mortar said brendon with a sigh however he was not averse to showing his grandfather that he was no fool but a man with a head on his shoulders george had a quick brain and a strong will and a considerable fund of information he had taken a good degree at oxford and his literary articles always received praise from the public and from his brethren of the press moreover george was fond of politics and could converse excellently on that fascinating subject he laid himself out to please derrington knowing that the old tyrant was disappointed in the languid vane who was chattering commonplace to mrs ward in a short time brendon and derrington were engaged in a discussion about ireland and irish home rule and the old lord approved highly of brendon's sentiments you ought to be in the house mr brendon he said i have no one to help me to such a goal derrington was about to speak and fastened his little eyes on the keen handsome face of the younger man but he suddenly changed his mind and turned away to talk to mrs ward brendon knew that he had succeeded in pleasing the old gentleman and was glad that so much was accomplished if derrington found that he was clever and presentable and likely to add luster to the family name it was not improbable that he would recognize the marriage but by this time george had it in his mind that derrington knew who he was and had been talking advisedly under the cover of pretended ignorance so as to see what manner of man his unacknowledged grandson was well thought brendon he has learned that i am no fool at all events mrs ward came across to george and left derrington talking to dorothy for whom he professed a great admiration he knew that dorothy liked brendon as mrs ward had told him so and he frankly acknowledged to her that brendon was a clever man i wish my grandson had his brains said derrington regretfully i am pleased you like him responded dorothy who could not tell him that brendon was his grandson and hardly knew what to say he is as good as he is clever this remark did not please derrington humph i don't like good young men they generally become bad old scamps were you a good young man lord derrington asked dorothy demurely he appreciated the joke one of the best he said with a twinkle in his eyes consequently i have gone to the other extreme for many years they say one always returns to his first loves said dorothy smiling so you may revert to your godly youth derrington shook his wicked old head my first loves are all dead and buried my dear but this brendon you like him dorothy did not see why see should conceal her feelings i love him she said quietly and firmly ha replied derrington showing no surprise mrs ward hinted at something of that sort but i thought that walter please say no more lord derrington well then i won't derrington's eyes rested wrathfully on the withered young man he called grandson i don't wonder at your choice my dear what walter requires is a nurse that is a profession i have not taken up said dorothy laughing she was very anxious to say something good about george to derrington on the chance that it might soften his hard old heart but after all george had spoken for himself and was his own best advocate if she interfered seeing that she was supposed to know nothing of the relationship she might make mischief therefore she held her tongue on the subject nearest to her heart and talked in the most general manner derrington said no more about brendon but dorothy noticed that his eyes were rarely off the face of her lover george had certainly made an impression meantime vane joined mrs ward and dorothy seeing that leonard was alone beckoned him to approach derrington was not particularly pleased at having his conversation with a pretty girl interrupted but he was polite and on learning that train knew brendon intimately he began to ask him about his friend train to please dorothy and because he really admired george spoke most enthusiastically dorothy listened in silence well pleased from derrington's curiosity and persistent questioning she began to think he knew something of the relationship but really you know she is a great artist mrs ward was saying to brendon there is something so original about her they were speaking of lola velez and it was vane who had introduced the subject as mrs ward was a married woman and knew the seamy side of social life vane had no hesitation in speaking about the dancer to her george to whom the subject was distasteful tried to avoid the discussion but mrs ward on the alert for information would return again and again to the topic they say you know her very well she declared they who asked brendon lifting his eyebrows i do for one said vane in his weak voice a fellow told me that she owed her success to you i am not sorry to put you right on that point replied brendon his eyes hardening many false rumors are about to one of which you alluded the other day mrs ward this is another what i know of senora velez and how i know her can be put in a nutshell and george quietly related his rescue of the dancer then you did make her the success she is cried mrs ward when he ended oh yes it's no use denying it you picked a jewel out of the gutter and gave it a chance of shining perhaps i did that much but she made a success by her genius i hope she is grateful murmured vane with a malicious smile brendon turned on him sharply i don't know what you mean by gratitude he said deliberately well drawled the little dandy she is pretty and she is not at all pretty mr vane and were she as lovely as cleopatra it would not matter to me my connection with her ceased when she made her success george quite forgot the presence of mrs ward and spoke vehemently can't you understand that a man may do a kind action without being biased by the beauty of a woman some men can said mrs ward politely and i am sure you are one mr brendon but suppose the woman i don't suppose anything mrs ward i know senora velez was poor i helped her to attain to the position she now holds because i endeavor to follow the preaching of christ and she is to me a grateful friend there is no more and no less to be said and a trifle ruffled george turned on his heel to join dorothy well i'm sure murmured mrs ward and in my own house too vane sniggered there must be something in it he said and the profane language he used of course i don't believe a word he says neither do i she's too pretty so these two scandal mongers talked on and george had only made matters worse by his explanation however he believed that he had nipped the scandal in the bud and strolled into the next room with dorothy to quiet his mind behind them they left derrington talking to train and rather enjoying himself the room in which they found themselves was a pretty little apartment hung with amber silk and illuminated with lights in yellow shades the furniture was also yellow and the carpet of a primrose hue mrs ward only introduced her most intimate friends into this boudoir as it was her own special sanctum and if its walls could have spoken they could have supplied all the existing society papers with gossip enough to last a century do you think lord derrington knows who you are asked dorothy as they seated themselves on a kind of divan i am not sure replied george who did not want to tell her what he knew lest he should have to introduce the name of lola velez i have an idea that he does dorothy shook her head i don't think so if he knows you he must be aware that you know him and about the relationship and would not speak so freely i think he is taken with you george well he has been putting me through my paces i only hope that our chance meeting of to night may bear fruit what is train doing here your mother only had him in her house once before and she does not like him i can't make out why she asked him said dorothy he is a dull young man though harmless enough but my mother made a point of asking him to dinner humph i wonder what that's for said brendon wrinkling his brows for he knew well that mrs ward did nothing without expecting an equivalent return then he recollected her questions about the crime and wondered if she had invited leonard so as to pump him it was just what mrs ward did intend to do but george could not think she had sufficient interest in the crime to justify such a course of action besides he felt that he could trust leonard to hold his tongue in spite of the man's weakness but in this he reckoned without mrs ward who could have wiled an anchorite to chatter had she been so minded and that is what she was doing at the very moment almost as soon as the lovers had disappeared into the yellow boudoir lord derrington had taken his departure he insisted that vane should come also and would not allow the little dandy to take leave of dorothy nor would he take leave himself this was done to punish vane miss ward is quite happy in there he said to mrs ward at the door of the drawing room i won't have her disturbed oh but really cried mrs ward who did not want vane to go away with a bad impression dorothy is simply bored with him if she is bored with such a brilliant fellow she would not enjoy the company of shakespeare himself i'm sure i shouldn't murmured mrs ward shakespeare must have been an awful bore but do say good by lord derrington dorothy will be so disappointed no she won't snarled derrington who was enjoying himself at thus thwarting mrs ward's schemes come along walter take me home and tell me your latest ailment good night mrs ward and he went derrington was chuckling and vane looked very sulky so mrs ward saw that the old man had done this thing to spite her horrid creature she pouted he ought to be dead and buried it isn't respectable being alive at his time of life he'll make walter vane angry with me and i'm sure here she caught sight of leonard's astonished face and became aware she was divulging secrets at once she smoothed her brow and began to smile this was an excellent opportunity to find out what she wanted taking leonard's arm she led him to a chair some distance from the door of the boudoir now let us have a nice long talk dear mr train she said settling herself amiably mr brendon and dorothy are no doubt talking tadpoles or frogs or something nasty they won't be out for a long time so we can renew our pleasant conversation i don't think it was very pleasant said train unwillingly what an ungallant thing to say i mean to talk about crime is most amusing i mean instructive oh yes i have read many of those novels what do they call them detective novels a very low form of literature said the superior leonard oh they are amusing and interesting and send one to sleep when one can't in spite of drops and morphia babbled mrs ward in her childish manner and i have often thought how nice it would be if one could really try and find out who killed a person now in this case mr train i am sure you heard something or saw something upon my word i neither saw nor heard protested leonard i was in bed all the time didn't you hear a scream no then you must have heard the fall of the body or the shutting of the door as the ah mrs ward saw from the expression of leonard's face that she had touched upon something you did hear no no he stammered wondering how he was to get out of confessing about the opening of the front door without appearing rude nonsense confess confess you silly man but leonard was too loyal to lead her away from the point he asked a question mrs ward that yellow holly yes what about it she leaned forward eagerly did you give a sprig of it to any one else no i only gave a bit to my daughter and she she gave it to brendon yes i know but did miss ward give any of it to a third person certainly not to do so she would have had to get it from me but beyond the sprig that was given and which mr brendon had no holly went out of this house it is very rare is it not i believe so i dare say there wasn't another bunch in london on that particular night of course there might have been still but why do you ask all this well said leonard it seems to me that the yellow holly has something to do with the crime mrs ward drew a long breath but said no word he was speaking half to himself and she did not wish to interrupt his train of thought but she listened with all her ears leonard continued i found a berry in the room where she was killed yes they took us in to see the body and a horrid sight it was i turned my eyes to the floor and there i saw just by the table a kind of amber bead i dropped my handkerchief so that quex might not suspect and i picked it up when in my own room i examined it it was one of the yellow holly berries mrs ward threw herself back with a kind of unholy triumph do you know what you are saying mr train she said in a half whisper you are accusing mr brendon no no train started to his feet mrs ward pulled him down again and pointed with her fan toward the boudoir hush he might come out she whispered but can't you see brendon wore the sprig in his coat on that night he must have been in the room and have dropped the berry what was he doing there if it was not to no said train hoarsely i half thought of that myself but it is quite impossible i tell you he could not have got out of his room unless he had come to me how do you mean i locked the door of the sitting room which was between his bedroom and mine there was no exit from his bedroom and to get out and down the stairs he would have had to open the sitting room door now the key was under my pillow and the door was locked in the morning no mrs ward brendon is innocent he might have stolen the key while you slept train shook his head impossible i sleep very lightly and on that night i hardly slept at all why was anything wrong i can't tell you that mrs ward without violating the confidence of my friend indeed i have said too much promise me you will not speak of what i have told you i promise but i am quite sure that the holly berry was dropped by george brendon and that he was in mrs jersey's sitting room on that night he is the criminal i tell you he is not mrs ward don't excite yourself mr train here is mr brendon and dorothy she sailed toward them with open hands finished your talk we must say good night and to herself she murmured while smiling i've got you at last i've got you at last and brendon shook hands with madame judas quite unconscious of her premeditated treachery chapter xi mr bawdsey at home under the rule of miss bull for margery was a mere figure head the house in amelia square was much more lively most of the old boarders had departed as their nerves would not permit them to stop in a dwelling wherein a crime had been committed mrs taine carried her knitting to her sister's house at clapham mr granger took the death of nelson to a boarding house on highgate hill and harmer went to rejuvenate his antiquity at some german baths in place of these ancient creatures came bright young men and girls who were up to date in every way none of them minded about the crime the house was cheap it was now bright and in a few months the tragedy was almost forgotten no one would have recognized the changed atmosphere of the place save for miss bull who still sat nightly playing patience in her favorite corner so little did she mind the horror of the murder that she took up her abode in madame's sitting room where it had happened she still retained her own bedroom and margery kept hers but the sitting room miss bull found very pleasant for she could ask her friends into it for afternoon tea without having to mix with the too lively boarders in the drawing room and the majority of them were extremely lively so much so that miss bull sent several away and checked the exuberant spirits of the others the girls played ping pong the men sang music hall ditties and in conjunction they tried to gamble but miss bull soon put a stop to that she had no notion that the house should get a bad name after her difficulty in obtaining the lease from lord derrington of course in spite of the fast air which certainly pervaded the house all things were very proper miss bull was a lady and saw that things were kept decent the boarders feared her bright black eyes and her sharp tongue and were always glad when she retired to her sitting room when they waxed too noisy the little old maid would appear like an unquiet ghost and the clamor would die away but miss bull was also liked as she was a very affable hostess she was thoroughly happy now as she had what she most desired power and thought like satan that it was better to rule in a certain place than to serve in the higher spheres margery was now as ever her docile slave and miss bull governed with a rod of iron she dismissed some of the servants among them jarvey who had bettered himself by becoming a page boy in a west end mansion among the new boarders miss bull took most notice of bawdsey who occupied the rooms formerly inhabited by train on his arrival he had asked particularly for these rooms saying that he had once lived in them when he stopped with mrs jersey many years before after some thought miss bull remembered the man he had boarded in the house and had been a great favorite with madame but had later gone to america and for some time had remained away he expressed the greatest sorrow for the death of the old lady but declared that he was very pleased with the house as managed by miss bull the little woman liked him as his conversation was amusing and he was most polite but had she known that he was a private inquiry agent she might not have approved of him so much miss bull was a lady and drew the line at spies what bawdsey was she never inquired as she was the least curious of women his habits were certainly eccentric for sometimes he would remain away for a week and at other times would stop constantly in the house he often remained in bed for the day and had his meals brought to him this he called his bed cure and stated that he suffered from nerves he told miss bull quite gratuitously that he had a small income and supplemented it by taking photographs of scenery and selling them to london firms but he declared that he was not a professional photographer he simply traveled here and there and photographed any scenery which struck him as pretty the london photographers gave him good prices for these but he stated that he merely did such artistic work for the sake of an occupation i am simple in my tastes said mr bawdsey and what i have keeps me in luxury but a man even of my age must be up and doing better to wear out than rust out miss bull assented for the greater part of her life she had been rusting and now that she had taken command of the house found that wearing out gave her an interest in things and prevented her from being bored she liked to hear bawdsey tell of his travels and frequently asked him into her sitting room for that purpose he seemed to have been everywhere and to have seen everything it appeared from his own confession that he began his travels at the early age of seventeen when he went to milan and the man talked freely about himself so freely that miss bull in spite of her suspicious nature never dreamed that all this chatter was for the purpose of throwing dust in her sharp eyes a week after the little dinner at mrs ward's bawdsey sent a note to brendon asking him to call on a certain afternoon and when george anxious to continue the acquaintance and curious to know how bawdsey had procured his address arrived he was shown up to the well known room bawdsey welcomed him with enthusiasm and much in the same style as lola did but in a less theatrical manner my preserver said bawdsey shaking hands vigorously and george laughed you put me in mind of a lady i know he said she uses the same term quite unnecessarily as it happens i don't agree with you answered bawdsey to the astonishment of his visitor when a woman is rescued from starvation she has a right to call her good samaritan the best of names oh said brendon taking a seat so lola has told you bawdsey nodded i guess so said he with a pronounced american twang somewhat too pronounced george thought she told me all about your visit the other night did she never speak of me before why of course she spoke i tell you sir that the girl is just bubbling over with gratitude and you're a good man mr brendon yes sir some you saved her and you saved me and i sha'n't forget and neither will she yet you said when last we met that she meant me harm jealousy mr brendon sheer jealousy i heard her talking of you and wishing to marry you so you can guess that you wish to put me against her not exactly that responded bawdsey coolly i wish to choke you off you see mr brendon i love her so she told me quite so and she informed me that she had informed you well i was a trifle jealous as i'd lay down my life to make that lady mrs bawdsey but when i learned that you admired and were almost engaged to miss ward how the devil did you find that out asked george without the use of the word devil said bawdsey dryly that is a long story mr brendon you seem to know a great deal about me said brendon nettled i made it my business to find out sir don't you think that is rather impertinent well drawled bawdsey combing his fingers through his ruddy locks you might put it that way if you like a fortnight ago i should not have minded whether you thought me impertinent or not but now that you saved my life i don't mind telling you that i wish to gain and retain your good opinion why asked george more and more puzzled because i'm that rare animal a grateful man you have had a bad time all your life mr brendon but now you shall have a good one and i am the man who is going to help you right along george looked at him helplessly he found it difficult to understand what all this meant of course i know from what lola said that you are a private inquiry agent he remarked with hesitation vidocq co said bawdsey briskly augusta street strand that's me mr brendon but you needn't mention it in this shanty are you an american mr bawdsey i am anything that suits i can talk all languages and try to tell the truth in every one and the best day's work you ever did for yourself mr brendon was in dragging me from under the feet of that horse yes sir i'm in line with you forever this is all amusing but a trifle confusing said brendon feeling that he must get to the bottom of this chatter will you answer a few questions mr bawdsey yes fire ahead wait will you take whisky no thanks yes i'll take a cigar henry clay said bawdsey passing along a box and the questions you are a private inquiry agent asked george when the cigar was well alight and bawdsey had subsided into a chair that's so vidocq company an attractive title i guess and you were employed by lola to watch me i was love will do anything for the object of its affections humph there are different ways of looking at that but you were also engaged by lord derrington to watch me bawdsey did not display the least surprise that's very creditable to your observation mr brendon it's true how did lord derrington find out that i was passing under the name of george brendon well sir if you will shove advertisements into the paper asking about the celebration of the marriage of percy vane and miss rosina lockwood you must expect to be dropped upon oh that was the way you found out that was the way nodded bawdsey you had the answers i had no answers said brendon quickly i am quite sure of that replied the detective coolly we should have heard of you in a court of law had you been successful but what i mean to say is that you asked for the answers to be sent to g b pembroke square kensington derrington spotted that and seeing that the marriage referred to was that of his son to george waved his hand impatiently i see i see he hired you and you looked me up quite so i have had you under observation for the last six months confound it cried brendon uncomfortably and i never knew bawdsey winked i know my business he said you don't find me sending myself up on any occasion any more questions sir only one replied george will you tell me exactly what you are doing in this galley certainly you shall have the whole story mr brendon but in the first place i shall ask you a question in my turn do you know why i asked you to come and see me to day brendon shook his head i have not the least idea he confessed i'll enlighten you was the other man's reply to warn you that you are in danger of arrest i in danger of arrest george jumped up what do you mean oh my meaning is clear enough there is a chance that you may be accused of having murdered mrs jersey george dropped back into his chair with a white face you must be mad to say such a thing who accuses me lord derrington on what grounds on certain information he obtained from mrs ward what is she in it too very much in it she is your bitter enemy you see mr brendon it is not her game that you should marry the daughter mrs ward knows that you are a clever man with a will of your own and that she will not be able to twist you around her finger which is what she wishes to do with any son in law who may come her way that young fool vane is the man she wants he will inherit the title and a good income mrs ward should he marry the girl will benefit if the title and income came your way she would make very little out of the business consequently she will stick at nothing to get you out of the way but she doesn't know that i claim to be lord derrington's grandson indeed she does replied bawdsey quickly derrington told her all about it why now that said bawdsey shaking his head and looking puzzled is one of the things i can't make out george thought for a moment i was at mrs ward's the other evening he said slowly lord derrington was there did he know then that i was his grandson he did he has known ever since you put the advertisement in the paper and i looked you up humph then he was putting me through my paces said brendon to himself what a clever man he is in concealing his thoughts and mrs ward knew also who i was bawdsey nodded yes and after that evening she came to see lord derrington to suggest how you should be got rid of ah george was now perfectly cool as he saw that bawdsey being so frank was ready to be his friend and how did she propose to do that mr bawdsey by having me arrested with the alternative that you should give up all attempts to prove your birth and go to australia and surrender my claim to miss ward's hand i suppose of course but that would go without speaking if you went to australia it's a case of threatening mr brendon was lord derrington agreeable to this suggestion yes he hates you and told me to see you and put the matter to you you have a week to think over it and at the end of that time mr brendon if you don't leave england you will be arrested no replied brendon calmly i will not be arrested setting aside the fact that there is no evidence which implicates me in the crime lord derrington for his own sake will not have his grandson arrested and his dirty linen washed in public whether there was a marriage or not i am his flesh and blood why does he hate me i can't say sir he never explained but he does hate you humph i see no reason a man can't help his birth and i am quite as presentable as walter vane much more so said bawdsey quickly he is a fool and a miserable little beast he sent a bracelet to miss velez oh and naturally you think the worst of him well it is no use my conjecturing the reason of lord derrington's dislike but i can well understand why mrs ward wishes me out of the way on what grounds does she accuse me of being concerned in this crime on the strength of a story related by a friend of yours who i knew it interrupted brendon starting up and beginning to pace the room that was why she asked leonard train to dinner that's the man said bawdsey coolly he occupied these rooms i believe and on the night of the murder you stopped with him i did in yonder bedroom so he betrayed me my dear sir i don't think he could help himself mrs ward is as clever as the devil and as unscrupulous she got out of him that you had been in the sitting room of mrs jersey at midnight that is untrue began george violently when bawdsey stopped him so it is to mrs ward to lord derrington and to the public but so far as i am concerned mr brendon it is a fact you were in mrs jersey's room about the time she was murdered how can you prove that asked george quickly and very pale oh i can prove it easily enough and i will soon but confess that i killed the woman no i never laid a finger on her i believe that said bawdsey if i thought you were guilty i should no not even then you saved my life and i'm grateful i believe you are my friend said george gloomily sitting down you would have been arrested by now were i not mr brendon no i tell you neither mrs ward nor lord derrington will go so far they will try and intimidate me but they won't succeed you'll fight them george set his face while there is breath in my body i knew you were a plucky 'un said bawdsey admiringly but you must be aware that your position is perilous how so mr train can prove that he locked the sitting room door that one there and george pointed the key was under his pillow and in the morning the door was still fast how could i have got out to visit mrs jersey's room without his knowledge that is what puzzles train and mrs ward and lord derrington was bawdsey's reply they asked me what i thought well one moment interrupted brendon why does train believe that i was in mrs jersey's room he found beside the table a yellow holly berry and you wore george started i did i did he muttered it must have been brushed off the sprig when i stooped to touch her ah said bawdsey in a voice of triumph then you admit you were in the room yes to you but to no one else i'm glad you trust me so far said bawdsey genuinely pleased your confidence is not misplaced mr brendon and you saw mrs jersey i saw her body she was dead at what time was that about twelve o'clock why did you not give the alarm what george smiled derisively you think i should have put the rope round my neck no but well no matter we can talk of that later but as to getting out of this room when the door was locked i didn't get out of this room mr bawdsey i wait a bit come into the room you slept in said the detective leading the way i have made a discovery the bedroom was in the same condition as when brendon had last seen it with the exception that the wardrobe was moved to one side the wall at the back which divided the room from the passage appeared a blank but on touching a spring a masked door opened shelves were revealed and it was evident that this door formed the back of a cupboard that was in the passage a cupboard used by the housemaid as was apparent from the dust shovel and brooms lying within it for a moment bawdsey left the door open and looked at brendon with quiet triumph then he snapped the door to and the wall appeared in its former blank condition no one without making a close examination would have suspected the presence of that secret door a housemaid might open the cupboard door in the passage at any time explained mr bawdsey accounting for his action and it would never do for her to look through the back of the shelves into this room she might talk mr brendon and then there would be trouble yes bawdsey rubbed his nose and looked at the astonished george i am sure there would be great trouble i congratulate you on your cleverness mr bawdsey said brendon when he had somewhat recovered you have discovered my secret i should like to know how you discovered it well said bawdsey pushing the wardrobe back to its place with an effort you see when i learned through the advertisement that george brendon was the grandson of lord derrington i told him of it he related your history including the murder of my father yes including that replied bawdsey with a queer expression but that has nothing to do with the matter in hand mr brendon i'm not so sure retorted george i should not be at all surprised to find that mrs jersey was murdered to keep her quiet on that point how do you make that out well she was in san remo at the time my father was murdered she loved him and i dare say in spite of having been discharged watched him she might know who the lady in blue but i forgot you are ignorant of all these things not at all don't i tell you that lord derrington told me the whole story i see what you mean you think that mrs jersey might know who killed your father and for the sake of shutting her up the assassin committed the second murder that is my idea said george coolly it's ingenious but it won't hold water however we can talk of that on another occasion in the mean time i wish to tell you how i discovered the secret door there's no need to derrington told you that i knew this house as my grandfather had brought me up in it when you knew through mrs ward that i had passed a night here and learned through her by means of train that the yellow holly berry had been found in the woman's sitting room you set to work to find out how i escaped from this room you knew that train had locked the door yes answered bawdsey he told mrs ward that he seems to have told her everything however to make a long story short you hunted for an exit and you found it that's so replied bawdsey quietly and now we had better return to the sitting room and talk over the matter quietly one moment said george have you told lord derrington or mrs ward of this discovery no and i won't tell them either i wish to get you out of trouble mr brendon they haven't the least idea that you could leave the room and the impression with them is that train is screening you bawdsey shrugged his shoulders with contempt and passed george another cigar just as though the man would incriminate himself if that were so george did not light his cigar well as you have told me so much mr bawdsey i may as well confess if i am to help you i must know all then you shall know whatever i can tell you george hesitated and bawdsey guessed that he was not going to be so frank as was necessary however he made no remark and brendon continued i came to this house to see mrs jersey and get the truth out of her it was my intention to speak to her the next morning however in the drawing room she stated that she wished the company to disperse at ten o'clock as she had business to attend to also she came up to this room to see if i and my friend were in bed at eleven i guessed that she intended to see some one and wondering if the expected person had anything to do with my business i determined to see her on that night when train was asleep i locked my bedroom door and made use of the cupboard how did you know of its existence i lived here as you know this is a queer old house full of these sort of things i expect that door was made by some scamp so that he might be able to lead a double life bawdsey nodded i know fair to the world and black to the heart as a boy i discovered the cupboard replied brendon not taking notice of this interruption and i am ashamed to say that i sometimes made use of it in my teens to go to the theater unbeknown to my grandfather on that night i used it again and went to the sitting room of mrs jersey it was about twelve o'clock the door of the room was closed i opened it and saw her sitting at the table dead as she was discovered in the morning in stooping over her to see if she still breathed the berry must have fallen it says a great deal for train's acuteness that he suspected me on such evidence i now see why he was so different to me when we parted and why he has been so stiff of late what did you do after you found that the woman was dead i returned to my bedroom and said nothing about it you see since i wanted something from mrs jersey and that desire might have come out in the evidence there was every chance that i would be accused of having murdered her there was certainly motive enough i don't agree with you replied bawdsey however i quite understand that under the circumstances you lost your nerve you returned to your room and expressed suitable surprise the next morning george nodded quite so and then train's having locked this door made me think that all was safe had he not told oh he has told very little rejoined bawdsey after all nothing can be done if i hold my tongue nothing will be done in any case said george grimly but i thank you for warning me mr bawdsey what are your plans i have none at present lord derrington asked me to watch you that you certainly have done and if you choose you can go on watching me but why do you stop in this house oh i knew mrs jersey some years ago and returned here for old times' sake george shrugged his shoulders he felt convinced that bawdsey was not speaking openly but then brendon on his part had held something back neither man was sufficiently sure of the other to be perfectly frank but the main thing was that bawdsey being friendly was content to let matters stand as they were that is so far as regarded george himself for brendon felt that the detective's presence in that house had something to do with the murder he rose to go well how do we stand asked bawdsey much as we did before replied george save that i know you will hold your tongue and not get me into trouble i shall certainly do that but remember mrs ward lord derrington can stop her mouth ah but will he asked bawdsey dubiously i shall call on lord derrington and see answered brendon and with a nod left the room he's a plucked 'un said bawdsey chapter xii a fireside tyrant lord derrington should have been born emperor of ancient rome or of modern russia he would have made an admirable despot as he was fairly good humored when all about him were on their knees serving him even then his temper was none of the best those who held their own he hated while the many who gave in to his domineering will received unmerited contempt as their reward even at seventy five the old man's temper had not cooled and the majority of people avoided him as they would the plague originally he had started life with a sufficiently imperious will and thanks to his position as a titled and wealthy orphan he had been enabled to exercise it at a very early age the habit of seeing every one terrified of his mere glance grew upon him and he became unbearable not only to live with but even to meet his wife after presenting him with two sons had died gladly seeing no other way of escaping her tyrant and the report went that he had browbeaten her out of existence derrington would have married again for the sake of his boys but like henry viii whom he greatly resembled he could find no one willing to endure his yoke consequently he became something of a woman hater and entered the political world in this he met with a certain amount of opposition which did him good and might have been trained into a moderately decent member of society but that his reformation was cut short by his being appointed ambassador to a prominent european power here his temper had full swing and he bullied everybody for three years at the end of that time he nearly caused a war and was recalled there was some talk of his being appointed viceroy for india but those in power had sufficient pity on the country not to send him derrington in india would have been on his native heath for tyrannizing failing from his reputation to get another appointment derrington took to quarreling with his sons percy the elder had a spice of the paternal temper and refused to submit consequently he was forbidden the house and crowned his iniquities in the old man's eyes by marrying rosina lockwood this was a severe blow to derrington who had the pride as well as the temper of lucifer he refused to hold any communication with percy and thus the son remained abroad living on an income inherited from his mother until he was murdered at san remo as his income ceased on his death for it reverted to his mother's relatives george the boy was left dependent on the charity of his two grandfathers derrington denied the marriage and refused to acknowledge the infant lockwood took the child to his home and brought him up then the lad disappeared when lockwood died and reappeared under the name of brendon derrington had discovered his grandson's identity in the way described by bawdsey the younger vane was a fool meek as moses and completely cowed by his terrible father he married an equally meek lady and the two were crushed by the old tyrant finally both died as gladly as the late lady derrington had done and left walter vane to carry on the title the old lord detested walter as a milksop but he refused to acknowledge george preferring the fool to the clever man from sheer hatred of brendon's father derrington house in st giles square was an immense palatial mansion which cost no end of money to keep up and as its lord was not over rich he would have done better to remove to a more modest residence but derrington's pride would not permit him to scrimp his living and he dwelt alone in the big house when walter's parents were alive they had occupied a corner so that derrington could bully them at his leisure and now walter himself remained as a whipping boy but he was cunning enough to keep out of his grandfather's way and contrived to be more independent than his parents had been perhaps derrington was too old to carry on an active war but he certainly gave walter more license than he had ever accorded to any human being a good deal of contempt for the weak little dandy had to do with this permitting him to act as he pleased there is no excitement in whipping a sheep the meeting with george at mrs ward's had touched the old man nearly he had never set eyes on percy's son before and had no idea that the young fellow was so handsome and clever derrington felt that he could take some pride in george as a man who would not permit himself to be bullied he had as strong a will as his grandfather and the older man respected him moreover george's refusal to accept an income when he took a feigned name and his determined fight for his birthright pleased the despot but for his pride and hatred of the father derrington might have acknowledged the marriage he knew in his own mind that such a marriage had taken place and that george was legitimate but he did not know where the ceremony had been celebrated the sole evidence he possessed was a letter written by percy from paris stating that he had married rosina lockwood derrington at the time accepted the fact and had never thought of inquiring about details from his son and of course when percy died it was too late mrs jersey knew and mrs jersey had made use of her knowledge but she never told derrington anything had she done so her hold over him might have waxed feeble although owing to her knowledge and to the old man's determination not to acknowledge george it could not be done away with altogether the library in derrington house was a vast and splendid apartment with a magnificent collection of books its owner driven back on himself by his misanthropic detestation of his species and the dislike his fellow men had for him read a great deal sometimes he wrote articles for the quarterlies principally on political questions he went out into society in spite of his age out of sheer contrariety and not because he enjoyed himself like vespasian he was determined to die standing and showed himself at several great houses at race meetings at hurlingham and sometimes in the house his movements were carefully chronicled in the morning post and he took care to let his friends know that he was still alive for the rest he sat in his library reading or writing his memoirs these he had arranged to have published after his death and there were many families who would have given much money to have seen them behind the fire derrington had known every one worth knowing for the last half century and had as bitter a pen as he had a tongue also he knew many secrets of diplomacy so it may be guessed that many great families did not look forward to the publication of these memoirs with particular pleasure derrington knew this and chuckled grimly much as heine did in the like case one afternoon he was adding a chapter to the book when a card was brought to him derrington nearly jumped from his seat when he read the name of george brendon at first he was inclined to tear up the card and send the pieces out to the insolent young man who thus dared to trespass on his privacy but on second thoughts he decided to accord him an interview he knew that by this time mr bawdsey must have informed george that his grandfather knew him as brendon and the old autocrat wished to see if george would behave as pluckily at their second interview as he had done at the first moreover he could not forget the good looks and clever conversation of the young man it would be absurd to say that derrington's heart yearned over this unacknowledged twig of the family tree for according to common report he had no heart but he certainly felt an unwonted emotion when brendon tall and handsome composed and ready for battle stepped into the room derrington knew that the young man was ready for battle for he saw the light of war in his eyes when the door was closed and the two were alone derrington took his station on the hearth rug with an impassive expression of countenance he waited for george to open the war of words and after a polite greeting he waited in silence george was not at all embarrassed he knew perfectly well that he had a difficult task before him and did not choose to shirk it with the family obstinacy he was determined on obtaining his birthright and if he set all london alight with scandal he was bent upon gaining his end the two men stared coolly at one another like two fencers but at the outset the buttons were off the foils i am sure you are not surprised to see me lord derrington said brendon with his eyes fixed on the old man's grim face not half so surprised as you were at seeing bawdsey said derrington not to be outdone in coolness george smiled i was not at all surprised at seeing the man he said calmly it was my happy lot to rescue him from an accident and it was my intention to call on him for what reason asked derrington who could not help betraying astonishment in spite of his self control you must excuse my not answering that question oh certainly replied lord derrington with ironical politeness but you are not so diplomatic as i thought because i decline a reply because you allow me to see that you are on good terms with the man i employ a clever diplomatist would have allowed me to think that bawdsey was hostile and so have used the man against me there is no need for me to stoop to such crooked ways said brendon with some scorn and i always find the truth tells in the long run ah you've never been an ambassador when i am i shall still tell the truth derrington smiled grimly oh then it is your intention to enter political life i think we discussed that fully the other evening derrington sat down and leaned his elbows on the table his temper was rising as he was not accustomed to be treated in this off hand way come sir let us understand one another state the situation so as to clear the ground for a proper argument certainly said george with frigid politeness you know who i am i understand no i don't so far as i know you are george brendon i met you at mrs ward's and and were good enough to hold a long conversation with me finished george smartly i see sir it is necessary for me to be explicit it's the best course rejoined derrington looking at him with hard eyes and secretly admiring his self control then i have to state that my name is george vane and that i am the son of percy vane and rosina lockwood indeed what proof have you of this the evidence of my nurse jane fraser who attended to me when my father your eldest son was alive the testimony of my former guardian mr ireland who took charge of me after the death of my mother's father finally my certificate of birth which i will show you whenever you choose derrington was confounded by this calm answer he would have blustered but george's politeness gave him no chance of losing his temper and without fuel it would not blaze up you seem to be well provided with proofs said he grimly let us admit for the sake of argument that you are my grandson but the marriage ah that is the difficult point and it is unpleasant for me to talk of the subject in justice to the memory of my mother i hold that there was a marriage and in justice to my family i hold that there was none in that case lord derrington we join issue you are quite a lawyer sir sneered the old man i thought of studying for the bar at one time indeed and why did you not i had no money to pay my fees said george coldly the old lord winced he could not but admire his pluck and aware that the young fellow was his own flesh and blood regretted that he should lack any chance of embarking on what promised to be a brilliant career you could have had money had you chosen said he roughly i know for that reason i changed my name to brendon well said derrington irritably let us come to the point you say you are my grandson i admit that as i am aware of what evidence you can bring forward but i decline to admit that you are my heir the onus of proof lies with you i am prepared to discover the proof if your lordship will behave in an honorable manner what roared derrington rising with a fierce look do you mean to say you jackanapes that i am behaving dishonorably extremely so said brendon coldly you have had me watched by a detective you threaten through him to have me arrested for a crime of which i am innocent if i do not give up my attempts to gain my birthright and here george leaned forward dorothy ward do you call these actions honorable how dare you how dare you was all that derrington could say you should know how i dare sir considering i am your grandson i'll have you thrown out of the house george rose i am willing to leave you sir if that is the tone you take but as to being thrown out that is quite another question do you know who i am questioned the other blustering very well you are the man who is keeping me out of my rights i am not i say you are the two faced one another without blenching derrington tried to cow george and george refused to be cowed it was the old lord's eyes which fell first brendon had youth as well as will on his side and these dominated derrington for the first time in his tyrannical life he gave way there is no need for you to go yet he grunted flinging himself into a seat i am willing to hear what you have to say brendon sat down also i don't think i have any more to say then why did you come here to ask you if you consider it honorable to threaten me i have already done so there is no more to be said on my part derrington dug a pen viciously into the blotting pad he did not know very well what to say had george sworn and blustered he might have been able to talk him down and to bully him into giving way but brendon was perfectly calm and polite he was not to be intimidated in any way and the ordinary methods would not do in this case derrington was reduced to reason what is it you wish i wish you to recognize my mother's marriage and to state that i am your heir anything else sneered derrington yes you will publicly recognize me you will allow me an income sufficient to maintain the dignity of my real name of george vane and you will order mrs ward to keep silent mrs ward what have i to do with her a great deal apparently you told her my story and as she does not want me to marry her daughter she will move heaven and earth to ruin me by using her knowledge how can she ruin you i think you understand sir the story told by my friend train friend judas rather no he is only a weak man who is as wax in the hands of a clever and pretty woman but mrs ward got sufficient out of him to place me in a somewhat perilous position were you in the room where the woman was murdered speak plainly i came on here purposely to speak plainly rejoined brendon dryly for your safety as well as for my own safety sir derrington grew crimson what the devil do you mean i mean that i can speak freely to you as i know perfectly well that for the honor of our family our family confound you our family repeated george of which some day i hope to be the head for its honor i say you will not take these matters into court i was in the room of mrs jersey i saw her dead and you know who killed her no i can't say that for certain george looked keenly at his grandfather the old man appeared uneasy suddenly brendon spoke i should like to know what you were doing in mrs jersey's house on the night she was murdered derrington dashed down his pen furiously and rose you go too far sir you go too far he roared not any further than you intended to go if you threaten me i have a right to protect myself in what way by telling you that if i am in a perilous position you are also do you mean to say that i murdered the woman by no means said brendon quickly i should not think of doing such a thing but i do say you were in that house after eleven i was not panted the old nobleman savagely and glared at his grandson with bloodshot eyes you were insisted brendon there is no need to tell you how i got out of my bedroom unbeknown to train but i did i came downstairs to see mrs jersey at half past eleven or thereabouts i crept down the stairs and saw you standing in the light of the hall lamp you had on a fur coat and i recognized you by your unusual height also by the color of your coat some months before you wore that coat it is a claret colored one trimmed with sable at a race meeting you were pointed out to me and it was the first time i had set eyes on you it was you in the hall did you see my face asked derrington no but the coat and the height and my knowledge that you were connected with mrs jersey i wasn't connected with the jade flashed out derrington she came to me years ago and said she could prove the marriage i tried to get out of her the name of the church where it took place she refused to give it and said if i did not pension her off she would go to your guardian ireland and get him to help her to prove that you were legitimate i hated your father sir and as to your mother no cried brendon rising not a word against my mother only this that she was not well born the daughter of a music master not the wife for my son she was his wife however leave my mother's name out of it and go on sir you say that mrs jersey could have proved the marriage yes growled derrington rather cowed by brendon's manner i did not wish her to do so for the reasons i have stated very unworthy reasons said george coldly you know nothing about it sir flamed out the old man slapping his hand on the table my family is as old as the conquest as the future head of it i am glad to hear that derrington looked as though he could have struck george who simply made the remark to punish him for his insolence never mind that said he controlling his temper i bought that house from your mother's father the music master he sneered and gave it to mrs jersey rent free i also allowed her an annuity she held her tongue for many years then she saw that confounded advertisement in the papers and threatened to tell you the truth on the chance of getting more money out of you when i was dead i refused and she then told me that she had written out a confession i thought as much interrupted george but that has been stolen by whom by the assassin and who is the assassin i can't say but if use is made of that confession either you or i will learn who killed mrs jersey why you or i because we alone can make use of the confession and pay money for it the thing would be no use to any one else but i now understand mrs jersey's possession of the house were you in it on that night derrington looked at brendon and hesitated then in strange contradiction to his usual manner he turned away his face i decline to answer that question he growled but i saw you insisted george you saw there is nothing more to be said hold your tongue willingly said george politely if you will silence mrs ward i have no influence with the woman oh i think so she wishes dorothy to marry my cousin your cousin can you deny the relationship derrington shirked the question by assenting to brendon's request i may be able to make mrs ward hold her tongue he growled i am quite sure she will do anything you tell her in the hope that you will approve of a match between my cousin and her daughter and you wish me to approve sneered the old man as to that it matters little mrs ward wishes dorothy to be lady derrington and to have your very excellent income whether she marries me or vane it comes to the same thing i can't understand mrs ward's dislike and mischief making since that is the case i can snapped derrington you are too clever for her and walter is a fool perhaps so however as i shall marry dorothy it doesn't much matter how can you marry her situated as you are i shall be george vane some day sir and then dorothy will be my wife i believe she will muttered derrington looking at the firm face of the young man humph so you intend to look for the certificate of marriage no for the confession of mrs jersey afterward for the church which will be mentioned in that confession the register will prove the marriage without the necessity of the certificate i shouldn't wonder though added brendon if mrs jersey had stolen that from my mother when she died mrs jersey was jade enough for anything said derrington well she is dead and there is no use saying bad about her how will you set to work to get that certificate george wrinkled his brows there is only one way sir i must find out who killed mrs jersey if you can help me i can't i know no more who murdered the woman than you do yet you were in the house on that night derrington grew wrathful don't talk rubbish sir if i was i should not mind admitting the fact as it is he broke off gnawing his lip and avoiding brendon's eyes that the old man knew something vital to the case brendon was certain that he would never confess what it was george felt perfectly sure he abandoned the point as he did not wish to make lord derrington incriminate himself and he might do so brendon was satisfied that he had seen him in the house on the night when mrs jersey was murdered there is no more to be said he remarked taking up his hat no except that i'll give you a fair chance of finding the church bawdsey shall watch you no more thank you and mrs ward she shall be made to hold her tongue george bowed i am obliged to you sir i now see that you intend to fight fairly good day and he departed derrington stood where he was in deep thought suddenly he struck a mighty blow on the desk by heaven he's a man after my own heart said the old scamp he shall be my heir he shall marry that girl but to exercise his wits he shall fight every inch of the way to attain his ambition chapter xiii a woman scorned dorothy was by no means of a jealous disposition moreover her love for george was so deep and pure that she trusted him entirely nevertheless having learned from the few words dropped by vane that brendon knew lola she felt desirous of seeing the woman that lola was her rival she never for one moment believed as she knew vane's malicious nature and evil tongue but the fact remained that brendon's name was coupled with that of the dancer and this incipient scandal annoyed miss ward there was no need for her to ask george why such a report should prevail for she knew that he would be able to explain in a satisfactory manner and trusting him already it was useless to demand details her feelings would remain the same after the telling of his story as they were now therefore she avoided the disagreeable subject nevertheless she was woman enough to desire a sight of lola and induced her mother to take her to the music hall mrs ward was very pleased to do so but she was too clever to hint that she guessed dorothy's reason for making this request certainly my dear she said briskly i am very glad that you are coming out of your shell men hate a woman who can't talk of everything and nothing is talked about but lola i must educate myself to please men then said dorothy dryly so i may as well begin with the dancer on what night can we go oh friday will do mr vane has invited us to dine at the cecil so i'll ask him to get us a box dorothy would rather have gone with any one than with mr vane as she disliked his feeble attempts at lovemaking however there was nothing for it but to accept since she had brought it on herself with a smile which encouraged her mother to think she would behave sensibly toward vane she agreed to the proposed dinner party and companionship and mrs ward wrote a note at once i hope when she sees lola and hears the stories about that brendon man that she may refuse to have anything more to do with him was mrs ward's remark as she sealed her note i don't want to get the brendon man into trouble by having him arrested for the murder and i don't think derrington would let me if i did wish it her last speech was prophetic for the next day lord derrington paid a visit to curzon street and had a short interview with mrs ward the gist of which was that she must hold her tongue brendon called to see me the other day explained derrington looking grim and he showed me plainly that he had nothing to do with the matter but how about the holly berry that is easily explained replied derrington who anticipating the question had prepared an answer brendon was one of the first to see the body and in touching it the berry fell from the sprig afterward mind you afterward mr train found the berry and not knowing that brendon had seen the body that morning thought he had been in the room on the previous night i'm sure he was insisted mrs ward you are sure of nothing of the sort brendon could not have got downstairs without the connivance of train and you heard what train said he is such a fool the more likely to tell the truth said derrington then he asked after a pause why did you tell dorothy to give the sprig of holly to brendon on that night mrs ward shrugged her shoulders and looked down nervously oh it was the merest kindness on my part she said trying to speak quietly derrington contradicted her at once it was nothing of the sort he declared with roughness you wished him to have the yellow holly in his coat when he saw mrs jersey so that the woman might betray herself i knew nothing about mrs jersey at the time oh but you did with regard to the holly you knew from me how it was used in connection with the death of my son at san remo and what i did not tell you you learned from other people mrs ward looked defiant well i did i am sure every one knew about the murder at the time she said and i met some old frumps who gave me all details i quite understand that but how did you know about mrs jersey that's my business cried mrs ward becoming imprudent you are right about the holly i sent to devonshire expressly to get some it was my intention to inclose a sprig in a letter to mrs jersey so as to frighten her what good would that have done my business again snapped mrs ward becoming bolder i had my reason for wishing to recall your son's death to her mind and i knew that the yellow holly would do so most successfully when dorothy came from the park and told me that brendon was to stop with his friend at mrs jersey's boarding house i thought that it would be better to let george wear the sprig and i managed it in such a way that neither dorothy nor george guessed how i planned the business and i succeeded mrs jersey saw the sprig and nearly fainted i knew then that here she stopped derrington saw that it was useless to question her further she would only lie and had been telling lies for all he knew moreover he did not think she could tell him anything pertinent to the case i shall ask you nothing more he said rising to take his leave you have some reason for all this intrigue i have no doubt what your intentions are matters little to me i came merely to warn you that brendon is to be left alone you won't have him arrested no and what is more i won't have him spoken about in connection with that crime mrs ward forgot her desire to conciliate derrington forgot her desire to marry vane to dorothy forgot everything in a sudden access of rage i shall do what i choose she cried no said derrington quietly and looking her full in the face you will obey me obey you lord derrington yes i have tried to conduct this interview quietly mrs ward and to hint that your wiser plan is to be silent but i don't want hints i wish for plain speaking raged the little woman how dare you address me like this the old gentleman leaned forward suddenly and whispered a short sentence in her ear mrs ward's face turned pearly white and she tottered to a chair closing her eyes as she fell into it derrington surveyed her with a pitiless expression you will be silent about brendon he asked yes moaned mrs ward i will say nothing when derrington departed mrs ward retired to bed after canceling her engagements for the evening for twenty four hours she stopped there explaining to dorothy that she was taking a rest cure it apparently did her good for on the evening of the day appointed for the meeting at the cecil she arose looking bright and quite herself again she had quite got over the fright given to her by derrington and when she saw him later treated him quite in her old manner on his side the old gentleman made no difference but he wondered how she was carrying herself so boldly at once it occurred to his suspicious mind that there was some reason for this defiant behavior and he determined to watch her for this purpose he joined the party it is the first time i have been to a music hall for years he explained to dorothy but walter has been talking so much about this new dancer that i felt i must see her why did you not dine with us at the cecil asked dorothy i always prefer to dine at home my dear young lady besides it does not do for an old man to wag his gray beard uninvited among the young meantime mrs ward was chatting amicably to vane and to a vapid war office clerk who had formed a fourth at the cecil dinner party he was a titled clerk and heir to great estates so mrs ward made much of him she was very diplomatic and never neglected younger sons one never knows but what they may be rich some day said mrs ward in explanation of her wisdom the box was large and easily held the party mrs ward had a position directly in front where she could see and be seen but dorothy kept herself behind the curtains she could see the stage excellently but did not wish to be recognized by any chance acquaintance in an opposite box sat a red haired man in immaculate evening dress derrington recognized him as bawdsey but did not think it necessary to show his recognition he sat at the back of the box between vane and the war office clerk and kept a watchful eye on mrs ward that little woman sparkled like a diamond she criticised the house admired the decorations and applauded the comic songs it might have been that this indifferent attitude was one of defiance as she must have known that derrington was watching her but she acted her part consummately and he could not help admiring her coolness what an admirable actress thought the old lord and what a dangerous woman the ballet of the bacchanals came at the end of the first part of the programme when the curtain rose dorothy was so anxious to behold lola that she leaned forward so as to show her face to the whole house bawdsey saw her and put his glass to his eyes he smiled slightly and derrington wondered why he did so but at that moment and while the stage was filling with dancers he arose to receive some newcomers these were none other than miss bull and margery for whom bawdsey had procured the box the little old maid was whiter than ever and wore her usual gray dress margery was smartly gowned in green and with her light hair and stupid red face looked anything but beautiful she placed herself in the best position being evidently directed to do so by miss bull for that lady preferred the shade at all events she secluded herself behind a curtain and kept her beady black eyes persistently on the stage on seeing that the two were comfortable bawdsey disappeared and did not return till the end of the ballet derrington saw all this but no one else in mrs ward's box took any notice and why should they bawdsey and his party were quite unknown to them the ballet was modeled closely on the lines laid down by euripides in his tragedy the opening scene was the market place of thebes and the stage was filled mostly with men pentheus the king is informed that the whole female population of the city together with his mother agave have gone to the mountains to worship a stranger the seer tiresias knows by his psychic powers that the stranger is none other than bacchus the god of wine and implores pentheus not to provoke his enmity the king spurns this advice and gives orders that the so called god shall be arrested it was at this moment that agav appears dorothy looked at her eagerly agav has not yet assumed her bacchanalian garb she is still in the quiet dress of a grecian matron but her gestures are wild and she is rapid in her movements in the dance which followed she is interrupted by pentheus who strives to calm her frenzy but agav knowing the god of wine is at hand becomes as one possessed bacchus appears and is arrested by pentheus he is chained and hurried into the palace agav warns the king against the impiety he is committing pentheus defies the gods there is a peal of thunder and the palace of pentheus sinks into ruins at the back appears the ruins of the city walls which have also fallen and on the summit of the heaped stones stands bacchus the god confest at a wave of his wand vines begin to clamber over the ruins and the cries of the bacchanalians are heard pentheus tries to seize the god again and darkness covers the stage the last thing seen was lola dancing in a wild red light with extravagant gestures dorothy could not say that lola was handsome but she had about her a wild grace which was very fascinating when dancing she seemed to think of nothing but the revels in which she was engaged she never cast a look at the house and dorothy noticed this she was therefore somewhat surprised when during the second scene she saw lola deliberately look in the direction of the box and stare at her piercingly for quite a moment or two rather confused by this sudden regard the girl drew back lola noticed her no more but continued to dance the second scene was the camp of the bacchanals where pentheus as a follower of the god comes to see the orgies it was a mountainous scene with a lurid red sky broken by masses of black clouds there is no need to describe the ballet in detail the frenzied dancers of the bacchanals seemed to send the audience wild there was something fierce and murderous about these orgiastic movements and through the wild throng darted lola in leopard skin and garlands bearing a cup of wine and flinging herself about in wild madness she appeared to be a devil and dorothy shrank back at the sight of her wild face the music also was terrible and excited the dancers to further efforts of madness it was a feast of witches a walpurgis night a revel of the earth powers there was nothing spiritual about this riot of the flesh the audience shuddered at the fierce rapture of the dancers at the alluring pain of the music at the reckless abandon of lola velez it's too awful murmured dorothy moving to the back of the box beside derrington that woman is a demon yet your friend mr brendon helped her to this position said the old man grimly i am sure he cannot approve of this dancing shuddered the girl who was very pale there is nothing improper about it said derrington no everything is right in that way but it is maddening and unholy and altogether terrible the music is something like that in tannhuser cruel evil voluptuous ah your poor spiritual nature shrinks from that sort of thing but mrs ward seems to enjoy it she certainly did craning forward so as to get a full view of the stage mrs ward's eyes were alight she would have enjoyed being in the throng herself and would have danced as madly as the worst of them and queerly enough miss bull appeared also spellbound her face was flushed her eyes glittered and her breath came and went in quick pants it's wonderful margery she said leaning out of the box and fixing her eyes intently on the whirling mass it's very pretty said margery stupidly her dull brain could not understand the wild madness of the scene and she was as unmoved as though she had been listening to a sermon dorothy dorothy whispered mrs ward come back to your seat lola juggles the head of pentheus it is the great dance no answered dorothy and clung to derrington's arm i will stop here it is too terrible the old man understood and in the darkness of the box he slipped his arm round her in that kind embrace dorothy felt safe if she looked upon that madness again she felt that she must cry out derrington quite appreciated her feelings it was the repulsion experienced by the spiritual against the material the action of the ballet proceeded rapidly pentheus climbed a tree the bacchanalians surrounded it and dragged him down lola emerged from a frantic crowd bearing his head then began the dance slowly at first with solemn pacings and stately gestures the limelights red and blue and green and yellow were flashed on the swaying form of lola as she eyed the head with terrible glances then the music flashed out into a wild galop the scene became pandemonium lightning flashed thunder rolled the violins shrieked in the orchestra the dancers spun whirled plunged and sprang and bounded and frantically rushed about the stage everywhere at unexpected moments lola appeared tossing smiting and caressing the head of pentheus whirling out and in as the rainbow lights played upon her restless figure finally when the orgy was at its height came a flash of lightning a crash of thunder the riot died away the bacchanalians sprang from the stage darkness descended the music sank to lulling tones and quiet silvery moonlight flooded the stage there alone in the center sat agav restored to her right mind weeping over the head of her son and on this scene of sorrow the curtain fell slowly to the strains of sweet music the audience drew long breaths and felt as though a nightmare were at an end let us go now said dorothy standing up and still clinging to derrington's arm i wish i had not come she was interrupted by an ejaculation from her mother mrs ward also was standing up but her eyes were fixed on miss bull the little old maid as though feeling the influence of that glance slowly looked in mrs ward's direction the eyes of the two women met from those of miss bull flashed a look of hate and she withdrew behind the curtain of the box mrs ward was white and shaking clutching vane's arm she requested to be taken to her carriage it is too much for me she said alluding to the ballet derrington stood on the pavement when the brougham rolled away bearing the mother and daughter both silent both pale he was alone as vane and the war office clerk were back again in the hall humph said derrington his eyes fixed on the retreating carriage so you know that little woman who called to see me about the lease i wonder how that comes about miss bull knew mrs jersey and you mrs ward sent that yellow holly i wonder the old man stopped he could not quite understand what mrs ward was doing but he repeated his former observation a dangerous woman said he i shall speak to bawdsey about her and making up his mind to this he went in search of the detective all that night dorothy was haunted by strange dreams in which the figure of lola played a prominent part usually calm and self possessed dorothy slept like a child but the fierce music the mad dancing the knowledge that george knew this terrible woman for so she appeared to the girl caused her to sleep brokenly she was up early and after a breakfast that was a mere farce she took her way to the park it was her usual custom to walk in a lonely part about eight o'clock in the morning but on this occasion she was at her usual spot by half past seven this was a seat under a spreading tree in the center of a wide lawn few people came there at so early an hour and dorothy often read for an hour before returning home in a mechanical manner she took a book out of her pocket it was the meditations of marcus aurelius and tried to fasten her attention on the soothing words of the stoic emperor but it was impossible before her inner vision passed the wild flushed face of lola velez and dorothy could not drive it away while endeavoring to do so some one came to sit on the seat dorothy rather surprised looked up she saw lola staring at her intently the dancer looked pale and worn about her there was none of the unholy influence of the previous night as the morning was cold she wore a sealskin coat and toque with a scarf of red silk twisted round her throat this touch of color was all that was about her likely to suggest her foreign origin with her pale face and piteous mouth and appealing eyes she looked like a broken hearted woman dorothy's first movement was to go away but when she saw the sorrow on that wild face she remained where she was the two gazed at one another for a time and the thought in the mind of each was the same both thought of george brendon lola began to speak without any preamble mr bawdsey pointed you to me at the last night she said in her imperfect english he declared you did walk early and i have been with my eye on your mansion since six hours what you call o'clock i see you come i follow you i am here mees vard i am here what do you want asked dorothy calmly her nerves much more under control than lola's were yet both were agitated ah cried the foreign woman throwing back her head give him to me i love him i worship him give him to me of whom do you speak mademoiselle ah mademoiselle so he speaks when angry but i am no french i am seora i am spanish i have warm blood here in my heart she struck her breast fiercely and if you take him from me i will kill you yes i will give you the death quick sure sudden her face drew near to dorothy's as she spoke and the girl could feel her hot breath on her cheek but dorothy had a brave heart of her own and did not flinch for all she knew lola might intend to stab her at the very minute the park keeper was some distance away and it was useless to create a scandal by calling him to her assistance lola was just the kind of mad creature to make a scene retaining control of herself though her heart was beating rapidly dorothy fixed her eyes firmly on those of lola sit a little further away she said and we will talk calmly are you not afraid asked lola surprised she had always found the savage attitude so effective dorothy laughed i was never afraid of anything or of any one in my life she said coolly and i am not going to begin now what do you want mademoiselle why do you threaten me bah cried the other but moving back a little as requested you know you blond white cat you it is george what about george he is mine he loves me you would take him from me if you are speaking of george brendon of who else should i speak you know ah you know yes i know i heard some rumors as to how he helped you but i do not believe for one moment that he loves you he does you dare ask that he loves i shall do nothing of the sort we may as well understand one another as you have no right to thrust yourself upon me i do do what i do please said lola sullenly these sorts of things are not allowed in england i am sorry for you and so i speak otherwise i should call the park keeper i want not any sorrow i do want my own george mr brendon is engaged to marry me said dorothy deliberately lola sprang to her feet with flashing eyes it will not be she almost shouted i love him sit down said dorothy much in the same tone as she would have used to a fractious child and lola resumed her seat immediately the woman was a creature of impulse had dorothy raged also she would have gained the ascendancy but this calmness to use a nautical simile took the wind out of her sails she could only do as she was told but i will have my george she muttered listen to me said dorothy quietly i have no right to answer your questions but i am sorry for you i will speak to mr brendon no lola looked up in terror you must not do that he will be very angry oh much much enraged then that shows me you have been speaking untruths mr brendon does not love you but i say yes yes yes lola sprang to her feet again and poured forth her wrath ah you think he will be milord and that you will marry him but what do you know about that asked dorothy rising indignantly oh i do know much much lola snapped her fingers yes i know that which i do know i can stop him from being milord and that i will i will if he is milord he will marry you you but as my own george he will make me me she struck her breast again me lola velez madame his wife you are talking nonsense said dorothy coolly though she felt annoyed and puzzled what can you know that which i do know wait oh wait a day one day two day three day and then she snapped her fingers you see yes you see how clever i am i go i go you white cat i go to get my george lola darted away at a run which slackened to a rapid walk as she neared the park gates dorothy sat down again too amazed to follow chapter xiv mrs ward's trump card kowlaski was a large fat good natured blackguard of a man quite without principle he came from some remote village in the balkans and was of jewish birth in his early days he arrived in london penniless and strove to make a living by selling toys in the street then he turned scene shifter at a music hall and while thus engaged educated himself to write and read and to speak english with wonderful fluency also he saved money and speculated in a small way having the marvelous hebrew instinct of picking out lucrative ventures shortly he became stage manager then he found a clever woman who sang badly and acted wonderfully kowlaski advertised her into a success and she proved grateful there is no need to trace his steady rise but one thing led to another until he became proprietor of the very music hall which had witnessed his humble beginning when he first set eyes on lola he had guessed that it would pay to invest money in her the success of the ballet proved that kowlaski was right as usual and he smiled his oily smile when he saw the crowded houses and looked over the receipts the ballet would run for more than a year he was sure of that and set about some other business now that the music hall was flourishing it was at this point that lola demanded a week's holiday kowlaski whimpered he usually did so to make people think he was weak but under his apparent weakness he was possessed of an iron strength having great experience of women he thought to control lola but she being gifted with a superlative temper laughed in his face all his cleverness could not make her swerve from the point i want a week to myself she said doggedly they were talking in french as kowlaski could swear more easily in that tongue and wanted freedom of speech but my dear child kowlaski was always paternal it will not do you are the draw and if you go out of the bill the people will not come to my house i don't care i want a week and a week i will have why do you wish for this week that's my business kowlaski tried temper if you go you leave my theater once and for all the time pschutt said lola snapping her fingers in his dismayed face i draw and you are in no hurry to get rid of me kowlaski tried reproaches if you were a grateful woman ah bah what of gratitude you wanted me or would you have seen me die in the gutter kowlaski began to whimper you will ruin me my dear it would serve you right if i did you have ruined others in your time don't you think i know you come she rapped on the table i want the week to morrow and till next wednesday i'm out of the bill but it cannot be done it must be i want it to be done kowlaski tried bribing i will raise your salary if you stay oh la la la la i am quite pleased with what i get if i wished my salary raised i should have it raised i go for a week in the face of this obstinacy kowlaski gave in but first of all he tried threats and lola threatened to throw a chair at him he finally agreed that she should have her week and lola walked out of the office without thanking him that was the last he saw of her for seven days he made the most of her absence declaring that she had been called away to nurse a dying mother and would reappear with a broken heart to keep her engagements with the public bawdsey saw this notice it was the first he had heard of lola's escapade and he went at once to her rooms in bloomsbury to ask where she was going lola had already gone and according to the landlady had left no information as to her whereabouts did she take a box asked bawdsey a small box she went away in a cab where did she tell the cabman to drive to to oxford street bawdsey was disappointed he saw that lola had taken every precaution to hide her trail and that there was not much chance of finding her however he went to see kowlaski the manager began to talk of the dying mother and bawdsey shut him up rubbish that's for the public i want to know where she is my dear i do not know said kowlaski and for the first time in his wicked old life he told the truth not to be beaten bawdsey sought out george brendon but george was as ignorant as the manager and the landlady i haven't the slightest idea he said when bawdsey asked and to tell you the truth i don't see why you should try to find out i want to know that is apparent on the face of it but you are not engaged to marry her are you mr bawdsey no such luck replied the detective with a dismal face then i don't see what right you have to control her movements did she write and tell you where she was going no and if she had done so i should not tell you replied george annoyed by the man's persistence you may as well be civil to me mr brendon you know that i am your friend oh i've heard all that before but people who talk much of friendship and gratitude are generally humbugs i am not said bawdsey quietly see here mr brendon lola is in love with you that's my business leave it alone bawdsey took up his hat oh very well if you will not be civil i cannot help you to learn who killed your father what george sprang from the table at which he was writing and seized the man's arm do you know that gently mr brendon no i do not know but then what do you mean by saying we had better have a chat said bawdsey and sat down but i wish to know where i stand lola loves you do you love her no said brendon seeing that he would have to humor the man i am engaged to marry miss ward will you help me to marry lola willingly though to tell you the truth i know very little about you and to make that girl marry you oh lola can look after herself mr brendon if she becomes my wife she will have the upper hand but i am so deeply in love with her that i am willing to play second fiddle can't you dispossess her of this infatuation for you george shook his head and groaned no she won't listen to reason well drawled bawdsey recurring to his american accent i don't blame her for that she is in love and love listens to no one and nothing i wouldn't listen to reason either if it entailed giving up lola see here bawdsey if you can persuade this woman to get over her liking for me and to marry you i shall be delighted i do not know where she is just now but it is my impression that she has gone away because she is afraid of me afraid of you oh that's absurd no it isn't the other morning she saw miss ward and there was a scene in the park bawdsey hung his red head i fear that is my fault he confessed i pointed out miss ward to lola and and it was i who foolishly mentioned that miss ward sometimes took a walk in the morning in the park oh said bawdsey i mentioned that also did you wish lola to see miss ward asked george angrily no nor did i intend to say anything about the walking in the early morning i simply pointed her out in the box to lola so that lola might see there was no chance of your marrying her as if any woman would accept such an excuse said brendon contemptuously then she questioned you about the walk yes she mentioned something about what you had told her and i was rather free with my tongue i am not usually said bawdsey penitently but there's something about lola that makes me behave like a child i'm wax in her hands so she saw miss ward yes and she knows that i am angry of course miss ward sent to tell me at once and i called on lola to give her a talking to but she was gone when i arrived would you have spoken harshly to her certainly she had no right to trouble miss ward but now you know why i think she has left town in a week she will come back thinking my anger is at an end and will it be asked bawdsey doubtfully it is at an end now i am quite content not to see lola again so long as she leaves miss ward alone i will try and keep her away said the detective but i have very little influence with her tell her i am angry and will be still more angry if she does not keep away from curzon street well we have discussed this matter i now want to hear what you meant by your reference to my father do you know who killed him bawdsey shook his head i can't say for certain but i can tell you who might know who is that mr roger ireland george looked astonished but that is ridiculous he said mr ireland told me that he did not know oh i don't say that he knows for certain but he is better acquainted with the matter than you think how did you come to know mr ireland he called to see miss bull and i dropped across him how did you get talking of the case well you see said bawdsey easily we naturally talked of mrs jersey and one thing led to another until i discovered that ireland had been in san remo when your father was murdered i wished to find out who killed him so i questioned mr ireland why do you wish to know who killed my father asked george because i think that the murder of mrs jersey is connected with that crime see here bawdsey cleared his throat mrs jersey was in san remo at the time of the death how do you know that don't i tell you i questioned mr ireland george looked sharply at the detective what magic did you use to make him talk mr ireland knows how to hold his tongue well when he found that i was looking after the case of mrs jersey and i made no secret of that he was good enough to tell me all he knew he thought as i did that the murder in san remo was connected with the crime of amelia square oh george wasn't at all satisfied as he could not conceive how bawdsey had induced ireland to talk however he thought it wise to say no more as he did not wish to make bawdsey angry and thus run a chance of losing his explanation go on there is nothing more to say said bawdsey rising mr ireland declined to tell me who he thought was guilty but he hinted that he had seen the lady in the blue domino unmasked did he recognize her i think he did but he assured me that he could not be sure and that he had not seen the lady again then he did know the face bawdsey's face assumed an impenetrable expression i can only refer you to mr ireland he said and as to lola oh she'll turn up again said brendon irritably don't worry me about lola i wish you would marry her and take her back to your native land what land am i native of mr brendon asked bawdsey calmly america i understand you hinted as much when we met bawdsey shook his head i am as english as you are he declared well said brendon with a shrug i thought as much your accent fails at times you are not a good actor bawdsey i may be a better actor than you think mr brendon what do you mean by that never you mind sir i can hold my tongue when it suits me and on this occasion it does suit me but remember mr brendon that whatever happens you have a friend in me what is going to happen bawdsey shook his head solemnly one never knows we are not out of the wood yet mr brendon are you referring to my father's murder and to mrs jersey's i have my suspicions and well there's nothing more to be said when i am certain i shall let you know you have your suspicions then yes but i shall not impart them to any one not even to you one moment bawdsey said brendon as the man had his hand on the door do you suspect miss bull why should i suspect her asked the detective in surprise because she was not on good terms with mrs jersey and you have taken up your abode in the house to watch her you would say well maybe rejoined the man composedly i know what i know and when i am more certain of what i know sir he nodded good day he said and went abruptly it struck george that bawdsey was a most mysterious person and knew far more about the san remo murder than derrington could have told him still it was possible that derrington had unbosomed himself to bawdsey and it was necessary to do so if he wanted the murder of mrs jersey cleared up and derrington from his refusal to admit that he was at the house on the night and about the time the crime was committed seemed to knew something that might lead to the detection of the assassin humph said george to himself when alone i have a great mind to go round and see that old man it seems to me that bawdsey is trying to serve two masters it is impossible that my grandfather can know the truth yet going by his height and figure and that sable claret colored coat he was certainly in the house on the night in question but it's none of my business he sat down again to his work and tried to interest himself in the chapter he was writing but it was all in vain bawdsey's speech and bawdsey's manner and a conviction that the man was playing his grandfather false kept recurring to his mind after an hour's futile work he threw down the pen in despair and went out to call on derrington on arriving at st giles square he saw a carriage at the door of the mansion on asking for lord derrington george was informed that his lordship was engaged with mrs ward and could see no one brendon turned away wondering that he had not recognized the carriage and he was still more vexed with himself when dorothy put her head out of the brougham and called to him my dearest he said softly so that the coachman and footman might not hear this is an unexpected pleasure why are you not inside my mother wished to see lord derrington alone replied dorothy i am waiting till she comes out she has been with him for half an hour i don't know what they are talking about it was at this moment that a message was brought out of the house from mrs ward saying that her daughter could drive home as she would not be disengaged for another hour dorothy looked puzzled i can't understand she said there is something wrong with my mother lord derrington came to see her one day and she has been upset ever since george shook his head he suspected mrs ward of knowing more than she chose to confess and based his suspicions on the fact of the yellow holly which she had given to dorothy to present to him she had made her daughter a cat's paw but why she should wish to startle mrs jersey with a reminder of the san remo murder was a thing george could not understand meanwhile he kept these suspicions to himself and made some excuse oh mrs ward and my grandfather are probably talking over my iniquities he said easily but i don't see why i should not take advantage of this chance what do you mean george asked dorothy with a becoming blush well here is the brougham and here you are why shouldn't we drive around the park before you go home my mother will be angry said dorothy hesitating then she blushed again but i shall brave her anger we have much to talk about as i wish to speak of lola velez dorothy you surely do not think no no but i want to ask you a few questions i believe she is mad george get in and we will drive round the park the order was given george seated himself beside his divinity and they drove away for a pleasant hour you see fate plays into our hands said george taking those of dorothy in his own and then the conversation became quite private and very very confidential meantime mrs ward was seated in a chair facing lord derrington the old gentleman looked savage but mrs ward was quite at her ease they had been having a war of words and mrs ward so far had come off best the conversation had been in reference to the sentence whispered in the little woman's ear when he had made her promise to hold her tongue about george of course i do think it is the meanest thing a man can do said mrs ward bitterly what if i did cheat at cards every woman does that and i was losing no end of money i don't think your friends would take that view said derrington grimly i came to hear of the matter quite by chance and it is plain that you won over a hundred pounds by cheating it's that horrid mrs wayflete who told you no if mrs wayflete knows she has held her tongue i learned it from a source of which you are ignorant but the fact remains you cheated and if your friends knew it you would be ostracized by all of them as if they did not do these things themselves retorted mrs ward but since you have been so nasty i intend to be nasty too i shouldn't advise you to be nasty to me mrs ward i have a large reserve fund of strength you'll need it all to hold your own against me lord derrington nodded i quite admit that you are a dangerous woman he said quietly well and in what way have you made up your mind to be nasty mrs ward laughed you needn't repeat my adjectives she said in her most frivolous manner if you want to know the way in which i intend to protect myself what do you mean by that i mean this cried the little woman growing angry all at once i am not going to be threatened about that unfortunate episode connected with the cards it was that horrid mrs wayflete who told you so don't deny it i am not going to be threatened without holding my own besides i want dorothy to marry your grandson which one asked derrington coolly you have only walter vane excuse me george brendon whether there is a marriage or not is equally my grandson i believe you admire him very much and it is in my mind to acknowledge him as my heir i thought as much after your sticking up for him the other day said mrs ward furiously now look here lord derrington if dorothy marries that brendon creature i won't be able to do a thing with her you know quite well i won't that means you won't be able to handle my money through george after i am dead said derrington grimly you can put it that way if you like but walter shall be dorothy's husband i have made up my mind because he's a fool and putty in your hands i shouldn't be vulgar if i were you said mrs ward in a dignified manner and quite forgetting that she had once used the same illustration herself in connection with brendon but so long as george leaves dorothy alone i shall say nothing that's really very good of you mrs ward your being nasty won't make me change my mind but you quite understand the situation lord derrington walter is to marry my daughter and george is to be kept away i don't see how he is to be kept away i assure you brendon is a strong man and his will is quite equal to mine nonsense you have the strongest will in london and you come here to try and break it life is a game said mrs ward leaning back with a pretty air of philosophy and at present i hold the trump card what is it asked derrington wondering by what means she hoped to make him consent to her demands i'll tell you presently said mrs ward in a most masterful tone which amused derrington but you understand that if george brendon doesn't keep away i shall give information to the police and have him arrested in connection with that murder oh no you won't said derrington good humoredly oh yes i shall as to your accusation about my having cheated you shall say nothing about that indeed i shall do so if you trouble brendon think of dorothy i do think of dorothy and i'm very sorry she has such a mother you dare to insult me began mrs ward when derrington who was losing patience cut her short i've had enough of this he said sharply you shall hold your tongue about brendon or i'll tell what i know then i'll do the same derrington bowed politely by all means he said my reputation is already so bad that a word or two from you can scarcely make it worse oh it's more than that said mrs ward quietly and she spoke in so positive a manner that derrington began to recollect his worst sins do you remember the night you came home here at one o'clock and found me in this very room yes you came with the amiable intention of telling me that george brendon was going to pass the night at mrs jersey's and that you suspected that he was up to mischief i took the trouble to come from a party for that very purpose was mrs ward's plaintive reply and how was i received i told you to mind your own business if i remember and you swore at me said the little woman as if a man who calls himself a gentleman mrs ward i am getting tired of this circumlocution what is it you have to say well on that night you were in a fir coat my usual coat in winter it was the night when mrs jersey was killed was it indeed i never noticed the coincidence no but you knew about it said mrs ward you threw your coat on yonder sofa i seated myself near it by chance there was something hard in the pocket of the coat when you were out of the room i took the something out there it is and she laid an italian stiletto on the table what is that asked derrington calmly but with an anxious face that said mrs ward touching it daintily with her finger is the weapon with which mrs jersey was stabbed chapter xv a recognition if mrs ward expected to startle derrington into a confession she was never more mistaken in her calculations lord derrington had not moved in diplomatic circles all his life without knowing how to guard against the display of emotion with an utterly expressionless face he looked at the stiletto it was a slender steel blade with a silver handle of renaissance workmanship evidently a valuable and curious relic of the middle ages it might have been made by cellini himself and have been worn by cesare borgia but derrington stared at it as though he knew nothing about it well said mrs ward sharply and rather disappointed he did not grovel on the instant what do you say derrington looked at her in rather a humorous manner what do you want me to say he asked confess that i killed mrs jersey and then brought this weapon carefully home in my pocket for you to discover and use against me that is a subterfuge said mrs ward you did not expect to find me waiting for you and you never meant that dagger to be discovered lord derrington i certainly never did he assented heartily i cannot imagine how you came to know more than i did what do you mean asked the little woman sharply well you see said lord derrington quietly this is a very clever bit of business on your part but so far as i am concerned it has nothing to do with me i never saw that weapon before oh that's rubbish said mrs ward with a mirthless laugh i found it in the pocket of your fur coat on the very you say you found it there said derrington meaningly do you deny that it was in the pocket certainly had it been in the pocket i should have known it was there but it was not in the pocket mrs ward stared you are very brazen she said you knew it was there all the time in the pocket asked derrington politely and perfectly calm mrs ward hesitated then she faced him defiantly i am so sure of my ground she declared that i don't mind saying it wasn't exactly in the pocket there was a hole in the pocket and the dagger had slipped down into the lining between the inside fur and the outer cloth it lay sideways and what with its position and the heavy fur i could not have known it was there finished derrington balancing a paper cutter on his forefinger you have found a mare's nest my dear mrs ward and if this is your trump card i am sorry to say it won't take the trick you wish to secure i did not know that this he touched the stiletto was in the lining of my fur coat then it was and mrs jersey was stabbed with it isn't that taking a great deal for granted said derrington with raised brows mrs jersey according to the doctor if i recall the report of the inquest rightly was certainly stabbed with a weapon similar to this but why do you say this is the one because i believe you were in the house on that night which house be explicit please mrs ward was growing angry at this calm defiance in the house in amelia square you went there to prevent that brendon creature from making mrs jersey confess lord derrington laughed you would not make a good lawyer said he by your own showing i did not know that brendon was to be at mrs jersey's on that night i certainly came to tell you said mrs ward feeling that she had missed a point but you could easily have heard it elsewhere who from brendon did not advertise in the papers that he was stopping with mrs jersey on the night in question then mr train i met mr train for the first time at your house the other night dorothy told you said mrs ward determined not to surrender any advantage she might have gained you can ask your daughter and she will tell you that i had not seen her all that week is there any one else mrs ward the little woman rose to her feet with an artificial laugh and shook out perfume from her silken skirts you are very clever and obstinate lord derrington but how will you explain this she pointed to the stiletto to the authorities there will be no need for me to do that said derrington and took up the weapon mrs ward stretched out her hand my property if you please lord derrington the old gentleman opened a drawer dropped the weapon into it and closed the drawer with a snap it's locked now he said coolly i shall take charge of this how dare you i insist oh dear no you insist on nothing lord derrington rose looking like a giant as he towered over the little woman my dear mrs ward said he quietly but in his deepest tones i have been very patient with you but this thing must end you must promise to hold your tongue about brendon and and about you i suppose she sneered about me derrington's tone expressed surprise what have you to hold your tongue about as regards me mrs ward stamped though as a rule she was not given to betraying violent emotion oh it's too ridiculous she said furiously i can say to the police how i found the stiletto in your coat i suppose i should advise you not to talk to any one about a thing which exists only in your imagination the stiletto what are you talking of mrs ward it's in that drawer she pointed to the table oh dear no it isn't said derrington blandly there is no stiletto there never was one we have had a nice talk shall we say about chiffons in spite of her rage at being outwitted mrs ward gave a hollow laugh at the thought of lord derrington discussing chiffons a nice talk i say and now we must part not before i have had my say said mrs ward savagely i see perfectly well that i have been foolish to let that stiletto get into your hands but i thought i was dealing with a man of honor ah mrs ward few of us can aspire to your high principles the sneer infuriated her you can deny the stiletto if you like to the public but you dare not do so to me why not for the sake of argument we will admit the existence of the weapon you come here with it in your hand and state that you found it in my coat in the lining of the coat and i did i did you know i did indeed i know nothing of the sort i deny that the stiletto was ever in pocket or in lining i did not see you take it out i waited till you were out of the room before i examined the coat of course but by doing so you have defeated your own object had you produced the weapon from the coat and showed it to me at the very moment your accusation might have held water as it is the thing is simply ridiculous you come here you accuse me of a crime i did not accuse you said mrs ward beginning to find that derrington was too much even for her i believe brendon killed the woman oh yes you went to the house and you saw him he and mrs jersey had words as she would not confess and brendon killed her with the stiletto then you came in and to save him you put the dagger into your pocket sent him up to bed and promised to hold your tongue and derrington laughed you have a most vivid imagination mrs ward he said with a shrug but as it happens you are talking nonsense i was not at amelia square that evening but at my club as any member then present can assure you i can prove what is called an alibi mrs ward which means that i can account for every moment of my time from the minute i left this house to the minute i returned to find you here as to the stiletto you say you took out of my pocket that is rubbish on the whole i think you had better hold your tongue if i go to the police they will open that drawer oh no an englishman's house is his castle you know and a man in my position cannot be treated in the way you suggest with impunity moreover mrs ward there is ample time to destroy the stiletto which you will do she said recovering her composure now that she found it was useless to protest no i wouldn't even mind showing it to the police and saying how you brought it here with an accusation if the police can prove that this is the weapon with which mrs jersey was stabbed and if you and the police can prove that the stiletto was in my pocket on the night of the murder then you and the police derrington made an ironical bow are extremely clever oh very well said mrs ward realizing her defeat i shall say nothing about you but brendon you will hold your tongue about him also i quite understand how you proposed to hold this stiletto and the tale of its being discovered in my pocket over me if i did not consent to the marriage of miss ward and walter eh i must do the best for my child even going so far as threats well i have too high a respect for miss ward to ask her to marry such a worm as walter she would do better to take brendon she shan't marry him why do you hate the man so asked derrington looking into her eyes i know he is a strong man and for the money's sake you do not want him to be your son in law but even this does not account for your hatred why do you hate him i have nothing to say retorted mrs ward who had flushed and paled alternately during this speech please see me to the door derrington walked to the door and opened it with a bow willingly i think we understand one another i think we do said mrs ward with an artificial laugh you do credit to your reputation lord derrington praise from mrs ward is praise indeed said the ironical old gentleman as he descended the stairs side by side with the woman who could have found it in her heart to kill him i am sorry to ask you to leave me so soon as our conversation was most enjoyable but i have to see a certain mr ireland is that brendon's guardian asked mrs ward coming to a sudden stop in the hall his former guardian corrected derrington how do you come to know of him mrs ward i think dorothy mentioned the name she said in rather a faltering tone dear me how my face burns i wish i had a veil i am sorry mrs ward but the late lady derrington's veils are not modern enough for you what nonsense said mrs ward who appeared flurried please tell your man to call a cab i sent away the carriage let me send you home in mine no no i want to go at once and she approached the door quickly when did you say mr ireland was coming derrington glanced at his watch he is due now he said and looked at her wondering why she asked the question mrs ward's face was turned away she was dressed in furs and carried a muff when the door was opened by the footman a gentleman appeared on the threshold mrs ward lifted her muff to her face but not before the stranger had caught sight of her face and had uttered an ejaculation of surprise you he said stepping forward what do you mean said mrs ward with her face still hidden lord derrington this friend of yours is making a mistake tell that man to be quick calling a cab and she moved past the stranger pardon he said politely but i wish to speak with you derrington bent his bushy brows let the lady pass he said who are you sir to stop the egress of my guests my name is rodger ireland said the stranger quietly and i have been looking for that lady for over thirty years what does the man mean asked mrs ward haughtily but looking disturbed lord derrington said ireland i think if you will permit this lady and me to have a talk there seems to be some mistake said derrington mrs ward will you not wait until we rectify it no the man is mad let me pass sir there is the cab she would have stepped out but ireland again placed his bulky form in her way it was all done so tactfully that the footman on the pavement did not notice anything unusual the man was waiting by the cab to assist mrs ward in but ireland would not let her pass lord derrington he said softly lest the footman should overhear this is the lady who was with your son when he was murdered derrington was not easily startled but he turned suddenly white mrs ward shrank back into the hall now that the truth was told she seemed to recover from her fears and to regain all her tact i shall not want the cab at present she said to the footman tell the man to wait lord derrington if you do not wish these private affairs to be discussed in the presence of the servants we had better return to the library lord derrington could only stare being confounded at her coolness he was much moved by the unexpected mention of his dead son and without a word went up the stairs again while mrs ward followed and ireland came at her heels she looked as though she were a prisoner between two guards when they found themselves in the library derrington closed the door and went to his seat he looked much older having aged in a most extraordinary manner under the shock of ireland's information mrs ward was perfectly cool and resumed her former seat as to ireland he let himself carefully down into the most capacious armchair he could find mrs ward opened the conversation at once you say you saw me at san remo she asked i did replied ireland in his heavy voice i was there at the time mr percy vane was murdered derrington groaned and i was at the masked ball where the veglioni said mrs ward well you were there you say you saw me in a blue domino there were plenty of blue dominoes at that ball at least i should think there were yes but you wore a sprig of yellow holly that was why i recognized you when you were masked how did you know it was i because early in the evening you went into a box i was there talking to the marchesa beltrami to whom the box belonged you removed your mask and i had ample opportunity to observe you what reason had you to observe me asked mrs ward just as though she were counsel examining a witness well said ireland smoothing his face you see i knew mr vane very well he married a woman of whom i was fond derrington shifted restlessly in his chair do not be afraid lord derrington i do not intend to talk of rosina lockwood you are talking to me at present said mrs ward sharply you can talk to lord derrington later i rather think ma'am said ireland that lord derrington will want to talk to you at present i say nothing was his lordship's reply and he watched the two faces before him with close attention you saw me unmask in a certain box said mrs ward quickly do you mean to say that after all these years over thirty years that you recognize me again i was a girl then i am a a she was about to say old woman as being more emphatic with the adjective but her vanity made her swallow the word i am a woman now quite so but you have a mole on your forehead just above the left eyebrow i knew you by that and then i have a splendid memory for faces and yours ireland bowed gallantly is too beautiful to forget easily mrs ward shrugged her shoulders she did not want compliments but she wished very much to get out of the trouble in which she found herself involved it's a most remarkable memory she said it is madam assented ireland my memory was always considered remarkable and the fact is that i was thinking of the murder almost at the moment i entered the hall consequently your face was in my mind's eye that made the chance of recognizing you more sure had i not been thinking of old days i might not have guessed so readily who you were why were you thinking of the murder then asked derrington well my lord you sent for me to speak with me about george mrs ward gave a short laugh and derrington smiled so i was naturally thinking of george such a thought led to my thinking of his parents and finally i remembered the circumstance of your son's death as i thought you might wish to talk of it and therefore desired to get my memory in order in this way did i recognize the lady this is all very well said mrs ward you say you recognize me mr ireland is that your name it is but your memory is not so good as mine we met only once derrington was not so sure if mrs ward's memory was not good for he remembered how she had tried to get away before the arrival of ireland go on go on he said irritably i wish to know the worst the worst is that i am supposed to have killed percy vane said mrs ward coolly so you accuse me of that she asked ireland by no means but you were at that ball i was in a blue domino with a sprig of holly at my breast and you were with mr vane no i was not you went out with mr vane i did not it was my sister your sister said derrington hah and he relapsed into silence mrs ward shot a suspicious look at him but his inscrutable face betrayed nothing i remember said ireland in a slow prosy way that there were two miss howards at san remo at the hotel d'angleterre they were with their father general howard i never met them but mr vane went frequently to call at the house he did said mrs ward if by house you mean the hotel the fact is my sister jenny was in love with captain vane i heard it was you said ireland distrustfully it was my sister said mrs ward coldly we thought mr vane would marry her but he certainly showed no signs of proposing i suppose he was too fond of his dead wife and she shot a sneering look at lord derrington who winced don't say a word against rosina lockwood said ireland quickly you see what he calls her said mrs ward to derrington there was no marriage ma'am cried ireland rising oh never mind replied mrs ward waving her hand there is no need for you to lose your temper my good man i am not going to speak of the woman she was an angel and a woman that's the generic name for the sex however it was my sister jenny who loved percy vane she would go to the ball and persuaded me to go with her we slipped out of the hotel and went without a chaperon our father would have been shocked had he known but it was merely the escapade of two schoolgirls i went with a friend and jenny looked about for mr vane we agreed to meet after an hour and go home as there were other blue dominoes at the ball we each wore and mrs ward repeated the word to emphasize the fact each a sprig of yellow holly i went to a box to have supper with a certain cousin of mine and my sister then departed with mr vane why did she leave the ballroom asked derrington because mr vane was shocked he recognized her voice and made her unmask he insisted on taking her home first and then intended to return for me as he could not find me at the moment they went out together mr ireland and that is the last i saw of mr vane what was the last your sister saw of him she was at the hotel and in our bedroom when i returned which i did after looking vainly for her she said that mr vane had escorted her to the hotel and had left her at the gate at her earnest request as jenny was so afraid lest my father should hear of our escapade she said good night to mr vane and then went to her room when we heard of the murder next morning she became very ill and my father took her away but she always declared to me that she did not know who murdered percy vane did your father ever know that she was in vane's company on that night asked ireland never we kept our folly a profound secret from him did any one else know you did said mrs ward sharply and mr vane did and a servant at the hotel an english servant who attended to us in fact it was she who procured the yellow holly by which jenny and i were to identify one another what was her name asked derrington quickly and raising himself in his chair with eagerness to hear the answer eliza stokes ah i thought so mrs jersey yes mrs jersey and now lord derrington you know how i come to take such an interest in the death of that woman yes but i cannot understand how you came to know that mrs jersey was eliza stokes that's my business flashed out mrs ward or why pursued derrington unmoved why you sent her the yellow holly because i was not quite positive if she really was eliza stokes i thought that the yellow holly being connected in her mind with the death of mr vane would make her betray herself it did in a way but to brendon he would not have told you he would doubtless have told dorothy and she would have told me ireland in his thoughtful ponderous way turned this matter over in his own mind where is your sister now he asked mrs ward replied with some reserve i can't tell you that she went out of her mind for a time after the murder of mr vane and after she came out of the asylum we were all afraid to live with her my father put her under some one's charge and when he died she was allowed an annuity her guardian died and my sister vanished we made no attempt to find her and it was supposed that she had put an end to herself ireland looked at derrington did you ever meet miss jenny howard my lord he asked no said derrington but i have known mrs ward for many many years quite twenty said mrs ward with an artificial laugh we grow old no mr ireland lord derrington never met my sister why you ask i cannot conceive because lord derrington is under a wrong impression he has met your sister and in this very room i beg your pardon began derrington i ireland cut him short she called to see you here about the renewal of the amelia square lease miss bull said his lordship i thought there was something familiar about her face so miss bull is mrs ward's sister she told me so herself was ireland's reply chapter xvi the pipe of peace brendon was much astonished a day or two later to receive an invitation to dine with his grandfather after the somewhat stormy interview he had participated in with the old tyrant george certainly never expected to be treated well by the man whose path he had crossed he had heard many tales of derrington's pride and of his relentless pursuit of those whom he conceived had done him wrong as george had fought the old man with his own weapons and had come off victor he did not expect to be pardoned but in this he was wrong derrington sickened with walter's milk and water ways saw in brendon a worthy successor who would be able to hold his own in will and word and would shed fresh luster on the house had george been polite and what the old lord sneeringly called cringing he would never have received the invitation as it was derrington took him to his hard old heart he chuckled to think of walter's dismay when he heard that he had an elder cousin and would not be likely to inherit the title or the money however astonished brendon was too much a man of the world to reveal his feelings on the evening in question he presented himself at the mansion in st giles square scrupulously groomed and brushed derrington looked approvingly on his dress which set off a handsome figure to advantage also the haughty bearing of brendon pleased him and he unbent so far as to advance to george with outstretched hand we had rather a rough interview george he said so i have invited you to smoke the pipe of peace brendon shook the old man's hand quietly but without much enthusiasm he could not conjecture what derrington meant by behaving in a way so different to that he usually adopted his host felt the slack hand clasp and winced on seeing the want of response in brendon's face queerly enough derrington contrary to accepted opinion had a heart and was so much taken with george that he wished to draw him to himself still he could not but admit that seeing how he had treated the young fellow in the past it was not to be expected that brendon would act the part of an affectionate relative immediately derrington rather admired george for his uncompromising attitude dinner will be ready soon said the old lord waving brendon to a seat only our two selves i wish to consult you consult me george could not keep the astonishment out of his face it's rather late in the day is it not remarked derrington dryly but you see i am old george and have not much time to spare yes i wish you to consult with me after dinner about but that can come in the course of our conversation meantime let us talk of anything you like the weather sir no confound you snapped derrington with a flash of his old irritable self talk of wine wit and women if you like but spare me platitudes brendon stared at his shoes and smiled under his mustache i do not think i can say anything very original about the subjects you mention he said quietly talk of miss ward then you can be original on that point brendon would rather not have mentioned dorothy but he was quite determined to show his grandfather that he fully intended to marry his lady love and that he was not afraid to speak his mind i do not fancy that there is anything particularly original in a love story i met miss ward some three years before i have loved her ever since and we will marry when there there interrupted derrington waving his hand let us not get on to that subject as yet we can talk of it after dinner in fact you may as well know that i asked you here to discuss your position we must have an understanding i think you must intend it to be a pleasant one said brendon as you have asked me to dinner and to smoke the pipe of peace there's the gong heigh ho he rose rather sluggishly gout is stiffening my limbs it struck brendon that his grandfather looked old and very haggard he had lost his fresh color his eyes were sunken and the defiant curl was out of his enormous mustache he moved slowly toward the door and george felt sorry to see him so lonely he knew that derrington hated all his relatives and that his relatives cordially hated him so there was none to comfort the old man in his declining years walter vane was less than nothing as his mere presence served to irritate his grandfather moved by a sudden impulse george made no remark but moved to the elder man's side and offered his arm the footman was holding the door open and derrington could not express even by a look the satisfaction he felt with a surly grunt he took brendon's arm but george guessed by the warm pressure that derrington was pleased that simple kindly movement served to draw the two men closer together and they sat down to an excellent dinner in good spirits it was quite a banquet for derrington lived in a most expensive manner and in spite of a sadly diminished income he would never abate the splendor of the style in which he had lived all his life the table was a round one laid with exquisite taste and was placed under a kind of velvet tent which shut off the rest of the room and made the meal particularly cosy george who had a taste for art admired the finish of the silver the beauty of the crown derby service the glitter of the cut glass which was unusually massive and the adornments of the table it was a perfect little banquet and after the somewhat stale food of his lodgings george enjoyed the meal greatly derrington himself did not eat much but he took great pleasure in seeing george enjoy his viands i had a fine appetite myself once he observed you have inherited it from me never be ashamed to eat george it means good work the man who starves himself starves his public you mean in the quality of his work sir of course poor living means poor thoughts well said brendon with a smile i don't think rich living means rich thoughts certainly not whoever said it did remember the saying of the greeks and egad they were the only people who ever knew how to live what saying is that asked george moderation is the corner stone of dissipation ah that's good sir but were the greeks ever dissipated no because they followed the advice of that epigram george if you expect me to explain epigrams i shall lose my respect for you have you any sir you wouldn't be here if i had not said derrington pulling his huge mustache there's your cousin walter my cousin sir of course you know that george thought it wiser to say nothing although it was strange that derrington should mention the relationship himself the old man gave him a quick glance and continued as i say there is your cousin walter i wouldn't ask him to dinner on any account he's a fool sir he means well if there is one class of people i hate more than another it is that pharisaic lot who mean well they make all the mischief with the best intentions put in brendon taking some wine best intentions are fatal how many plans have come to naught because of best intentions take some of that port no more thank you sir i insist there are walnuts i don't mind the nuts but the port george shook his head derrington at his own table was too polite to press the matter but he scored up another victory to brendon's strong will more he passed off the matter with a laugh you have the hereditary gout i see george when you are afraid of a glass of port it's not that sir but i drink very little i work on milk bah derrington made a wry face then your work is all the better for it those who drink beer think beer and those who drink milk think cows i should say your knowledge on that point prevents contradiction on mine derrington chuckled this was just the kind of epigrammatic reply he relished you must enter the diplomatic service sir said he looking approvingly from under his bushy brows don't you think i'm rather old brains are never old sir and you have 'em it's what the diplomatic service in this country requires and what it never gets i was in the service myself at one time so i have heard said brendon cracking nuts composedly eh what did you hear you must excuse me at your own table sir pooh if you want to say anything disagreeable my own table is the safest place you can say it at i can't throw things at you still a guest must be polite argued george i like my guests to be truthful very well sir if you will have it and i feel that it would be bad manners to refuse your request it is said that you nearly set europe by the ears when you were ambassador derrington roared i did i did and i wish i had brought about the war i wanted it would have done no end of good does war ever do good asked brendon doubtfully certainly it stirs up things and teaches men how to use their hands and brains without war there is too much wrapping up in cotton wool don't tell me george that you aren't a soldier at heart for nearly all your ancestors fought for their country and fought their country also i believe when they didn't get their rights said derrington grimly i have been a fighter myself all my life and i've held my own so they say sir and i admire you for it hah very good of you i'm sure said derrington ironically but in my old age i can't hold my own so i have to call in you george looked surprised do you intend to do me the honor to ask for my advice sir bless my soul are you also without understanding sir didn't i say so when you first came of course i forgot you shouldn't forget though it's useful at times to do so in what cases sir forget a woman's age forget to talk about yourself and forget your relations if you can come he added seeing george laughing the wine and food have thawed you there's coffee in the library and we can talk over our cigars up i get george your arm he not only asked for it but took it with marked pleasure the footman in attendance returned to the servants' hall to state that the old devil the domestic name for derrington had quite taken to the new young gentleman had the servants known who george was they would have had a long gossip as it was they simply said that the old devil was always taking fancies and soon grew tired meanwhile brendon was seated in a comfortable chair enjoying one of the best cigars he had ever placed between his lips at his elbow smoked a cup of mocha and in the chair on the other side of a roaring fire of sea timber smiled lord derrington he looked a grim and determined old gentleman as he bent his shaggy brows on his grandson he was becoming more and more delighted with the young man i shall have a prop for my old age at last he thought damme he's a fine fellow ah youth youth george was very comfortable and also felt grateful for the kindness which his grandfather was showing him at the same time he felt as though he were acting wrongly in hobnobbing with a man who persistently blackened his mother's memory but brendon thought he saw signs of repentance in derrington and wished to improve the situation if he could it was difficult for him to quite forgive the old rascal but he was sorry for his loneliness and haggard looks besides george was a christian in more than merely going to church on sunday i suppose you wondered when you received my invitation said derrington in his hardest tone i did sir i wondered very much and you felt inclined to refuse i had almost made up my mind to why did you change your mind george pondered and looked again at his neat shoes well sir said he after a pause i thought that after a dinner we might come to understand each other better and i am anxious for peace and for recognition of your birth naturally the one included the other does that mean you will fight till you get what you want yes said george curtly and then closed his lips with a firm determination to give battle if necessary at the same time he felt it was rather awkward after eating derrington's food a sudden impulse made him rise what's the matter now asked derrington not moving well sir burst out brendon with a candor unusual in him i have a feeling that we are going to quarrel and in your own house and after that very excellent dinner i don't want to behave rudely it will be better to postpone this talk to some other time not a bit of it said derrington quietly we are relatives and quarrels between relatives do not count sit down i have something important to say to you george sat down and prepared for the worst we'll leave the question of your birth alone for the present said the elder in a hard tone at this moment i wish to talk of mrs jersey's death yes said brendon looking down also about your father's death what has that to do with this sir i believe the one is connected with the other george remembered what bawdsey had said i've heard that remark before he observed of course that detective i employed to watch you made it he did i think you trust that man too much sir said brendon after a pause do you i thought he was a friend of yours oh george shrugged his shoulders i saved his life but that does not constitute friendship i would fight a man who saved my life said derrington grimly well sir i don't think bawdsey is worthy of your confidence i know he isn't but you see i can't help myself george looked up quickly blackmail something of that sort i intend to trust my own flesh and blood that is i intend to tell you all i know connected with the jersey case and ask you to help me to get the better of bawdsey i shall do my best sir willingly assuredly sir derrington was rather moved i have not behaved well george that's true enough sir said george who was not going to be weak but you can make amends by acknowledging that my mother was an honest woman i believe she was george for none but an honest woman could have borne a son like you but you see i know no more than you do where the marriage took place do you acknowledge that there was a marriage said george starting to his feet derrington rose also and the tall men faced one another then the elder placed his hands on the shoulders of the younger with a look on his face which brendon had never seen before and certainly the look was new to derrington my boy said he i am sure there was a marriage i am sure that you are my legitimate heir and by heavens i intend to acknowledge you as such before the week's out brendon was so moved by this sudden recognition of all he longed for that a sudden weakness seized him and he sat down covering his face with his hand derrington thought the young man did so to conceal his tears but in reality george was putting up a short thanksgiving for this wonderful and bloodless victory his grandfather again touched his shoulder my boy he said again and his voice was broken with emotion i have behaved badly i ask your pardon george put out his hand blindly and grasped that of his grandfather when it was once in the old man's grip he raised his grandson with a jerk and made him look him in the face you forgive me he asked with all my heart and soul said brendon quietly and after another handshake they resumed their seats the scene which both had dreaded was over and now they sat like two friends who had known each other for years george felt that as derrington had done justice to the memory of his mother and derrington was pleased to feel that he now had a grandson and heir worthy of his name i can marry dorothy now said brendon with a contented sigh if my influence can help you yes derrington paused and shook his head but there is a lioness in the path george mrs ward exactly she will move heaven and earth to prevent the marriage george looked puzzled i see no reason why she should oppose it if i am acknowledged as your heir nor do i i thought myself that it was simply the money she wanted and if you were the son in law she would not get her claws on the gold but there is more in it than that she seeks revenge on me i have never harmed her it's a vicarious revenge i believed that woman loved your father george and that he slighted her that is why she wants to visit his sin as with a vindictive spirit she may regard it on you did mrs ward know my father sir asked george quickly yes she met him at san remo then she knew he was murdered of course i saw mrs ward the other day george she came here to force me to harm you and to consent to walter marrying dorothy oh you never agreed to that i have answered her challenge by asking you to dinner and will acknowledge you my heir mrs ward will then try and make mischief can she do so yes she knows that i was in mrs jersey's house on that night and you were sir derrington made a most unexpected reply no i was not chapter xvii lord derrington explains george was rather puzzled to reconcile the apparent contradiction in derrington's speech the old gentleman saw his bewilderment and before the young man could speak he anticipated his question you are perplexed he said quietly i thought you would be to explain myself clearly it will be better to tell you the whole story from the beginning what story the story of your mother's marriage and of my quarrel with your father do not be afraid i shall say nothing to hurt your pride george nodded i am sure of that we are friends now derrington was much gratified by this speech but he merely acknowledged it with a grunt and began his family history at once your father and i never got on well he said frankly and i fear it was my fault i wanted percy to obey me implicitly and as he was of an age to judge for himself he objected you would have done the like in his case i certainly should sir every man should judge for himself if he has brains to do so but i fear percy was not overburdened with brains he was gay and thoughtless and thriftless your talents george come from your mother she must have been a remarkable woman so mr ireland says pooh he was in love with her and a man in love is incapable of giving an opinion however i saw your mother several times when she sang although i never met her to speak to she was very beautiful and had an intellectual face yes george it is from her that you inherit your brain from my side of the family you inherit a strong will and a propensity to fight there is irish blood in our veins said derrington grimly was my father a fighter in a way yes but he had not a strong will save in resisting me george smiled and said nothing but he privately thought that if mr percy vane could hold his own against derrington he must have had a stronger will than the old gentleman gave him credit for however to continue pursued derrington pushing away his empty cup percy saw miss lockwood he fell in love with her and finally he eloped i wrote him a letter saying he was to return or i would never see him again he declined to return and remained on the continent with his wife i never did see him again added derrington quietly for three years later he was murdered at san remo in his letter to you did my father say he was married he did but at the time as he did not say where the marriage was celebrated i thought he mentioned it out of obstinacy george colored i don't see why you should have so misjudged my mother he said hotly admitting that she was not born in the purple she was in a good position and had no reason to run away with my father she was in love with him i believe even then she would not have eloped unless it was to be married derrington nodded you are perfectly right he said i tried to disbelieve in the marriage but in my own heart i knew there was one i have behaved very badly george you have sir but as we are now reconciled the less said about the thing the better you are quite sure you do not know where the marriage was celebrated no george i do not after the death of your father i tried to find out but it was impossible had i really seen the register of the marriage i should have acknowledged you as my heir as a matter of fact added derrington with a burst of candor i did not trouble much to search as i feared lest the marriage should be verified george wriggled in his seat let us say no more he said very good i have confessed my sins and i have received absolution from you at the present moment we will leave the murder of your father at san remo alone and come to the appearance of mrs jersey in my life you were with your grandfather lockwood in amelia square i had constituted my second son my heir and i had relegated to obscurity the escapade of my son percy all was nicely settled in my humble opinion when mrs jersey appeared to make trouble that was eight years after your father's death where was she in the mean time i cannot say she told me nothing of her history but from a word or two which she let slip i believe she must have been in the united states why she went there from san remo or for what reason i cannot say she came here to see me we had an interview in this very room to demand money what threat did she make that she would tell where the marriage took place and you bribed her to keep silence derrington winced at the scorn in his grandson's voice and took a turn up and down the room i am no saint i admit he said and at the time george i did not know that you would turn out such a fine fellow i dreaded a scandal and there was your uncle to be considered i had made him my heir and what about me sir were the sins of my father to be placed on my shoulders i have admitted that i was in the wrong said derrington impatiently spare me further sermons i beg your pardon said george quietly but please touch as lightly as possible on these matters we will admit that you acted according to your lights false lights said his grandfather sadly however we need speak no more on that particular point mrs jersey said that she knew where the marriage was celebrated adding that if i did not give her an annuity she would go to lockwood and help him to prove that you were my legitimate grandson and heir did she say if the marriage was celebrated in england or abroad no sir mrs jersey was a remarkably clever woman and if my son percy had married her she would have made a man of him then she really was in love with my father very deeply in love as she told me herself but she did not regard his memory with such veneration as to desire to aid his son she was content that you should lose your rights provided that i paid her an annuity i tried in vain to learn from her where the marriage had been celebrated she refused to open her mouth so i allowed her an annuity of five hundred a year that was a large sum interposed george derrington shrugged his shoulders much larger than i could afford my good sir he said but mrs jersey dictated her own terms i arranged that the money should be paid through my lawyers and she vanished where to i can't say she might have gone to rejoin mr jersey if there ever was such a person she sent a messenger regularly to the office of my lawyers for the money but did not trouble me in any way her next appearance was shortly after the death of your grandfather what did she want this time to set up a boarding house in amelia square she said that her life was lonely a remark which made me think mr jersey was a myth and that she wanted company i expect she learned in some way that i was buying old lockwood's house why did you buy it i have a lot of property in that district and i wanted to round it off with this house ireland in his rage at me for my treatment of your mother would not have sold it to me i bought the house through an agent mrs jersey must have heard of the purchase for it was then that she came to me and asked me to set her up in the house as a landlady i wonder why she did that said george thoughtfully she was lonely i understand george looked at his shoes as eliza stokes she lived in that house along with my mother previous to the elopement i expect she had a kind a affection for it well whatever her reason was i did what she asked she agreed to pay me a rent and her money was as good as any one else's besides i felt that as my tenant i could keep her under my own eye when she was away i never knew but what she might die and part with the secret to some one else who might come on me for blackmail also i thought it best mrs jersey should have the house so she went into it and used the old furniture i don't deny but what she was a good business woman and made the house pay at all events she was never behindhand with her rent i wonder she paid you any at all oh she had her annuity and was afraid of pressing me too hard i refused to let her the house on a seven years' lease she only had it from year to year and in that way i kept a check on her she knew if i once lost my temper that i would throw her over and acknowledge you as my heir i wish you had done so said brendon moodily it would have saved a lot of trouble i do so now replied derrington testily better late than never well mrs jersey lived and flourished for fifteen years i tried to find you out george lest she should get at you oh was that why you offered to make me an allowance it was i intended to give you a yearly income on condition that you went to australia then i could be sure that mrs jersey would not seek you out but you refused my offer and disappeared i went to college under the name of brendon observed george and that is why mrs jersey never found you and why i could not come across you until you put those advertisements about the marriage into the papers it was that which yes so bawdsey told me you had me watched i did said derrington and in that way i found out that you were going to stop in mrs jersey's house how did you learn that sir asked george in surprise i never told any one oh yes you told lola so i did said brendon quickly she bothered me to come and see her and i said that i was going to stop in the neighborhood of amelia square with a friend and would call on her the next day i expect she told this to bawdsey exactly and bawdsey told me i was afraid lest you should make mrs jersey confess i wrote to her and asked her to see me she refused to come to my house so i made up my mind to seek her out in amelia square i arranged by letter with her to call about eleven o'clock at her place and see her secretly why secretly and why at night can't you see george my height and figure make me so conspicuous that i knew i would be recognized if i went in the daytime and then people would ask themselves why lord derrington went to see a lodging house keeper you could have put it down to her being a tenant ah said derrington grimly i never thought of that i received a note from mrs jersey saying she would wait for me on friday evening at eleven o'clock in her sitting room it was a foggy night if you remember very foggy i suppose you traced the house by means of the red light over the door i did not trace the house at all said derrington quietly i did not go near the house but i saw you insisted george you saw my coat and a man with my tall figure and having my association with yourself in your head you jumped to the conclusion that the figure was me then if not you who was the man bawdsey said derrington curtly george stared in your coat he said incredulously it seems strange said derrington but the fact is that bawdsey is one of the few who have got the better of me in my life it was in this way that he prevented me from seeing mrs jersey on that night i visited him at his rooms which then were in bloomsbury i desired to tell him that i intended to see mrs jersey and to warn her against revealing anything i don't suppose the warning was needed as she knew when she was well off but the fact is mrs jersey was not in good health and was feeling compunction about keeping you out of your rights i learned from bawdsey that mrs jersey had written out a confession of the whole matter and that she intended to leave this to her niece margery watson so that i might be forced to continue the lease of the house george uttered an ejaculation i thought from what margery said that there was some such confession he remarked but it is missing it was not found among her papers after her death unless miss bull took it and forced you to no interrupted derrington vigorously she came here quietly and put the case of the poor girl to me she also undertook that the rent would be paid regularly and that through miss watson she would manage the house i was quite satisfied with the existing arrangements and moreover thought that if such a confession were found out of gratitude miss watson might bring it to me if miss bull had told her to she would have done so but not otherwise said george she is under miss bull's thumb the best place she could be george the girl is a born idiot from what i saw of her however you know why i renewed the year by year lease where the confession is i have no idea but the person who holds it will certainly make use of it some day to extort money and then we will learn who killed mrs jersey i dare say the assassin must have taken the papers well derrington proceeded with his account of his doings on that night as i said i went to see bawdsey at his rooms i took a cab and as the fog was thick i had considerable difficulty in finding the place the rain and fog chilled me for i am not so young as i was and when i arrived i was shivering but i was too anxious to tell bawdsey about mrs jersey to trouble he heated some water to give me a glass of hot whisky while the water was boiling i told him i was going to see mrs jersey he asked me how i could get into the house without being admitted by one of the servants and thus run a chance of my visit being known did it never strike him that mrs jersey expected you and would admit you when you rang yes it did strike him but he knew that i didn't want any one to know that she had a visitor so late at night i don't know why you took all these precautions sir derrington smiled dryly perhaps they were rather unnecessary but i thought it best to be on the safe side as a matter of fact i had a latch key i thought that mrs jersey never allowed latch keys this one came to me when i bought the house and was given to me by the agent i told mrs jersey i had it and that i would let myself in she expected me at eleven i know she did said george for on that night she asked the boarders to be in bed by eleven and broke up her party at ten i wondered if she was having any one to meet her then she was expecting me it was after ten when i told bawdsey and i explained to him that i had a latch key he gave me the whisky and being chilled i drank it then i fell asleep george looked up suddenly the whisky was drugged he guessed it was assented derrington and while i was insensible bawdsey took the latch key out of my pocket and put on my coat he is rather my height so with that and the fur coat i expect he passed himself off as me to mrs jersey until she saw his face when she did she would have nothing to do with him although added george he was an old boarder in the house wait till i tell you the rest said derrington and then you can give an opinion when i woke it was after twelve i never suspected that the whisky had been drugged and thought that it was some sort of illness bawdsey was in the room when i awoke he did not tell me that he had been to mrs jersey and i now saw that it was too late to go he advised me to see her on the morrow saying that it was doubtful if you would speak to her on that night i intended to wait till the next day but as a matter of fact i became anxious to see if any one was with her and i went down the stairs by means of that secret door bawdsey told me well i crept downstairs and saw as i thought you it was of course bawdsey he was standing at the door of the sitting room i was afraid lest you as i thought it was should see me so i went upstairs again and bawdsey left the house however i never suspected him i went home and found mrs ward waiting for me she came to tell me that she had heard from dorothy that you purposed to stop with train at mrs jersey's house and came to warn me how good of mrs ward she is a dangerous woman george i threw my coat on yonder sofa and she sat near it feeling something in the pocket her curiosity led her to take out the something when i was absent from the room it was a stiletto george started from his seat a stiletto yes derrington opened the drawer in his desk and took out the weapon which mrs ward had brought this was between the fur and the lining of the coat what with the weight of the coat and the position of this weapon lying along the bottom of the coat i never suspected it i brought it home quite unconsciously mrs ward found it took it away with her and came the other day to accuse me of having murdered mrs jersey how dare she do such a thing oh mrs ward is capable of all things however you can see from what i tell you what happened bawdsey put the stiletto in my coat and either forgot to take it out or left it there so that i might be incriminated did he tell you this he told me when i rebuked him too sharply that he could get me into trouble and explained how he had been in the house he also referred to the stiletto i denied that i had seen it and it was only when mrs ward brought it the other day that i saw that this part of bawdsey's story was true what did you do i accused him of having killed the woman what did he say he denied that he had done so he declared that he went to mrs jersey's sitting room door close upon twelve having let himself in noiselessly by the front door he discovered mrs jersey lying dead as she was found in the morning on the floor was the stiletto fearing lest he should be accused of the crime bawdsey left the house quickly but took the stiletto with him so that he might find out who had done the deed he changed his mind or left it by mistake in my fur coat did he ask money no he has not done so yet but he told me very plainly that no one could prove that he had been in the house on that night and that if he had been seen the coat would make people think it was i exactly what i did think said george well i had to hold my tongue for you see i was in a most awkward position and i could prove nothing i bluffed mrs ward but if the matter came into court things would look extremely unpleasant for me i can see that said brendon but bawdsey he has made himself secure as no one can prove that he was in the house on that night even you thought it was i i can't say for certain if bawdsey committed the murder or if he really did find the woman dead as he said but he swears to his innocence as yet he has not made any use of his power but i am quite sure that he will try and get money out of me so i have asked you here to advise me about the matter do you think bawdsey has the confession he may have if so he knows where the marriage was celebrated brendon mused for a time i think it best to do nothing at the present moment he said bawdsey is friendly to me as i saved him from being run over if he thought i knew this he might turn crusty and make trouble better wait for what asked derrington restlessly to see what he will do if he does blackmail you call me in derrington drew a long breath yes i think you are right he said we will wait but i don't trust that man he's a scoundrel said george but i know how to conquer him chapter xviii miss bull's story miss bull was alone in the sitting room of the late mrs jersey margery had gone out shopping and the old maid left to her own resources amused herself as usual with playing patience with the exception of a few old ladies in the drawing room the house was empty and miss bull found the quiet very soothing after a time she grew weary of the game and seated herself in an armchair to meditate her thoughts were sad here she was an old spinster dragging out a miserable old age in a london lodging house while her sister lived and fared sumptuously in accordance with her position miss bull looked back on all the trials she had passed through and wondered how she had been able to stand them for a moment a revolt took place in her breast at the cruel fate she had endured but the feeling died away and she relapsed into the patient misery which was her usual frame of mind it can't last much longer said miss bull with a sigh i am getting old and the end is coming the sooner the better as she gave vent to this dreary sentence there was a ring at the door miss bull paid little attention to it as she never had any visitors but this day proved to be an exception for george was admitted into the room he advanced cordially toward miss bull i have come to see you again you see said brendon miss bull gave him her hand with a great deal of pleasure and invited him to be seated now that she had thawed towards george she treated him kindly and her face wore a less stony look as the sun melts the frost so did the reserved nature of the old maid melt when in the sunshine of brendon's presence more than that miss bull actually congratulated herself on margery's absence as it gave her a chance of having the company of george all to herself i am very glad to see you mr brendon she said ringing the bell you will have some tea thank you replied brendon who thought she might thaw still more under the influence of the tea urn i suppose you wonder why i have come again so soon miss bull smiled in her calm way you have come to make further inquiries likely to forward your fight for your birthright george laughed there's no need for that thank god said he my grandfather has agreed to acknowledge me then there was a marriage i cannot be certain of that yet how do you know about that miss bull answered quietly you told me last time you were here that you were lord derrington's grandson and i heard that there was some doubt about the legitimacy i know it was common talk at one time replied brendon satisfied with this explanation did mrs jersey ever speak about it no she never did what did she know about it i think you can best answer that question miss bull george looked hard at her and a faint tinge of color crept into her face before she could reply with a counter question the servant brought in the tea miss bull waited to supply george with a cup before she spoke by that time the servant had left the room and the door as miss bull assured herself was closed i don't know to what you allude mr brendon perhaps if i allude to your life in san remo you miss bull started to her feet and the cup she held fell on the carpet san remo she muttered yes miss howard said brendon using her real name purposely the little old maid put one thin hand to her head miss howard the daughter of the late general howard said george my father was a general he was general howard you are miss jenny howard miss bull started and then sat down her face expressed pain he used to call me jenny jenny howard yes there was a happy girl of that name but she she died not at all said brendon briskly to arouse her from this dreamy state she lived and changed her name to bull the woman pushed back her white hair and made an effort to be calm but her lip quivered why have you come here to awaken these painful memories she asked because i wish to know how my father came by his death i do not know indeed i do not know moaned miss bull putting out her hand as though to ward off the thought you may not know for certain but you have some idea your sister mrs ward miss bull's face flushed crimson and she drew a deep breath oh it's violet's work is it she said and her eyes grew hard and pray mr brendon has she sent you to cross question me no i come on my own behalf you knew my father percy vane yes i knew him he loved me ah indeed he did that night he asked me to be his wife and had he not been murdered did he ask you when he was taking you home asked george wondering how miss bull would have behaved as his stepmother taking me home he never did that on the night of the ball your sister mrs ward i have no sister i disown violet she is a wicked woman george was quite of this opinion yet for the sake of dorothy he dissented she has her good points miss bull no no she has no good points she is selfish vain cruel and deceitful a child of the devil how do you know that i am her sister and how did you come to learn my name lord derrington told me and it was told to him by mr ireland your guardian miss bull tapped her hand on the woodwork of her chair he recognized me when i called to see him on that day about the lease but he promised to hold his tongue he would have done so had he not been startled by meeting mrs ward and recognizing in her the woman who had left the ball with my father and violet admitted this no she said that you had left the ball with my father it was you who wore the blue domino and the holly sprig liar liar muttered miss bull but she is always the same when i saw her at the music hall the other night her face wore the same false smile oh that i could see her punished as she deserves god will punish her miss bull he has delayed long said the old maid with a bitter smile my sister has enjoyed the good things of this life she has had money position praise and all that a woman desires as for myself she looked round the room and burst into a bitter laugh yet jenny howard was always considered the prettier sister of the two then it really was mrs ward who left the ball it was she lays the blame on my shoulders miss bull paused and her mouth worked nervously does she accuse me of the crime no she says that you left mr vane at the gate of the hotel oh muttered miss bull percy came as far as that with her did he and she said he left her at the door of the room where the ball was being held liar liar she always was she always will be can the leopard change his spots by this time the ice in miss bull's nature had melted under the heat of her indignation she walked hurriedly up and down the room her eyes bright and her cheeks flushed george was pleased to see this as he thought she was the more likely to tell the truth when thus moved by emotion than if she had remained calm miss bull was so angered by the memory of her wrongs that she struck her hand against the mantelpiece so as to inflict pain the shock seemed to nerve her for she drew a long breath and returned to her seat with her eyes fixed on george she began abruptly violet has told her story she said now i will tell you mine i want to know however exactly what she said in the exact words if you can remember them i did not hear her speak confessed george it was my grandfather and mr ireland to whom she told the story story fable lie romance said miss bull vehemently well tell me what you can remember this george did as concisely as possible for he feared lest margery should interrupt the interview miss bull listened with a downcast face and pursed up lips not a word did she say but when george ended she looked up with a bitter smile she has simply put herself in my place she said wait for a moment or so she tried to compose herself then she raised her head and looked her visitor squarely in the eyes i am going to tell the truth said miss bull bravely therefore i have no need to shun your gaze mr brendon i loved your father so mrs ward said and violet loved him also he must have been a singularly attractive man remarked brendon wondering at this revelation my mother eloped with him her maid was in love with him and now you and mrs ward oh violet really did not love him it was simply a desire to take him from me that made her behave as she did violet never loved any one in her life save the person she sees in the mirror every day a selfish woman mr brendon and a wicked one this was no news to george so he strove to coax her to tell him that which he wished to know i don't quite understand but if you will relate the story i shall do so at once you may as well know all and know also what a bad woman i have for a sister if she was dying cried miss bull vehemently i wouldn't raise a finger to save her life we should forgive our enemies hinted george i can't forgive her i never will forgive her she ruined my life george brendon she ruined my life brendon said nothing and in a few moments miss bull composed herself sufficiently to tell what she knew my father was general howard she said quietly and violet was my only sister we never got on well together violet was jealous of admiration and as i was said to be prettier than she was she hated me intensely whenever any one liked me violet would do her best to take him away from me i can quite believe that said george recalling mrs ward's arts she did not always succeed however continued miss bull with a flush i had my admirers also and some i could keep but when violet could manage it she always took them away you hinted that she took my father away said brendon she did at least she tried to but if he had not been murdered i should have been mrs vane in spite of violet's arts well tell me how you came to san remo and met my father oh i knew him before that we were six months at como and saw your father frequently then he and the general used to talk politics mr vane was always bringing us books and magazines and we used to climb mount bisbino what a delightful summer that was i remember you then she added looking at george with interest you were scarcely two years old a dear good fair little fellow i met you and the nurse sometimes and often carried you was the nurse's name eliza stokes no it was let me see some scotch name jane fraser i think ah then eliza stokes was not at como i never saw her mr vane told me that you had had another nurse but that he had to dismiss her at milan for impertinence george saw that miss bull was not keeping strictly to the truth and corrected her at once you knew eliza stokes at san remo so i did i quite forgot miss bull put her hand to her head with a puzzled air but since my illness i have forgotten so much it is all a blank to me tell me mr brendon have you ever felt as though you were a ghost no replied george keeping his countenance with difficulty i don't think i ever experienced that feeling miss bull looked vaguely at the window it is a strange feeling after which remark she lapsed into silence still staring brendon remembered that she had been in an asylum and thought that her mind was still weak it might be that after all she had not told an untruth but had quite forgotten eliza stokes george was confirmed in his supposition by her next remark eliza stokes i remember mrs jersey you knew she was mrs jersey yes that was why i came to this house did you like her then miss bull's eyes flashed she was another violet i hated her oh how i hated her i found her through my sister mentioning that lord derrington had given her this house so i came here to board but your sister knows nothing about you she says you ran away and that it was supposed you were dead miss bull laughed bitterly my sister knows perfectly well that i live here but it suits her to disown the relationship it is my wish also and for that reason i changed my name no one would recognize pretty jenny howard in poor miss bull she paused for a moment and then continued yes i knew that eliza stokes had become mrs jersey and that is why i came here but if you hated her i did i did but she was the only person who could talk about mr vane she loved him also but not as i did and we have talked for hours in this very room we quarreled certainly but at times she was very nice i miss our talks greatly it really seemed as though miss bull was weak in the head she admitted to hating mrs jersey and yet she came to stop with her it might be that mrs jersey looked after her as a kind of keeper and that she acted the tyrant at that moment as though answering his thought miss bull made a sudden observation mrs jersey knew that i had been in an asylum she would have sent me back if she could the vile woman but i was never afraid of her never and she always talked to me of mr vane concluded miss bull in a softer tone did she know who killed him miss bull shook her head no she never knew no one ever knew i sometimes thought that violet but she declared that he left her at the door of the ballroom miss bull said george growing impatient of this disconnected recital will you go on with your story story yes it is a story a sad romance she passed her hand again over her forehead as though wearied and resumed with an effort mr vane left como and came to milan afterward he went on to san remo my father who liked his society joined him there we stopped at the hotel d'angleterre eliza stokes was a housemaid there and it was while attending to our bedroom that she told me she had been your nurse she was a large stout girl with red cheeks as mrs jersey she was vastly improved but as a girl miss bull shuddered in a prim way and continued yet she had her admirers a waiter called george rates wished to marry her she had accepted him but while within sight of mr vane she could not love him how do you mean well eliza used to spy on mr vane and follow him in his walks she was quite insane about him i told mr vane and he kept away from the hotel and george rates was jealous of eliza's love for mr vane but he never loved her nor violet he loved no one but me and he told you so at the masked ball yes there was to be a masked ball and both violet and i were anxious to go we made a friend of eliza and she got us two blue dominoes that we might recognize one another we each wore a sprig of yellow holly my father was supposed to know nothing about the matter but we told a young oxford cousin of ours he met us at the ball and afterward took violet away i found mr vane and we danced together he did not know me at first but afterward when we went into a quiet room i unmasked he was vexed at first that i and violet should come to the ball unattended as he said my father would be so angry which was quite true then he told me that he loved me and asked me to become his wife i accepted and he kissed me miss bull paused moved by an emotion too deep for words i was fond of you as a baby george and he your father knew i would be a good mother to you did he speak of his first wife of my mother yes he told me how dearly he had loved her did he say where the marriage was celebrated no i never thought to ask him i always thought there was a marriage why should i not until i later heard that lord derrington denied that such had taken place but that was after i came out of the asylum added miss bull with a troubled air so it might be my fancy no it is true lord derrington did deny the marriage but he now recognizes that it took place we wish to find where i cannot help you mr brendon mr vane never mentioned it to me he told me that he loved me then he went away to get me an ice and said he would take me home and return for violet i waited but as he did not appear i went to look for him he was gone with your sister yes said miss bull clenching her fists violet overheard a part of our conversation she had just come down from the box of the marchesa beltrami that was where she unmasked and mr ireland recognized her she must have seen me with mr vane continued miss bull taking no notice of this interruption so she stole behind us and heard what we were to one another then she slipped on her mask and followed mr vane she said she did not want an ice but that she desired to go home at once mr vane wanted to wait for her for violet yes he thought that i had run after him and as violet wore a blue domino with the sprig of holly he fancied she was me i understand so he took her home she said he left her at the door and then came back to look for for violet said miss bull contemptuously she disguised her voice and he quite thought she was myself but from what mr ireland said mr vane saw violet home to the gates of the hotel i waited for a time and as your father did not come back i ran home alone violet was in our bedroom and said that mr vane had left her at the door of the ballroom and had gone back for me then the next morning we heard of the murder i never knew until you told me how violet had managed to get mr vane away from me she tricked you said george sympathizingly she tricked every one when i heard of your father's death i fell very ill the world became a blank to me when i came to myself i was in an asylum then i grew better and was let out my father died and an annuity was allowed to me i heard about mrs jersey taking this house and wishing for some one to talk to about your father i came here and here i have been ever since a lonely woman mr brendon but i find margery a great comfort then you do not know who killed my father no miss bull shook her head he was struck down on the parade when returning to the ballroom it must have been after he saw my sister home do you think mrs ward knows the truth she might perhaps some one followed and violet might have been mistaken for some person i know there was a married woman in san remo deeply in love with mr vane what an attractive man he must have been oh he was the handsomest man in the world cried miss bull with genuine enthusiasm and so kind no wonder eliza stokes loved him but he loved no one but me no one but me what did eliza stokes say when she heard of his death oh she almost went out of her mind i did altogether said poor miss bull with a wan smile and as they found her a nuisance in the hotel she went away george rates went also did she marry him no i asked her when i met her here as mrs jersey she said that she returned to england and that rates had been run over and killed in the street she then went to america and married mr jersey he died and left her some money then she set up this house so she said nothing of the annuity from lord derrington no it wasn't to her interest to do so she could hold her tongue when she liked we very often quarreled but on the whole we were as good friends as two women well could be who had loved the same man george rose to go thank you for telling me so much miss bull he said what was the name of the woman who loved my father oh she was a common woman who kept a shop velez was the name velez cried george and added to himself so that is how lola knows chapter xix the inquiry agent as george stepped out of the front door he came face to face with bawdsey who was mounting the steps the man seemed excited and carried a carelessly folded newspaper which he had apparently been reading he did not seemed pleased to meet brendon and looked at him in a suspicious manner i didn't expect to see you here he said with a certain degree of roughness i did not know that this house was interdicted to me replied brendon sharply he liked neither the tone nor the peremptory manner of bawdsey and moreover was not prepossessed in his favor by the report which lord derrington had made of the man's duplicity i am glad to meet you however continued george as i wish to have a few words i am too busy to give you any time retorted bawdsey and tried to enter the house nevertheless you will give me a quarter of an hour said george blocking the doorway with his stalwart form what i have to say cannot be left until a more convenient period i tell you i am busy mr brendon and i tell you that i intend to have this interview rejoined brewton imperiously you talk a great deal about gratitude bawdsey yet you are unwilling to put yourself out for me in the least degree bawdsey became penitent at once it is true mr brendon but i am very worried he cast a glance at the newspaper in his hand however you have first call upon my time so we will go to my room that's as it should be no more words passed bawdsey mounted the stairs and led george into the well remembered room brendon took a chair and bawdsey with an anxious look threw himself into another the man's face was flushed his red hair was in disorder and his eyes were bright as a rule he was calm and self controlled so george conjectured that something particularly important must have occurred to upset him however bawdsey's troubles were none of his business and he began talking at once of his reason for seeking the interview i had a conversation with lord derrington the other evening he said deliberately and we talked of you then you heard no good of me replied bawdsey with a sneer lord derrington does not like me that matters little no liking can exist between a man in lord derrington's position and his paid servant oh you call me that do you sir what else are you lord derrington engaged you as his agent to watch me and that you have done not lately i have given you a free hand in any case i have a free hand said george loftily you were grateful enough for my service in saving your life to release me from your espionage but had you not done so i should have taken means to put a stop to your dogging my footsteps you would not have known had i not told you mr brendon oh yes i should in any case i should have seen my grandfather and he would have told me no sir he is your enemy that is where you are wrong bawdsey he is my friend the detective looked astonished do you mean to say that lord derrington has climbed down he demanded incredulously it is strange is it not said george in a bantering tone but as a matter of fact after a long conversation lord derrington and myself came to understand one another he intends to recognize me as his heir has he then learnt where the marriage took place asked bawdsey starting from his seat and again glancing anxiously at the newspaper which lay on a small table at his elbow no we have yet to find that out but he is quite satisfied from the hints of the late mrs jersey that a marriage did take place and he wishes to make amends to me for his unjust conduct as regards my mother's memory and myself whew what means did you take to force him to recognize you i used no force at all responded brendon very dryly lord derrington would not climb down unless he were made to as a matter of fact he did the olive branch was held out by him all this is none of your business mr bawdsey and i only tell it to you to clear the ground for what i am about to say it's something disagreeable i bet said bawdsey scanning the set face of his visitor your penetration does you credit sir it is disagreeable bawdsey settled himself comfortably in his chair then the sooner we grasp the nettle the sooner will the pain be over he said with quite an eastern wealth of parable but first mr brendon i should like to know your exact position oh that is easily explained and there is no reason why you should not know what all london will know soon lord derrington will join with me in searching for the register of marriage and meanwhile will recognize me as his grandson and the heir to his estates not a very large income for a future peer murmured bawdsey george took no notice of this in a fortnight i leave my kensington rooms and take up my residence with lord derrington in st giles square then i shall assume my real name of george vane and you will marry miss ward i suppose that is entirely my business said george placidly you will gain nothing by insolence bawdsey the man rose with a wounded air upon my word mr vane he said giving george his correct name to show that he recognized his new position i have not the slightest intention of being insolent i am glad for your sake that things are as they are and pleased for my own since lola may now give up thoughts of you and turn to me that's all very well bawdsey said brendon quietly you profess a great friendship for me but how can i trust you i have never deceived you yet i have not given you the chance of doing so but if the opportunity offered and it was convenient to you i am quite sure you would sell me as the saying goes to the highest bidder why should you doubt me asked bawdsey still wounded i can only judge the future by the past and since you are quite ready to play lord derrington false who says that cried the man sitting down but looking defiant i say so lord derrington has told me all all what demanded bawdsey willfully ignorant all that took place on the night when you came to this house to impersonate him bawdsey laughed and his face cleared if that is your disagreeable business sir i can easily put that to rights can you explain why you drugged him why you threatened him i did not threaten him lord derrington informed me that you threatened to get him into trouble that was why he consulted me and that is why i have come to tell you that if you fight lord derrington you will fight me also lord derrington is old but i am young and i am quite equal to dealing with you i never denied that said bawdsey calmly i quite recognize that you are a strong man mr vane although it is not to my interest to admit as much that's your business rejoined george coolly i play with all my cards on the table what those are which you have concealed i do not know but i am quite prepared to play the game and at the present moment you need not call me by my father's name i have not yet assumed my position when i do george vane will have nothing to do with you but george brendon has said bawdsey with a flash of his eyes don't press too hard mr brendon i am willing to do you a service and you are misjudging me i am sorry you should think so let us cease this bickering i am willing to hear what you have to say if you are satisfied with my explanation will you endeavor to get lola to marry me that has nothing to do with me but you have influence with her it shall not be used to make her miserable i know nothing about you save what my grandfather told me and his report does not bias me in your favor for all i know you might make poor lola the worst husband in the world bawdsey shrugged his shoulders lola is well able to look after herself he said i think i mentioned that before but if you are satisfied with what i am about to tell you will you help me i'll do my best said george impatiently lola is sure to lose this engagement sooner or later through her vile temper i do not want to see her on the streets again and she may as well be supported by you in a respectable manner as by any one else besides as you truly say she can take care of her own skin but i shall not advise her to marry you unless you prove to me that you did not intend to blackmail lord derrington nothing was further from my thoughts said bawdsey earnestly it was to my interest that your grandfather should hold his tongue about my having been to this house he would not have known had you not told him voluntarily oh yes he would have discovered in some way i thought it best to be on the right side by confessing voluntarily what i had done i said i could get him into trouble and i admit that i did threaten him so far simply to make him hold his tongue you were afraid lest you should be accused of the crime bawdsey looked at george in surprise that possibility never crossed my mind he replied calmly i certainly did not kill the woman do you think i did mr brendon george shrugged his shoulders going by circumstantial evidence oh bawdsey flipped away that objection with a snap of his fingers that's all right i will explain no mr brendon why i wished lord derrington to be silent was that i might carry out my plans so as to learn who killed mrs jersey then you are looking after the case on behalf of lord derrington he has an idea that the assassin became possessed of a confession which mrs jersey left behind her how do you know she left it because i knew mrs jersey very well and as i told you long since i was once a boarder here one day she let slip that she had some one in her power and would leave the evidence of that power behind her so that her niece might benefit i told this to lord derrington he insisted that i should try and discover the assassin so as to get that confession which compromises him back again to spur me on he has promised me a reward of a thousand pounds should i obtain the confession and the conviction of the assassin as i want money to marry lola i am doing my best i came to live here for that purpose lord derrington talking of my visit to the house on the night of the crime would have jeopardized my plans therefore i was obliged as you say to threaten him so as to make him keep silent so far do you blame me mr brendon no replied george after some thought the end justifies the means but you might have adopted less rascally means i have not adopted any i have not asked lord derrington for money so i am not a blackmailer nor do i intend to claim from him anything but what is justly mine and what is justly yours if you please the reward of one thousand pounds for the discovery of the assassin oh have you learned who killed her not yet but i may learn at present i confess i am in fault george pondered a little so far bawdsey spoke frankly enough but he could not help mistrusting him however since the man was in the telling vein he thought it best to betray no doubts lest bawdsey should turn rusty well the discovery is in your own hands he said and i sincerely trust you will gain that thousand pounds i am as unwilling as my grandfather that mrs jersey's connection with this unfortunate business should become public i am perfectly convinced that the person who took that confession stabbed the unfortunate woman do you think so asked bawdsey stealing a glance at the newspaper george nodded the confession was written i learned that much from margery mrs jersey told her it was a story well as the confession was not found among mrs jersey's papers when she died it must have been taken by someone but i can't think what interest such a thing can have had for any one unless unless what mr brendon unless it contained the name of the person who assassinated my father how could mrs jersey know that she was at san remo when my father was killed she loved him and she used to follow him how i learned these things bawdsey does not matter but it is just possible that mrs jersey or eliza stokes as she was then might have some knowledge of who committed the crime if that was set down in her confession as is highly probable i can quite understand that the original assassin killed her to gain a dangerous document such as it undoubtedly was then you think that the assassin of your father was also the assassin of mrs jersey i fancy so as i can explain the disappearance of the confession in no other way and if i remember rightly bawdsey it was you who said that the san remo crime was connected with the one committed in this house i did say so replied bawdsey thoughtfully he pondered for a few minutes and then looked up briskly well mr brendon that point cannot be settled without proof and there is no use our wasting time in indulging in vain speculations let me tell you about the night i went to see mrs jersey go on said brendon crossing his legs i am all attention i knew before your grandfather came to see me that you were about to pass the night here lola told me yes i was foolish enough to tell her though to be sure i had no great reason to conceal my visit to train i never knew that a murder would take place so lola told you bawdsey nodded she did but i never intended to bother about the matter as i did not think there was anything in your visit but lord derrington came and put a different complexion on the affair it was his belief that you intended to force mrs jersey into confessing about the marriage i came to appeal to her said brendon dryly there was no thought of forcing in my mind lord derrington judged you by himself and thought there might be i rather agreed with him then knowing his temper i fancied if he went to see mrs jersey there would be a row and a scandal and i did not want that to happen i was making a very good thing out of lord derrington admitted bawdsey frankly and if a scandal had taken place my occupation would have been gone i therefore determined to drug him and to go myself but why in his coat i thought that mrs jersey might not admit me george pounced upon him at once there was no need that she should do so you took the latch key my grandfather carried oh you know that do you said bawdsey composedly then i may as well be absolutely frank it is your best course oh i'm not on my trial mr brendon it is only my friendship for you that is making me speak out i accept that excuse go on bawdsey shrugged his shoulders to show his annoyance at the uncompromising attitude of his visitor i feared lest mrs jersey should order me out of the house unless i could gain time by being mistaken for lord derrington i drugged the old gentleman and then taking his coat and the latch key i went to see mrs jersey at what time were you there some time before twelve i cannot say for certain well mr brendon i let myself in with the latch key and i found the house by the red light over the door in former years it had been my custom to guide myself in that way i told lola so why did you tell her that oh she knew that you were going late to the house and made a fuss about the chance of your being lost in the fog i said that probably train would tell you of the red light and that you could guide yourself by that humph lola was always unnecessarily kind said george well well i closed the door softly and went into the sitting room you knew where that was of course don't i tell you i once lived in this house i entered the sitting room the lamp was burning and mrs jersey was seated at the table bawdsey shuddered there is no need to tell you more i left the room at once for the sight horrified me why did you pause in the hall i thought i heard a footstep on the stairs and the shock gave me one of my fits the fear of open spaces you know how did you come to learn that i paused in the hall because i had come down the stairs to see who was with mrs jersey ah then it must have been your footstep i heard said the detective well i soon recovered and left the house what about the stiletto it was lying on the floor near the table i saw it glittering in the lamplight as there was blood on it and i saw the wound i knew that mrs jersey had been killed by it i slipped it into my pocket with a vague idea that thereby i might trace the assassin did you leave it purposely in the coat no said bawdsey frankly i did not i was so moved and as a woman would say flustered by the death that i forgot all about it lord derrington woke up and went home i said nothing about the murder to him at the time i had not the nerve it was only after he departed that i remembered the stiletto i thought he might make a row and accuse me of the crime but he said nothing and i judged it wise to let sleeping dogs lie so that is all i can tell you mr brendon and you will see that i am not such a bad man as you try to make out oh you have spoken clearly enough said george then after a pause yes i think you are honest so far as i can judge i trust you bawdsey looked delighted will you have a glass of wine with me to show that he asked rising on the arab principle of bread and salt said brendon certainly bawdsey nodded in a pleased manner and went to his sideboard at the end of the room george mechanically took up the newspaper his eyes were caught by a cross heading strange affair in an essex church and by the words destruction of the registers just as he was about to glance over the article never thinking what it meant to him bawdsey returned with the wine and two glasses he uttered an exclamation of dismay when he saw the paper in george's hand hang it i never meant you to see that he said why not replied george is it this news about a lady trying to tear the registers he started and looked at bawdsey who was uneasy and pale it's lola said george no and yet why should you not know i believe it is lola though no name is mentioned george picked up the paper again and read rapidly no name was mentioned as it was said that the strange lady who had been arrested refused to give any name it seemed that she went to wargrove church and asked to see the registers for a certain year the registers of marriage the sexton took the fee and showed the books then it appeared that the strange lady searched for an hour the sexton left the vestry for a few minutes when he returned he saw that she had torn a page out of the book being taken by surprise she had tried to conceal her theft but the sexton seized her rescued the torn page and called for assistance the end of it was that the strange lady who was described as having a foreign air was arrested and placed in prison it is lola said george breathlessly yes assented bawdsey also pale she evidently tried to destroy the evidence of your mother's marriage george gave a cry wargrove he said wargrove in essex it was in the parish church that the marriage took place and lola knew lola he paused the eyes of the two men met chapter xx the trouble of lola it was four o'clock when george left bawdsey the two had spoken little of the newspaper paragraph which informed them of lola's escapade although her name was not mentioned there was no doubt in the mind of brendon that she was the culprit the newspaper gave the year of the book when the sheet was torn and that corresponded to the year when percy vane married or had been supposed to marry rosina lockwood and this was the explanation of lola's absence from town she had not fled from the rebuke of brendon but had gone to do him an injury by destroying the evidence of his parents' marriage this finally was the meaning of her wild threat to dorothy by preventing george from proving his legitimacy lola hoped to put a final end to his chance of making miss ward his wife bawdsey was much upset over the news he would have flown immediately to wargrove but some special business kept him in town however he purposed to go the next morning by the first train bawdsey did not think that brendon had sufficient interest in lola to go down to wargrove at once but george was going that very day all the same lola could not have known that his parents had been married at wargrove without having seen mrs jersey's confession wherein the fact was probably mentioned therefore she must have obtained the confession in some way how she achieved this george could not conjecture then he thought of lola's hot spanish blood of the stiletto a peculiarly foreign weapon and shuddered it occurred to him that lola herself must have stabbed the woman however he put this thought aside for the moment and set about getting to wargrove on consulting an a b c he found that a train left liverpool street station for southend at ten minutes past five and that wargrove was a tiny rural town which could be reached in an hour ever quick and expeditious in his movements george had entered a strand shop to buy the railway guide and having ascertained about the train he simply stepped into his cab and ordered the man to drive to liverpool street at the appointed time he was on his way down the country this precipitancy of action was due to a dread lest bawdsey should change his mind and see lola first certainly the detective had spoken frankly and his conduct appeared to be dictated by sentiments of honor nevertheless george felt that bawdsey was playing a part and that this apparent honesty was not his real character it behooved him to be on his guard against him and to know as much about the death of mrs jersey as bawdsey did so as to able to counterplot him if necessary from the fact that she was in wargrove lola evidently had possession of the confession if bawdsey saw her he would doubtless try and get it from her to learn the name of percy vane's assassin george wished therefore to forestall bawdsey and to make lola surrender the confession always presuming she had it to himself for this reason he departed quickly for wargrove at the liverpool street station he examined all the passengers as they entered the train bawdsey did not put in an appearance and as the next train would not depart for another two hours george felt that he had stolen a march on the detective bawdsey would never think that he had acted with such promptitude it was a dull journey as brendon was worried by a commercial traveler who would talk politics george put him off as civilly as possible and finally turned his prattle for it was little else to his own advantage by asking for the whereabouts of wargrove it seemed that the new town of wargrove was the place where the train stopped but old wargrove was three miles distant and it was there that the parish church was situated the commercial traveler followed up this information with many details concerning the manners and customs of the natives which bored george to distraction however he listened quietly and paid as little attention as was consistent with politeness his officious companion watched for the station and roared out the name when the train stopped george thanked him and alighted glad to be relieved of such a weary talker and till the train was moving the man leaned out of the window shouting directions as to the best way to reach old wargrove as it proved there was no necessity for george to go there lola was stopping in the policeman's house prior to her removal to the prison at chelmsford her attempt at robbery had been committed on the previous day and brendon thought she would have already been removed however he was informed that there was some delay owing to the illness of the chelmsford inspector and therefore lola would have to remain in wargrove for another twelve hours brendon was glad to hear this as it would save him a long journey he thanked the policeman who had explained and was directed by the man to the house of his superior officer which was on the outskirts of the town george soon found a semi detached house with a notice on it and on knocking at the door explained his errand to a brisk little woman she pursed up her lips looked inquisitively at him with bright eyes and called her husband the policeman was a burly slow witted fat man who seemed nervous on being asked for a sight of the prisoner for such lola was to all intents and purposes he did not want to exceed his duty george produced a sovereign but the official although his eyes twinkled hesitated to take the bribe it was then that mrs policeman came to brendon's assistance nonsense jeremiah she said briskly let the young gentleman see his young lady she's dying to have a sight of him how do you know that she is my young lady asked george mrs policeman nodded with her arms akimbo why she's been crying out in that foreign way of hers for george george that is my name certainly and you are her gentleman she told me what you were like and cried all the time poor soul tall fair with eyes of blue it's all very well grumbled jeremiah but 'tis against the law you can be present at our interview if you like there jeremiah you can't have the gentleman saying fairer than that here the sharp little woman nudged her husband's arms this was a hint for him to swallow his scruples and take the sovereign jeremiah agreed and shortly the sovereign was in his pocket and he was leading george to a back upstairs room we'd have put her in the best parlor he said as i always like to make 'em comfortable but she'd have run away so we was obliged to keep her in the room with the bars on the window poor lola thought george as he conjured up the small stuffy room and the barred window but the room was not so comfortless as jeremiah stated thanks to mrs policeman it was small certainly but it was neatly furnished as a bed sitting room the window was certainly barred but there was no other sign that it was a prison cell before introducing george to this abode it struck jeremiah that the prisoner had been inquired for as the young lady he stopped brendon at the door might you know her name sir of course i know it replied george promptly don't you now i do said jeremiah with a heavy nod but it was a rare time afore she'd speak my missus got it out of her loler veal it is she says and she's by way of being on the stage she is the most celebrated dancer in london and her name is lola velez said george i don't suppose she'll be punished much for this she's mad at times oh if she's mad she'll get off lightly but them parish register to be torn it's bad work that my father were a sexton explained jeremiah soberly and naturally you think mademoiselle velez has committed the most atrocious of crimes but don't stand chattering here my good fellow i have to return by the nine train i'll wait outside said jeremiah on whom brendon's generosity and peremptory manner had made an impression but you won't give her poison or knives or that sir george laughed no she is the last person to use them if i did supply her with such articles she's a lively young woman said the policeman and slowly unlocked the door george was admitted and then jeremiah so as to give the lovers as he thought them an opportunity of meeting unobserved retired locking the door after him lola and george were together she was seated by the window staring out into the darkness on the table was a small lamp and a fire burned in the grate lola started up when the door closed again who is who is she asked in her rapid way and came toward him lola began george but he got no further she ran forward and flung herself with tears at his feet clutching his legs and wailing oh my dear one hast thou come in anger trample me make me as earth beloved but be not enraged ah no ah no lola get up and don't be a fool said brendon speaking roughly to brace her nerves she rose sobbing and crept to a chair in a slinking manner quite unlike her usual free grace she did not raise her eyes and george was pained to see the change badly as she had acted he felt sorry at beholding her depressed and like a sick beast in confinement lola he said taking a chair near her i have come as your friend not in anger ah but yes in anger i am not angry i am very sorry ah but in your eyes they sparkle i see mees vards i do try to steal the church books you are furiously enraged look at me and see but lola would not so george took her chin and made her gaze directly into his eyes lola's were filled with tears but after a time she began to smile ah you are not enraged it was for you i did it i wish my dear george to myself all all you know that is impossible but it is not i will have you not at all said george deliberately you will marry bawdsey that pig cow horrible and miserable non ah non she sprang to her feet jamais ah grand jamais i do swear and producing a small black crucifix from her dress she kissed it vehemently she was a most impossible person to deal with being as wild as a tigress and as impulsive as a child george made her resume her seat and drew his chair close to her much delighted lola took his hand within her own and looked at him affectionately brendon did not like the position at all but it was necessary to humor lola if he wished to arrive at the truth he spoke to her very directly now lola i wish you to tell me the truth ah but i will when you are kindness i tell you all do you know that you have done a wrong thing pschutt she said contemptuously i give that old mans knocks on the heads but he is alive oh yes i did not kill him i don't mean the assault though that is bad enough but your trying to destroy the register of the marriage it is your fault cried lola impetuously for loves of my george i did so i wish you not to marry any but me we can talk of that later lola answer me a few questions and make no remarks i will do what you say my friend said lola nodding george thought for a moment how did you learn that wargrove was the place where my parents were married i tell not that indeed i will not it is my businesses mine also you must tell but i will not for my sake lola ah you want to know all and then trick me i will not tell then i will explain to you aha you cannots you know nothings at all pah la la la la george spoke sternly lola i know more than you give me credit for i have seen the dagger this time he struck home for she started what dagger the stiletto you left in mrs jersey's room i did nothings i was not there yes you were for all i know you may have killed the woman but it is foolish you talk george i did not she was frightened oh very much afraid so much that she gave you the confession you asked for ah yes yes yes cried lola then seeing she had betrayed herself she began to be alarmed ah you will say nothing i would not tell anys but my george he loves me he will not see me dead good heavens lola did you kill the woman that fat ladys in black silk ah no i did not but she was so afraid of the knife you left her alive on that night why yes my george we part oh such good friends lola blew a kiss from her finger tips she quite pleased immense well lola as you have told so much you must tell me all there is nothing to say she replied turning sullen george rose then i shall go away he declared i came here to be your friend lola and to save you from getting into further trouble but if you will not be candid he moved to the door what is candids i know not george she sprang to her feet ah my heart do not go soul of my soul leave me not i will do anythings what you ask of me then tell me the whole story of your visit to mrs jersey but you will marry mees vard i do that in any case see here lola he added artfully this marriage register which you wish to destroy does not matter now my grandfather has acknowledged me as his heir she looked at him with wide eyes and pale cheeks and you will be milor you will marry mees vard you will you will her mouth began to work piteously like a child being reproved i will always be your friend lola you will marry mees vard she persisted lola he took her hand if we married we would never be happy i and you are different people do you wish to see me happy ah yes if i die i would have you happy she sobbed then allow me to marry miss ward and give me up ah but it is asking much always too much well said george a trifle cruelly you offered to die for me just now yet to see me happy you won't deny yourself anything yes yes but it is all so quick my dear give times oh give times till i become used she sobbed for a moment then dried her eyes and sat down briskly i am ready my george you shall be happy but you must not forget poor lola ah no of course not replied george patting her hand now tell me the story wait was it you mother who told you of my father's death yes assented lola she often talked of your fathers i heard she was in love with him said george slowly lola shrugged her shapely shoulders that i know not my dear mother was handsome oh yes and dark and fond of gayness she might have loved eh it is not impossibles did she ever hint who killed my father lola shook her head no never did she say anythings he was found dead stabbed she made a gesture that was all all evidently she could tell him nothing so george reverted to more immediate matters how about that night you knew that i was going to mrs jersey's on that night ah but yes you did tell me then what made you come also was it to see me lola put her finger in her mouth and looked down no my george i did want that confessions of the fat old lady to stop you being milor and then i thought you would marry only poor lola how did you know about the confession that pig man told me bawdsey why did he tell you pschutt said lola contemptuously he loves me so i can twist and twist him so she made a rapid motion with her fingers we did talk of the death of your fathers i lamented that my poor mother did loves your fathers unhappily as i did love you and i was enraged to think that your fathers had died i did ask bawdsey who made the stab gave the death eh it is so i asked she added nodding he could not say but he declares that mrs what you call her eh but my friend mrs mrs jersey bawdsey declared that she knew lola nodded it was so she assented mrs what you call that fat ladys she write out all she know of your father's death and of his marriages i say to myself that i would get that confession and learn where the marriage was made then i would burn the book that no one might learn after i would say to you that i could tell who killed your father if you made me madame your wife that's a very pretty plot said brendon not knowing whether to be angry with her wrong doing or touched by a love that to gain him would not hesitate to commit a crime so far you have carried it out you have the confession lola put her hand on her breast he is here she said nodding i carries him always always give it to me lola her eyes opened in wide alarm ah no you will not ask me i keep him to myself all george saw that the moment was not propitious but he was determined to get the confession before he left her however he begged her to continue her story how did you know the house he asked it was the scarlet windows i remember bawdsey gave you that for guide bah he knew not i was going said lola with a shrug i got out of him the fool man all that i did want i thought i would get to the fat ladys on the night you were with her that i might have you for helps if she was enraged it seems to me that you protected yourself very well with the daggers oh yes i said to myself that if my george did not come for the fogs that mrs what you say jarsey oh yes would be enraged and i would have trouble i took the stiletto to save myself how did you get into the house wait ah wait i did not dance all that night i said i was ill and i came aways i took the daggers and a cloak and i went to the square it is not far from my houses no you just turn the corner of the street said brendon well i walked by the walls it was after ten o'clocks i walk round and round the squares and i then see a red lights the door open it was open and many people came out of the houses the fat lady was on the steps waving her hands so lola waved her hand a crowd was around i came into the crowd and when the fat lady was down shaking with the handshake i did slip into the house that was clever of you said george wondering at the dexterity with which lola had managed to enter without exciting suspicion and then what did you do did you meet any one ah but no i ran into a place there was a room with a light and that i did go into mrs jersey's sitting room murmured george yes i was afraid to be thrown out my dear and i hided behind a curtain of the window the fat lady she did come in and close the door she talked to herself of lord derrington coming and did seem enraged at him wishing to come you understand yes what then a leetle boy did come in with wine and cakes she did send him away being angry and did close the door she took from a box a green box lola yes a green box she did take a blue what you call paper a blue envelope ah yes it is so and she looked at a paper a white paper she took from the envelope she laughed and said that milor would love to have this i say to myself behind the curtains it is the confessions i will have it then she did put it in the envelopes and leave it on the tables it was near me i could steal and you did said george impatiently but no my george i did try and madame she saw my arm with a cry she leap to the doors i come out and say that i wish to talk of the deaths of monsieur vanes she turns most white and did not cry no more then she ask me what i want you needn't tell all in detail lola be as short as possible oh well but yes assuredly i told madame i was of san remo and did talk of my dear mother and of her love for monsieur vane but this pig womans insult my mother i become enraged i bring my dagger and wave it so again lola made a dramatic gesture i say that i kill her she fall on her knees and hide her face then i did take the confessions out of the blue envelopes and hide it that was very clever of you lola did mrs jersey see ah but no she did not i take it when she was with the eyes covered then having all what i was desired and seeing her so afraid i had the contempt look you i say 'there there' and i throw the dagger at her feets then i go to the door and say i would depart she beg me to stop i did stop and we talk of san remo and of my mother i say that you were my love and that monsieur vane was the father of you then she knew who i was on that night ah yes but she did i say you wish to see her the next day she say 'i will tell him nothing and now go for i have to see a great gentlemans' i was quite happy did she not miss the confession no i said nothing of wanting that it was in my pocket the blue envelope was on the table she never thought but what it was within then she ask me to say nothing to any one about san remo and we part quite happy she allowed me out of the door and closed it again oh so softly i saw her no more you left the dagger behind it was on the floors where i threw it i wished to get away with the confessions lest she should call me thieves i did not wait for to take the dagger i departed that is all humph said george the story seemed likely enough after letting lola out of the house mrs jersey then came to see if he and train were in bed expecting lord derrington and knowing from lola who he was she no doubt expected george to interrupt the interview but finding him as she thought in bed she departed satisfied then she met margery and after locking her in her room went down to meet her death it was eleven when all this happened and bawdsey in the coat of lord derrington arrived close upon twelve therefore as lola left mrs jersey alive and bawdsey found her dead she must have been killed in the interval and whomsoever had done this had used the dagger left by lola however george had learned all he wished to know in the mean time and it only remained to get the confession from lola she refused to give it up george entreated cajoled stormed insisted she still held out no i will not i will not she kept saying finally he hit on a solution of the difficulty if you do not give it to me it will be taken from you when you go to prison ah but will it cried lola wide eyed with alarm certainly and will probably be published in the papers keep it if you like lola but don't blame me if you get into trouble over it i assure you if you keep it they will take it lola pulled a white packet from her breast and ran with it to the fire they will not have it i burn i burn and she threw the papers on the fire george shot past her snatched them out before they could catch alight and thrust them into his pocket lola turned on him like a tigress and he thought she would strike him she seemed inclined to do so then unexpectedly she threw up her arms and fell into a chair weeping it is the end you love me no more we part we part the confessions will part us all all alas chapter xxi the confession of a jealous woman george returned to town with the confession of mrs jersey in his pocket on arriving at the liverpool street station he wrote a note to kowlaski telling him of lola's plight and advising him to engage counsel for her defense he added that he would come around the next day to see kowlaski and discuss what could be done toward extricating lola from the mess she had involved herself in having thus done what he could brendon took the underground railway to kensington and alighted at the high street station in another half hour he was in his rooms after making a good meal for he felt the need of food to sustain him he ordered coffee and sat down to read the manuscript of mrs jersey the coffee was brought george lighted his pipe and having poked the fire into a blaze made himself comfortable the confession of the wretched woman who had come to so tragic an end was written on several sheets of foolscap loosely pinned together her caligraphy was vile and george had great difficulty in making out some of the words also the english was not faultless but good grammar and fine writing were scarcely to be expected from a woman in the position of eliza stokes but she wrote in a most cold blooded way and seemingly exulting in her wickedness all through her confession ran a venomous strain of deadly hatred toward george's mother and indeed against any woman who paid attention to vane jenny howard was not spared and the woman velez who kept an oil shop sneered mrs jersey was mentioned when brendon discovered that mrs jersey had italian blood in her veins he saw perfectly well whence she got her savage nature and undisciplined affections she was like a wild beast let loose among more civilized animals and the wonder was that with such a nature she had not committed more crimes than those she confessed to the woman was a dangerous creature and brendon when he laid down the manuscript thought it just as well that she had been removed even by the violent means which providence permitted my parents were of humble station began mrs jersey abruptly i believe my mother was a lady's maid she married my supposed father who was a butler i say 'my supposed father' as i have reason to believe that i was the daughter of a certain italian count who had loved and betrayed my mother in her moments of rage my mother would taunt my supposed father with this but when calm she always denied that there was any truth when i grew old enough to understand she rebuked me for asking about the matter 'you are my daughter' she said abruptly 'and the daughter of samuel stokes who is the biggest fool and the greatest craven i know' it will be seen that there was no love lost between my parents my father stokes as i may call him though i believe the count was my real sire was always very kind to me and shielded me from my mother's rage she treated me very cruelly and when fifteen i was glad to go out as a scullery maid so as to escape her persecution shortly after i took up life on my own account she died in a fit of violent rage during which she broke a blood vessel i think stokes was glad when she died she made his life a misery when she lived and tormented every one around her if i have faults it is not to be expected that i could inherit a decent nature from such a mother i never loved her and when she died i did not shed a single tear i remember singing at my work on the day i received the news one of my fellow servants asked me why i was so gay i replied that i had heard of my mother's death after that they hated me and i had to leave my situation but had any one of them possessed such a mother any one of them would have been as gay and relieved as i was so much for my mother as for my presumed father stokes i saw very little of him he retired from business and bought a public house then he married again and was not inclined to see much of me i did not mind as i never loved him in spite of his kindness i dare say i should have returned his affection but my mother had beaten all love out of me it is needless to give my early life in detail i rose from scullery maid to housemaid then i became parlor maid in a suburban villa where the wages were poor and the food was bad i took charge of children when not doing housework and managed to get on but i was ambitious i wished to get among the servants of the aristocracy a friend of mine who was maid to the duchess of taught me her duties and i procured a situation i pleased my mistress and she promised to do much for me however she died and i was thrown on the world i saw an advertisement for a lady's maid and got the situation it was in this way that i became the servant of that woman whom i hated so deeply she was called rosina lockwood and was no better born than myself her father was a low man who taught singing and she appeared herself on the stage i never thought she was beautiful myself she had good hair and her complexion was passable but her figure was bad and she had no brains an inane silly foolish woman how percy vane could have eloped with her beats me but men are such fools he would not look at me yet i was ten times as lovely as this singing woman and quite as well born oh how i hated her at first i rather liked miss lockwood she was kind to me in her silly way and the gentlemen who were in love with her gave me plenty of money to deliver notes and other things there was one gentleman who was the best of them all and the biggest fool over her blue eyes and fair hair his name was ireland and he had plenty of money he came to learn singing from old lockwood simply to be near her and proposed three times to my knowledge but she would have nothing to do with him which was foolish as he had money and she could have twisted him round her finger why he loved her so and what he saw in her i can't say she had nothing attractive about her so far as i could see i was a handsome girl in those days though i say it myself but if a woman is good looking why shouldn't she say so i had a perfect figure and a complexion like cream and roses my hair was as black as night and my eyes were sparkling and large i taught myself to read and write and i learned french also i learned to play the piano and to conduct myself like a lady as i always was i often dreamed that i would marry a gentleman and i could have done so but that my foolish heart was captured by the only man who would have nothing to do with it or with me i never loved till i set eyes on him there was a footman who wanted to marry me to join our savings and set up in a public house but i told him i was born for better things then a coachman asked me to be his wife but i hated a man who had to do with horses oh i had plenty of offers as a handsome girl should but i knew my own value and looked about for the gentleman who would give me my rightful position as a lady from my italian father i inherited aristocratic tastes and i was not going to remain a low vulgar common servant all my life not me then he came to the house oh my adored one my idol my angel how magnificent and beautiful thou wast percy was his dear name and his blood was very blue lord derrington was his father a most aristocratic nobleman who was an old brute from my experience of him but he was of high rank i don't deny and percy had the blood of heroes in his veins he came to take lessons in singing but after a time i saw that he was in love with my mistress afterward i found out that he had seen her at a concert and had fallen in love with her i don't believe it who could have loved that bad figure and that silly brain now a woman like myself but he never cared for me although i adored him from the first time i set eyes on his manly form it was her arts that captured him else he would have turned from her to me but he never did how handsome and fascinating was my hero percy vane fair hair and blue eyes and the figure of a life guardsman just the kind of man i liked he was kind to me for her sake i suppose and gave me money and presents she said she loved him and used to make me sick with talking of him i let her think i was her dear friend as if she had known my true feelings she would have sent me away and then i would never have seen my hero again i made the best of my position for at least i saw him as often as she did and that was something they both looked on me as their friend had they only known how i hated her and loved him lord derrington was angry with percy for loving my mistress and i don't wonder at it a low singing woman percy had some money of his own inherited from his mother and he proposed an elopement he said that lord derrington could not leave the estates away from him and that some day he would come in for the title she never lived to be lady derrington i was glad of that i should have killed her had she reached that pitch of splendor her position should have been mine but it never was well they eloped after singing at a concert in st james's hall he met her outside and took her to liverpool street station i was waiting there with the luggage we went down to a place called wargrove in essex and the very next day they were married in the church of that parish i was furious but what could i do had i told lord derrington he might have stopped the marriage but percy would never have forgiven me and i did not wish to lose sight of him as mrs vane's maid i had chances of seeing him daily and of basking in the light of his eyes it was weak of me but i loved him so dearly that i would have done anything simply to be in his presence but i wish now that i had prevented the marriage since i could not get him i didn't see why she should bear off the prize but i was a girl then and sentimental and foolish and she was a cat as she always was afterward we went to paris and from that place percy wrote to tell his grandfather that he was married i know he did not mention the place for the letter was given to me to post and i opened it i never gave it a thought at the moment but afterward percy's mistake in not telling where the marriage had taken place did me a lot of good i should not now be writing in this house but for that lucky omission lord derrington would have nothing to do with his son and there was trouble with mr lockwood but i don't think they minded much percy was wrapped up in the creature and she loved him in her silly simpering way i pretended to be quite happy but i inwardly was raging all the time for his sake i put up with the unpleasant position and i never received my reward never never never oh how some women's hearts are broken by the cruelty and neglect of men i lived with the two of them during their married life a son was born and she died i was glad when she died and i was sorry she left the boy percy was wrapped up in the child and gave him to me to nurse mrs vane was buried in pre la chaise and then percy with myself and the baby went to monte carlo he gambled there in order to forget his grief though i don't see what he had to moan over seeing what a silly fool his late wife was percy lost money and wrote to his father who declined to help him then he went to italy and wandered about now that he was free i hoped to marry him when not nursing that horrid child he was called george after his maternal grandfather and was a scrubby little beast some said he was a fine child i could not see it myself he was her child and that was enough to make me hate him as i did but as i say when not nursing him i devoted myself to study so as to be worthy of the time when percy would marry me i knew that the future lady derrington would hold a high rank and i qualified myself to fill the position gracefully i did work i learned arithmetic and could write beautifully i talked italian and french like a native i got an old artist to teach me to paint in water colors and i bought a book which taught the manners of good society also i tried to dress well and do my hair becomingly percy saw the change in me and congratulated me on the improvement which had taken place in me since leaving england had he only known that it was for his sake i had improved as to that child i should have liked to drown it or to have given it to gypsies as lady derrington i did not wish to be troubled with her brat besides percy loved the boy so that he used to make me envious the way he nursed him but had i got rid of the child and i thought of a thousand safe ways i could have done so i should only have been sent away and then some woman would have got hold of him i thought it best to bear with my aching pain and put up with the child so that i might be near to watch over percy the end of it came in milan we were stopping at the htel de ville and there was a waiter who fell in love with me he was an english boy called george rates a horrid scrubby red haired nasty pale faced creature who worried me to death besides he was younger than i was and i wished for a husband to protect me i should have had to look after george rates whereas percy in the days to come would look after me besides i felt that it was an impertinence for a low waiter to expect me to marry him me who had done so much to improve myself and who looked forward to taking proud rank among the british aristocracy at first i laughed at him but he became such a nuisance that i told him plainly that i would have nothing to do with him he then accused me of being in love with my master i acknowledged it proudly why should i not a woman should glory in her love i did i told george rates that i worshiped the very ground percy walked on i gave my passionate feelings full vent and bore him to the ground under the storm of my indignation he told the other servants and they insulted me especially the english ones as there were two or three in the hotel i was persecuted but i bore all for his dear sake then it came to his ears percy heard what i had said to george rates he called me in he accused me of making him ridiculous of being out of my mind of a thousand and one cruel things i lost my head i told him how i loved him i knelt at his feet i implored that he would reward my love my long long sufferings he laughed in my tearful face at that moment i hated him but not for long my life was bound up in his when he dismissed me i thought that my heart was broken i was dismissed he procured a new nurse from england a scotch hussy as ugly as she was silly i saw her often in milan after my dismissal oh that time oh those weary days i wept i prayed i moaned i was a wreck with what money i had i went to a convent near milan and stopped there for a month but i could not remain away from him i came out he was gone i went to inquire at the hotel he had gone to rome afterward a message came that all letters were to be sent to san remo i determined to go to san remo and to be near him i would have died else george rates who was still in love with me proved a willing tool i could not get to san remo without money he offered to advance me the railway fare and he got me a situation in the htel d'angleterre as housemaid he also was going there for the season as a waiter i said that if he took me to san remo i would marry him he did so and i but that comes later sufficient it is to say that george believed in my promise and that i found myself again in the presence the heavenly presence of my adored percy but i had only come to submit myself to fresh anguish he saw me but took no notice of me i was afraid to follow him too closely lest he should ask the police to interfere george rates was jealous too and i had to consider him as failing percy rewarding my love i could fall back on george he was always useful to supply the money for me to get back to england where i was certain of a situation i handled the situation in a masterly manner and contrived to see percy without his seeing me and without exciting too openly the jealousy of george rates but it was the horrid girl that caused me pain she was one of the daughters of general howard whom percy had met at como the two girls both laid themselves out to catch my darling but their arts did not succeed at como jenny was the one who tried hardest to get him but violet took her chance also when they came to san remo they stopped at the htel d'angleterre i looked after their room and knowing what they were i made myself their friend they knew me as the former nurse of percy's horrid little son and wondered how i came to be a housemaid i told some story which satisfied them i forget what it was they believed in me thoroughly and they found out that i loved percy then they were amused and i hated them for it they told percy that i was watching him and he came to the hotel no more but i still pretended to be their friend for my own ends there was a masked ball coming off and the miss howards wished to go unbeknown to their father i entered into the spirit of the joke i procured them two blue dominoes and each a sprig of yellow holly so that they might know one another they went to the ball thus disguised i went also in the same dress i had got a third blue domino and i also wore a sprig of holly in my pocket i took a stiletto why did i do that because i was determined to kill any one who tried to make love to my percy i knew that jenny howard the little cat would try and get him to love her and i would have killed her with pleasure had she become percy's bride as i was masked i had no fear of being discovered should i stab any one and moreover were there trouble the miss howards being dressed as i was even to the sprig of yellow holly might be accused of any crime that might happen moreover even if i killed jenny i knew that the two sisters quarreled and that on the evidence of the holly and the domino violet might be charged with the crime oh i made myself quite safe i am a clever woman about the stiletto i received that from a low shopkeeper called velez who was in love with percy she and her husband kept an oil shop and her husband was very jealous of her she was madly in love with percy as i found out when buying something at her shop and i got to know her intimately so that i could make use of her if the occasion arose i did make use of her by getting the stiletto and i took it to the ball i heard percy propose to marry jenny and i was minded then to kill her i drew the stiletto from my breast and would have rushed forward hoping to escape in the confusion when i killed her but my heart failed me even when she was left alone my heart failed me jenny took off her mask and i left her sitting waiting for percy's return then i followed percy and saw violet join him i knew it was violet owing to the unmasking of jenny and moreover i had seen violet listening as i was she loved him also the cat however i saw that she wanted to get percy out of the place by making him think she was jenny she did i followed he took her home to the gates of the hotel and left her there when he was coming back to the ball i stopped him at the bottom of the parade there was no one in sight it was late and a clear moon was shining percy thought i was violet whom he mistook for her sister he addressed me in such endearing tones as jenny and remonstrated so gently about what he called the rashness of following him from the hotel that i lost my temper i snatched off the mask and poured out my wrath percy burst out laughing when he recognized me he said never mind what he said but it was an insult and my italian blood boiled in my veins i drew the stiletto and rushed on him at that moment my hand was caught from behind and i fell it was that man ireland who was then at san remo and a great friend of percy's he had wrenched the stiletto out of my hand for a moment no one said anything and i arose to my feet ireland addressed me as miss howard miss violet howard percy laughed again and corrected his mistake saying that i was a love sick nursemaid whom he had discharged then i lost my temper stop i must say exactly how it happened percy was leaning against the parapet of the parade in a careless attitude he did not even move when i rushed on him with the stiletto and had ireland not caught my arm i should have killed him ireland said that he had followed me thinking i was violet howard to ask me to return to the hotel he talked some rubbish about a gentle born english girl being out at night but when he found that i was only a servant there was no more of that talk poor eliza stokes could have been out till dawn for all these gentlemen cared they laughed at me percy leaning against the parapet ireland beside me holding the stiletto carelessly in his hand as i said i lost my temper and i told percy what i thought of that fool rosina lockwood he lost his temper also but that only made me more angry at last he dashed forward and i believe he would have struck me but that mr ireland intervened i don't know exactly how it happened but in moving mr ireland evidently forgot how he held the stiletto and put out his hand with the weapon pointing outward in rushing on me percy came against it and it ran right into his heart with a choking cry he fell dead i was terrified and began to wring my hands ireland knelt down and found that percy was dead he seized my wrist and told me to hold my tongue lest i should be accused of the death i said it was his fault he replied it was an accident but i had got the stiletto i had tried to kill percy and ireland declared that if i said anything that he would denounce me as the criminal i was terrified as i saw the danger in which i was placed ireland suggested that we should throw the body over the parapet on to the beach and that it would be thought robbers had killed percy i agreed and we threw the body of my darling over oh how my heart ached when i heard it fall on the cruel cruel stones with ireland i arranged to hold my tongue and on his part he promised he would say nothing the next day the news of the discovery of the body came i was nearly out of my mind seora velez from whom i had borrowed the stiletto knowing of my love for percy and being in love with him herself accused me of the crime i denied it and said that if she did not hold her tongue i would tell her husband how she had loved percy she was afraid of her husband who was a jealous brute so she remained quiet i gave her back the stiletto which i had obtained from ireland we were both safe but i was so ill that i left the hotel and returned to england george rates who never suspected my share in the death followed it was at this point that george ceased reading he now knew the worst his father had died by accident and ireland had been the unwitting cause of his death brendon wondered how the old man could have carried the knowledge all these years without speaking he determined to have an interview with him but at last he knew the truth about the death in san remo it inculpated no one and he could not see how according to bawdsey it could be connected with the murder of mrs jersey chapter xxii who bawdsey was george read the remainder of mrs jersey's confession and then put it away even when he got to the end he could not connect the san remo crime with that of amelia square it was in his mind to see his grandfather and tell the story to him backed by the production of the confession but on second thought he decided to see bawdsey first he wired for an appointment and received a reply stating that bawdsey was going out of town at three o'clock that day but would be in his rooms till then george lost no time he called a cab and within an hour of receiving the answer to his request he was on his way to bloomsbury on arriving he found that the detective expected him and went to his room bawdsey was still in a disturbed state as he was most anxious to get down the country and to help lola out of her difficulty he received brendon irritably and in silence george saw that the man was all nerves and did not resent his sharp greeting he sat down and opened the conversation you are going down to see lola he asked of course i am much worried over her she may get into serious trouble over this freak well why not tell the judge she is insane at times then she will get off lightly would that be true asked the detective struck by the idea as true as most things she really is not accountable for her actions when she gets into these frenzies and in such a one she must have been to attempt the burglary poor soul i wonder how she is now oh she is not troubled much her spirits are as good as usual she hardly seems to realize the enormity of her offense how do you know asked bawdsey with a stare because i saw her last night you saw her i did after i left you i took the train to wargrove and had an interview with her you might have told me mr brendon said bawdsey in a wounded tone where would have been the use of that i can manage my own business i hope considering how i love her it is my business also george shrugged his shoulders well you see bawdsey it was your intention to see lola first i guessed as much so i stole a march on you bawdsey fenced i don't see how you can say that i can you know that lola was in this house on the night the woman died i presume so since she got the confession and she must have secured it to know where your parents were married well then knowing that you wished to get that confession yes i did said the detective and why not i desired to know if mrs jersey said anything about the san remo crime in it i can tell you that she did i have the confession bawdsey bounded from his chair where is it he asked in my rooms locked away i do call that a shame grumbled bawdsey you might have trusted me mr brendon might i would you have trusted me i do you know i do to such an extent as suits yourself but would you have shown me that confession had it come into your possession you are not showing it to me said bawdsey evasively that is not an answer but i'll show you the confession whenever you like come now would you have shown it to me since you have read it why ask me that question snapped the detective you know yes i know that you would have burnt the confession i know that to have a paper in existence which sets forth that mr bawdsey's true name is george rates is not to your liking i never did anything to disgrace that name mr brendon that is between yourself and your conscience replied george coolly and has nothing to do with me you are george rates bawdsey shrugged his shoulders there is no use denying it he said you have my wife's handwriting was mrs jersey really your wife she was we married soon after we left san remo she was hard up or she would not have married me and you went to the states we did there i took the name of jersey and tried a variety of things none of which came to any good then i left eliza why did you do that because she was a devil said bawdsey his face lighting up i tried all the means in my power to make her happy but she was always quarreling and nagging and lamenting that she had not married that vane your father mr brendon did she tell you about the murder it wasn't a murder protested bawdsey no she did not tell me but from a hint or two she dropped about getting money from mr ireland i guessed that he had something to do with it i came across to england and i saw him he told me the whole story did you get money from him i did not i am an honest man although you do not seem to think so i left all that blackmailing to my wife she came over to get money out of ireland he simply said that he would tell the whole truth and would call the woman velez as a witness about the dagger but that woman is dead oh no she isn't said bawdsey coolly lola told me that she was alive and still in san remo she could have made things very hot for my wife but failing ireland my wife mrs jersey we will call her had another string to her bow she heard how lord derrington denied the marriage and how you were living with your grandfather lockwood she went to derrington and i know the rest and you came to live in this house not at the time i went back to the states but as i could do nothing there i returned to england then i took up the private inquiry business and called myself bawdsey i came to see my wife she would not let me call myself her husband and as i had no great liking for her i agreed i was in this house for a few weeks and then i got my own diggings i saw as little of mrs jersey as was possible why was that well sir replied bawdsey frankly i didn't hold with the annuity she was getting in a word you disapproved of the blackmail that's a good useful word sir said bawdsey easily yes i did i never would take a penny from her and when i lived here during the few weeks i paid my board yes sir i'm an honest man george stretched out his hand and shook that of bawdsey heartily i am convinced you are bawdsey and i apologize for my suspicions but in some ways eh i didn't act very straight you mean well sir when one deals with a criminal case one can't be too careful i have had to tell lies sir and i say mr brendon cried the detective with a burst of confidence i would not have shown you that agreement i guessed that eliza would state who i was and i didn't wish you to think that i was connected with her why not well sir i fancied seeing what you know that you might suspect me of killing her no bawdsey as you have acted so fairly all through i am convinced that you are innocent on that score but why did you say that the san remo crime was connected with the death of mrs jersey bawdsey opened his eyes can't you see sir the stiletto oh you mean that the weapon used by lola was the same one as my father was killed with certainly mr brendon it belonged to seora velez the mother she gave it to lola for i saw it in her rooms before the death of mrs jersey and i recognized it from the description given by my wife but there are dozens of stilettoes like that one lord derrington showed it to me yes that's true enough but you see from what my wife told me i knew that she had got the dagger from the woman velez it wasn't hard to see when i dropped across a similar weapon in the room of a woman also called velez that it was the same now you see how it is that lola knew so much about the death of your father and how she and i came to talk of the matter how did you drop on the subject in the first place the name was enough for me i saw lola and i fell in love with her as you know then i remembered the name velez and got an introduction to her one thing led to another until i knew the whole story and she admitted that the stiletto was the one with which mr vane had been killed george thought for a few minutes tell me bawdsey he said at length did you suspect lola of committing the crime yes i did admitted bawdsey frankly you see she has a devil of a temper i never knew that she had gone to see mrs jersey on that night although i might have guessed it because of the way she tried to learn the whereabouts of the house you mean the crimson light her excuse was foolish i thought the other day when you stated it said george but when did you first suspect her when i picked up the stiletto i recognized it at once it was my intention to take it round to her so that she should not be incriminated but i was so upset as i said the other day that i forgot all about the matter when i did think it was too late for derrington woke up and put on his coat i wondered whether he would mention the stiletto to me but he never did because he knew nothing about it said george mrs ward stole it as i told you oh i see how it is now but i really did suspect lola i asked her if she was in the house she said that she had been although she denied it at first that's lola's way said george she always begins by denial how did you bring her to confess i threatened to identify the stiletto then she told the truth if it was the truth said bawdsey doubtfully oh i think so i don't believe she killed the woman but you know her temper yes i do but since she has got what she wanted the confession there was no sense in her committing a murder no i quite believe that she threw the dagger at mrs jersey's feet as she said it is just like one of lola's impulsive actions bawdsey scratched his head i wonder who did kill eliza he muttered if lola is innocent and i am innocent he looked at brendon i can't help you replied george rising the thing is quite beyond me it must have been some one in the house no replied bawdsey positively remember mr train heard a door close the front door some time about half past eleven that was you was it not no sir i did not arrive till close on twelve and mrs jersey was already dead the door must have been opened and closed by the murderer and he left just before i arrived but how could he have entered you alone had the latch key as to lola she slipped in while mrs jersey was dismissing her guests bawdsey shook his head i can't understand it sir of course there was another gentleman who had the house for a short time he looked meaningly at brendon george looked puzzled what do you mean he asked well sir began bawdsey with his invariable formula i don't like to mention names and i am sure what i say will go no further but there is mr ireland brendon started to his feet with an agitated face ireland oh no that is impossible he declared quite impossible why should he have a latch key after your grandfather's death he was in possession of the house for a time and the keys would be with him in handing them to lord derrington's agent he might have forgotten one it's improbable i don't think so it was a chance i think at first but when he knew that mrs jersey occupied the house he might have found the latch key useful to see her when he felt inclined i dare say she tried to get money out of him again but he refused her he did once said bawdsey meaningly but mr ireland was not so young as he had been and dreaded lest his accident should be known it was an accident said george much as i deplore the death of my father yet i acquit ireland of all blame but he didn't know she lived here until miss bull told him oh yes he did i'm sure mrs jersey would let him know that she was just round the corner she always kept in touch with useful friends but why should he kill her so suddenly well he might have heard that she had written out a confession or even about lord derrington's visit and then he would come round to ask her if she had incriminated him in her confession he would ask her for a sight of it not having it for she found the blue envelope empty after lola left she would deny that she had it the stiletto left by lola would be on the table what was more natural than for ireland to pick it up and kill her in a sudden access of dread remember mrs jersey could accuse him of the crime as it was known that ireland was jealous of your mother's marriage to vane oh there was plenty of motive as to his having refused her before he was getting old and thinking he might be brought to justice by her confession for he never knew when she would die or into whose hands it would fall he might have lost his nerve it strikes me that if he struck the blow he had a great deal of nerve said george dryly but you go on a lot of suppositions you suppose that ireland retained a latch key of this house that he knew mrs jersey had written out a confession that he knew my grandfather was coming on that night in fact that's all theory bawdsey i do not believe mr ireland had anything to do with the matter then who had asked the detective what would you say to margery what the niece that half witted girl exactly half witted she is more like an animal than anything human she gets these sudden fits of rage when miss bull fainted margery rushed in and threatened me with her fists seeing what an uncontrollable temper she had it occurred to me that she might have killed her aunt but miss bull says that the aunt locked the girl in her room of course but miss bull may know the truth and may be shielding margery she seems to have a strange affection for the girl what if mrs jersey to vary the story found margery down the stairs after lola was gone and instead of rebuking her as miss bull said in the passage at eleven o'clock mind later i think said george quickly you did not arrive till nearly twelve and the woman was just dead i don't think a few minutes would make much difference said bawdsey quietly but go on sir let me hear your theory well i fancy that mrs jersey caught margery down the stairs and took her into her own room to rebuke her quietly so that the rest of the house might not hear also she would be anxious to learn if the girl had overheard her conversation with lola if margery had she would assuredly have told miss bull mrs jersey would be afraid of that and i dare say she stormed at margery to make her speak but there could have been no row sir no one heard a disturbance oh the boarders are old and sleep lightly but i am bound to say i did not hear a disturbance myself said george reflectively mrs jersey may have argued quietly then as you say the stiletto was on the table margery goaded into action might with the sudden rage of a dumb animal might have well it's not impossible but about the door closing when margery saw what she had done pursued george still trying to guess what had taken place her first impulse would be to run away she would steal out and open the door i am pretty sure miss bull was on the watch and saw her she would draw the girl back and close the door at half past eleven as train heard then she would pacify margery and lock her in her bedroom after previously instructing her what to say next morning that is what i believe bawdsey it's a very pretty case murmured the detective and things might have happened as you say but if it is the case there is not much chance of learning the truth both margery and miss bull will be silent and after all my theory regarding ireland is just as good mr brendon george rose to go stick to your theory and i'll stick to mine he said smiling but what about lola well sir i'll go down with kowlaski and see her we will do whatever we can to get her out of her trouble and you sir oh i shall have nothing more to do with lola take her away to the states as your wife bawdsey and i will get my grandfather to give you the thousand pounds to start life on it's very good of you sir said bawdsey gratefully and you will try and persuade her to marry me yes she knows as i told her that register or no register my grandfather intends to recognize me as his heir therefore she is certain as she may well be that i shall marry miss ward she will gradually get over her fancy for me and will be quite content to take you bawdsey sighed i hope so i love that woman sir yet she is a violent woman almost as violent as your first wife yes assented bawdsey rather dolefully it seems as though i was always to fall into the hands of violent women what do you intend to do now sir leave matters alone bawdsey i don't want to learn who killed mrs jersey now i know about my father's marriage i shall change my name take my rightful one and have done with all this crime and mystery the yellow holly can go hang for me chapter xxiii the turning of the lane the proverb says that good luck comes to those who know how to wait it had certainly come to george brendon or as he was now called george vane lord derrington could not make enough of him after the interview with bawdsey the young man called at st giles square and related to his grandfather all he had learned the old man was much astonished i don't think ireland was to blame he said not even in holding his tongue after all the thing was an accident although undoubtedly that woman was the cause have you seen ireland not yet but i will soon then tell him from me that i don't consider he was responsible and that i quite believe from what i know of mrs jersey that he has told the entire truth i will sir answered george i suppose you mean that if he really committed the crime with malice aforethought mrs jersey would have blackmailed him lord derrington nodded approvingly you are what the scotch call 'quick in the uptake' george that is what i mean mrs jersey must have been afraid for herself or she would never have kept her claws off ireland's money she had plenty of mine added the old gentleman grimly bad lot george i quite agree with you sir poor bawdsey was honest however well lord derrington did not assent immediately to this if bawdsey had been really honest he would have asked me to be silent on the matter and need not have used threats however unwilling he was to carry them out no george bawdsey is like the serpent in the bamboo straight so long as it is kept in check i suppose he will marry the girl i think so he is madly in love with her i promised that you would give him a thousand pounds if he went to america the deuce you did said derrington wrathfully why not sir rejoined brendon calmly we want him out of our lives he knows too much better send him abroad so that he may not make any remark about this unpleasant family history lord derrington winced george certainly had rather an unpleasant way of putting things however the old man silently acknowledged the justice of the speech you are right he said but bawdsey ought to do something for his money you mean that he ought to discover the assassin yes i do whosoever killed that woman should be brought to justice george brendon looked down i think it will be best to let sleeping dogs lie sir he said significantly because of some scandal said derrington looking hard at him are you alluding to the possibility of mrs ward having killed her at this supposition george laughed right out no sir i don't think mrs ward would go so far as that she would were there no law to restrain her i dare say she has the instincts of a female despot but as there is a law she would not jeopardize her neck no i mean ireland derrington sat up nonsense do you mean to say he is guilty i don't think so but bawdsey has an idea and george related the theory of the detective derrington grunted in a disgusted manner the man's a born idiot he said why should ireland run the risk of getting his neck into a noose for a second crime if he thought that she would leave a confession behind inculpating him he would have waited to make certain i don't believe there is a word of truth in the matter however when you see him you can question him about his doings on that night i shall certainly do that replied brendon quietly but failing ireland and his guilt is presumed by bawdsey there remains margery that idiot of a girl yes george detailed his reasons for believing in margery's guilt again derrington sniffed it's all supposition if the girl came into the room if the stiletto were on the table if mrs jersey scolded her into a fury pah i don't believe it and you really wish to find the assassin i should like to know out of mere curiosity but if it is your opinion that things should be left as they are why bawdsey can take his thousand pounds and sail for america whenever he chooses but i grudge setting the rascal up in business added derrington who was still sore about the way in which he had been threatened after this conversation george took his leave dorothy was out of town so he could not visit her after the interview with ireland in derrington's library mrs ward had found it convenient to go down the country she felt that she was in an unpleasant position not that there was any danger of her being accused of murdering vane but if the police got hold of the story they might make inquiries in fact they certainly would make inquiries and then the disagreeable fact would come out that miss bull was her sister mrs ward knew that she had not behaved well to jenny and that if the truth were known her friends would blame her as mrs ward did not like blame and disliked to have her actions criticised she went down the country saying to dorothy she desired a change of air lord derrington wrote a note to mrs ward after george had departed i'll ask her to come up said derrington grimly as he sealed the letter george will return in three days with the copy of the marriage certificate and with news of how that case has been disposed of mrs ward shall apologize to him and formally consent to the marriage dorothy shall come also and walter derrington rubbed his hands chuckling he was rather anxious to see walter's face when he heard that he was no longer the heir meantime george went with kowlaski and bawdsey to chelmsford to see after lola kowlaski was in despair as if lola received a term of imprisonment his ballet would be brought to an untimely end now that lola was out of the bill the hall was not so full as usual and kowlaski foresaw that if lola did not come back he would lose money he therefore went down prepared to spend a large sum to set her free but there was no need for fear lola was brought up before the magistrates and evidence was given as to her excitable nature the old sexton produced the torn register and detailed how he had been assaulted he thought the lady was queer himself kowlaski went into the box also bawdsey and george the result of their evidence as to lola's foreign ways was that the magistrate admonished her and inflicted a small fine this was triumphantly paid by kowlaski who returned to town with his principal dancer under his jealous eye more than that kowlaski made quite a story out of the events it was known in london that lola velez had been arrested as all the london papers copied the account of the trial which had appeared in the country press kowlaski put it about that lola had gone off her head owing to grief for her dying mother few people believed this but the public was so pleased to see the favorite again that she was saluted with cheers in a few days every one forgot about the matter which after all did not amount to much luckily it was not stated why lola had wished to destroy the register there were several marriage entries on the page and no one could say which of these she wished obliterated besides brendon got the magistrate to suppress the book and not let the press report the matter he accomplished this by telling the magistrate exactly how the matter stood so the judicial authority used his power and the fourth estate quailed everything was settled in a most satisfactory manner later on brendon had copies made of the marriage entry of percy vane bachelor and rosina lockwood spinster and brought them to his grandfather the old man read them carefully then laid down the paper with a sigh of relief i never thought i would be pleased to see that in black and white he said and are you pleased now of course i am you are to revive the glories of the derrington vane family they have faded of late but you sir he clapped his grandson on the back and george laughed at the old man's enthusiasm there is one strange thing he said after a pause seeing that my parents were married so near london i cannot understand how the marriage was not discovered before derrington looked thoughtful also it is strange he admitted but you remember the tale of poe's purloined letter people always look in the most unlikely places first and because the church was so near to town and nobody had replied to the advertisement they the searchers i mean must have thought that the marriage took place in some moorland parish where people never looked at the journals it was the very closeness of wargrove church to london george that prevented the certificate being discovered sooner i suppose you are right said brendon but it does seem strange everything in life is strange said derrington and not the least strange thing is that i kick out walter to make room for you by the way george he will be here soon have you told him yes and he wants to see you about the matter i said that he could in my presence what he has to say i don't know there is another reason for your remaining george mrs ward and her daughter are coming here she won't be pleased to see me said brendon oh i think she will after ireland put her in a corner she grew afraid and now she would like to see the matter settled at any price when she is your mother in law george keep her out of your house or there will be trouble you must stand sentinel sir she won't come near me then egad that's true she is afraid of me i hold that stiletto you see and i know about her doings at san remo the minx said derrington with great vigor i wonder that her daughter is so charming so good you mean said george fondly whereat derrington gave a sigh oh love love and again love said he it seems i am going to have a most sentimental time with you two be at rest sir neither dorothy nor i am sentimental we are too serious for that that's worse i hate serious lovers then we will be gay said george with a laugh don't overdo it replied derrington with a kindly smile be as you are both of you and i shall not complain ah here is walter well my boy have you come to see your new cousin walter vane entered the library with an injured air he looked neater and more fragile than ever and wonderfully old considering his years derrington looked from him to the fine figure of george with a queer look in his eyes no one would ever take you for relatives he said why they say we are like one another said walter mrs ward remarked on the likeness when we dined with her i wondered why we should resemble one another but it is explained now and walter cast a not unkindly look in his cousin's direction derrington snarled george is like me and you take after your father walter who was a shrimp if ever there was one george hastened to the rescue of his cousin it seems to me that the conversation is getting somewhat personal he remarked walter i hope you bear me no grudge for stepping into your shoes walter took the hand in his own limp grasp well of course it is hard on a fellow he answered in a rather whining manner but you and i got on well together so i would rather it was you than another fellow that train friend of yours for instance he's such a cad but a very good fellow for all that said brendon dryly oh people always say that of a fellow who has nothing to recommend him retorted walter but as you are to be the head of the family i am glad you are not a bounder that's very kind of you said george dryly and very silly of walter growled the grandfather what do you mean sir by talking rubbish is it likely that any one of my blood would be what you call a bounder no said walter pacifying the old man i only mean never mind what you mean it's sure to be something foolish this said derrington pointing with his cane to george is the future head of our family pay him all respect we'll get on capitally said george clapping walter on the back and what about my income asked walter you will have what you have now said derrington don't bother me about the matter you and george can settle it between you considering how he had been ousted walter really took things very calmly but he had not enough vigor to protest he sighed his grandfather had cowed him and walter profoundly admired his newly found cousin who did not hesitate to stand up to the despot he began to think it was a good thing that george had come into the family he would at least save him walter from constant bullying this interesting family council was interrupted by the entrance of mrs ward as pert and pretty as ever she had quite recovered her spirits and knowing that derrington would say nothing about the card cheating or about the san remo matter she was prepared to be as insolent as she dared but she was quite determined not to cross swords again with the old man like a burnt child she dreaded the fire derrington was altogether too much even for her as it was she came sailing in with the prettiest air in the world and held out both hands her head on one side like a sick canary my dear lord derrington how well you are looking how here her astonished eyes fell on george you said mrs ward aghast mr brendon and here not mr brendon said derrington enjoying her confusion but my grandson george vane dorothy who had remained below to give some instructions to the footman entered the room just in time to hear this announcement she flew to her lover my dearest george i am glad glad so glad and before them all she kissed him mrs ward screamed dorothy what manners very good manners said derrington coolly seeing that they are natural well mrs ward george my grandson and heir added the old man with emphasis has something to say to you really i shall be most happy to hear it george took his cue i have to ask you for the hand of your daughter dorothy he said looking very proud and manly as he stood with the girl's hand within his own really said mrs ward again i don't know i fancied that walter you see and she cast her eyes on the neat little man oh i scratch said walter in his elegant way there's no fighting against george he has all the luck you call him george why shouldn't i he's my cousin the head of the house when i go to my long home finished derrington well mrs ward do you consent to the match do mother said dorothy imploringly mrs ward sank into a chair and pretended to be overcome by emotion in fact she did this merely to gain time as she did not wish to answer too quickly it was plain that walter whom she had wished dorothy to marry took in her own phraseology a back seat george was promoted vice walter resigned george would be lord derrington and would have the money he was an obstinate man certainly and would be difficult to manage still she might be able to get the better of him she could always work him through dorothy if dorothy would only get over her absurd notions of religion and all that sort of thing on the whole mrs ward thought it was best to agree knowing what derrington knew and how obstinate both lovers were she did not see very well what else she could do however she made the most of her compulsory surrender after a few sighs and having squeezed a few tears she cried to her daughter in a muffled voice expressive of deep emotion dorothy my dear child dorothy with a look at george went and knelt down by her mother's chair she was not the dupe of this play acting but knowing that her mother would insist on making an effective scene wished to get it over as speedily as possible mrs ward put her hand on dorothy's shoulder in a maternal manner do you love george she asked yes said dorothy simply you know i love him george do you love my child i do replied george curtly while derrington surveyed this touching scene with a grim smile he always loved to watch the antics of mrs ward she believed in them so thoroughly herself and they deceived no one gifted with ordinary intelligence it is hard said mrs ward with a deep sigh to see a child leave its parent but you love her you have won her here she rose and raising dorothy from her knees gave her to george take her george and with her take a mother's blessing the idea of mrs ward's blessing was too much for walter and he went off into a shriek of laughter which ended in his leaving the room george was quite unmoved he thanked mrs ward and kissed dorothy then he took her to a distant seat near the window where they could talk sensibly lord derrington was left to console the afflicted mother this he proceeded to do immediately egad you did it well he said looking at the pretty woman i don't believe miss terry or mrs siddons could have done it better mrs ward flushed a little but still kept up the pose nature spoke my dear lord derrington i am aware that you consider nature vulgar i was not aware that i did i see so little of it that your scene touched me positively touched me mrs ward saw that it was useless to hide the truth from this keen eyed old man any longer oh don't be nasty she said plaintively and rustled up to him of course i wanted dorothy to marry walter but george does just as well i don't think she has made a bad exchange mrs ward he's good looking enough said the little woman but so serious and dull of course i suppose you'll allow him an income he shall have all that is necessary to keep up his position as my heir said derrington dryly i hope he and dorothy will live here the house is big enough and they won't have to pay any rent which is always a consideration isn't it oh i hope dear dorothy will be happy i shall see much of her much of my darling child no said derrington thinking it just as well to nip these plans in the bud you care very little about dorothy and you don't like george when they are married you must stop away as much as is consistent with your feelings i'll do what i like said mrs ward beginning to tap her foot no i don't think you will you threatened me in this room i was only playing a game protested mrs ward well i can play a game also mrs jersey has left behind her a confession in which she details how you managed to cheat your sister miss bull if you don't leave that couple severely alone i shall show the confession to dorothy you would never be so cruel oh yes i would replied derrington who had not the slightest intention of fulfilling his threat i never did anything to my sister mrs jersey tells lies derrington made a gesture of disgust there there he said what is the use of talking further things are settled when dorothy and george are married i'll see what i can do for you mrs ward's face became wreathed with smiles she was such a frivolous heartless little woman that she could change from one mood to another with wonderful rapidity oh thank you dear lord derrington she said artlessly and pressing his arm i know you are the most generous of men but i really can't stop talking here all day she rustled over to dorothy my darling i must go and do some shopping no you can stay here i will call again in an hour george she presented her cheek you can kiss your mother in law george did so delicately so as not to spoil the tint of the cheek mrs ward departed he's like a block of wood she said to herself never did a man kiss me so coldly before ugh the bear chapter xxiv a startling surprise having thus settled matters in a satisfactory manner with mrs ward and dorothy george sought out ireland the next day he passed a delicious hour with dorothy and they renewed the vows they had made when there was little chance of a bright future now the future was altogether bright and the two built castles in the air george was to marry dorothy they were to take up their residence with lord derrington and george was to enter parliament on the first opportunity but you must not neglect your literary work said dorothy the novel must be finished i hope that many novels will be finished said george laughing i will be like beaconsfield and write novels between whiles of politics it will be an amusement which will be the amusement asked dorothy both politics is an amusing game and when one has time to write what one pleases and at the pace one pleases that is amusing also you will be my inspiration my egeria that is very like beaconsfield replied miss ward he always called some unknown woman his egeria i am more lucky i know who my egeria is more talk of this light and fanciful kind passed it would have sounded foolish to sensible people but george and his beloved were so happy that they talked nonsense out of sheer lightness of heart at the end of the hour mrs ward carried off dorothy and george took leave of his grandfather it was the next day that he went to see ireland at the door he was informed that ireland had been very ill with his heart and that the doctor had been called in nevertheless ireland would not obey the advice of his physician and stop in bed he was up and dressed as usual and in his study george entered the large bare room papered with the gaudy advertisements and saw his former guardian seated at his desk as usual the man looked very ill his large placid face was extremely pale there were dark circles under his eyes and he even seemed to have grown lean his clothes hung loosely on him and he did not rise when george entered the young man knew that ireland must be ill to fail in this courtesy as he was extremely punctilious excuse me george he said with an attempt at cheerfulness but i am not so well as i might be you are looking ill very ill said george taking his seat ireland nodded i can't live long he remarked in his heavy voice so the doctor informs me my heart is extremely weak i may die at any moment george was shocked it's not so bad as that i hope he said it's as bad as it well can be for the last few days i have deviated sadly from my usual habits i have not taken a walk and my system of life is quite upset it's the beginning of the end he paused and sighed you are looking well george i have every reason to mrs ward has consented to my marriage with her daughter how is that well the church where my parents were married has been discovered ireland looked interested that is good news where were they married in wargrove church it is a parish in essex an hour's journey from town quite a small place ireland made the same remark that george himself had made strange he said that being so near town the place was not discovered before i have no doubt that your advertisement set many people hunting well i'm glad that the marriage has been proved at last both for your sake and in justice to the woman i loved to her dear memory she was rosina vane after all that has been proved beyond a doubt my grandfather has seen the copy of the certificate and now holds it is he pleased very pleased he is now as friendly toward me as he has been hitherto hostile ireland nodded breathing heavily i thought he would be he and i had a long talk about you on the day i called that was when i saw mrs ward and you can go on said george seeing his hesitation i know the whole story what story asked ireland suspiciously the story of what happened at san remo mrs ward i know was violet howard and her sister jenny is miss bull yes poor jenny she was the better of the two and now she drags out a miserable life in a london lodging house while violet who is a bad woman and the mother of dorothy interrupted george imperiously say no more sir you are quite right as i can't say good of the woman let me say no bad well you know how she loved your father i think she flirted with him but it was jenny who really loved and look at her reward said ireland with a deep sigh those who try to do their best always come off worst i loved your mother george and i have been a lonely man all my life it was a sad case george wished to get at the truth but he was so sorry for ireland who had passed so many miserable years that he did not like to inflict more pain nevertheless it was necessary to learn if ireland had really visited mrs jersey on that night so as to set bawdsey's mind at rest if george did not learn the truth bawdsey might attempt the discovery and he would handle the old man in a much worse manner than george was likely to do while pondering how he could set about his unpleasant task george was saved from making the first step always the most difficult by an observation from ireland which paved the way to an explanation how did you discover the church he asked idly in rather a queer way lola velez ireland opened his eyes which had been closed and looked up who is lola velez he asked anxiously she is a dancer whom i helped oh quite in a proper way mr ireland you know the name ireland contrary to george's expectation nodded there was a woman in san remo about the time of your father's death she was called velez and was in love with him he seems to have been a fascinating man said george smiling to set ireland at his ease but this lola is the daughter of the woman you mention it was she who found the church by this time ireland was quite awake and keenly anxious for details how did she learn its name he demanded quickly she found it in the confession of mrs jersey ireland snapped the paper cutter he was holding and leaning back in his chair looked anxiously at george what do you mean well replied the young man keeping his eyes fixed on ireland's face it seems that mrs jersey left a confession behind her as to what took place at san remo who has that confession i have i got it from lola and how did she manage to obtain it for answer george related how lola had called to see mrs jersey and how she had managed to steal the confession it was from reading it finished george that she learned of the church in which my parents were married desiring that i should marry her and thinking i would not do as were my birth proved she went to the church to destroy the registers she was caught with the torn leaves and arrested arrested yes i wonder you did not see the case reported in the papers i have been too ill to read the papers lately said ireland looking round the room in rather a helpless way and none of my servants told me what happened oh lola was let off with a small fine she is now back dancing at her music hall she gave the confession to me did any one else see it the authorities no you can set your mind at rest mr ireland i got it from lola before she was taken to prison no one had seen it but myself and lord derrington ireland drew a long breath of relief you made a strange remark just now george he said not looking at the young man you told me to set my mind at rest why did you say that i have read the confession said george quietly mr ireland rose from his chair and began to pace the room he seemed so weak that george wished him to return but the old man waved his hand impatiently it's all right it's all right he said then stopped opposite to george then you know i know that my father's death was due to an accident what did that wretched woman tell the truth she told the truth and she did not accuse me of having murdered your father no she did not i suppose she thought it was as well to go to her long home with as few sins as possible on her conscience but she certainly exonerated you thank god for that said ireland and returned to his seat then he looked at his visitor in a piteous manner george he said in faltering tones i have suffered greatly on account of that most unhappy accident i am sure you must have sir but don't let it worry you any more it was an accident and both lord derrington and i heartily forgive you for having been the unconscious cause of my father's death ireland nodded thank god again he said solemnly your father and i were not very good friends as i found it difficult to forgive him for having taken from me the woman i loved but at san remo we got on better together i stifled my resentment so that i might see as much of you as possible george knowing that i was not on good terms with vane i thought that mrs jersey might have accused me of the crime she did try to get money out of me so bawdsey told me bawdsey who is he i forget you don't know he is a private inquiry agent who has been looking after the case on behalf of lord derrington i learn from the confession of mrs jersey that he is her husband george rates i remember she told me she married him and went to america it was after her return from america that she tried to get money out of me i refused not that i did not realize the danger to which she could expose me but i knew that if i once yielded i would be in her power besides i had a defense as she got the stiletto from the woman velez and it was with that same stiletto that mrs jersey was killed by whom asked ireland did her husband no we do not know who killed her perhaps you may know i ireland looked genuinely surprised no how should i know well said george rather awkwardly it seems that bawdsey has got it into his head that you knew about this confession i did not that you were afraid it would be published after her death and that you went to the house on that night to get it i did not how could i have entered the house bawdsey thinks you had a latch key no all the keys were handed to lord derrington's agent when the house was sold in plain in words george this man bawdsey rates whatever he calls himself accuses me of the murder he doesn't exactly accuse you but i don't know what else you would call his statements but accusations retorted ireland with some heat but i never was near the house i certainly thought that mrs jersey might leave some such confession but i never asked her about it i never thought that such a healthy woman would die before me and i knew that sooner or later my bad heart would carry me off in spite of the regularity of my life then you cannot guess who killed her no i was never near the house i was in bed and asleep my servants will tell you so i need not ask them said george quickly i never thought you were guilty and i only came to receive your assurance so that i might tell bawdsey and prevent him troubling you if bawdsey comes here i'll soon make short work of him said ireland sharply i am not afraid you need not be mrs jersey's own confession exonerates you i don't mind even that i would have faced the worst had it to be faced i never was a coward except in one thing he paused and looked timidly at george i shrank from telling you how i was the unhappy cause of your father's death you were not the cause in my opinion mrs jersey was the cause well i thought you would shrink from me did you know all i do know all and i do not shrink from you replied george leaning across the desk to shake ireland's hand it was a pure accident and has been related by your enemy i am so glad the truth is known to you at last faltered the old man and that you see how unconsciously i caused the death you are her son george the son of the only woman i ever loved of the woman for whose sake i have remained lonely all these years had you condemned me his emotion prevented him from saying more george grew alarmed by his pallor please think no more of the matter mr ireland he said you are ill go and lie down yes i'll lie down ireland leaned heavily on george's arm i shall lie down for ever but i am glad you know i am glad you are not angered we are the best of friends mr ireland you have always been kind to me and i am sure my dead mother blesses you for all your goodness to her orphan boy rosina rosina murmured ireland how i loved her you have her eyes george and her kind nature come let me get to bed soon the curtain will drop i am afraid my visit has been too much for you no i am glad you came i am glad you spoke out i always intended to do so but i feared lest you should blame me by this time they were ascending the stairs george conducted the old man to his room and sent for the doctor ireland undressed and got to bed then he insisted on george leaving him but you are ill protested the young man i am dying but what of that i am glad to die i shall meet rosina again after long long years of sorrow go george we understand one another and you have forgiven me there is no more to be said there is nothing to forgive replied george softly then to humor his old guardian he departed a strong grip of the hand was exchanged between them george left the room and saw ireland lying as still as any corpse only his lips moved and they murmured continuously rosina rosina he was true to the woman he loved to the very end george left the house as there was nothing he could do but he intended to call in again meanwhile he repaired to amelia square to see bawdsey derrington wished him to tell the detective to stop looking after the case and discharge him from his employment in his pocket george had a check for one thousand pounds and when this was paid the whole case was to be relegated to obscurity now that derrington was reconciled to his grandson he was anxious for obvious reasons that the sordid tragedy of mrs jersey's death should not come to light he had not played a very respectable part in it himself and moreover he did not wish that confession published it would only be a case of washing the family linen in public and both george and he agreed that this was undesirable the sooner bawdsey married lola and went to america the better derrington thought and for his own sake bawdsey would hold his tongue seeing what a close connection he was of the dead woman bawdsey was at home and saw george at once he looked rather excited and could hardly keep his seat well mr brendon he asked what is it i should rather ask you that said george you seem excited not very only i have been fortunate in some business and what is the business i'll tell you that later what is yours a pleasant one rejoined george here is the check for one thousand pounds which my grandfather promised you marry lola and go to the states and stop searching for the assassin of mrs jersey thank you replied bawdsey taking the check eagerly your grandfather is a prince mr brendon as to the case why should i stop searching you will never find the assassin pardon me said bawdsey in high glee i have found the assassin yes as george uttered an ejaculation miss bull killed mrs jersey chapter xxv the truth george stared at the triumphant detective in surprise it seemed impossible that what he stated could be true miss bull was the very last person whom brendon would have accused no one had been more candid than she had been and no one at the time of the discovery of the crime had done more to help the detectives you must mean margery said george after a time no i don't replied bawdsey in a determined voice i mean that little white old woman with the black eyes miss bull or as you know her miss jenny howard but what reason ah that's a long story she shall tell you herself have you had her arrested not yet but she will be arrested before the end of the day i have already communicated with scotland yard george rose and walked to the window he felt irritable and upset now that the truth had come to light he wished that bawdsey had not been so confoundedly interfering and the detective's next words annoyed him still further it was your idea about margery that put me on the scent he said with great complacency though to be sure i had my suspicions before it was to watch miss bull that i came here what made you think that she was guilty she has confessed in the calmest manner too that i mean before why did you suspect her well it seemed to me that she was the only person who could have killed eliza she and eliza hated one another because of their mutual love for your father george groaned what a lot of trouble his father had caused with his handsome looks and charming manners even after his death the fatal attraction he exercised seemed to bring about disaster she did not kill mrs jersey on that account he said wait till you hear she will tell you in fact she asked me to send for you as she wishes to speak where is she now in the famous sitting room playing patience doesn't she realize the peril of her position in a way she does but she seems quite ready to face the worst poor woman said george thinking of the sad life which the old maid had led if she has sinned she has suffered if people will use knives in that way they must be punished was the rather harsh retort of bawdsey don't talk stuff bawdsey you have your own sins to think of i never committed murder no one said you had but you may do so before you die bawdsey shuddered i hope not mr vane he said i don't know why you should say such a thing i am an honest man you say that so often that i shall begin to disbelieve it replied brendon rather cynically but if you marry lola either you will kill her or she will kill you i'll take my chance of that and if you george made an impatient gesture with his hand and returned to his seat never mind further chatter let me hear how you came to learn that this poor creature struck the blow if you talk that way of a criminal mr vane what will you say of a good woman my good man there is more joy over a sinner that repenteth but miss bull doesn't repent said bawdsey i'll hear the story before i give an opinion on that point you say that it was some remark i made which yes it was said bawdsey eagerly and throwing himself into a seat your remark that margery might be guilty one moment interrupted george in his turn i may tell you that i have seen mr ireland and he declares that he never was near the house on that night that he knew nothing of the confession and that he had no latch key he is innocent now that i have heard miss bull i know that sir she's the one well and how did you find out bawdsey cleared his throat and began with a most important air i rather agreed with your idea that margery might be guilty he said and when i turned it over in my own mind i thought it more and more probable i therefore determined to get margery alone and work on her fears pah said brendon with disgust well sir retorted bawdsey shrugging his shoulders i had to get at the truth somehow and detective's work is not all so honorable as novelists make out i got margery alone and how did you set to work well it was this morning in the sitting room miss bull had gone out and had left margery to make up some accounts the girl was laboring away at them and getting into a hopeless mess i came to speak with her and offered to do them i soon put the accounts to rights and then began to talk of miss bull why of miss bull why bawdsey pinched his lip i thought at the time that margery was guilty and that if in talking to her i laid the blame on miss bull that the girl would speak out you traded on the poor wretch's friendship bawdsey i'm ashamed of you i'm ashamed of myself replied the detective penitently but lord bless you mr vane one gets used to this sort of thing in our business the means justifies the ends far more than in religion i certainly don't think it justifies any end in religion said george sharply well you accused miss bull of the crime in a way i did margery denied it what did you say that she might as well confess i declared that i had evidence to prove miss bull's guilt and that she would be arrested when she came back i declare mr vane i thought that girl would strike me she was like a wild cat i wish she had growled george whose generous spirit was revolted by the use bawdsey had put margery to she said if i arrested miss bull she would kill me i said 'as you killed your aunt' she up and said 'yes i did kill her miss bull is innocent and you know she is' of course when she admitted the fact i at once began to suspect miss bull why did you do that because if margery had been guilty she would not have owned up but if miss bull was guilty margery would certainly take the guilt on herself poor girl murmured george there is something noble in that dull soul bawdsey could not see this and mentally disagreed with it however he did not want to argue down brendon's too tender conscience so he went on with his recital while margery was threatening me and taking the guilt on herself miss bull came in that stupid girl ran to her and fell at her feet crying that i knew all but that she would die for her dear miss bull and what did the woman say she asked me if i knew i said i did she demanded how i found out i told her that that was my business she began to smell a rat and suspected that i was bluffing she would have held her tongue but margery was in such terror for her friend that she came out with the whole story miss bull tried to stop her but margery kept repeating that she would die for her dear miss bull and so let the cat out of the bag the girl is half witted all this may not be true oh yes it is when miss bull saw that the game was up she sat down and admitted that she had killed mrs jersey she also said that she was glad the truth had come to light that she wished to die and so on she was raving said george incredulously not thinking any one would incriminate himself or herself so freely no she wasn't she told me the whole story in the calmest manner just as though she were asking me to have a cup of tea then she asked me to send for you and sat down to play patience i wonder you are not having her watched said george with scorn oh she won't run away replied bawdsey easily and not perceiving the irony of the remark come along mr vane we'll go down and see her she is desperately anxious to see you do any of the boarders know not yet but they will when she is arrested george shuddered and followed bawdsey down the stairs it seemed terrible to him that such a fragile little creature as miss bull should be subjected to this disgrace he did not condone her crime she had acted wrongly and must take the consequences but he could not forget that she was dorothy's aunt and he wished he could see some way of rescuing her from this dreadful position miss bull was as bawdsey had stated playing patience seated at the very table where her victim had sat she dealt the cards and seemed quite interested in the game margery was seated in a chair near at hand looking with tearful eyes into the face of her friend beyond the fact that miss bull was whiter than usual she showed no signs of emotion you have come george she said addressing him by his name i am glad to see you mr bawdsey you may go the detective was taken aback and would have remonstrated but margery rose and approached him you have done your worst she said her eyes flashing go or i'll twist your neck bawdsey shrugged his shoulders and with a glance at george went out after all he had heard the story before and did not particularly care to hear it again besides bawdsey was a kindly man and he felt sorry that he had proceeded to such extremities miss bull shuffled her pack of cards and laid them away in a box i shall play that game no more she said i have been playing patience all my life but the end has come and i am glad it has come hush margery for the girl had burst into tears i will see that you are left well off and looked after my dear i don't want that i want you sobbed the girl she slipped to the floor and laid her head on miss bull's knee like a faithful dog miss bull patted her head and allowed her to remain in this position while she spoke to george margery sobbed for a time and then remained quiet listening to every word and quite content to feel the gentle hand of the old maid smoothing her hair i suppose you were astonished when mr bawdsey told you said miss bull looking with piercing eyes at brendon i was i never thought that you you that i would kill mrs jersey finished the woman quietly why not she was a bad wicked creature and caused the death of your father she boasted of it where when asked the astonished young man in this very room in my presence but to make you understand i had better tell you all one moment miss bull when you told the fortunes on that night did you intend to kill mrs jersey no the death card did turn up that was a strange coincidence george when i came down the stairs i had no more idea than you of killing the wretched woman what made you do it i am telling you replied miss bull folding her hands on her lap wait and hear mrs jersey was very rude to me on that night i intended to remonstrate with her she added insult to injury by locking margery in her bedroom so as to keep her from me i heard her scolding margery in the passage and when all was quiet and mrs jersey had gone down the stairs i went up to margery's room and unlocked the door mrs jersey had struck the poor child and she was sobbing on her bed i then determined to go down for the second time and see mrs jersey for the second time were you down before i was replied miss bull calmly i wondered who mrs jersey had coming to see her particularly after she had lost her courage when she saw the yellow holly in your coat you noticed that yes and i noticed the holly also i wondered why you wore it the sight of it put into my mind that fatal night when he miss bull brushed aside her thoughts but no matter i thought i would see if mrs jersey was seeing any one and also i wished to talk about the yellow holly but why should you trouble about her seeing any one miss bull looked down and then looked up abruptly mrs jersey would have sent me back to the asylum if she could and i was always afraid lest she should see some one secretly about the matter i crept down the stairs leaving margery in my room playing at patience mrs jersey's door was closed i heard the murmur of voices and i put my ear to the keyhole i heard that dancer afterward i learned that it was the dancer i heard her accuse mrs jersey of having killed percy vane on what grounds did lola base that accusation she said her mother told her i remember muttered george the mother on receiving back the stiletto certainly might have thought so and what did mrs jersey say he asked aloud she denied it and made some sort of excuse i remained to hear no more i knew then that mrs jersey had killed my percy but she did not it was an accident i know she explained but she was the cause i was right to kill her but for her percy would have been alive i would have been his wife and you george would have been my step son what did you do next i went up to my room and resumed my game of patience i intended to have a talk with mrs jersey the next morning but when i found that she had struck margery i came down at once that was after eleven about a quarter past mrs jersey was in her room we talked and i told her what i had heard she denied it i pointed to the stiletto which was on the table as a proof that the girl had been here mrs jersey said that it was the same stiletto with which percy had been killed as lola had received it from her mother that put the thought into my head that god intended mrs jersey should be slain with the same weapon with which my darling had been stabbed a terrible thought you should have put it away i did but it came again i accused mrs jersey of having killed percy she gloried in the fact that it was through her he had died she declared that if ireland had not held her hand she would have laid him dead at her feet she exulted that the accident had fulfilled her intention and taunted me with the fact that i never became his wife i was very quiet added miss bull her eyes glittering but my blood was boiling mrs jersey turned her back on me with an insolent laugh and sat down the stiletto was on the table her head was turned away i softly took the dagger and no no cried margery wailing you never did it you never did it dear miss bull it was i who don't be a fool child i did it and i would do it again miss bull rose george you now know all go no do not shake hands i have avenged your father and i expect i will be hanged margery burst out into renewed weeping and miss bull soothed her talking to george the while tell my sister she said that the name of howard will not be mentioned i will die under my false name no disgrace will be brought on her as to dorothy here miss bull's eyes grew tender no disgrace will befall her marry her george love her make her a good husband and take this kiss to her from a sorely tried woman before the astonished george knew what she was about he felt a pair of cold lips pressed to his own the next moment she had pushed him out of the room and had locked the door that was the last george saw of her whether margery had agreed to die with her or whether miss bull knowing what a miserable life the girl would lead after her death compelled her to take the poison it will never be known but when the door was burst open the two women were found on the floor in one another's arms on the table was an empty glass and it was ascertained that miss bull and margery had taken prussic acid bawdsey entered the room an hour after the death alarmed by the silence he found that his prey had escaped miss bull was buried under her false name and margery was buried with her nothing of miss bull's sad past or of her killing of mrs jersey came to light she passed away with her only friend and her story was told six months later george vane was seated in the library of the mansion in st giles square it was after dinner and lord derrington occupied his usual chair the old man looked brighter and happier than he had looked for many years daily george grew a greater favorite with him and on the morrow george was to be married lord derrington had insisted that as it was his last night as a bachelor george should dine alone with him and would not admit even walter it's the last time i'll have you all to myself george said the old man piteously after to morrow dorothy will possess you not at all replied george you will have us both we will come back from the honeymoon in a month and then we will live here that's all been arranged said derrington testily but we won't be two independent bachelors all the better replied his grandson cheerily a lady in the house will make a lot of difference you won't know this place when dorothy is flitting about don't her mother is the kind of woman who flits and i won't have her doing the butterfly business in that way oh i don't think we'll be troubled much with mrs ward since the shock inflicted by her sister's sad death she has become religious bah that's only a phrase poor miss bull said derrington i like to think of her under that name she had a sad life i don't wonder she killed herself do you think she was mad george no but i think the memory of her wrongs which were all caused by mrs jersey was too much for her she was mad for the moment but she told me the terrible story in the calmest manner and who came in at the front door that night asked derrington no one after the murder miss bull opened it to fly panic struck i expect but margery came downstairs and stopped her miss bull closed the door and remained to face the worst well she is dead and buried and the scandal is laid at rest unless that bawdsey revives it oh you can trust bawdsey said george smiling he and lola are quite happy and she has almost forgotten me i got a letter from bawdsey the other day he is acting as his wife's agent and they are making a lot of money all the better he won't talk about that business by the way i forgot to ask you about ireland's money the money he left to me i have settled that on dorothy how suddenly he died said george reflectively just an hour after i left the house i hope his end was peace i think it was as he felt relieved that you and i had forgiven him there was nothing to forgive it was an accident and if any blame is due it is to that jersey woman well she is dead and the woman who killed her is dead so let them all rest in peace but it was good of ireland leaving me his money i don't see who else he had to leave it to and five thousand a year is not to be despised have you settled it all on dorothy every penny don't you approve oh yes so long as mrs ward doesn't get it she's a reformed character why the other day she told me that she considered dorothy irreligious pah new brooms she'll soon grow weary of that pose when the effect of poor jenny howard's death wears off she will be as gay and silly as before don't have her in this house that's all you can depend upon that sir but dorothy will be here dorothy whom i shall see to morrow crowned with orange blossoms and derrington laughed but not unkindly well well better orange blossoms than yellow holly george nodded i hope never to see yellow holly again he said and derrington agreed so their conversation ended on the threshold of george's new life with that last reference to the old the end

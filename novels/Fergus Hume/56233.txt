minutes past the hour this was not the fault of the branchline authorities the london express had been behind time at werry junction whereby the local had been forced to wait the delay mattered little to the majority of the passengers as time in the wilds of essex is of less value than a similar commodity in the metropolis but dr jerce being a famous urban physician felt annoyed as he had come down hurriedly in this unpleasant weather to see a patient and wished to be back in harley street by nine oclock also dr jerce was napoleonic in his love for precision and the failure of the company to obey the timetable irritated his usually bland temper jerce was not unlike the great corsican in looksthat is he was short and stout calm in his manner and impenetrable in expression his cleanshaven face classical in outline save that the jaw was of the bulldog order did not betray his present feelings of exasperation at the pinprick of delay when the belated local finally steamed leisurely into the terminus he buttoned his sablelined coat adjusted his shining silk hat and dusted unnecessarily his smart patent leather boots so unsuitable to the season finally with the same imperturbable air he collected the christmas magazines he had been reading on the way down and stepped on to the thronged platform a man in a grey coat grey gloves grey trousers and a grey homburg hat leaped from the adjoining carriage and followed closely at the heels of the popular physician jerce did not turn his head as no sixth sense told him that he was being watched it wanted only a week to christmas and the weather was quite of the traditional dickens kind deep snow almost overwhelmed the quaint little essex town and this hardened by many nights of frost sparkled like jewels in the clear radiance of streetlamps and shoplights the short winters day drew to a bitterly cold close and although the pedestrians crowding the narrow twisted streets were for the most part warmly clad many of the more sensitive shivered in the cutting east wind but jerce having a sufficiency of flesh to cover his bones and a furlined overcoat to protect that same flesh stepped out briskly and comfortably without regard to the chills of the season the man in grey followed him at a respectful distance keenly observant the shops already decked for yuletide looked unusually lavish with their blaze of lights their mistletoe and redberried holly branches and their extra display of santa claus presents and christmas provisions but the doctor did not look at the glittering windows nor did the man in grey jerce who appeared to be well known nodded smilingly right and left to respectful townspeople and his follower took note of this popularity finally the physician turned down a somewhat dark sidelanefor it was not yet an official streetand entered an iron gate on the lefthand side some distance down this admitted him into the grounds of a large square georgian mansion of mellow red brick covered with ivy and snow and looking like a house with a history the watcher was compelled to remain outside the high iron railings as he was unable to give any plausible reason for entering when jerce rang the bell and finally disappeared inside the mansion the grey man muttered an impatient word or two and resigned himself to sauntering up and down the lane until such time as the doctor should emerge but the air was nipping while the man in grey was thin and thinly clothed shortly he began to shiver and turn blue glancing down the semilane where it led into the truly rural country he noticed the brilliant lights of an ambitious inn measuring with his eye the distance from the georgian mansion to this hostel the man in grey saw that he could shelter therein and yet keep an eye on the gate out of which the doctor presumably would come the opportunity was too tempting crossing the road he entered the bar which looked warm and cheery jerce would scarcely return to london for an hour or so therefore the watcher thought that with an occasional glance out of the barroom door he could very well keep guard over the doctors comings and goings but the first thing he did when inside was to demand a bradshaw lor now prattled the lady behind the counter in a thin mincing voice the very ghost of speech and with restless volubility if i didnt see it only an hour ago yes i did say what you like mr ferdinandthough to be sure you dont know himbut mr ferdinand came in for a scotch and polly and asked to look up the london trains for this evening he had that bradshaw in the private bar if i remember which i cant be certain through that door sir if you please im sure ill be able to oblige though i cant be positive when this incoherent speech terminated the thin stranger passed through a narrow door in a partition plastered with gaudy almanacks and sober advertisement sheets to enter a small cupboard cut off from the bar by the aforesaid partition it contained two deal chairs a deal table covered with a red cloth and strewn with newspapers and guide books and nothing else dimly lighted by a smelling swing lamp dangling over the table and better illuminated by a bright fire it looked comfortable enough when contrasted with the snowy world outside the lady who talked so much suddenly appeared from somewhere like a jackinthebox and after turning up the lamp poked the fire vigorously and unnecessarily chattering all the time you see sir only the gentry come to this private bar she said in her highpitched voice and taking stock of the stranger all the time and theres no gentry hereabouts tonight mr ferdinandbut you dont know him of course but mr ferdinand and a pleasant young gentleman he is was the last to look at that bradshaw oh yes you were asking for it sirof course you were though where it can be i cant say happy as id be to oblige you but the table is so very untidy sir making it worse by tossing about papers and books and pamphletspeople wont leave things where they ought to and this bradshaw which is a new oneoh here you are sir youll be sure to find the train you want or perhaps the local timetable she snatched up a pink sheet which is published as an advertisement by my uncle who keeps the bakers shop on the left hand side of our high street going towards the station oh you prefer bradshaw sir well sir some likes this and some that but i never never could understand bradshaw myself my head for figures not being like my brother who is truly wonderful and quite a phenomenon figures is childs bricks to him andoh theres someone asking for beer youll excuse me sir wont you with a winning smile ill attend to this customer and return when i set lydia to watch the others with these highly unnecessary remarks to a wearied listener the brisk landlady who was thin and small tightlaced and highlycoloured disappeared as suddenly as she had presented herself and was heard a moment later exchanging interminable greetings with the last person who had entered to toast the season the man in grey shrugged his lean shoulders and breathed a sigh of relief when mrs talkative departed shortly he nodded contentedly over the bradshaw the next london train did not leave crumel until seven oclock so if dr jerce intended to go to town on this night he would have to be at the station at that hour of course there was a chance that the doctor might remain but the grey man did not think that this was likely as he had observed the absence of a bag still it was as well to provide against emergencies and when the landlady returned the stranger asked a question in a deep grave voice which suggested in some uncanny way cemeteries and funerals i may have to remain here tonight said he surveying the brightlydressed wouldbe fashionable lady can i have a bed please with all her frivolous exterior the little woman had a head for business and first glanced round the room to see if the visitor had brought a bag he guessed the meaning of her hesitation i shall pay for a bed and for two meals in advance he remarked solemnly that is if i find it necessary to remain missmiss there now giggled the hotel fairy pleasantly confused if i aint always saying to lydiawho is the housemaidthat strangers will call me miss though i should look married having heard the wedding service three times and the funeral words as often my last name was dumps if you please sirjohn dumps and a dear man he was though not extraordinarily handsome he left me this hotelthe savoy hotel added the landlady with emphasis and you can call me mrs dumps the grave man listened impassively with his keen eyes on the airy female so gorgeously arrayed he might have been of bronze for all the impression this speech seemed to make yet it conveyed to him the idea that mrs dumps was a confirmed gossip and sufficiently free with her tongue to tell him everything he wished to know concerning crumel and its inhabitants making a mental note of this the grey man reverted to his first statement i shall pay in advance mrs dumps he remarked and the price seven shillings for supper and bed and breakfast i cant say fairer than that look as you like mrmrlor now i dont know your osip is my name interrupted the man and tendered two halfcrowns and a single florin mrs dumps clawlike fingers closed on the money in a way which suggested the miser osip really osip a strange name osip i am a strange man replied the other curtly would you mind getting me a glass of ginger beer mrs dumps oh mr osip really mr osip surely port or whiskey at christmas let alone the freezing weather and the frost causing thirst i never drink alcohol mrs dumps lor now said the landlady confidentially if you arent exactly like me on the mothers side as i come of a fullblooded family given to choking and apoplexy i dont believe in strong drink myself mr osip say what you like then why sell it was the not unnatural question i must live said mrs dumps plaintively then to avoid further remarks she hopped into the bar like a wren although her plumage was less sober presently she returned with the ginger beer and wont you take something to eat mr osip she asked with her fashionable head on one side more like a bird than ever no thank you osip paused then faced her abruptly i am a stranger in crumel and i think of taking a house here do you know of any to let mrs dumps my cousin does mr osip arthur grinder grocer and landagent with an insurance office and a dogcart in which he drives round our beautiful and interesting country all orders osip cut mrs dumps short in her description which was evidently culled from the local guidebook or from one of mr grinders pamphlets i shall see him tomorrow if i stay said he hurriedly but surely mr osip youll stay seeing you have paid circumstances may arise which may make it necessary for me to return to london tonight but i can afford the loss this speech made the landlady sweeter than ever apparently the stranger was rich so she prepared to make herself aggressively agreeable if you become one of us chirped mrs dumps more like a roguish bird than ever i dare say youll like to know about the town osip sat down near the fire and folded his arms information of that kind has its advantages he said dryly can you tell me anything about crumel and its inhabitants can i tell echoed mrs dumps shrilly contemptuous why i was born and bred here it is thirty years since i saw the light of day in dear crumel thirty years repeated mrs dumps challenging contradiction which she seemed to expect with regard to her age osip might have suggested with some truth that she was over forty but he did not judge it wise to interrupt the flowing current of her gossip nodding gravely he looked into the fire and mrs dumps talked on rapidly reverting again to the guidebook or to the pamphlet of mr grinder who was her cousin crumel explained mrs dumps breathlessly has three thousand inhabitants more or less chiefly less and the surrounding country is dotted with the delightful residence of welltodo gentry formerly the place was called legby in the time of charles the first but when general cromwell visited the then village during one of his wars the prosperity increased so greatly through his having made it his headquarters that the inhabitants in compliment to the great man called the then village cromwell which by time has become corrupted to crumel very interesting yawned osip visibly bored the minster is tenth century and very fine continued the guidebook and also low church the vicar being the rev nehemiah clarke who is quite a puritan out of compliment no doubt to cromwell or crumel to whom the town formerly the village of legby owes its greatness and they do say continued mrs dumps dropping the guidebook to become merely a gossip that mr clarkes daughter miss prudencedid you ever hear such a name sir and she isnt a bit prudent well then miss prudence would rather her pa was high church i dare say mr ferdinand who loves miss prudence would like it also he being quite artistic you have mentioned mr ferdinand several times mrs dumps who is he an orphan and so is his sister miss clarice bairdwealthy orphans too mr osip i assure you and mrs dumps nodded vigorously osip showed that he was becoming weary of this conversation since he was not gathering precisely the information he required abruptly he changed the subject in this lane street interpolated mrs dumps indignantly very good street and nearly opposite to this inn hotel if you please mr osip the savoy hotel so be it mrs dumps well then in this street and nearly opposite to the savoy hotel there is a red brick mansion which i should like to purchase if it is for sale lor now how funny that is say what you like seeing its the very house where the baird orphans live alone mrs dumps oh dear me no sir they board so to speak with their guardian mr henry horran who suffers from some disease the doctors cant put a name to hes been ailing off and on for over ten years but the doctors cant cure him nohow not knowin whats wrong with his inside mr ferdinand ought to find out seeing hes lived with mr horran all his life though to be sure he aint old being but three and twenty mr ferdinand baird is not a doctor then he will be some day if his brains hold out hes a medical student and what you might call an apprentice to dr jerce ha said osip quickly your local doctor lor no whatever made you think that mr osip dr wentworths our local and he isnt bad though i know more about insides than he does but what can you expect as i always say when hes unmarried and cant understand ladies why sampson tait can cure better than our dr wentworth sampson tait our chemist explained mrs dumps my second cousin on my fathers side you seem to have endless relatives mrs dumps heaps and heaps and theyre always dying which makes mourning come expensive but im lonely all the same mr osip i do assure you as no one can live lightheartedly after burying three husbands of course theres my daughter zara but shes in london her pa had her christened sarah but zara to my mind is more romantic undoubtedly well then this dr jerce not to know him interrupted mrs dumps throwing up her hands is to argue yourself unknown hes famous in harley street london and they do say that hell be knighted some day soon a great day for crumel that will be as hes a native and were proud of him not that its to be wondered at for a better man never lived a better doctor said osip inquiringly a better man reiterated mrs dumps firmly hes kind to the poor and lavish with money and why with such a loving heart as i know he has he never will marry beats me hollow but they do say as he loves miss clarice though hell never get her say what you like she being engaged i do hear to a soldier officer called captain anthony ackworth who fires guns at gattlinsands five miles away on the seashore oh and is miss baird rich she will be and so will her brother when they and reach the age of five and twenty being twins though shes got the brains of the two mr horran is the guardian and looks after the money but since hes illand lord knows what his illness is abouti dare say dr jerce helps him to see that things are kept straight the bairds were a scotch family in the time of james the first added mrs dumps becoming again like a guidebook and that stuart king gave them lands about crumel then the village of legby the old manorhouse is three miles from crumel and is let to a rich american until the baird orphans prefer to live in it they meanwhile dwelling with mr horran who is their guardian by law constituted that is miss claricebless herlives with mr horran but mr ferdinand is usually in town where he boards with dr jerce who is like a father to him and i dare say would like to be a brotherinlaw not that hes likely to be so with captain ackworth in the way does dr jerce come down often once a week at least mr osip to see mr horran hes interested no end in the case but he dont know whats wrong with the man and dr jerce is a good fellow said osip thoughtfully one of the very best but wont you drink up your ginger beer sir and partake of some more we must rejoice at christmas time ill rejoice when i return said osip then rose unexpectedly and buttoned up his threadbare overcoat meanwhile ill stroll through the town and inspect the shops be sure you look into the butchers window screamed mrs dumps as he passed out he being my nephew by his mothers side osip made no reply but vanished into the night as mrs dumps fluttered back to the bar to charm fresh customers a clouded sky revealed neither moon nor stars but the hard snow emitted a kind of sepulchral radiance which created a luminous atmosphere by an odd inversion the light seemed to come from below instead of being shed from above as usual and the effect was weird in the extreme walking towards the redbrick mansion osip pondered over what he had heard from the chattering landlady and congratulated himself on securing information while not appearing to seek for the same opposite the georgian mansion he halted for a few seconds and as there appeared to be no one about he made up his mind to venture into the grounds noiselessly opening the gate he skirted the leafless hedge and reached the side of the house here he found two french windows giving on to a miniature terrace the blinds were not down nor were the curtains drawn so the lamplight poured forth across the snow in a gleaming stream osip cautiously peered in and beheld jerce talking to a pretty young girl whom he took to be clarice baird without hesitation he pressed his ear against the wall and listened with all his ears chapter ii an adventure i am extremely puzzled said dr jerce scratching his plump chin with his right forefingera favourite gesture of his oha clever man like you ahawhat pleasant feminine flattery the truth you are celebrated humph so is a charlatan if he advertises himself sufficiently charlatans dont cure people as you do doctornor can they ever hope to be knighted like someone i know well answered the stout man again tickling his chin i am not so sure of that humbug often succeeds where merit fails perhaps his little black eyes twinkled perhaps that is why i can look forward to being sir daniel jerce the girl looked closely into his bland face a charlatan would never confess to being puzzled in this case jerce shrugged and resumed a quarterdeck walk in the long drawingroom the archangel gabriel would be puzzled what can be the matter with uncle henry observed his listener pensively ask the archangel gabriel miss baird miss baird like a woman her train of thought switched up a siding jerce coloured all over his large waxen face and he gulped with embarrassment of course i have known you since you were a little girl he began awkwardly but she cut him short then why not call me clarice only too delighted he stuttered clarice then clarice now i rather think she laughed and wondering at the confusion of this usually selfcontained physician returned forthwith to the topic which had created this conversation what can be the matter with uncle henry she said again jerce became the medical man at once and shook his head ten years of attendance on horran have left me where i was at the beginning how strange everything connected with medicine is strange the human body is a box of tricks with which we play in the dark a box of bricks you mean as you please we doctors build up the bodies of the sick so i suppose flesh and bones muscles and nerves are the bricks but this casehorrans casehumph he resumed his walk with knitted brows yes quite so i confess that a postmortem would settle the matter clarice rose with a horrified look what a coldblooded speech he is your oldest friend forgive me science is not quite human at times of course i am here to cure horran not to kill him i should indeed regret losing my best and as you say my oldest friend but how can i cure a man when i dont know what is the matter with him what does dr wentworth say jerce looked at the girls pretty face and fairly laughed wentworth is not a prospective knight said he dryly which means that i dont wish to boast this time clarice coloured i beg your pardon doctor i know that you are everybody and that dr wentworth is nobody you live in harley street and attend to titled people while he works in a quiet essex town amongst the middleclass and the poor all the same she was determined to have the last word the mouse may be able to assist the lion i prefer a feminine mouse said the doctor smiling suppose you assist me by detailing exactly what has happened clarice leaned an elbow on the mantelpiece and absently ruffled her brown hair before replying mr horran has been complaining of headaches she said at length and once or twice he has been sick also on rising suddenly from a chair he has always felt giddy you tell me nothing new missi mean clarice for ten years horran has suffered in this way humph the attacks of giddiness have not been so frequent wentworth tells me no only every now and then humph and his behaviour well clarice hesitated he has been a trifle excited at times and by dr wentworths advice he gave up his one glass of whisky at night i see jerce once more scratched his chin alcohol excites him anything unusual seems to excite him doctor mr horran gets quite hysterical at times and is always thinking of his health hypochondria muttered jerce with his eyes on the ground and on this particular occasion didnt dr wentworth tell you mr horran fell down in an epileptic fit and bit his tongue we got him to bed and sent for dr wentworth who insisted upon wiring for you quite soquite so wentworth knows that i am deeply interested in this most mysterious case what do these symptoms mean whence do they arise i wish he cast a look on the girl no i wont suggest a postmortem again all the same only a postmortem can explain these things oh doctor do you think he will die no no there there the doctor patted her hand dont cry horran may go on living for the next twenty yearsas he is only fiftyfour i dont see why he shouldnt then you cant see death i cant see death or life or anything but a series of most puzzling symptoms which neither i nor wentworth nor the whole college of surgeons can understand however well drop the subject just now and think of tea oh doctor how can you think of food when when my patient is sleeping quietly why shouldnt i theres nothing to be done until he awakes then ill make another examination although i dont expect ill learn anything i return to town jerce consulted a handsome gold watch by the seven train it is very good of you to have come down so promptly not at all i would go to the ends of the earth at a moments notice to attend to so interesting a case ha ha coldblooded science again clarice you see come come let us say that i came willingly to see my old and valued friend henry horran doctor you are a great man flatteringvery flattering and why great men i have always read and heard will never spare anyone in their aim to attain their ends humph that is not quite so flattering and my ends you want to find out the cause of this trouble naturally i cant cure horran unless i do yes but you are more curious to learn the reason for the disease than to cure him you wrong me said the doctor quickly and to prove that you wrong me i shall assuredly cure horran if it be in the power of man to set him on his legs again now you had better go and have some tea and toast ill return to horrans room and see wentworth when he comes in i cant eat doctor said clarice making no motion to obey that is foolish starving yourself will not cure your guardian i dare say you are fond of him eh have you known me more than twenty years to ask such a question of course i am very fond of uncle henry he is the best of men i agree with you there said jerce earnestly but i dont think your brother agrees with you that is strange why so doctor you and ferdy are twinstwins may have the same likes and dislikes clarice laughed for a clever medical man that is certainly not a clever speech twins are often alike in looks and entirely different in disposition i am aware of that responded jerce calmly but i have always noted that you and ferdy think alike or did until lately that is because ferdy is removed from my influence said clarice sadly he always followed my lead but since he has gone to town to stop with you and become a student of medicine he thinks very differently from what i do naturally perhaps since he is seeing more of the world than i and is a man you should have been the man clarice and ferdy the woman i wish to do my best for your brother because he is your brother but jerce made a gesture of annoyance ferdy is so terribly weak dont be hard on him doctor she pleaded ferdy never got on well with uncle henry he gets on with no one my dear save with those people who pander to his weaknesses clarice clasped her hands and looked anxious doctor there is nothing very wrong with ferdy she asked faltering no no jerce stopped in his walk to pat her shoulder i look after him as much as i can yet i must not disguise from you clarice that ferdy iswell rather wild rather wild echoed the girl he frequents musichalls and goes with people who make pleasure their aim in life also he has sometimes been the worse for alcohol these things clarice do not lead to peace or to greatness the girl sat down and covered her face when ferdy came down yesterday i noticed that he was not himself he seems to have something on his mind jerce shrugged his shoulders i dare say he is ashamed of himself cant something be done if i spoke no my dear said the doctor very decidedly you will only make matters worse ferdy for the last twelve months has been out of leading strings and if you try however delicately to lecture him he will only become obstreperous but you need not be alarmed ill do what i can i would do much for you clarice there was a note in his voice which made the girl look up the usually pale face of the doctor was red and his eyes had a look in them which she was woman enough to understand rising with a nervous laugh clarice grappled with the situation at once she did not wish to lose her amiable companion in a disappointed suitor do what you can for ferdy doctor and ill ever be yourfriend but suppose i friend doctor reiterated clarice steadily and withdrew the hand he had clasped too warmly i wonder stammered the medical man nervously if you understand exactly what i mean clarice smiled i should not be a woman else i understand and so i sayfriend there is someone else asked jerce chagrined clarice turned the leading question with an embarrassing laugh there is always someone else and in this instance the someone else is my brother ferdinand i rely on you to bring him to his senses well said jerce struggling back to calmness that may be difficult you see miss baird clarice no said jerce steadily never again until i have the right to call you clarice what right no no thats a foolish question she added hurriedly doctor doctor do not put your feelings into words let things remain as they are help ferdy and cure uncle henry and then and then he bent forward eagerly then i shall ask you to dance at my wedding replied the girl and fairly ran out of the room jerce was so determined that she could scarcely avoid hearing him speak plainer than she wished and if he did speak out the answer her emotion would force her to give him would inevitably create a disagreeable feeling if not a positive breach of friendship this was not to be thought of as jerce was necessary both to help poor weak ferdy baird and to cure henry horran of his mysterious disease discretion as clarice rightly thought was the better part of valour in this especial instance and therefore she deliberately ran away jerce was left alone naturally he thought that he was unobserved and the watcher at the window could see the various expressions which chased each other across his usually calm face judging from these jerce was annoyed that he had spoken so inopportunely the fruit was not yet ripe as he reflected after recalling the few words he and clarice had exchanged first he would have to bring ferdy back to the paths of virtue well what then clarice mighton the other hand she might not certainly she had laughed away his leading question but also she had invited him to dance at her weddingalso laughingly no there could be no one else and if jerce saved the two men in which she was most interested she might reward him by loving him as he wished to be loved thanks to the gossip of mrs dumps the watcher at the window knew well that jerce was dwelling in a fools paradise but it was not his intention or will to inform jerce of the gunner officer at gattlinsands five miles away by the seashore jerce even though presumably alone did not allow all his feelings to be seen on his face but he felt that the room was stifling in spite of its being a cold winters evening and opened the window to gain a breath of sharp air as he stepped out he was suddenly grasped from behind and the skilful exercise of a jujitsu motion placed him prostrate at the mercy of his assailant in the light of the drawingroom lamps streaming through the open window jerce could see that the man wore grey clothes he would have spoken or would have called for assistance but the grey man placed his hand on what is called adams apple and paralyzed by pressure the vocal chords jerce lay voiceless and motionless as though in a state of catalepsy while the man went systematically through his pockets with the dexterity of a thief in less time than it takes to tell the assailant had failed to find what he sought and rising quickly disappeared like a shadow or a ghost all the time he had spoken no word and had not allowed his face to be seen as his retreating feet scrunched the snow jerce too shaken to rise immediately lay where he was wondering what had taken place and wondering most of all why this very dexterous thief had gone through his pockets so thoroughly then he rose to his feet and found that his gold watch his not inconsiderable sum of money his rings and his silver matchbox were all safe evidently the assailant was no common thief he had desired to find something and had failed to find it but what that something might be jerce could not think when he came quite to himselffor the shock of the assault had somewhat stunned himhe rushed along the terrace and into the garden which was parted by a single iron railing from the lane but there was no one to be seen the man in grey had vanished swiftly into the night and jerce could no more guess in which direction he had gone than he could surmise why the man had assaulted him he stared from the elevation upon which he stood over the spectral wastes of snow and then turned to reenter for the moment it was in his mind to send for the police but he could give so scanty a description of his daring opponent that it hardly seemed worth while not even the cleverest detective could recognise the man from the mere fact that he wore grey clothes however just as jerce turned the corner of the terrace to reenter by the still open french window he heard the click of the iron gate as it swung to a tall figure walked briskly up the snowy path and seeing him at the corner of the terrace advanced towards him with an ejaculation of astonishment doctor exclaimed the newcomer bending forward to examine the features of the outraged man in the uncertain light i knew you were coming down but i did not expect to find you out of doors on this freezing night ferdinand gasped jerce and stretching out his hand he gripped the young man by his overcoat collar before baird could expostulate he was drawn unresistingly along towards the light streaming from the open window and jerce was looking fiercely at his tall form and grey clothes tell me why you knocked me down just now demanded the doctor much ruffled and short of breath ferdinand started back in genuine surprise i knock you down he repeated why doctor you must be out of your senses why on earth should i knock you down to search my pockets for some reason baird laughed at the monstrous charge do you accuse me of robbery oh no you took nothing but you searched me why and jerce looked closely at the handsome weak face of the spruce young gentleman but that you are a rabid teetotaler doctor said ferdinand with a shrug i should think you had been drinking i have been for the last hour at the vicarage seeing prudence and before that i visited mrs dumps savoy hotel to look up the last train to town tonight i have just returned and you accuse me of assaulting you its too ridiculous and baird annoyed at being kept standing in the cold began to fume like a spoilt child i tell you ferdinand that you knocked me down herewhere we are standing and searched my pockets thoroughly i recognise you by the grey overcoat you are wearing although you were clever enough to hide your face grey clothes eh mused ferdinand slowly there may be something in what you say after all a tall man in grey clothes hat and all passed me in the high street near grinders shop did you see his face asked jerce doubtfully yes i dont usually take notice of a mans face but this chap was a stranger here and looked like a londoner he had a lean face so far as i could seeyes and a small black moustache andandoh yes doctor there was a crisscross scar on his cheek i fancy but of course he passed too quickly for me to observe him closely a scar on his cheek said the doctor loosening his grip humph i congratulate you on your rapid powers of observation only a woman could have gathered so much in one moment i ask your pardon ferdinand doubtless it was this fellow who knocked me down and here ferdinand looked round in our grounds what cheek i expected he wished to rob you if so he certainly did not fulfil his intention even though he had me at his mercy said jerce dryly and stepped into the room shall i go for the police doctor no well say no more about it my boy do you know this man asked baird puzzled i fancy i do if you describe the scar accurately oh it was a crisscross scar right enough but if he did not rob you or wish to rob you why did he go through your pockets that said jerce with emphasis is as much a mystery to me as it is to you chapter iii twins next morning clarice and her brother were at breakfast together in a cheerful little octagonshaped room all enamelled white panels delicately painted wreaths of flowers and profuse gilding more snow had fallen during the night and through the tall narrow windows could be seen a spotless world almost as white as the breakfastroom itself but a cheerful fire of oak logs blazing in the brass basket where the bluish tiles took the smoke and in the centre of the apartment a round table large enough for two was covered with dainty linen upon which stood a silver service delicate china and many appetizing dishes clarice was a notable housekeeper and knowing that ferdinand was fond of a good breakfast used her best endeavours to provide him with the toothsome food he loved and this was somewhat in the nature of a bribe by jove said the young man attacking a devilled kidney jerces housekeeper doesnt feed me like this then why dont you come down here oftener ferdy and allow me to feed you suggested clarice artfully and filled him another cup of hot fragrant coffee what rotas if i could jerce keeps me at work i can tell you i scarcely have a minute to myself and the minutes you have are given to other people than your sister said clarice dryly ho ho ferdinand chuckled jealous of prudence no i should like to see you married to prudence she would keep you in order bosh jerce does that i doubt it after what he told me last night knife and fork fell from ferdinands hands and his rosy complexion became as white as the snow out of doors whatwhatdid he tell you he quavered while clarice looked at him astonished only that you are a trifle wild she hastened to explain why should you look so alarmed imim not alarmed denied baird and absently wiped his forehead with his napkin that is of course if jerce talks about my being wild to you and you speak to prudence shell give me the goby like a shot prudence is awfully jealous im not in the habit of telling tales said clarice dryly jerce is then why cant he hold his tongue is what he says true i dont exactly know what he did say said ferdinand irritably and pushed back his plate youve spoilt my breakfast i dont like shocks why should you receive a shock from my very simple observation becausewell because of prudence im fond of prudence and i dont want her to know that iwell that ienjoy myself clarice tried to catch his eye so as to see if he was speaking the truth but ferdinand evaded her gaze and rising went to the fireplace where he lighted a cigarette the girl remained seated where she was resting her elbows on the table and with a frown knitting her brow ferdy was so weak that she always feared lest his weakness should land him in trouble moreover he was not truthful when anything was to be gained by telling a falsehood his confused manner showed that he had something to hide but she reflected bitterly that to ply him with questions would only make his recording angel take to shorthand so rapidly would the lies pour out ferdy leaning his elbows on the mantelpiece admired his own handsome face in the round mirror and furtively glanced at the reflection of his sister the twins were wonderfully alike and wonderfully goodlooking but clarice strange to say was the more manly of the two that is her manner was more masculine and decisive her mouth was firmer and she had the squarer chin with his rosy oval face his grecian nose his full lips and soft brown hair which lay in silky waves on his white forehead ferdinand was much too pretty for a man he possessed a slim shapely figure and wore the smartest of clothes with an aristocratic air curiously enough considering his delicate looks he was an excellent athlete and also had proved his bravery more than once when in the wild waste lands at the back of beyond whither he had gone a year previously on a tramp steamer from that wild excursion he had returned brown and healthy and full of life but within twentyfour hours clarice who had rejoiced at the apparently virile change knew that ferdy was as weak and wavering as ever he was a weed to voyage with every current a feather to be wafted hither and thither on every breath of wind i should have been the man said clarice suddenly rising and placing her hands on her hips with a throwback of her shoulders eherwhats that you say asked ferdy absently his sister came to where he stood and placed her face beside his i should have been the man and you the woman she declared as they looked at their delicate youthful faces in the mirror you and i are alike ferdy but there is a difference if we are alike how can there be a difference asked the wise youth pettishly cant you see i can look at my chin and at your own gaze into my eyes see the firmness of my lips theres a dash of the man in me ferdy and much of the woman about you baird dropped into an armchair and kicked his long legs in the air with a light laugh i suppose you say that because im like you you arent like me i wish you were come nowyour face and mine wheres the difference in the points i have named she replied quickly i am not talking of the physical ferdy i know you are brave enough dear and can hold your own with anyone where fighting is concerned i should jolly well think i could muttered baird bending his arm and feeling his muscle ive never been licked in a fight yet but went on clarice with emphasis its your nature i talk of you are so weakso very very weak im not snapped ferdy flushing i always have my own way ah thats obstinacy not strength because a person said no you would say yes and viceversa but you are the prey of your own passions ferdy you deny yourself nothing why should i because it is by denialby selfdenial that we make ourselves strong ferdy why any woman could twist you round her finger any woman can twist any man you mean if you bring the sex question into the matter clarice i admit that man is the weaker vessel a woman can do what she likes with a man women rule the world and why they should bother about this suffragette business beats me all men cant be twisted by women ferdy dr jerce for instance pooh hes so wrapped up in medicine and science that he hates the sexyour sex i mean i dont think so said clarice recalling a scene on the previous night dr jerce is a man like other men in that way only he is sufficiently strong to hold his own with women i say cried ferdy restlessly whats all this chatter about about you if youll only listen said his sister looking down at the weak frowning face im worried about you ferdy when you were here with me i could manage you but since you came back from that trip a year ago and went in for medicine you have changed for the worse i dont see that said baird sulkily i do there are lines on your face which should not be there at your age look at the black circles under your eyes youre getting the look of a man who stops up night after night and you do who says that dr jerce says it you dont attend to your work he says you are always at musichalls you take more drink than is good for you you gamble above what you can afford and i dare say that you make love to all manner of women oh i say you shouldnt say that last because im a girlan unmarried woman flashed out clarice what rubbish ill say what i think to you who are my only brother and my twin do you think that i am going to see you ruin yourself with wine and women and cards simply because there are things a girl is not supposed to know i am twentythree i have had endless responsibility since uncle henry took ill so i am quite able to speak out and to save you if possible ferdinand rose and flung his cigarette into the fire i wont have you talk like that to me he declared his voice thick with anger i am a man and you are a woman the reverse i think retorted clarice bitterly you have got far too high an opinion of yourself foamed ferdy kicking the logs angrily and when uncle henry dies ill show you who is to be master here clarice ignored the latter part of this speech why do you suggest that uncle henry may die hes illhe cant last long stammered ferdy evasively how do you know how does dr jerce know he told me himself that he could not understand this strange illness and could not say whether uncle henry would live or die do you call yourself more clever than dr jerce i have studied medicine and for twelve months and what you call study i call pursuit of pleasure you are wasting your life and there is no one to stand between you and ruin but me i dare not tell uncle henry what dr jerce reported to me as his health is too delicate to stand shocks you can tell him what you like mumbled ferdy knowing very well that he was safe in giving the permission i shall tell him nothing but added clarice with emphasis ill tell prudence if you dont mend ferdy clenched his hands and his eyes flashed prudence wont believe one word of what you say he declared angrily she loves me as i love her and do you love her asked clarice sharply and ferdinand recoiled before the look in her eyes dr jerce what has he dared to say nothing more than what i have told you said the girl but no man who is behaving as you are can possibly love a woman truly oh bother leave these sort of things alone you are a girl and you dont understand as to jerce he has his own secrets he turned on his heel to leave the room but clarice swiftly placed herself in his way now what do you mean by that she asked wondering if jerce had related the scene of the previous night in order to enlist ferdy on his side to forward his suit well mumbled the young man pausing and fishing out another cigarette from mere habit theres no reason why i shouldnt tell you about the row jerce never said i wasnt to what rowas you call it i dont know what else you would call it retorted ferdy who had regained his good humour with the shallow capacity of his nature i dont know who that chap in grey can be but jerce knows and whats more i believe he hunted him out last night i was going to town with jerce and he said that i could stop down here for a couple of days if he wasnt after that grey chap why didnt he want my company clarice listened to all this with a puzzled expression i dont understand a word youre talking about she said tartly what grey manwhat row well drawled baird lighting his cigarette and strolling back to his seat its like this and he related all that had taken place on the terrace and described the man with the crisscross scar on his face ending up with a few comments of his own and jerce must know the chap for he wouldnt let me go for the police oh jerce has his secrets and if a chap has to knock him down and go through his pockets those secrets aint respectablethats all i have to say a nice chap jerce is to talk of my being wild when hes old enough to know better and has larks like this why dont you tell him so asked clarice sarcastically oh its none of my business replied ferdy airily all the same his delicate colour came and went in a way which showed clarice that he was afraid of dr jerce and very rightly too considering their relative ages and different positions in the world its a strange thing said clarice thoughtfully kilting up her dress and resting one slender foot on the fender i wonder dr jerce didnt speak of the matter oh he wants you to have a good opinion of him so doesnt give away his little wickednesses ferdy said miss baird sharply for his flippant tone jarred on her you have no right to speak like this of dr jerce everyone who knows him is aware that his character is of the highest he is charitable and attends to poor people in some london slum for nothing no one can breathe a word against him a man like dr jerce would not hold the position he does or expect to be knighted unless his reputation and life were spotless however theres an easy way of learning the truth dr jerce is coming down again tomorrow to consult with dr wentworth over uncle henrys case ill tell him what you say no no this time ferdinand went quite white and spoke with dry lips youll only get me into a row i dare say jerce is all right i never heard anyone speak of him save with the highest praise and he has been a good friend to me i dont want to quarrel with him there is no need that you should do so ferdy all i mean to ask dr jerce is why the man assaulted him and went through his pockets he says that he doesnt know said ferdy gruffly you say that he knows the man he mightthat is i think so anyhow he wouldnt let me go for the police so it looks as though he didnt want a public row but youd better not say anything clarice jerce may get his back up at my telling you hed row me i dont want that jerce is a brick you know clarry hes lent me money when uncle henry kept me short remembering the hopes expressed by the doctor clarice was vastly indignant at this revelation and faced her weak twin with clenched hands how dare you borrow money from dr jerce she said and her eyes flashed uncle henry gives you all you want he doesnt said ferdy sulkily he allows me next to nothing i call him a skinflint whats two hundred a year very good pocketmoney he pays your bills keeps you for nothing and gives you four pounds a week to waste yet with all that you borrow from dr jerce how much have you had thats my business mine also tell me or ill tell uncle henry only a few hundreds snarled ferdy reluctantly a few hundreds clarice sank into her seat and looked at ferdy with consternation and how on earth have you spent so much in addition to your own income money will go lamented ferdy whenever i break a pound i never have any left within the hour youll bring disgrace on us some day said clarice with a pained look why didnt you come to me youre so high and mighty you wouldnt have understood i understand this much that dr jerce is the last man i should wish you to have money from i thought you liked him i didi do and i respect him all the same i wish you hadnt borrowed from him ferdinand rose and kicked the logs again in his petulant fashion i must have money somehow to enjoy myself you have four pounds a week whats thati want fifty and after all its my own money when we come of age in two years we each have two thousand a year i dont see why uncle henry should grudge me cash in the way he does if you dont want to spend it i do and whats more cried ferdy working himself into a rage im going to you shant spend dr jerces money said clarice and her mouth shut firmly while her eyes glittered like steel how can you stop me from getting it scoffed fred uneasily i can ask him to refuse you more dr jerce will do anything for me ferdy scowled i know that he said moodily he hinted that he was in love with you if you were only a decent sort clarry you would marry him and help me hes got heaps of tin and youd be lady jerce some day you know oh said clarice and her voice was as hard as her eyes did dr jerce ask you to speak to me no no on my honour he didnt but he hinted that hed like you to be his wife i never said anything not even that i am engaged to anthony ackworth ferdy looked up in genuine surprise oh by jove you aint yes i am he asked me to become his wife only six days ago i consented and we are engaged uncle henry knows and i intended to tell you later i thought you might have guessed apparently you did not being so wrapped up in yourself im glad of that as i want to tell dr jerce myself you would only bungle the matter ackworths only a gunner chap muttered ferdinand in dismay you had much better marry jerce he could help me you know with more money i suppose well not exactly that confessed ferdy with an engaging air of candour though i shouldnt mind asking him for a fiver if i were hard up which i generally am but when i become a doctor jerce could retire and hand over his patients to me you know oh there are lots of ways in which he could be useful to me if you are nice to him if you aint he may cut up rough and jerce isnt pleasant when hes in a rage i can tell you oh said clarice contemptuously so to please you i am to marry a man old enough to be my father hes only fiftyfive and rich and hell have a title soon so will anthony if it comes to that his father is a baronet a poor baronet sneered ferdy with emphasis ill have two thousand a year of my own when i am twentyfive said the girl ignoring the speech and anthony has his pay and an allowance from his father we will be able to live very comfortably on what we can get besides uncle henry likes anthony and is delighted that i should marry him as to dr jerce she hesitated what about him murmured baird nervously ill inform him of my engagement when he comes down again also ill ask him about this row as you call it and request him to refuse you more money youll ruin me gasped ferdinand on whose forehead the drops of perspiration were standing thickly in what way jerce will chuck me he can be a beast when he likes let him be a beast said clarice impatiently although i think you exaggerate hell say nothing he has no right to say anything clarice he caught her hands for my sake you must marry jerce the girl released herself angrily what do you mean by that jerce could help me so much said ferdy feebly is that all asked clarice keeping her eyes steadfastly fixed on the weak handsome face of her brother of courseof course he replied testily what else could there be you stupid girl i dont know she said coldly but i do know ferdy that you never by any chance tell the whole truth you always keep something back and that makes it difficult to know how to advise you i dont ask for advice no she answered bitterly you ask for a sacrifice which in your egotistic eyes is no sacrifice and you are keeping something back from me what reason have you to be afraid of dr jerce i have no reason i never said that i was afraid and yet and yetand yet he broke in snappishly you are making a mountain out of a molehill i only suggest that you should marry marry a man i dont love my word is passed to anthony clarice the girl pushed him aside and opened the door that is enough go your own silly way but dont ask me to come with you ah you are always selfish always said clarice sadly and thinking of the many small sacrifices she had made for the fool before her therefore i marry the man i love and she hastened from the room unwilling to break down before one who would take such emotion as a sign of yielding ferdy left alone kicked over the breakfast table and vented his rage on the furniture generally the room was quite a wreck by the time his feelings were completely relieved chapter iv a mystery the housekeeper of mr horrans establishment was a small witheredup old woman who looked like the bad fairy of a daulnoy story she had nursed clarice and ferdy and their father before them so she was deeply attached to the twins of course ferdy being the more selfish of the two obtained all her affection and although she was fond of clarice she lavished the treasures of her love on ferdy who gave her in return more kicks than halfpence mrs rebson was quite seventy years of age and her face resembled a winter apple so rosy and wrinkled it was she must have had french blood in her old veins for her vivacity was wonderful and her jet black eyes were undimmed by age nothing ever seemed to put her out of temper and her devotion to the twins had in it something of a religion being thus bright and cheerful it was strange that mrs rebson should cherish a dreadful little book which was called the domestic prophet full of dismal hints published at the beginning of each year it prophesied horrors for every month from january to december and was as lachrymose as the book of lamentations not a single cheerful event enlivened the year from this modern prophets point of view and although the book consisting of twentyfour pages was bound in green paper the cover should certainly have been black if only for the sake of consistency over this lamentable production mrs rebson was bending when clarice entered fresh from her encounter with ferdy what is the matter lovey asked the old woman pushing up her spectacles on her lined forehead theres nothing to worry about i have ordered the dinner and seen to the christmas provisions and mr horrans in a sweet sleep and your good gentleman is coming this afternoon to kiss your bonny face bless it and bless him clarice sat down with a disconsolate air its ferdy now miss mrs rebsons voice became sharper and her manner quite like that of the nurse who put the twins to bed years before how often have i told you not to quarrel with your dear brother as is bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh and the sweetest tempered baby i ever nursed nanny clarice called mrs rebson by this childish name for the sake of old times and perhaps from custom you are quite crazy about ferdy and he doesnt deserve your love indeed he does miss and i wonder at your talking in that way oh fie miss fie shaking a gnarled finger this is jealousy its common sense nanny retorted clarice and detailed what dr jerce had said about ferdy and what ferdy had said to her mrs rebson listened to all this quite unmoved but of course you wont believe a word i say against your idol ended clarice bitterly because everyones against him cried mrs rebson wrathfully oh that jerce manill jerce him if he dares to speak against master ferdy who is an angel there are two kinds of angels nanny white and black master ferdys the kind of angel that plays a harp said the old dame with dignity and why shouldnt the poor boy amuse himself hell get into trouble unless hes more careful drinking and gambling and sitting up all night with fast people i dont believe a word of it said mrs rebson energetically dr jerce says hes a liar miss and dont come to me with tales of that angel why cant you hold your tongue and think of your future with mr ackworth who is so fond of you and i hope youll deserve his fondness im fond of ferdy too nanny and i want him to grow up to be a good man he is a good man said the old nurse obstinately and theres no more growing of that sort needed mr horran drat him keeps the poor boy short of money two hundred a year whats that when master ferdy will have two thousand he wont become possessed of that for two years nanny meanwhile he has no right to gamble i dont believe he does why he spends all his money in buying books about health and medicine i gave him five pounds the other day to get some oh nanny your savings again when you promised me you wouldnt i can do what i like with my own miss clarice besides i have made master ferdy my heir so why shouldnt he have the money now if he likes bless him nanny said clarice seriously you are ruining ferdy me mrs rebson gave an indignant screech me ruin the boy i love so dearly jealousy again miss clarice go and read the commandments miss and weep for your sins i dont think ill find honour thy brother among the commandments nanny said clarice the humorous side of the business striking her however i see its useless to think you will blame ferdy mrs rebson looked round the comfortable little room and removed her spectacles my dear she said in a rather shaky voice if i must speak plainly to you i am rather put out about master ferdy not that its his fault added the nurse hurriedly but when one sees him being led away by that hussy who is that asked clarice anxiously mrs dumps daughter zara she calls herself when i know that she was christened simple sarah not that she is simple my dear for a more cunning fox isnt to be found with her red hairdyedand her cream complexion and red cheeks which are nothing but pearlpowder and rouge drat her and her mother also for a fool clarice knew mrs dumps and also had frequently seen sarah dumps but had never for one moment thought that ferdy would be attracted by such a bold chattering girl who flirted indiscriminately with every man goodlooking or plain i thought sarah had gone to london so she has said mrs rebson fiercely she went over a year ago and with her good looksall paint and dyeand brazen impudenceah thats genuine enoughshe pushed her way on to the stage so mrs dumps told me said miss baird sarah is dancing and singing at some westend musichall she is that and fine dancing it is i dont doubtthe hussy id rather see a child of mine in her grave than capering as a butterfly before gentry butterflies dont caper nanny this one does sniffed the old woman viciously she calls herself butterfly on the stage the butterfly nojust butterfly when she ought to be called cat well then my love mrs dumps who is a cousin of mine and i dont think much of her dressing and screeching like a peacock called to see me the other day and told me that master ferdy had been seeing sarahi cant bring myself to call her zarasuch affectation hes been driving and talking and walking and giving her presents and mrs dumps who is a born fool thinks that master ferdy means marriage clarice started to her feet oh nanny whats the use of saying oh nanny like that snapped mrs rebson you know what an angel master ferdy is and how easily a pretty face can beguile himnot that sarah is pretty the minx its her fault and id tar and feather her and ride her on a rail if i had my way why cant she leave the boy alone i know you are jealous of master ferdy miss clarice but as you have a head on your shouldersi dont deny that loveyit is only right that you should know the truth i cant tell mr horran as there would be trouble clarice went to the window and looked out into the white cold world with her thoughts fixed anywhere but on the scenery in fact she was wondering what was best to be done about ferdinand who evidently had become entangled with sarah dumps dr jerce apparently knew of this entanglement hence ferdys fear of him and dread as to what he might have said it was useless to talk to ferdy who would only go his own way being obstinate as all weak people are while mr horran was too ill to be told of the business there remained anthony and dr jerce to help her the second of these had made things unpleasant by wanting to marry her so it was difficult to appeal to him for aid he might demand his price finally in two minutes clarice made up her mind to enlist captain ackworth on her side he was not coming this afternoon as mrs rebson had said but the next day so she could speak to him then meanwhile it would be best to be agreeable to ferdy and keep him at home lest he should go back to town and to this dreadful girl not that sarah dumps really was very dreadful for being shrewd she was quite respectable and able to take excellent care of herself but naturally clarice thought she was dreadful when ferdy was in her toilsthough what sarah dumps could see in poor weak ferdy passed clarices comprehension well deary asked mrs rebson impatiently say nothing to mr horran or to ferdy said clarice turning from the window ill see what i can do treat master ferdy tenderly warned mrs rebson oh yes replied miss baird indifferently things will come all right nanny ferdy after all is in love with prudence another hussy snapped the nurse a very clever one then she would make ferdy a good wife and rule him with a rod of iron he doesnt want that miss you can lead him with a silken thread i am quite sure sarah dumps can said clarice emphatically ferdy can always be led in the way he wishes to go no no she waved her hand impatiently dont defend him any more nanny i agree with you that ferdy is all sugarcandy and honey ill try and put everything right and it needs putting right said mrs rebson in her most lively tone theres going to be troubleyes povertydeathsorrowdisgrace stop stop cried clarice turning pale what do you mean the domestic prophet oh that creature pooh clarice was much relieved i thought you were in earnest the domestic prophet always is deary hes a fraud nanny he never prophesies correctly yes he does cried mrs rebson obstinately and adjusting her spectacles listen to this and she read the month of december will be dangerous to elderly men who are sick they will probably die if the weather is severe and in winter we may expect snow some elderly men will probably meet with a violent death either by poison or the knife or a railway accident or by drowning if they frequent seaside resorts beware the dead of night says the domestic prophet to all men over fifty after reading this precious extract mrs rebson lifted her eyes to find clarice choking with laughter and assumed an offended air you were always foolish miss she said disdainfully but these things will come true mr horran is doomed he is over fifty and how do you think he will die nannynot in a railway accident or by drowning as he cant leave the house the severe weather may kill him certainly but ill see that he is well wrapped up there remains the knife and the poison which will he die of mrs rebson still continued disdainful its all very well sniggering miss but the domestic prophet is right very often she opened the dismal book again and read when a black cat bites its tail take it for a sign of a sudden death and added mrs rebson closing the book solemnly i saw my black cat bite its tail only yesterday also mr horran is elderly and should beware the dead of night well then said clarice flippantly i suppose buster this was the black cats name hints by biting his tail that mr horran is about to meet with a violent death at midnight i dont say mr horran miss but dr jerce is over fifty and so is the rev nehemiah clarke you also nanny the domestic prophet is talking of men deary you scoff miss but mark my words before the end of the month well hear of something miss baird still laughing kissed the withered cheek i dare say was her reply your prophet is very general in his applications well i shall see uncle henry dont tell him what i say oh but i will nanny its too funny to keep to myself and clarice left the room laughing while mrs rebson with a sigh for such levity began to read the domestic prophet with renewed zeal meanwhile miss clarice proceeded to mr horrans bedroom this was on the other side of the house and was similar in many respects to the drawingroom here also were two french windows opening on to a terrace and the apartment was large and lofty and spacious and was furnished half as a bedroom and half as a sittingroom this was because mr horran lived for the most part of his life beneath its roof formerly he had occupied a room on the first floor where the other bedrooms were but being unable by reason of his mysterious disease to mount the stairs he had within the last five years transferred this room which was formerly a library into his sleeping chamber it was handsomely furnished and very comfortable and had a large open fireplace in which summer and winter blazed a grand fire the walls were of a deep orange colour as mr horran thought such a hue was most restful to the eye and on them hung many fine pictures and also several spears and swords and zulu shields and matabele assegais which various friends had brought as presents in front of one window stood a rosewood escritoire covered with papers but the way to the other window was left open as it acted also as a door whence mr horran could emerge on fine days to take the sun on the miniature terrace for an invalid everything was perfectly arranged and mr horran was lodged luxuriously the old man himself was thin and wrinkled but very straight and somewhat military in his looks the resemblance being increased by a long irongrey moustache and closely clipped grey hair he had left his bed and was sitting clothed in a camels hair dressinggown in a deepseated leather armchair before the fire when clarice entered he was weeping and she hastened towards him in alarm dear uncle henry she said putting her arms round his neck why did you get up it is most imprudent dr jerce and dr wentworth both say you should remain in bed i wonder chalks this was horrans valet and faithful attendant allowed you im all right my dear said mr horran trying to recover his selfcommand and patting clarices hand im only upset a little and no wonder after that fit it is not the fit that is all right now i have been sleeping for about ten hours and woke some time ago feeling much better indeed i felt so well that i decided to rise and take a stroll on the terrace in the winter sunshine then i received a shock what kind of a shock we wont say anything about it just now said horran in a weak voice it would not interest you and besides i dont wish to talk of it i have told no one not even chalks told him what nothing nothing maundered on the old man staring into the fire i feel ever so much better my dear only i cant help cryingsome sort of emotion from the shock clarice slipped down beside him and held his cold hands dear uncle henry tell me what is the matter she implored it isnt ferdy no no ferdy is all right hes a good boy and very kind it is very strange clarry but i am now beginning to feel drowsy and a few minutes ago i was so wideawake oh dear me he sighed i do wish daniel or dr wentworth would find out what is the matter with me they will find out soon dear said clarice soothingly no clever as daniel is my disease seems to baffle him he says that i may live for years but i dont think that is likely clarry dear however should i die suddenly everything is straight you and ferdy will get your money within a week of my death dear dont talk of your death i must it is just as well clarry that you should know how matters stand i have arranged that you will control ferdys money as i have the power to do by your fathers will i was appointed sole guardian and the will enables me to appoint another guardian should i die but i shall not do that i shall arrange and have arranged as my lawyer will tell you to give you the whole four thousand pounds a year you will be so to speak your own guardian and ferdys also you dont trust ferdy then uncle henry she asked in a low voice no dear he patted her hand you are the clever one ferdy is unstable i have seen that for many years and so i placed him with daniel who will keep the boy straight ferdy is like your poor father charming and weak you more resemble your dear mother who was my first and my last love i never married because of your mother i know dear clarice kissed the cold hand tenderly as she knew of this romance she was the sole person to whom horran ever spoke of the matter he maundered on dreamily i told daniel of my will and he was not pleased he said that a woman should not possess such power as she was incapable of exercising it oh indeed said clarice flushing angrily i think dr jerce will find me perfectly capable i am glad that you have made me ferdys guardian uncle henry as he certainly needs a guiding hand have you told him about the will dear no i only told daniel who was displeased but then he says that i may live for years he spoke kindly too though he is wrong in believing i shall recover daniel and i have always been friends we only quarrelled once and that was over your mother but she married baird and left us both in the cold but for you dear clarry i should have had a lonely life my dear clarice rose and moved towards the bell let me call chalks to put you to bed again uncle henry you are quite drowsy no no the invalid grew testy sudden changes of mood being a characteristic of his unknown disease im comfortable here and i want to see daniel where is daniel he returned to town last night dear i dont think he will come again until after christmas that is not for a few days groaned horran in a piteous tone oh send for him clarry i must see him about the letter what letter dear she asked much puzzled horran raised his heavy lids with an effort the letter which i found on the terrace near the window it gave me a shock show it to me uncle henry no you would not understand daniel might hes so clever who wrote this letter coaxed clarice trying to get information there is no writing he answered drowsily it is not a letter you said that it was picture writing then like the ancient egyptians she thought naturally that his mind was wandering when he talked in so contradictory a manner after a moment or so his head fell back on the chair and his eyes closed he began to breathe deeply and apparently was falling asleep clarice put her ear to his lips as she saw them move and caught three words which conveyed nothing thepurplefern this was unintelligible until she noticed an envelope at his feet which had fallen out of his pocket picking this up she took out the slip of paper it contained and found thereon no writing but the representation of a tiny fern stamped in purple ink chapter v the vicar there seemed to clarice to be a familiar look about this representation of a fern the double sheet of writing paper was thick and glossy with untrimmed edges and on this the curved fern with its fronds wonderfully delicate and distinct had evidently been impressed with an indiarubber stamp moistened with purple ink the squaresized envelope bore no address no stamp and no seal what could one make of such a missive it appeared meaningless yet to clarice the fern itself recalled some faint memory probably that memory whatever it might be was clearer to horran and so had given him the shock of which he had complained after some consideration clarice slipped the envelope and sheet of paper into her pocket thinking it advisable to remove them from horrans sight he had fallen into a deep sleep and was breathing almost imperceptibly his face looking singularly calm and unwrinkled whatever his disease might be he certainly was not suffering pain but it was strange that after a ten hours sleep he should again relapse into slumber still from his looks there was no cause for alarm so clarice touched the bell and when chalks entered she pointed silently to his unconscious master the valet was a round rosy stout little man with twinkling black eyes and a meek manner he beamed with good nature and overflowed with the milk of human kindness an attendant with so cheerful a disposition and smiling a countenance was quite the kind of nurse needed by an invalid as his spirits were infectious and frequently served to arouse the somewhat melancholy mr horran from dismal musings chalks displayed no surprise at the sight of his patient asleep again but lifted him in his arms and placed him gently on the bed clarice deliberated as to whether she should tell chalks who was intelligent and devoted to mr horran about the missive of the purple fern but finally decided to say nothing concerning it to anyone until she had seen anthony the elusive memory which would not come back to her in its entirety suggested that ackworth could account for the fern in some way what do you think of him chalks she asked indicating the unconscious man on the bed i thinks hes asleep miss said chalks innocently but why should he sleep again after ten hours slumber why should he be ill at all miss was the retort of the cheerful little man seeing that them doctors says as his organs is healthy and that there aint nothing whatever the matter with him miss baird drew her white brows together in a perplexed way there must be some reason for his disease chalks the doctors say theres no disease miss but this sleep is unnatural masters health has been unnatural for the last ten years miss what is your theory chalks i have none miss master gets headaches and giddy fits and weeps and gets into rages which aint his real nature and hes had two fits and now sleeps like a top for hours this aint what youd call health miss and yet dr jerce and dr wentworth have both examined him heaps of times only to find hes all right both inside and outside its a riddle miss thats what it is whats to be done then chalks advanced briskly to the bed leave master to me miss and ill put him between the sheets then we must wait until dr wentworth comes again miss clarice walked to the door but cast a glance round the room before going out she saw that one of the french windows was open and moved to close it chalks stopped her no miss master must have all the air he can getdr wentworth says so and dr jerce chalks beamed like a cherub bless your heart miss he insists on master getting as little air as possible when dr jerce comes down miss he says the window must be closed when dr wentworth turns up he opens it straight off they dont agree miss which is hard on me miss it is perplexing assented clarice laughing what do you do well miss i let them do what they like if dr jerce closes the window i leave it so when dr wentworth opens it i let it be sometimes that window is open all night and closed all day at other times miss its open all day and closed all night it depends on them dratted doctors clarice laughed at this explanation and seeing that her guardian to all appearance was in a healthy sleep went away tell me when he wakes up chalks said she at the door yes miss if master dont sleep for one hundred years like the sleeping beauty and chalks chuckled at his own simple wit clarice passed the morning in attending to her domestic duties and had a consultation with mrs rebson about the christmas festivities that cheerful housekeeper remarked that it would be as well to make the house as bright as possible since the domestic prophet declared that something terrible would happen before christmas what the event might be mrs rebson could not tell as the prophet after the manner of his kind was obscure in the wording of his oracles nevertheless clarice became infected with the vague dread which mrs rebson insisted she felt herself and the memory of that oddly delivered envelope containing the stamped picture of the purple fern did not tend to dissipate her uneasiness when she left mrs rebson still prophesying coming woes like an elderly cassandra the girl felt that a walk would do her good and putting on her furs she sallied forth eager to breathe a less portentous atmosphere the day was bright and clear the snow was hard and clean in the lucid air lurked the sting of frost sitting over a fire one was apt to shiver but smart walking brought a colour to the most wan cheeks and communicated a glow to the whole body clarice looked extremely pretty as the exercise tinted her oval face and sent the warm blood spinning through her youthful veins she walked in a determined swinging way with steadfast eyes and a firmly closed mouth like a woman who knows her own mind and who means to have her own way it needed a very strong man to master this young lady of the new school and clarice believed that ackworth was just the man to exercise authority certainly dr jerce might have mastered her also as he was stern and strong but then she did not love dr jerce and only from the tyrant she loved was miss baird ready to take orders finding herself near the vicarage clarice determined to enter and see if ferdy was there as he had not come back to luncheon it was probable that he had gone to prudence clarke for consolation a thing miss baird quite approved of as she respected prudence and would have been glad to see ferdy engaged to so sensible a girl the quarrel at the breakfast table had no doubt left ferdy fretful and complaining so it was pretty certain that he would visit prudence and pour his woes into her sympathetic ears ferdy never could keep his troubles to himself but invariably climbed to the highest housetop to shout out his puny griefs clarice wished him to marry prudence yet sometimes she doubted if so sensible a girl would tolerate such a baby man as a husband the servant who answered the door said that miss clarke had gone out skating with mr baird but that the vicar was in his study clarice would have turned away in pursuit of the young people but that the parson heard her voice and came into the hall he was an undersized miserable man with a head too large for his body and an awkward diffident manner which seemed to continually apologise for the existence of mr nehemiah clarke his voice was querulous and his complaints were incessant in his rusty black clothes with his bent frame and untidy hair he looked a most dismal object and clarice in her then somewhat dejected state of mind scarcely relished an interview with so cheerless a person however she could not help herself and entered the study with the best grace she could muster there whimpered mr clarke waving his hands towards an array of bills which strewed his desk like autumn leaves what do you think of that for christmas clarice how is a man to preach goodwill towards men when men wont show any goodwill towards him but we all get bills at christmas time said miss baird consolingly i get more than anyone else moaned the vicar sinking into the chair before his desk why they should come to me i dont know you should pay as you go mr clarke i havent any ready money clarice its all very well for you in the lap of luxury but i have only three hundred a year and even that small sum comes to me slowly since people will not pay their tithes without legal threats and those cost money i dont eat much i dress plainly i never enjoy myself and keep only one cheap servant yet the bills will come in prudence is responsible for many she ought to emulate her name but she wont imprudence would suit her better oh dear me how i can sympathise with lear i dont think prudence is extravagant mr clarke said clarice who resented this placing of burdens on other peoples shoulders she always seems to me to be a sensible girl in some waysin some ways muttered the vicar discontentedly clarice reflected for a few minutes from hints dropped by prudence she had a shrewd idea of where the vicars money went how is frank mr clarke she asked significantly my son he is still in london trying to get work poor lad he is very unfortunate with his education and manners and brains he ought to be one of the foremost men of the time but the want of money is a bar to his advancement what is frank doing nothing he has tried the army the medical profession the legal profession the lecture hall and even the stage but as yet he has not hit upon the field in which he can display his undoubted abilities to their utmost you support him i suppose i cant let the boy starve said mr clarke defiantly well then it seems to me that frank is more to blame than prudence for your difficulties he ought to support himself he will some day when he acquires the position to which his talents will lead him then he will bring glory to the clarkes he only brings misfortune and debts just now said clarice dryly who says so asked the vicar furiously prudence tells me that her brother will not do anything but passes his time in idleness and constantly comes to you for money as he is over thirty years of age he certainly should support himself poor frank cannot help his misfortunes i rather think that a mans misfortunes are as a rule of his own making mr clarke your own for instance you have three hundred a year and a free house that ought to keep you out of debt but if you will give all your money to frank what can you expect my dearmy dear said mr clarke testily a girl like you cant understand these things oh yes i can since uncle henry has been ill all these years i have had a great deal to do with business the vicar started i thought mr barras was your guardians lawyer so he is he attends to everything but uncle henry rarely sees mr barras himself so i have to attend to necessary matters why doesnt ferdinand ferdinand clarice made a gesture of contempt he is the same as your son and spends money rather than earns it my dear you shouldnt say these things unbecoming in a young girls mouth it is not modest in a woman clarice stood up very tall and dignified and rather irritated what is the use of talking like that to me mr clarke all that idea of the superiority of man is a thing of the past i am only a woman and a girl as you say but i have five times the sense of ferdinand and uncle henry trusts me rather than him prudence also is clever and sensible i dont believe that she is extravagant mr clarke frank is the one who spends your money if you would allow frank to earn his own living and let prudence arrange your affairs you would soon be out of difficulties prudence knows nothing of business clarice and frank knows less retorted the girl thoroughly angry women have more intuition than men but there is another way out of your difficulties mr clarke what is that asked the little man somewhat cowed by the determined demeanour of miss baird ferdy is in love with prudence let them marry and then i can arrange that your debts will be paid when ferdy comes in for his money two years hence but in the meantime moaned the vicar we can arrange somethingthat is if you will stop sending money to frank let him sink or swim mr clarke selfreliance is the sole thing which will make a man of frank ill see ill see said mr clarke evasively but if i allow prudence to marry ferdinandand i note that they love one anotherdo you think he will help me i shall help you but how can you mr clarke i spoke to uncle henry this morning and he told me that as our guardian he has the authority to appoint another one at his death he doesnt trust ferdy so he has constituted me the head of our affairs ferdy gets two thousand a year as i do in two years but i shall have the casting vote as to how his money is disposed ofat least up to the age of twentyfive when he takes it over if ferdy marries prudence next year ill allow him a good income on condition that he pays your debts he will do it if i advise as i shall have the legal power when uncle henry dies but if mr horran does not die then ill see what mr barras can do he is the lawyer and believes in me he tells me everything clarke rose and began to pace the room has barras told you that horran lent me one thousand pounds five years ago at ten per cent no said clarice somewhat startled is that so yes i am in great trouble over the loan i borrowed it to help my son frank and i have had to pay interest at the rate of ten per cent every yearthat is one hundred pounds i have not paid up for three years so i am indebted to mr horran for three hundred pounds and he threatens to sell me upthat means ruin i dont believe it cried clarice energetically uncle henry is a kind man and would never do such a thing who says so mr barras then ill go up to london and see mr barras after christmas he ought to have told me about this but he did not why do you not see uncle henry yourself mr clarke i tried to but dr jerce would not let me he said that i would upset mr horran if i talked business to him i therefore have kept away from the house i noticed that you had not been near us for months said clarice thoughtfully but how does dr jerce come to know of the matter mr barras told him miss baird flushed in an angry way it seems to me that mr barras takes a great deal upon himself she said haughtily since uncle henry is ill and trusts me i am the one to be spoken to about these matters and not dr jerce ill question uncle henry about the loan and see that everything is put right then i wont have to pay the three hundred said the vicar eagerly i cant say that rejoined clarice bluntly ill see what i can do of course if ferdy would only become engaged to prudence i might be able to do much but as matters stand dr jerce and mr barras may prove too strong for me but mr horran trusts youso you say clarice he does but heuncle henry i meanhas a great opinion of dr jerce and in his weak state may be influenced by him ill speak to the doctor and to mr barrasmore than this i cant promise the vicar looked more miserable than ever and twice opened his mouth to speak each time he closed it while clarice wondered at his hesitation do you think that everything is right with mr horran asked mr clarke at length what do you mean by that she asked startled mr horran has no money you know save what he receives from your estate by acting as your guardian clarice stared i never knew that she said at length i understood of course that uncle henry received a sum for acting as guardian since that is but right but he has his own money and the house the house you live in belonged to your father and now belongs to you said clarke rapidly leaning forward with eagerness to emphasise his words i know because i buried both your parents and was present at the reading of the will mr horran loved your mother and was trusted by your father but he never had any money when your father died he left everything to your mother in trust for you and ferdinand when she went the way of all flesh she constituted mr horran who then managed her business your guardian as she trusted him and he was hard up did not mr barras tell you all these things clarice no she said absently and began to see that the lawyer had not trusted her so entirely as she had thoughtneither had horran if the vicar was to be believed i shall speak to uncle henry she said after a pause and from him i shall learn the true position of affairs meantime please say nothing mr clarke no ill be silent but this three hundred interest ill see about that also i am sure that uncle henry does not mean to be hard on you of course business may upset him since he is so ill and dr jerce may be right in keeping you away all the same it seems to me that dr jerce knows a good deal about our private affairs i am sure that mr horran tells him everything said clarke with a gloomy air and dr jerce is not friendly towards me i dont know why since we were at college together but he is not friendly clarice felt puzzled this conversation with mr clarke opened her eyes to the fact that business was not so easy a matter as she had imagined if she was to be tricked by mr barras keeping back details of finance and if dr jerce was influencing horran secretly it appeared that she would have some difficulty in straightening out things at the death nevertheless horran had assured her that when he passed away she would find everything in good order before she could pursue the subject further in her thoughts the door opened and prudence appeared with ferdy behind her prudence was a brunette as dark as ferdy was fair but tall and handsome and full of life and spirits from the downward curve of her mouth it would seem that she had a temper but just now she appeared to be filled with joy and rushed to kiss clarice dear dear she said quickly ferdy hasferdy has i am glad cried clarice guessing what had happened with the swift intuition of a woman it is exactly what i wanted ferdy to do well then said ferdy who was radiant as a lover and who evidently had forgiven his sister for the quarrel at breakfast ive done it done what asked the vicar staring openmouthed i have asked prudence to become my wife thank god said clarke devout and egotistic my debts will be paid chapter vi a discovery on that same night the weather changed with unexampled rapidity from cold to warm a thick mist descended on crumel and the snow began to melt as though under the influence of a summer sun the long hours of darkness were filled with the dripping of water the melting of snow and the whole country was turned into a vast expanse of slush the expectations of a white christmas entertained by oldfashioned people vanished and next day it seemed from the warm humidity of the foggy air as though the season of yule had given place to early autumn clarice looked out of her bedroomwindow on to damp green lawns from which patches of snow were quickly disappearing and experienced a sense of discomfort which she set down to the queer weather perhaps the earthquakes in the earlier part of the year had disarranged the english climate and altered the seasons but assuredly the atmosphere was decidedly unhealthy yet the vague fears of the girl may have been less due to the sudden change of temperature than to the feeling of apprehension she entertained since her conversation with mr clarke that money matters were not so satisfactory as she had thought them to be hitherto clarice had implicitly trusted mr barras in her innocence of worldly ways he had always been frank with her so far as she could see and having been delegated by horran to tell her of all things connected with the estate clarice had believed that she knew everything now if the vicar were to be believed it appeared that horran had lent him money and was pressing for the payment of the interest also dr jerce seemed to know of the private business of the baird orphans and to be influencing horran against the wretched mr clarke certainly the vicar was not a very estimable character and his infatuation for his spendthrift son merited contempt rather than approbation nevertheless horran had known clarke all his life and had been to college with him and with jerce he therefore assuredly should not be hard on the parson whose sole fault was affection for an unworthy son also if jerce was influencing horran as clarke suggested he might advise leniency instead of bearing hard on the man especially at christmas time barras also appeared to be anxious to force the vicar into discharging the interest at a time when he could ill afford to pay three pounds much less three hundred and more than this barras wilfully concealed from clarice the facts of the case if the lawyer withheld this item he certainly withheld others and clarice staring out of her window at the thaw began to find herself doubting the honesty of mr barras added to these troubles were the facts of horrans mysterious illness and the mystery of the purple fern more than ever clarice was determined not to speak to jerce about the missive which had sent horran into his second deep sleep putting aside the fact that jerce was in league with barrasas it would appearto bankrupt the vicar the doctor being in love with her assuredly was not a person to whom she could talk freely then again ferdys manner alarmed the girl after his first outburst of joy on becoming engaged to prudence he had relapsed into moody silence and seemed to be much worried over something which he refused to explain to his sister in vain on the previous night had clarice implored him to be entirely frank ferdy declaring that there was nothing wrong had maintained his moody manner and had drunk much more wine than was good for a man with a weak brain on the whole clarice after reflection concluded that her uneasiness was due less to the unexampled weather than to the domestic mysteries by which she seemed to be surrounded on leaving her room she found that ferdy had already breakfasted and had gone out presuming that he was haunting prudence with the impatience of a young lover clarice thought no more about his absence but breakfasted alone then she repaired to mr horrans room to speak to him of the many matters which were on her mind it was just as well she thought to go to the fountain head at once and to learn if horran really desired to sell up the vicar is uncle henry awake she asked when chalks presented himself no miss was the prompt reply he is sound asleep as usual dear me and how long will he sleep dr wentworth cant say miss we tried to wake him and cant so dr wentworth said it would be better to let him sleep until he had a consultation with dr jerce clarice cast a look at the french window and saw that it was open wide in spite of the fog i see that dr wentworth has been here chalks she said remembering the whimsical explanation of the man about the disagreement between the two physicians yes miss said chalks casting a look at the window but when dr jerce comes this afternoon he will have that closed oh is dr jerce coming this afternoon yes miss dr wentworth doesnt like this constant sleeping of the master and has sent for dr jerce to consult it is just as well said clarice crossing to the bed and looking at the pale calm face of the still sleeping man i want to talk to dr jerce about some business this was hardly the term she wished to ask jerce why the grey man had searched his pockets and why he was influencing barras and horran to be hard on the vicar the matter of the purple fern she intended to relate to no one but anthony a memory of his name made her glance at her watch and she noted that he would soon make his appearance horran seemed to be sleeping as placidly as an infant so she felt that there was no cause for alarm bending to kiss the placid face she turned slowly towards the door by the way chalks have you seen mr ferdinand this morning she asked thinking that her brother might have paid a visit to the invalid yes miss said the valet promptly i saw him out of this he waved his hand towards the open french window going to the savoy hotel oh ejaculated clarice and hastily left the room it seemed strange to her that ferdy should seek out the mother of sarah dumps just when he became engaged surely he did not love the dancer when he had only lately proposed to prudence remembering dr jerces remarks and recalling the conversation of mrs rebson the girl felt uneasy on account of her brother ferdy seemed to have two strings to his bow sarah dumps was not at home certainly yethere clarice stopped and thought a sudden idea struck her she returned quickly to the sickroom chalks you go sometimes to the savoy hotel she remarked were you there last night for half an hour miss replied the valet apologetically mrs rebson watched master while i was away i hope i didnt do wrong but master seemed to be sleeping so quietly that i thought i might get a breath of fresh air no no thats all right chalks but do you know if mrs dumps daughter has returned for christmas yes miss she came back last night and a very pretty girl she is miss quite a yes yes i have seen her interrupted clarice hurriedly and went away feeling more upset than ever this then was the reason of ferdys visit to the savoy hotel sarah dumps was in the field and ferdy was in her nets yet weak as the boy was it seemed incredible that he should propose to one woman and immediately seek the company of another here then was another trouble for clarice and she did not know very well what to do it was impossible to speak to ferdy as she had no proof that he loved sarah dumps save from what mrs rebson had said a simple denial on the part of ferdy would take the wind out of her sails so to speak and she would be helpless to do anything on the other hand clarice felt certain that in some way ferdy was playing a double game she knew his weak character too well to give him the benefit of the doubt for all she knew he might be engaged to both sarah dumps and prudence at the same time oh dear me cried her heart i wish anthony would marry me and take me away from all these troubles but even as she thought the wish seemed cowardly she would have to remain and fight ferdys battles and those of the vicar also if the purple fern meant any harm to mr horran she would be forced to help him also the sole thing she could do was to seek anthonys advice and aid towards noon that young man arrived having driven over from gattlinsands in his dogcart usually he came over on a motor bicycle but as he explained to clarice between kisses the sudden thaw had made the roads deathtraps in the way of slipping im jolly well splashed said ackworth laughing but if leander swam the hellespont to see hero why shouldnt i wade through acres of slush to see you of course smiled clarice who felt much lighterhearted now that this strong young lover was present only you were driving instead of wading my dear anthony well i dare say leander would have taken a penny steamer had there been one said anthony throwing back his handsome head so that makes my parallel the more perfect clarice laughed again and drew him silently to a sofa whereon they sat hand in hand after the delightfully foolish manner of lovers ackworth was certainly a swain of whom any girl might have been proud he was not the desperately goodlooking god of the family herald but was comely enough in his youth and strength to pass in a crowd his closely clipped hair was fair as was his moustache he had a bronzed face and a pair of merry blue eyes and was as well set up as military training and constant outofdoor exercise could make him finally he had a wellgroomed clean look and anyone could see that he was a thoroughly wholesome honourable gentleman clarice of course deemed him to be perfection which he was not but he had more virtues than faults and assuredly was masterful enough to satisfy the most exacting woman as a greek god anthony ackworth was a failure as a man to trust and love he came off very well that he was not superlatively clever did not lower clarices appreciation of his character well asked anthony unoriginally how are things all wrong replied clarice quickly i have been most anxious to see you dear i want help i should think you were clever enough to do without any help i could give you said ackworth admiringly for he looked upon miss baird as a queen elizabethcumcatherinegeorge eliot kind of woman is mr horran any better nothat is hes asleep he was asleep last time i was here yes he then slept for ten hours and woke up to drop asleep again for a longer period what a dormouse sort of existence is it that which worries you no uncle henry is no better and no worse than he ever was i have several things to worry me ferdy is engaged to prudence clarke lucky man shes a pretty girl said anthony that shouldnt worry you dearest you wished to have her for a sisterinlaw yes but theres sarah dumps what a name who is sarah dumps butterfly butterfly what you know she dances and sings under the name of oh anthony was suddenly enlightened i remember i saw a dancer called butterfly at the mascot musichall shes pretty but not the kind of woman i admire i am afraid ferdy does sighed clarice what you dont mean to say yes i do listen to what mrs rebson says and clarice related the conversation with the old housekeeper and you see ended miss baird anxiously if sarah dumps has come back and ferdy has gone to see her so immediately i am afraid he is entangled with her ackworth shook his head no my dear he said very decidedly ferdy is not clever but at least he is a gentleman no man would propose to one woman and then immediately visit another old flame i dont believe there is anything in the matter besides butterflyto give her the name she is best known byis ambitious of a richer husband than your brother to say nothing of her wish for a title but mrs dumps oh the mother living here naturally thinks ferdy a good match well he is he will have two thousand a year butterfly will want ten thousand from all i have heard she has a wonderful capacity for spending is sheis she clarice hesitated quite respectable oh quite assented ackworth decisively shes too clever a young woman to play fast and loose with her reputation she wants to marry well you see and therefore keeps straight but i dont think you need be afraid of ferdy darling hes only one of the many moths that have fluttered round that candle now that hes engaged hell forget her and after all its mere talk he may not be in love with butterfly at all why should he visit her so he may have gone to see the mother or to have a drink said anthony vaguely ferdys an ass but hes all right but dr jerce says he drinks and gambles and ill have to talk to ferdy and see if i can lead him in the right way said ackworth with some impatience dont trouble yourself over your brother dearest every young man of that age is more or less of an ass but its only like a young colt kicking his heels in a flowery meadow then i need not worry anthony no ill speak to ferdy and take this especial worry off your shoulders my dear anything else this clarice held out the letter without explanation as she wanted to know if the elusive memory would come more clearly to anthony he opened the envelope in silence then sprang up with a shout when he saw the contents the purple fern by jupiter said ackworth staring what does it mean asked clarice vaguely terrified ackworth looked anxious nothing very pleasant he muttered i thought it had been stamped out what had been stamped out this purple fern business dont you remember that the papers were full of it a year ago clarry clarice put her hand to her head the memory came back with a rush and she now knew why the pictorial representation of the fern had been vaguely familiar to her oh she exclaimed does it mean death to uncle henry what anthony looked relieved then you did not get it no uncle henry told me that he found it outside his bedroom window i expect he remembered about the murders and received the shock he talked about why do you look so relieved i thought that the warning might have been directed to you muttered ackworth turning over the envelope apparently it is not and perhaps not even to mr horran since there is no address tell me anthony exactly what it means said clarice anxiously i remember reading a lot about those murders but i almost forget i wonder at that considering how we talked them over said ackworth sitting down again and slipping his arm round her as though to protect her from harm dont you remember darling that one person after another was found murdered in houses and in streets with a purple fern stamped on the forehead and in every case a warning of a stamped fern was sent beforehand then the police caught one man redhanded he was tried and hanged but he would not give away his associates but the police gathered that he was one of a gang who killed people to get moneysince all the victims were wealthyand in every instance the sign of the association a purple fern was stamped on the forehead of the victim but with the hanging of the man that was caught the murders ceased this is the first time i have heard of a new warning being given i should recommend mr horran to take care of himself oh anthony how terrible do you really think that he is in danger of his life judging by the fact that seven people men and women were killed after such a warning had been sent i do think it is dangerous i shall see the local police about this at once the house must be watched i wonder why horran is to be killed is he very rich recollecting what clarke had said clarice could reply easily on the contrary he has nothing but what he earns by acting as our guardian i wish he could explain exactly how he picked up the letter but he is still asleep at this minute the wheels of a carriage were heard clarice wondering if the new arrival was jerce opened the french window and stepped out on to the terrace now sloppy with mixed snow and water and mud she strolled to the end followed by anthony and saw that dr jerce had indeed arrived he was stepping out of a hired fly and had just handed the man his fare when he caught sight of clarice at once he came towards her with outstretched hand she took it unwillingly enough i received a wire from wentworth he said anxiously i hope my old friend is not very ill again no hes in a sound sleep and dr wentworth is puzzled over the length of his slumber come in this way and she went along the terrace thank you ah mr ackworth how are you quite a change in the weather isnt it and iwhy whats the matter the ejaculation was caused by a cry from clarice she had picked up a small object which the thaw had revealed it was a small gold box and on its face was set a curved fern in amethysts the purple fern again exclaimed ackworth amazed chapter vii dr jerce explains ackworth and clarice looked at one another dumfounded and dr jerce with considerable amazement looked at them finally the eyes of all three rested on the object picked up by the girl it outwardly appeared to be a snuffbox and with its surface of dull gold wherein the amethystine fern was delicately set looked an exquisite specimen of the jewellers art but to jerce there seemed nothing about it to startle the young people yet anthony appeared grave and clarice even frightened one would think you had picked up a serpent said jerce jestingly what is there about that snuffbox which frightens you the purple fern she replied pointing to the amethysts as the doctor still seemed to be puzzled ackworth explained do you not remember those murders of a year ago murders oh eryes there was much in the papers about them but i read the public journals very little all my time is taken up with medical works just refresh my memory will you ackworth the dead bodies were stamped with a fern werent they yeson the forehead seven people were stabbed to the heart one in kensington gardens one in the strand one in a house at hampstead and one yes yes i remember now interrupted jerce impatiently but the murderer was caught and hanged if i forget not one murderer was caught said anthony with emphasis but he had accomplices whose names he refused to reveal really but there have been no more murders since no for over a year they have ceased but this ackworth pointed to the golden box and the warning received by mr horran look as though the accomplices who were not caught intend to begin another series of crimes jerce looked confounded whats that you say about horran having received a warning he asked before ackworth could reply clarice drew the attention of the two men to the box which she had opened it was divided into two compartments one of which was empty while the other was filled with a silken pad moistened with purple ink look cried miss baird aghast as well she might be this is the very box which contained the stamp for impressing the purple fern on the forehead of the victims here is the pad but the stamp has gone oh anthony how did this come here the letter too and what letter asked jerce soothing her agitation while ackworth took over the box to examine it its not exactly a letter said clarice striving to appear calm only uncle henry found an envelope outside his window yesterday it contained a sheet of paper stampedbut mr ackworth can show it to you here it is remarked anthony taking the envelope from his pocket and passing it to the now grave doctor and now this box has been found it seems to me that mr horran is in danger of death jerce examined the picture of the fern turned and twisted the envelope to see if there was any address or postmark and looked attentively at the dainty box humph said he cautiously the assassin must be a man of taste and culture since he designed such a receptacle for his indiarubber stamp and uses such costly stationery a man echoed clarice with a sudden idea the assassin may not be a man at all that box and paper look as though a woman no interrupted the doctor decisively the person who dropped this gold box here is a man and without doubt he is connected with those wretches who used the purple fern to stamp their handiwork yes he spoke half to himself there certainly must be a gang of course chimed in ackworth quickly the man who was caught defied the authorities to stamp out the criminals he admitted that he had three accomplices two i remember now broke in clarice two well then he admitted that he had two accomplices but refused to betray their names or hiding places also he warned the government that they would avenge his death but for the last twelve months they have not done so now ackworth pointed to the box and the warning missive with great significance we must take steps to save mr horrans life he ended decisively certainly certainly agreed jerce whats to be done ill go at once to the local police no i should not do that mr ackworth it will be better to come with me to london tonight and report the case at scotland yard but in the meantime uncle henry may be killed chalks can stop with him day and night until a detective arrives a detective echoed clarice in dismay and in this house why not asked jerce quietly we must take strong measures i see no reason why horran should be killed as he is not a wealthy man and this gang always selected their victims both men and women from rich people perhaps to supply these luxuries he touched the valuable box and expensive envelope but certainly the man in grey means to kill horran else why the warning the man in grey asked ackworth inquiringly ferdy told me about that said clarice quickly i was going to ask you about the man why did he search your pockets i did not know at the time said the doctor gravely but i know now come this way he walked into the drawingroom through the window we must speak softly so that no one may overhear but we are quite safe here said clarice as anthony closed the window why are you afraid doctor walls have ears my dear miss baird and the remaining man of the triumvirate is clever and cunning the remaining man said ackworth then another of the three is dead jerce nodded and sat down quietly he looked somewhat upset it is a very unpleasant business he said anxiously and i am to blame in not having allowed ferdinand to inform the police about the assault made on me the other night had the man in grey been arrested this warning or threat might not have come also the fact of the box with the purple fern would have ensured his hanging as one of the gang who committed those cruel murders i am much to blame all i can say is that not until i returned to harley street on that night did i guess why the man in grey wanted to search my pockets and why did he asked clarice who had been listening to this explanation with a puzzled look thats a long story then begin at the beginning said ackworth impetuously for i want to know everything so that i can see my way to what mr ackworth to protecting mr horran and getting this blackguard arrested jerce nodded approvingly i shall lend you all the assistance i can mr ackworth said he firmly unless this man is caught he will be a veritable scourge to society the storythe story cried clarice with impatience it is indeed a story more like romance than real life said jerce quickly you know miss baird that i have a consulting room in tea street whitechapel yes mr horran told me that also said anthony you physic poor people for nothing i do i earn so much money in the west end that i think it is only right to use my talents for the poor we must do what good we can in this world you know mr ackworth i dont set up for being a philanthropist but in my humble way i do what good i can well then he resumed quickly seeing that clarice was growing impatient again i was therein tea streetsome two months ago and attended on a young man who was dying of consumption he appeared to be clever refined and intelligent and for that miserably poor quarter his room was furnished with great taste and somewhat expensively he seemed to be absolutely alone and i did what i could to save his life all my skill was of no avail and he died as i had refused to receive a fee he gave me a sealed envelope and told me to carry it constantly upon my person why asked clarice wonderingly ill tell you later the dying man also warned me that if i was attacked by a fellow with a crisscross scar on his left cheek to open the envelope then the man died and was buried i did not attach much importance to the sealed letter and didnt you open it asked the girl eagerly not until the man in grey attacked me i should have opened it at once she said quickly jerce smiled eves curiosity he answered however i am not a woman so i refrained from unsealing the envelope and after a time i slipped it with some other papers into my safe and thought no more about the matter but when this grey man attacked me the other night the incident was recalled to my mind but not added jerce with emphasis not until ferdinand told me that he had seen a man in grey clothes with a scar on his cheek i then returned to london and opened the envelope i found therein a paper containing a name and address what were they asked anthony who was listening attentively alfred osip rough lane stepney also there were a few lines stating that the man who wrote themmy consumptive patientand osip were the surviving members of the purple fern gang and that if osips room in stepney were searched papers proving the guilt of all would be found well then mr ackworth one man has been hanged another has died of consumption and the third alfred osip is the person who attacked me on that terrace and no doubt in the struggle dropped this golden box which at one time undoubtedly contained the indiarubber stamp used to mark the victims i see said clarice but why should osip attack you doctor jerce looked at her in surprise my dear you are usually quicker in seeing things he said rebukefully of course osip in some way knew that his dying accomplice had betrayed him and that i carried the sealed letteras he thoughton my person that was why he searched i should have had him arrested when ferdinand suggested going for the police but i never dreamed that the wretch was connected with the purple fern gang however i have made what amends i can i went at once to scotland yard and told the authorities what i have told you now this warning to horranundoubtedly sent by osipand this box will be valuable evidence he may be caught redhanded if he attempts the murder but you can see now mr ackworth why i suggest that you should not inform the local police osip is cunning and dangerous so it will be advisable for us to get a detective from london to see into the matter i fear the crumel police may bungle the business i return to london this afternoonor to be precise this evening so i shall at once communicate this new discovery to the scotland yard authorities ackworth nodded i think your plan is the best doctor he said in a meditative voice only i hope this brute will not murder mr horran in the meantime i suggest that chalks should remain constantly with mr horran will not that arouse mr horrans suspicions asked anthony after all in his delicate state of health it will not do to let him know that he is in danger of death uncle henry knows already said clarice impetuously the discovery of the envelope gave him a shockhe said so and wanted to see you doctor i expect the sight of the fern recalled the murders to him at once i had an idea that the fern was familiar to me but until mr ackworth refreshed my memory i could not be sure ill speak to chalks said jerce rising but it will be just as well that no one else in the house should know about the matter and theres one who knows said a voice coming from a distant alcove and ferdys head appeared over the back of a deep leather armchair which faced towards a window the doctor started and looked displeased ferdinand he said in an angry voice why did you listen to what does not concern you i think it concerns me a great deal said ferdy coolly and came forward into the full light of the room very pale and with ruffled hair i went to sleep in that chair and woke up at the sound of your voices i listened half unconsciously and then when the story became interesting i listened with all my ears as the chairback is towards you i expect you did not see me i wish you had come out ferdy said clarice much annoyed as she recalled her conversation with ackworth how long have you been sleeping not very long i came in through the window when you were out on the terrace ackworth looked hard at ferdy to see if he was lying but could only make out that the young man looked extremely upset he remarked upon it with some dryness and baird turned on him at once with the fractiousness of a spoilt child that story has made me quite sick said he restlessly i dont want to be murdered in my bed the warning was not sent to you said clarice contemptuously if it had been id have gone to the police station right off i wish you had let me go on that night doctor i wish i had said jerce regretfully however its too late now and we must do the best we can dont say a word about this to anyone ferdinand i jolly well wont i dont wish to be mixed up with these horrid things said baird im going upstairs to lie down now i was sleepy before with walking but now im quite sick with sleepy with walking whispered clarice drawing close to him ferdy you have been drinking in the savoy hotel your eyes are red and your cheeks are pale you have been oh leave me alone said ferdy rudely and twitching his sleeve from clarices hand he abruptly left the room anthony bit his lip that young monkey deserves a kicking he said sharply if he were not your brother clarice i should break his neck dr jerce started already the girl had called the man by his christian name and now the man was returning the compliment clarice coloured with genuine annoyance as jerce was the last man to whom she wanted the secret of her engagement revealed the doctor looked sharply from one to the other but saying nothing walked towards the door with official composure clarice did not know if he guessed the truth or if he deemed the interchange of familiar names mere slips of the tongue jerces face was inscrutable will you come with me to see our patient he asked clarice politely certainly doctor please remain here mr ackworth she cast a side glance at jerce to see if he noted the stiff address but he made no sign i shall return almost directly anthony looked puzzled as he could not understand why clarice had coloured when speaking to the doctor and was perfectly unaware that jerce had hinted at a proposal however as the presence of a third person did not permit of an explanation he merely bowed his acquiescence clarice looked at her lover for one moment in a hesitating manner then hastily followed the doctor she caught up with him at the door of mr horrans bedroom and they entered without speaking as usualsince wentworth had last seen the patientthe french window was wide open jerce immediately shut it sharply i have told you a dozen times to keep this window closed he said severely to chalks i dont open it sir protested the valet dr wentworth he has his views and i have mine said jerce imperiously mr horran is my patient and dr wentworth is merely called in as a local practitioner to act while i am absent the window must be kept closed day and night do you hear yes sir said chalks sulkily i think master is waking sir both jerce and clarice turned towards the bed and saw that horran was sitting up he smiled in a dreamy way when he caught sight of his old friend but seemed disinclined to talk jerce felt the mans pulse and listened to the beating of his heart then he produced an ophthalmoscope and examined the eyes turning up the lids delicately with his fingers after a few minutes he drew back with a puzzled expression and shook his head while horran in a semiconscious condition sank back on his pillow well asked clarice eagerly jerce shrugged his shoulders as usual i can say nothing he replied in a low voice i can find no trace of opticneuritis and the visual acuity is normal on my next visit when wentworth is present i shall make a more precise examination what is to be done nothing at present i never met with a more interesting or more perplexing case in all my experience i would give much to know the true cause of these symptoms i must return to town by the three oclock train concluded the doctor glancing at his watch no said a strong voice from the bed and there they saw horran sitting up apparently wide awake the sudden change was one quite characteristic of his mysterious disease no repeated the sick man with an anxious glance at jerce you and i must have a talk daniel things must be settled between us yes yes said jerce goodnaturedly then sank his voice to address clarice he apparently wants to talk about his will leave me alone with him take chalks with you clarice kissed her guardian but he took no notice of her as his eyes were steadily fixed on the doctors strong calm face things must be settled between us repeated horran as clarice and chalks departed chapter viii what happened next well asked anthony when clarice returned to the drawingroom is mr horran any better i think so he is awake and his voice is stronger but whether the improvement will last i cant say what does the doctor say nothing he is very perplexed over this disease and does not know what is the matter that doesnt say much for jerces reputation said ackworth dr jerce is only a man after all answered clarice earnestly and uncle henrys disease is so very mysterious that neither he nor dr wentworth can say anything explicit ackworth twisted his hands behind his back and swayed to and fro on his toetips i wonder if mr horran is really ill after all clarice with her handkerchief to her mouth looked at him suddenly and inquiringly what do you mean from what i have seen of mr horran said ackworth quietly he does not appear to be ill his colour is good he eats well and sleeps a lot he has not lost flesh and his eyes are steady certainly he appears to become giddy at times but that might be biliousness from his sedentary life also he gets cross and fractiousthat again might be liver he lives very unhealthily stewing in that room with a fire and such an existence is enough to produce all the symptoms he suffers from without any real physical cause well questioned clarice not knowing what this speech meant you wont be offended asked ackworth in his turn and uneasily with what i am about to say something about the purple fern yes she stared at him amazed ackworth still continued to sway to and fro and gazed at the ground as he replied mr horran may take exercise at night go on i dont understand his illness may be a feint for what for business connected with the purple fern anthony clarice recoiled as though he had struck her oh i know it sounds ridiculous said ackworth hurriedly and perhaps it may prove to be ridiculous all the same the fact of that man searching jerce on the terrace and this mysterious illness and the envelope containing the stamped fern and the presence of the gold box which jerce now haswell you seei dont exactly know how to put it clarice drew near to him again do you mean to say that uncle henry has anything to do with these murders oh noi dont go so far as that my dear do you remember that when i became engaged to you you asked me to see barras the lawyer since your guardian was too ill to be spoken to yes i wanted you to inquire about the money well i spoke to barras last week and learn that you certainly get two thousand per annum in a couple of years ferdy gets the same and mr horran is sole guardian with a right to appoint another guardian should he die mr barras wishing to stand well with me i suppose as your future husband hinted that you might not find everything right at horrans death but uncle henry told me that everything was in order cried miss baird and declared that he had appointed me guardian to look after ferdys money when he diedwhen uncle henry died i mean humph that does not entirely agree with mr barras hints and he did no more than hint but something is wrong and mr horranas i understood from barrasis the cause of its being wrong uncle henry has always been a good friend quite so but has he been a good guardian yes no one could have been a better one so far as i know precisely said anthony quickly so far as you know but the fact is clarice i dont like mr horran and i never liked him andand he hesitated go ongo on dont keep me in suspense well then three months ago i was in town and went to a ball at the shahs rooms it was notto be plaina very reputable dance or at all events it was extremely bohemian i went there before i was engaged to you clarice now i should not go well then at that dance i saw mr horran oh thats quite impossible he has not been out of his room for years and years i recognised him at a glance said ackworth steadily his military carriage his spare figure his long irongrey moustache and he was with a tall man who had a crisscross scar on his left cheek the man in grey who searched dr jerce on the terrace the sameif dr jerces description is to be relied upon i never thought of the thing until you left the room then remembering our late conversation the memory of the incident came back now clarice if this manas jerce declaresis mixed up in the purple fern business he certainly was with mr horran and that dont you see brings your guardian into the affair clarice turned quite pale it is very mysterious she said to herself and yet it seems perfectly absurd uncle henry is ill he has always been ill off and on for the last ten years i have lived in this house with him all the time how could he possibly go to town even once without my knowledge ackworth shrugged his square shoulders oh as to that a good motorcar could take him to london and back in a few hours uncle henry has not got a motorcar he may have one we do not know of said ackworth quickly and as that french window of his opens on to the terrace on the other side of the house it would not be difficult for him to slip out and back again without your knowing but chalks has sat up with him often quite so but he may have slipped out on the nights chalks did not sit up with him are you sure it was uncle henry you saw at the shahs rooms i caught only a glimpse of him with the scarred man but i feel certain he was mr horran he has rather a striking personality and appearance you know also when i moved forward to speak to him he saw me and vanished in the crowd of dancers if he was there when he was supposed to be ill at home there may be something in mr barrass hints also as he was with the man in grey and the box was found on the terrace yonder by you and a stamped picture of the fern was delivered to him it seems to me that mr horran is secretly mixed up with the matter it is all supposition said clarice uneasily quite so however the best thing to do will be to ask mr horran for an explanation yes and dr jerce no i shouldnt do that jerce is an eminently respectable man and if anything was wrong i should think he would show scant mercy to the wrongdoer dr jerce may know more than you imagine said clarice quickly and she related what the vicar had said about the loan ackworth listened with great attention humph jerce apparently suspects something also horran has been moneylending it seems and is quite a shylock why dont you speak to horran about the loan to the vicar it is your money horran has been playing with if it is true that he has nothing save an income for acting as your guardian but mr clarke told me that dr jerce would not allow him to see uncle henry about the loan dr jerce wants to keep his patient quiet and may be quite deceived about this diseaseif it is a disease dr jerce is too clever to be deceived but he is insisted ackworth seeing that neither he nor wentworth can state what the disease is i tell you what clarice you announce your engagement to me and that will give some colour for me to interfere then we can get mr clarke in to see mr horran and also we can ask mr horran about his appearance with the man in grey at the shahs rooms finally we can ask mr barras to be present and make him explain his hints in this way everything will be cleared up and matters can be placed upon a proper basis clarice assented i think your idea is very good she said quietly all the same i fancy you are exaggerating when you say that uncle henry has to do with this dreadful business of the purple fern ackworth shrugged his shoulders he can best explain that i am quite prepared to state on oath that i saw mr horran with the purple fern man at the shahs rooms but of course as you say i may be exaggerating everything i say may be explained by mr horran but only he can put things right at this point of the conversation dr jerce returned to the drawingroom looking rather perturbed for so serene a man he was drawing on his gloves as he entered where is ferdinand was his first question as he cast a look round upstairs lying down said clarice dont you remember he yes yes jerce turned to the door again i know where his room is i must see him before i go he glanced at his watch ill just have time for a short conversation before i catch this three oclock train excuse me miss baird but doctor stopstop what is the matter with uncle henry he is annoyed by mr clarke about the loan asked clarice quickly jerce looked at her astonished yes do you know about that mr clarke himself told me and said that you did not want him to see uncle henry about it i certainly did not said jerce decidedly clarke is always in difficulties and horran has been very good to him his talking of incessant trouble would only irritate horran so i would not allow him to enter the house but it seems that mr clarke slipped in through the french window and made trouble today while chalks was out i have promised to see clarke when i return here again and to arrange that the interest of the loan stands over for another six months which will give him time to turn round as it were but i wish he had not forced his way into the sickroom he has done harm but doctor about the purple fern oh horran talked about that but i have managed to set his fears at rest he thinks he may be murdered so i have told chalks to stay with him all night tomorrow the scotland yard people will take up the matter ill go to the yard tonight and tell everything we have discovered also ill give in the gold box as evidence and dont you think began ackworth when jerce cut him short i have no time to talk he said impatiently i must see ferdinand and then catch this train as i have much to do miss baird your guardian is rather feverish with excitement you had better not see him tonight tomorrow ill come down again and with these final instructions jerce slipped out of the room clarice and anthony looked at one another i shall see uncle henry for all that said clarice determinedly no no better obey the doctors instructions urged anthony after all what we have to say will keep until tomorrow but i am so worried i know darlingi know he slipped his arm round her slender waist but it is best to settle this perplexing business in a shipshape way leave mr horran alone for tonight clarice thought for a few moments anthony she said earnestly i cannot wait for days for an explanation and it seems to me that there can be none unless mr barras is present christmas is here in a couple of days so i want you to go up to town and bring down mr barras tomorrow then we can take him into uncle henrys room and have an explanation humph said anthony doubtfully it seems to me that if jerce goes to scotland yard the authorities there may wish for an explanation from mr horran not if you hold your tongue as to uncle henrys being at the shahs rooms she said anxiously you want me to shield him we dont know yet that he is guilty she reminded him sharply ackworth nodded after all he had doubtful ground to go upon in connecting horran with the criminal triumvirate whose trademark was the purple fern the man might be entirely innocent notwithstanding appearances however if barras was an honest lawyerand on the face of it there was no reason to think that he was nothe would be able in the presence of his client to state if the property of the baird orphans was administered honourably if horran had been using the money for his own secret pleasure and for loans to clarke and others he would be forced to account for the same and such a forced explanation would inevitably compel him to acknowledge or deny that he was at the shahs rooms when ackworth saw him if he confessed so much he would also have to explain how he came to know the grey man who assuredlyif the gold box was to be accounted forhad to do with the purple fern crimes then in one way or another matters might be explained they were certainly mysterious enough at present in the meantime the lovers postponed inevitable disagreeables in order to talk about their own particular future and to enjoy themselves the more they went for a short drive in ackworths dogcart which had been waiting all this time at the door in charge of mr horrans groom anthony had not brought his own servant so the conversation of himself and his fiance was perfectly free and unfettered as they drove along the high street dr jerce passed them in earnest conversation with ferdinand i expect hes bringing your brother to his senses said ackworth hopefully i hope he will sighed clarice i am not very fond of dr jerce but he is certainly a good man and his example is one which ferdy should follow i wonder she added musingly if ferdy ever saw uncle henry at the shahs rooms that is just the sort of fast place which ferdy would go to anthony flicked the horses ears with his whip and laughed i have been there also said he coolly perhaps i should not have confessed as much to you my dear why not demanded clarice with perfect candour you must not think me a cottonwool young woman i quite understand that men are men and that women are angels questioned anthony bending to see her pretty face we leave that for the men to say returned clarice dryly this man says itof you this man does not talk sense nor does he intend to i have had enough of sense for the day my dearest sensible conversation invariably means worry let us enjoy our golden hour without transmuting it into dull lead miss baird who was feminine after all and very much in love and young in years and spirits thought that this was an excellent idea so the rest of the drive was all that could be desired in the way of cheap and genuine happiness when it ended she gave anthony russian tea in a tumbler and dainty caviare sandwiches ferdy as they learned from mrs rebson had returned from the railway station to enjoy his golden hour at the vicarage and mr horran had again fallen asleep but simple happiness over afternoon tea could not last for ever and when anthony set out for gattlinsands after a lingering farewell clarice felt the reaction to prevent herself from feeling dull it was necessary that she should do something so true to her intention of defying dr jerce she tapped at the door of the sickroom chalks appeared with a whispered communication that the patient was awake and too fractious to see anyone on that night clarice returned to the drawingroom and read indolently until wentworth came to pay a late visit at eight oclock just as she descended the stairs dressed for dinner miss baird caught the young physician at the door and accosted him at once is uncle henry better doctor she asked coming forward wentworth was a slim shy man who wore spectacles and spoke in a jerky staccato manner when addressed by a woman betteryesthat ismore awake lethargy passed awayvery bad temper better leave him alone until the morning night miss baird and he shot off in confusion like a timid schoolboy clarice made a hurried meal and returned drearily to the empty drawingroom without any desire to encounter the fractiousness of her guardian which she had experienced on more than one occasion after the somewhat exciting day she really felt wornout and in need of rest therefore made up her mind to retire comparatively early however she hoped that ferdy would come home soon to explain his absence from the dinner table and passed the time in playing patience until ten oclock finally after asking mrs rebson if the house was locked up and if ferdy had returnedwhich he had notshe ascended the stairs to bed at the top of them she found ferdy clinging to the banisters apparently he had entered the house without mrs rebsons knowledge oh said clarice perceiving his condition again ferdy chuckled ive beensvy hlbtfly pretty girljlly evningsuch funitsits here he missed one step and rolled down two with an idiotic giggle clarice would have struck him in her disgust but that would have done no good being a prompt and powerful young woman she caught him by the collar of his coat and dragged him into his bedroom on the first floor there she locked him in while ferdy protested weakly all the time and only yielded to superior force faugh said clarice throwing the key on her dressingtable what a weak fool he is she sat down and stared at the reflection of her face in the louis quinze mirror it looked weary and drawn i shall be an old woman soon if this sort of thing goes on she thought oh dear me how tired i am of bearing other peoples burdens i must end it in some way ill get the truth out of uncle henry settle the money matters marry anthony and wash my hands of everything as to ferdy ill marry him to prudence and let her look after him having thus arranged the future she retired to rest but not to sleep since her brain was much too active for slumber she tossed and turned and sighed wearily at intervals as the hours dragged on to midnight only on hearing the church clock strike twelve did she begin to lose consciousness and finally thankfully sank into a deep slumber which lasted for hours towards dawn as is often the case with worried people she began to dream in a confused broken way and the purple fern very naturally since it was in her mind mingled with her fleeting visions she fledso it seemedthrough dark streets of nightmare length pursued by the man in grey who assumed monstrous proportions he caught her at the end of interminable miles andso she dreamed with gasping horrorstabbed her to the heart then she felt the mark of the purple fernthe mark indeed of the beast as it might bestamped on her forehead afterwards half awake and half asleeponly in her dream she was deadshe felt herself being placed in a narrow coffin and heard the hammering of the nails which closed her in for ever and ever and ever with a violent effort she broke the nightmares bonds and woke in a cold perspiration to see the cold faint dawn glimmering behind the window blinds andhorrible feelingto hear the knocking continue but not on her dream coffin the blows came on her bedroom door steady persistent terrifying she heard her name called in a quavering voice and sprang out of bed confused and dazed wrapping a dressinggown round her and somewhat recovering her senses she hastily unlocked the door which she invariably kept closed during the hours of sleep on the threshold stood chalks white and shaking with chattering teeth and trembling hands miss miss he stammered and then fled down the stairs unable to get out his words sick with fear clarice followed in her disordered attire and came to horrans room on the bed lay the body of the sick man with a cruel wound in his breast he was stiff and cold deadmurderedand on his chill forehead was the infernal mark of the purple fern chapter ix the inquest mr horran was as dead as a door nail there could be no doubt about that while chalks shivered and wrung his hands in the middle of the room demoralised and helpless clarice bent over the bed in a dazed manner she could scarcely grasp the situation notwithstanding that it had been foreshadowedas it wereby the mystery of the grey man without doubt he was the assassin the sinister omen of the purple fern had been fulfilled an eighth victim had been struck down and his forehead bore the infernal trademark of the triumvirate which no longer existed one of the members had been hanged another had died from natural causes but the survivor alfred osip of rough lane stepney had accomplished alone the accursed work which the three had undertaken i was sent away explained the valet with chattering teeth by master at eleven oclock as he would not let me sit up with him i came into the room as usual about seven oclocka few minutes ago missto see if master wanted me then i saw thathe pointed to the bedand thishe picked up an assegai which was lying near the escritoire look at the blood on it miss and look at the cruel wound in masters breast the bedclothes were perfectly smooth and turned down to the dead mans waist in an orderly manner the jacket of his pyjamas was open and the breast revealed a ragged wound upon which the blood had congealed apparently the assassin osip had found the unfortunate man sound asleep and having taken the assegai from the collection of barbaric weapons on the wall had turned down the clothes to stab his victim with a surer aim there was no sign of a struggle and even clarices untutored senses told her that henry horran had been foully murdered in his sleep but how had the assassin entered the windowshe wheeled round with a set face and stretched out an arm the window is open she said in a dry cracking voice yes miss whispered chalks dr wentworth saw master after dr jerce went away and opened the window as usual you fool cried clarice furiously and recollecting jerces precautions in the face of the warning you have made two mistakes you should have obeyed dr jerce in sitting up all night with mr horran and the window according to his directions should have been closed i told you about the window before miss said chalks doggedly i let them doctors do what they liked as it aint my place to advise medical men as to sitting up dr jerce told me to do so but master insisted that i should leave about eleven as usual how can i obey them all asked the little man tearfully i ask you that miss but you knew the danger and what danger miss master has slept with that window open off and on for three yearsever since dr wentworth came to look after him he said it was to be open and dr jerce always wanted it to be shut i let them do what they liked you should have remained all night with mr horran said clarice remembering that chalks knew nothing about the warning of the purple fern or the need of especial supervision with a royal bengal tiger miss wailed chalks for that was what master was last night i never saw him so crossnever he seemed to have something on his mind and went on awful what did he say asked miss baird thinking horrans utterances might shed a light on the darkness i cant tell you miss it was swearing for the most part but he made me go to bed and laughed when i declared that dr jerce told me to sit up with him how did you leave him sitting up in bed swearing with that window open it was ajar as dr wentworth left it explained the valet cautiously dr jerce closed it in the day and dr wentworth opened it when he left about eight oclock last night did you hear any noise in the room during the night now how could i miss complained the little man in an injured tone seeing that my bedroom is at the back of the house and that i sleep like a top through being worn out with masters tempers i left at eleven last night and came again at seven but what happened between them hours i know no more than you do i know what happened said clarice with a shudder and looking at the still figure on the bed murder happenedas you see but why should it happen miss master had his tempers but he would not have harmed a fly i cant tell you the reason chalks but doubtless osip intended to murder mr horran for some wicked purpose of his own osip echoed the valet starting why that is the man who was going to stop at mrs dumps savoy hotel a few days ago and didnt what day was that asked clarice quickly chalks searched his memory and mentioned the very evening when dr jerce had been searched on the terrace there was no longer any doubt in clarices mind but what horran had been killed by osip but why so inoffensive a man should be thus cruelly put out of the way she could not conjecture however theorising would not help so she moved away from the bed with a sigh and tried to recover her composure you had better go at once for the police chalks she said rapidly meanwhile ill rouse up my brother and the servants they are already up miss do they know no miss i just cast one glance and then flew up to you miss why not to master ferdinand because miss we always look to you for orders said the valet respectfully and about the body miss dont touch itdont touch anything said clarice warningly it is necessary that the police should see the room as it is and on your way to the police station chalks send a telegram to captain ackworth at gattlinsands and to dr jerce in london miss there is no need dr jerce is coming down today as usual clarice went to see mrs rebson and communicated the dreadful news of the crime in a few minutes the other servants were also informed and everyone was horrified that such a tragedy had taken place in the quiet house mr horran had little enough to do with the domestics seeing that he usually kept to his room but he was sufficiently well liked to make one and all regret that he had come to so terrible an end and mrs rebsons expressions of sorrow were mingled with congratulatory comments on the triumph of the domestic prophet didnt i tell you miss she said nodding convincedly didnt i tell you that trouble and death and disgrace would come and you laughed at mewhat do you think of the prophet now miss baird shook her head being too stunned by the catastrophe to express her wonder or her reasons for disbelief she went to her own room to dress and mrs rebson sailed down to the kitchen with the domestic prophet in her hand ready to partake of a cup of tea and to expatiate on the wonderful manner in which the seers chance shot had hit the bullseye of the future having completed a hasty toilet clarice took the key of ferdys bedroom from her toilettetable and went to release him as might be expected seeing that the hour was early ferdy was still in bed and fast asleep when his sister shook him he rolled over and muttered something uncomplimentary his debauch of the previous night had left him somewhat haggard but the nights rest had to a great extent smoothed away the lines of dissipation from his handsome face get up ferdy said clarice harshly uncle henry is dead the wordso terribly significantpenetrated even to ferdys shallow sleepy brain and he sat up with widelyopened horrified brown eyes uncle henry he gasped dead murdered whispered his sister grey and shaken whaaat ferdy sprang out of bed and his pink pyjamas formed a strange contrast to his white horrified face clarry youyoumustyou must be mistaken i have just seen his body with a wound in the breast and with the mark of the purple fern on the forehead clarry ferdinand caught her by the hand what i overheard yesterday in the drawingroomwhat you and ackworth and jerce yes yes she said impatiently and wrenched herself free everything is plain this man osip murdered uncle henry last night i have sent for the police dress yourself quickly ferdy and come down to see them with me i expect the inspector will come and i have also sent for anthony ferdy caught her by the dress as she moved towards the door but clarry clarry why has uncle henry been killed i know no more than you do we must find out it is something that we know the name of the murderer ferdy gasped andanddo you he stuttered of course that man osip is oh ferdy wiped his face osipof coursethe purple fern man but how can you be certain he is guilty he put his trademark on uncle henrys forehead said clarice and left the bedroom after a second command to ferdy that he should dress quickly and come on the scene of action osip osip said ferdy to himself stripping for his bath thats the man in grey jerce talked ofthe man who called on old mother dumps and paid her for a bed he did not use i wonder if he really is guilty at all events murmured ferdy thankfully and splashing in his tub as clarry locked me in last night they cant say that i have anything to do with it poor uncle henrybut cheerfully now ill get my money and can marry prudence if ruefully if sally dumps will let me meanwhile clarice downstairs was talking to inspector tick who was in charge of the crumel police and who had come with two constables to see about the tragedy miss baird told him all that had happened since jerce had been searched on the terrace by the man in grey who had given the name of osip to mrs dumps then she conducted tick to the deathchamber and left him to examine chalks and the body later wentworth arrived and two hours afterwards captain ackworth appeared on the scene both were horrified didnt you hear a cry clarice asked anthony when in possession of the facts i heard nothing she replied nor did chalks but that is not to be wondered at since chalks sleeps at the back of the house and is far away from uncle henrys room did ferdy hear anything i dont think so though i havent asked him he came home drunk last night shortly after ten oclock so i locked him in his room and in any case anthony i dont think a cry was uttered for uncle henry must have been stabbed by the assegai in his sleep the window was open questioned ackworth thoughtfully why clarice explained the contention between the two doctors as regards fresh air and how the local practitioner being the last to see the patient had left the fatal window ajar theres nothing to be learned from that ended clarice with a shrug i expect this osip man was haunting the house to kill uncle henry and the open window gave him his chance humph said anthony meditatively there is one peculiar circumstance if osip is guilty he would have brought a weapon with him why then should he take an assegai from the wall such a clumsy article too i dont know answered clarice but i expect well learn all that is to be learned at the inquest it will take place tomorrow for the whole of the morning inspector tick was busy making notes and asking questions he examined wentworth about the window clarice again as to the finding of the gold box ferdinand about the presence of osip at the savoy hotel and then after a word or two with chalks on the same subject went off to see mrs dumps in the midst of all this excitement dr jerce arrived he looked much distressed as he had heard the truth at the station my dear miss baird he exclaimed when he learned all that she knew how terrible my oldest and best friend dear dearand just when i had arranged that the matter of osip should be inquired into have you seen the scotland yard authorities asked ackworth suddenly yes last night i handed over the gold box and explained they said they would send down a detective today and on hearing the news at the station i sent a wire to expedite his arrival then we shall get at the truth it seems to me that we know the truth said clarice quickly osip killed uncle henry and took advantage of the open window to do so ah said jerce bitterly if my directions had only been attended to the assassin would not have been able to enter the house i look upon wentworth as responsible in some measure for the crime oh no no expostulated anthony wentworth did not know that horrans life was threatened we ought to have told him all jerce shook his head and still condemned wentworth when that doctor appeared out of the deathchamber where he had been examining the body he and jerce had a wordy argument jerce blamed wentworth for not leaving the window closed as jerce had left it and wentworth complained that jerce should have told him that the dead mans life was in danger had i known that said wentworth i should have left the window closed according to the etiquette of our profession said jerce stiffly my treatment took precedence of yours i closed the window yesterday before i went and you should have left it closed i believe in fresh air snapped wentworth holding to his point and in this disease i believe in warmth for the patient retorted the more famous doctor do you set your opinion against mine i have my own views about this disease said wentworth you dont know what it is sir neither do you if it comes to that dr jerce i am just about to find out said the great man and stalked from the drawingroom followed by the humbler member of the profession who was still bent upon asserting his dignity it was a sad christmas eve for clarice anthony stopped as long as he could but had to return to his duties early in the evening ferdy behaved much better than his sister expected him to since he remained at home and did his best to comfort her after dinner the vicar looked in and talked religion but clarice knowing what a weak man the parson was did not find much encouragement in his ministrations the kitchen was much livelier than the drawingroom for there mrs rebson was enthroned with the domestic prophet in her lap recounting over and over again what the book had said and how she had applied it to mr horran the next day being christmas the inquest could not be held but on boxing day the jury and the local coroner arrived to inspect the body and to hold an inquiry already the london papers had heard of the murder and as it was the eighth of the purple fern series a number of reporters came from the metropolis to take notes never before was the quiet little town so lively for cheap trippers took advantage of cheap fares to come and view the scene of the latest crime many even preferred this new excitement to the wellworn amusements of southend which was not very far distant mrs dumps especially did a roaring trade being particularly popular from having conversed with the murderer the shrewd little woman made the best of the notoriety which had so suddenly rendered her famous im sure she cackled a dozen times in the course of the day you could have knocked me down with a feather when i heard that such a nice man as mr osip was nothing but a cutthroat assassin and he wanted to take poor mr horrans house toojust like his artfulness when he intended murder and sudden death as the prayer book says oh that dumps were alive to support me for my limbs is giving with horror at the thought that i might likewise be cut off in the prime of my youth and beauty lydia beer to that gentleman over there and now ill have to get ready for the inquest my evidence being required to hang the assassin though assassin he didnt look like i can tell you gentleman as nice a spoken man as i ever listened to which shows how careful we ought to be seeing that in the middle of life we are in our grave as the bible says after which and a few other incoherent speeches the little woman arrayed herself in her smartest frock and took her way to the house of death here the coroner presided in the drawingroom over twelve good and lawful men there was no mystery about the murder as everyone was perfectly satisfied that alfred osip was guilty but it was necessary to collect all evidence to reveal how osip had committed the crime and to gather any clues together which might lead to his capture the two bairds were present with ackworth and dr jerce before the proceedings began clarice took the opportunity to ask the latter if he had discovered the reason for horrans mysterious disease which had baffled him and everyone else for so many years yes whispered jerce calmly but with a look of triumph in his eye and i was right in my surmise as to what was the matter my poor friend would have died of the disease had he not been murdered what was the disease asked clarice curiously you would not understand if i explained said jerce shrugging the description would be too technical but i want to know well said the great physician when i removed the skullcap i found a cyst had formed under the membranes and was pressing on the brain the probable cause of the cyst was cystic degeneration of an old bloodclot the result of intracranial hmorrhage clarice shook her head the death by the assegai was easier to understand chapter x a chance whisper the coroner a stolid old country doctor of sixty with a ruddy face shrewd eyes and a beard which would have done credit to a christmas card santa claus opened the proceedings after the jury had inspected the corpse his few brief remarks regarding the nature of the death and the heinousness of the crime introduced fussy inspector tick with a sheaf of notes dealing with uptodate evidence tick described the appearance of the dead man described the state of the room hinted at the open window and laid before the jury the deadly assegai with which the death wound had in all human probability been inflicted then the inspector reverted to the appearance of the man in grey at the savoy hotel under the name of alfred osip and related what dr jerce had said about the struggle on the terrace afterwards he mentioned the finding of the envelope containing the representation of the purple fern and the discovery by miss baird of the gold box he finished by again drawing the attention of the jury to the fact of the open window and to the finding of the dead man by chalks not being an orator inspector tick spoke with hesitation and set forth his facts dryly but these were so interesting that the lack of ornamentation was not apparent mrs dumps was the first witness called by the inspector and she deposed in a shrill voice and with many words that alfred osipso the man in grey called himselfcame to the savoy hotel and had paid for bed breakfast and dinner after making inquiries about the inhabitants of crumel and especially about those in the deceaseds house the laurels on the plea that he thought of settling in the town mr osip had departed and had never returned there was nothing in osips talk declared mrs dumps which gave her any hint that he contemplated murder he had not reappeared at the savoy hotel there was nothing further to be gained from mrs dumps so she was requested to stand aside which she did unwillingly enough as she liked the publicity of her position dr jerce followed next and described how the man in greypresumably alfred osiphad searched him on the terrace of the laurels and explained that he probably wanted the letter given to witness by the sick man in tea street whitechapel jerce also stated that the letter had been handed by him to the scotland yard authorities in london and they had made inquiries the result of which would be explained to the jury by mr sims a detective now present the coroner asked a few questions regarding the deceaseds illness and the open window all of which jerce answered in detail he explained the cause of the disease as gathered from the postmortem examination and the reason why the window had been left open by wentworth and closed by himself afterwards jerce deposed as to the cause of death which took place from horran having been stabbed to the heartapparently during his sleep said the witnessby an assegai which was produced by inspector tick the murder according to the condition and stiffness of the body must have taken place between the hours of one and two oclock in the morning the doctor finally stated that he had been a lifelong friend of the deceased and never knew him to have any enemies dr wentworths evidence was much the same as that of jerce he held to fresh air although dr jerce preferred the patient to have warmth and so had opened the window just before he left the deceased at eight oclock in the evening the deceased was fractious and uneasy on that evening but had assigned no reason for such uneasiness which witness took to be connected with his mysterious illness that illness had now been explained by the postmortem examination samuel chalks deposed to being the valet of mr henry horran and stated that at the request of the deceased he had retired to bed although instructed to sit up by dr jerce but that deceased had been so angry the witness declared that he would have obeyed the doctors orders as it was he judged it best to humour his master lest worse should happen the window was certainly open when he left the room as witness had not touched it according to his custom when it was set ajar by dr wentworth at eight oclock witness had not taken any notice of the arms on the walls on that evening and so could not say if the assegai was in its place he never saw it about the room until he found it on the floor and mr horran dead in bed with a wound in his breast coroner did deceased notice the open window witness no sometimes the window was open and sometimes shut mr horran never troubled about it in any way coroner had you any suspicion that deceased wished you to leave him that night in order to see someone witness no he was swearing in bed when i left him coroner did you lock the door of the bedroom witness no the door of the bedroom was never locked a juryman did you hear any noise outside which led you to believe that someone might be lurking about witness no sir coroner and you knew nothing of this purple fern business witness no miss baird never told me nor did dr jerce if i had known i should have stopped in the room notwithstanding masters bad temper coroner mr horran was not alarmed or apprehensive witness not in the least he was in a bad temper and wished me to leave him so i did coroner do you know why the deceased was in a bad temper witness the rev mr clarke had called in the afternoon and after he left mr horran was very cross as he was goodtempered up till mr clarkes visit i suppose mr clarke put him out in some way the coroner gave instructions that mr clarke should be called as a witness since this had not been done meanwhile clarice baird deposed that the deceased was her guardian and had been ill with some mysterious disease for ten years more or less usually he was good tempered she did not see him on the evening of the crime as he refused to receive her being out of temper dr jerce had told her that mr clarke had seen deceased and dr jerce was vexed as he did not wish deceased in his bad state of health to be worried with business witness also stated how she had found the gold box and had handed it to dr jerce who had taken it along with the picture of the purple fern and the letter given to him by the sick man of tea street whitechapel to scotland yard deceased had seemed much agitated when he found the picture of the purple fern in the unaddressed envelope outside his window but had never gone into details about the matter and she had not found an opportunity of speaking to him on the subject as a matter of fact deceased had fallen asleep while talking of the picture of the fern and witness had picked it up beyond that he was agitated witness had no reason to believe that mr horran expected to be murdered still since the other seven deaths connected with the purple fern had always been preceded by the same warning it was possible that mr horran was in dread of a violent death witness also stated that she had heard no noise or cry during the night and indeed had known nothing of the crime until chalks the valet came up to lead her down to the scene of the tragedy from the disposition of the bedclothes she fancied that deceased must have been stabbed in his sleep before he had time to wake or call out witness had told the valet to leave the room exactly as it was when found by him and had then sent for the police coroner when you found the box did you see deceased about it witness no sir mr horran was asleep for hours and hours and i had no opportunity coroner would you have done so had deceased been awake witness certainly dr jerce recalled said that he had not related the finding of the gold box to deceased since he was already in a state of nervous excitement owing to the visit of mr clarke witness intended to wait until mr horran was more composed and then it was his intention to tell him about the golden box and about osipthat is such details as were in the letter given to him by the young man who died in tea street dr jerce stated that he had placed all evidence in the hands of the scotland yard authorities on the same night that he went up and that he had intended to come down next day and relate everything to deceased whom he hoped to find more composed but when i arrived at the crumel railway station ended witness i found that my poor friend had been murdered mr clarke hastily summoned from the vicarage then put in an appearance and stated that he had received money from mr horran through his solicitor mr barras he had long wished to see mr horran on the matter of the interest which was overdue and for payment of which witness was being pressed but dr jerce would not allow witness to see mr horran because mr horrans health was delicate andaccording to dr jerceit would have been detrimental to his condition to worry him with business witness however was passing the laurels and saw the french window of mr horrans bedroom open he therefore slipped in on the impulse of the moment mr horran had expressed himself as angry about the thousand pounds loan as he declared that he had not given mr barras leave to lend money at the rate of ten per cent he had told witness that he would write to barras and would see himwitnessin a few days about the matter telling him not to worry in the meantime deceased certainly appeared to be very much annoyed and witness expressed his regret that he had not obeyed dr jerces wish and had refrained from paying the visit his only excuse was that he had slipped into the bedroom on the impulse of the moment and on seeing the window open from the lane coroner you can see the window from the lane witness certainlyvery plainly coroner did you leave deceased in a bad temper witness so bad that i was sorryin the interests of peacethat i had paid my visit coroner did mr horran express any fear of being killed witness not a word coroner did he touch on the fact of the purple fern murders witness no sir he never mentioned them i only conversed with him for twenty minutes and then it was about my own business the coroner suggested that mr barras should be called but the lawyer had not come down from town as he was away on a holiday and would not return for a few days he had been telegraphed for to paris where he was spending his holiday the inspector pointed out that any evidence given by mr barras would not bear on the crime but with this the coroner disagreed mr barras said the coroner might be able to explain why he lent mr clarke money without the leave of the deceased inspector tick possibly sir but that would have no bearing on the case in hand we are here sir not to search into deceaseds private affairs but to learn why he was killed and who killed him coroner an inquiry into the past life of deceased may reveal why he was murdered again the inspector disagreed with this and again the coroner objected so there was a wrangle which lasted for some minutes finally inspector tick being the more obstinate of the two it was agreed that the inquest should not be postponed as the coroner had suggested for the presence of the lawyer barras the last witness called was thomas sims a smiling little jewishfaced man from scotland yard with an olive complexion and a pair of dark inquisitive eyes he deposed that the apartments in rough lane stepney had been searched by the police but osip having probably taken alarm had cleared out everything likely to incriminate him the young man who had died of consumption in tea street whitechapel attended by dr jerce out of kindness might or might not have been connected with the purple fern crimes the only evidence which connected him with them was that he had accurately described alfred osip and the sole evidence which associated osip with the young man and with the murders was the gold box which had been found by miss baird also it was probable that as osipaccording to mrs dumps and to dr jercehad been in crumel a short time before he had left the warning of the pictured fern outside the window of the deceased every effort had been made to find osip but without result from the time he had searched dr jerce on the terrace of the laurels he had disappeared according to the ticketcollectors and porters and officials at the crumel railway station osip had not even returned to london from that station it was possible that after searching dr jerce the man had walked to the next stationbenleighto escape any pursuit should dr jerce have given the alarm a juryman and why didnt dr jerce give the alarm dr jerce arose to explain and was permitted to do so by the coroner although his rising was out of order i ran after the man he said calmly as soon as i could pull myself together he had disappeared mr ferdinand baird who came up suggested that the police should be called in but when he described the man as having a scar on his left cheek i then remembered the letter which my dying patient in whitechapel had given me with instructions to open it should i be attacked by such a man i judged it best to return to london and open the letter before taking any action i went to scotland yard as soon as i learned that osip was connected with the purple fern crimes more i could not do you should have given the man in charge for assault insisted the juryman doubtless replied jerce ironically but i did not wish to make a scandal in my friends house moreover since the deceaseds health was extremely delicate it would have been injurious to him to be disturbed by an account of the struggle on the terrace and that he would have learned had i called the police to the laurels no one could deny but what jerce had acted sensibly and the jurymanstill holding to his opinionwas crushed if this osip had been arrested at the time of the assault muttered the juryman we should not have had the murder and how was i to know my good sir that the man osip contemplated murder the letter you received from the tea street man was not opened by me until i returned to town after the assault and then i went at once to scotland yard retorted jerce the juryman retired from the contest and the coroner then summed up the evidence as clearly and concisely as he could bearing in mind he observed the purple fern murders and the presence of osip who was clearly connected with the same and above all remembering the fatal mark on the forehead of the deceased there could be no doubt that this crime was the eighth of the fatal series one of the criminals who had perpetrated these terrible assassinations had been hanged another had died from consumption but the thirdalfred osipwas still alive and had undoubtedly stabbed henry horran it was proved by the fact that the usual warning had been given by means of the pictured fern the windowaccording to mr clarkecould be seen from the lane so without doubt osip lurking therein had seen that the window was openas a light was in the roomand waiting until the small hours of the morning when his victim would presumably be asleep he had entered and killed the unfortunate gentleman the coroner ended his speech with a request that the jurymen would bring in a verdict in accordance with the weight of evidence which plainly pointed to alfred osip as the criminal the jury did so very promptly as not one of them and not one of the listeners to the evidence had any doubt but that osip was the guilty person therefore after bringing in a verdict of wilful murder against alfred osip the inquest was brought to an end and the jurymen very well satisfied with themselves went home but although the verdict had been given the criminal was still at large and now that he had commenced operations in crumel it was doubtful when he would stop the locksmiths of crumel did a fine trade during the next few days as everyone wanted bolts and bars patent locks and ingenious alarms the quiet little essex town was terribly scared by the presence of this unseen beast of prey during the inquest clarice looking round to see who was present noticed a fashionablydressed young lady with a wonderful complexion and coppercoloured hair at once she recognised her as the notorious butterfly sarahor zaradumps was seated by her mother and greatly resembled the elder woman but her mouth was firmer and her eyes were more deepset notwithstanding the boldness of her appearance and the frivolity of her attire she nevertheless looked clever and quite capable of dominating the weaker nature of ferdy baird once or twice butterfly met the grave gaze of clarice and rather to the latters surprise immediately dropped her eyes with a quick flush this was strange considering the known boldness of the girl and clarice wondered what it might mean when the inquest was over and the jurymen were leaving the house along with the rest of the crowd clarice noticed the girl again she was chatting in a low voice to ferdy while mrs dumps sailed ahead with the coroner explaining how he should have managed the case rather annoyed that her brother should thus publicly flaunt his acquaintance with so notorious a young woman clarice pressed through the throng in order to touch ferdys arm and draw him away but before she could carry out her purpose a single sentence falling from the lips of zara made her change her mind butterflys lips were almost touching ferdys ear and she spoke in a low and rapid voice but sufficiently loudly for keeneared miss baird to overhear now that osip is accused whispered zara softly there can be no danger chapter xi the dog clarice quite intended to ask ferdy what was the meaning of zaras strange remark but other things took up her attention and for the time being she forgot the saying as regards the murder of course neither clarice nor any one else thought that there was any mystery about the death of mr horran undoubtedly osip had killed him in due accordance with the traditions of the purple fern only in this instance it was difficult to guess why the crime had been committed on an inoffensive man the other seven victims men and women had been selected for their wealth and in every case either the body had been robbed of jewellery or the house of the deadwhen the especial murder took place in a househad been looted in the case of horran nothing had been stolen therefore robberyas in the other casescould not be the motive for the crime however clarice did not trouble her head much about the matter although the facts of mr horran according to ackworth having been in the company of osip at the shahs rooms and the curious observation of zara to ferdy might have urged her to make enquiries still there was no mystery about the death save the want of a motive and therefore there was nothing to unravel horran was dead the hue and cry was out against his assassin and two days after the inquest the funeral took place owing to the publicity of the death and the respect in which horran was held by his fellowtownsmen there was a great crowd at the cemetery ferdy acted as chief mourner along with dr jerce the lifelong friend of the deceased and mr clarke read the burial service clarice according to custom stopped at home while her unfortunate guardian was being laid in his untimely grave it was then that she remembered zaras observation and wondered anew what it meant did the girl mean that now osip was accused there could be no danger to ferdy clarice asked herself this question but without receiving any answer from her consciousness the facts of the murder were sufficiently plain save as to the motive so in any case it had nothing to do with ferdy moreover if zara meant that ferdy was implicated in the matterand on the face of it that seemed absurdsuch an accusation if made could be rebutted by clarice herself since she had locked ferdy in his room on the night when the purposeless crime was committed miss baird used the word purposeless because she could not conjecture why horran should have been killed in so tragic a manner unless of course the motive for the committal of the crime was connected with horrans acquaintanceship with osip why the dead man had been at the shahs rooms and in osips company was yet to be explained but only the assassin could give the reason for that secret visit to london and he was not likely to come forward considering that there was a price on his head clarice at the suggestion of dr jerce had offered a reward of two hundred pounds for the apprehension of the man in grey and the london detective sims had gone back to town with the firm determination to win that sum of money but he admitted to miss baird herself with a rueful smile that it was like looking for a needle in a haystack to capture the remaining member of the purple fern triumvirate as yet barras had not put in an appearance although he had been expected to be present at the funeral a telegram from him stated that he would be down immediately afterwards and would come to the laurels to read the will of the deceased there had been some difficulty in finding mr barras in paris and only at the eleventh hour had he returned to england meanwhile clarice in deep mourning sat in the drawingroom waiting for the arrival of the solicitor and for the return of the funeral party ackworth had not come over to attend as stern duty compelled him to go to southampton with a draft of men for india but he promised to return as soon as he was able clarice anxiously expected him as she had much to say about the property and about their marriage especially about the latter as since the death of horran dr jerce had too openly displayed his interest in the girl it was therefore necessary to put an end to the doctors hopes by announcing her engagement to captain ackworth while clarice thought of these things mrs rebson at her elbow kept up a cheerful conversation about the truths enshrined in the pages of the domestic prophet one things come true miss she said briskly i only hope the other wont what other asked miss baird listlessly why the disgrace miss we had the death to an elderly man who should have been beware of the midnight hourdeath by a knife too only it was an assegai retorted clarice scornfully your prophet made a mistake in the weapon the domestic prophet doesnt condescend to tell everything said mrs rebson much offended but you cant say but what the murder hasnt taken place no sighed the girl poor uncle henry weve had death and sorrow went on the housekeeper relentlessly and disgrace has still to come disgrace what nonsense so you said before miss dont scoff when you know whats happened disgrace must come as the domestic prophet plainly says she turned over a few pages and cleared her throat to readif a crime of any nature has been committed by any person during the months of december january or february that person if hanged will assuredly bring disgrace on those nearest and dearest to them let degenerates beware says the seer oh what rubbish mrs rebson put the book in her pocket took her spectacles off her nose and rose in a stately manner death has come she said in her most scathing voice sorrow has come you scoffed at both being hard of heart now disgrace will befall this house and how can it asked clarice impatiently osip doesnt belong to this house or to us the disgrace falls on him since he is guilty mrs rebson had no answer for this so retreated with dignity her faith in the domestic prophet still unshaken mark my words miss clarice disgrace is coming and with that she left the room much to the relief of miss baird who was very weary of the gimcrack sayings and pinchbeck philosophy which mrs rebson set such store by scarcely had mrs rebson departed when ferdy entered by the window he looked tall and slim in his deep mourning and very well content with himself his grief for the guardian who had been so kind to him was apparently swallowed up by the reflection that he could soon be enjoying two thousand a year his first glance round the drawingroom was in search of barras wheres that lawyer chap asked ferdy producing a cigarette he has not arrived yet replied clarice rather disgusted at this want of feeling how can you talk so ferdy when poor uncle henry is just buried tell me about the funeral theres nothing to tell said ferdy flinging himself into the most comfortable armchair it was much the same as other funerals you have no heart ferdy and no money retorted the youth coolly but that will soon be remedied thank heaven clarice could not help smiling to herself in spite of her grief when she thought of how ferdy would be disappointed it then occurred to her that he had some especial desire in wanting the money so badly and pending the arrival of the lawyer she asked questions i suppose you want your two thousand a year in order to marry prudence perhaps said ferdy cautiously perhaps echoed his sister raising herself angrily why you have proposed to prudence i know that and i love prudence all the same a proposal doesnt invariably mean marriage oh said clarice in disgust then you still hanker after zara ferdy lighted his cigarette calmly i dont know what youre talking about he observed obstinately mrs rebson says that you are always at the savoy hotel she had better mind her own business the interfering old cat was ferdys retort besides zara doesnt always live there she lives in town and so do you i know ferdy i dare say you see a lot of her there oh has jerce told you so no but i am certain that you are familiar with her are you indeed said ferdy in an aggravating tone and on what grounds since you are so clever clarice leaned forward i heard zara say to you immediately after the inquest that as osip was accused there could be no danger this time ferdy was startled he dropped his cigarette and bent down to pick it up and to hide the sudden rush of colour which came to his cheeks did you hear anything else he asked hesitating no but i want to know the meaning of the sentence i did hear ferdy rose and paced the drawingroom shrugging his shoulders what an inquisitive girl you are he said carelessly zara only meant that as osip was accused there would be no danger of any other murder being committed this sounded a plausible enough explanation yet clarice doubted its truth that is not the meaning she said impetuously what is the meaning then asked ferdy sharply i dont know unless she meant that you were free from danger what do you mean by that asked ferdy angrily and dropped his cigarette again do you think that i have anything to do with the death of uncle henry certainly not seeing that i locked you up in your room on that night all the same i shouldnt be at all surprised if you knew this man osip and that he had influenced you in some way i dont know osip from moses said ferdy doggedly all i saw of him was a glimpse on the night he searched jerce and then it was only a casual glance when passing him in the high street how could i possibly know such a blighter uncle henry might have introduced you ferdy wheeled round in genuine amazement uncle henry are you out of your senses clarry you know uncle henry never went out of his room for years and years and certainly this man in grey never came to the laurels until the time he searched jerce do you know the shahs rooms ferdy yes i sometimes go there snapped ferdy unhesitatingly you go there very often i expect said his sister bitterly well then anthony went there and what scoffed ferdy the immaculate anthony hes no more immaculate than any other man besides when he was there a couple or three months ago he was not then engaged to me but anthony saw uncle henry with this man osip ferdy went quite white youanthony must be mistaken no anthony didnt know osip at the time and he doesnt know him now he knows the looks of the man the person with uncle henry at the shahs rooms was a tall slim man with a crisscross scar on his left cheek thats osip true enough muttered ferdy judging from the glimpse i caught of him in the high street and in a bad light but it is quite absurd to say that uncle henry was at the shahs rooms you know that his disease prevented him from leaving his room we did not know what the disease was at the time said clarice coolly there may be some mistake as you say but anthony is too keeneyed to make one did you ever see uncle henry in town no i never did did you ever see this osip not in town said ferdy truthfully but i saw him in the high street on that night when jerce was searched look here clarry let us have an understanding if you please do you accuse me of i accuse you of nothing interrupted clarice rising a trifle wearily only the observation of zara i have explained that in a lame way i am certain that you know nothing about the murder ferdy as you were locked in and how dare you how dare you burst out the young man furiously red and angry even to hint at such things is an insult to me i am not a saint all the same i am not a devil dont excite yourself ferdy we know that osip is guilty and that no blame attaches to you but i fail to see why zara should have made that observation to you go and ask her snapped ferdy rudely i dont speak to persons of that sort said clarice icily shes a good decent pretty hardworking girl what an array of adjectives i never said that she was not all i wish to knowand my desire to know is suggested by the chance observation i overheardis are you acquainted with osip or are you in any way influenced by osip i am not how dare you suggest such a silly thing as to uncle henry having been at the shahs rooms thats sheer rubbish clarice walked thoughtfully to the window i dare say i am worrying myself unnecessarily she observed there is no mystery about uncle henrys death and anthony may have made a mistake but you do make me anxious ferdy dear with your wild ways you are so unsophisticated that i fear lest you should be led astray im quite able to look after myself fumed the young man again producing his cigarette case that unfailing resource in embarrassment his sister sighed somehow in everything that ferdy said or did there lurked a doubtful note but on reflection she could not but confess that it seemed ridiculous to think that ferdy knew an assassin only for the overheard whisper clarice would never have started so futile a conversation and now wished to end it by confessing her fault i beg your pardon ferdy she said quietly but my anxiety for you must be my excuse before ferdy could accept her apology and kiss her as he seemed inclined to do there was a furious barking outside and the angry voice of a man clarice stepped out on to the terrace theres jane at dr jerce again she said hastily and went to the rescue jerce with a very white and angry face was repelling with his umbrella the assault of a tawny dog of the mongrel collie species with savage white teeth and blazing topaz eyes janeas the animal was calledcherished a deep hatred for jerce notwithstanding that he had been her former master and had presented her to miss baird on all occasions she attacked him and was usually shut up when the doctor was expected that jane was lame in the left hindleg did not prevent her from making furious darts at jerce until clarice caught her deftly by the collar that damned dog will be the death of me said jerce when jane handed over to ferdy was dragged away growling and snapping i beg your pardon for swearing miss baird but i am very sorry doctor said clarice leading the way back to the drawingroom jane was shut up as usual but must have got loose while the groom was at the funeral i wonder why she hates you so i dont know said jerce seating himself and recovering his calmness i get on firstrate with dogs but jane never did like me i gave her to you miss baird because she never would be friends with me the shedevili beg your pardon againbut i am quite sure that jane will kill me some day nonsense her bark is worse than her bite then i hope she wont bark again thats all ungrateful beast i picked her up in whitechapel on a wet day streaming with water and starving with hunger she had a good home with me until her temper made me get rid of her perhaps her lameness makes her fractious said clarice jane is really a goodtempered dog as a rule her lameness echoed jerce after a pause and then smiled in an odd way why yes miss baird that might have something to do with her temper however now that shes tied up shut up you mean said ferdy who had now returned let us say disposed of observed the doctor genially and end the subject well my dear miss baird he added gently now that our dear friend has been buried we must learn how things are to be arranged mr barras will tell us that said clarice glancing at the french clock on the mantelpiece he has not yet come hell be here in a few moments said jerce cheerily i saw him walking up the high street ahas there came a sharp ring at the front doorthere he is do you want me to remain yes do urged clarice both ferdy and i would like you to be present at the reading of the will you are our best friend i should like to be something nearer and dearer breathed jerce as the door opened and clarice rose to welcome the lawyer she pretended that she had not heard him but he guessed that she had from the flush which coloured her fair face but by this time barras was shaking hands with the two young people and bowed politely to the famous doctor i am glad youre here sir he observed sitting down and laying aside a black bag i want to ask you a question what is it demanded jerce looking surprised you knew my late client mr horran intimately yes for years and years we were at school and college together then you would know know what asked jerce still more astonished if my late client mr horran was an honest man or a scoundrel chapter xii business affairs an astonished silence ensued the lawyers observation was so very unexpected that no one knew exactly how to reply mr barras did not look like a man inclined to jest being leanfaced dour and cleanshaven with a thinlipped mouth and scanty irongrey hair his severe black eyes peered sternly at the world from under shaggy grey eyebrows and he constantly appeared to hold the attitude of a hanging judge sentencing a criminal to the gallows barras was not popular with his fellows but he had the name of an extremely honest man and was supposed to be aggressively just also he was deliberately cautious in expressing an opinion therefore it was scarcely to be wondered at that his late remark considerably startled the three people who had assembled to hear the will read being a woman clarice was the first of the trio to recover the use of her tongue and spoke indignantly what do you mean by that mr barras she demanded breathlessly exactly what i say miss baird and i would have you remark that i addressed myself to dr jerce here who has not yet replied you take me by surprise barras said jerce with a shrug all i can reply is that horran was the most strictly honest man of my acquaintance had he not been so the late mrs baird would hardly have chosen him as her executor or as the guardian of her children exactly said the lawyer again and opened his portentous black bag but the question is may not the late mrs baird have been mistaken as to the true character of the man your own client said clarice indignantly i am a man as well as a lawyer retorted barras coldly still uncle henry whom every one liked popularity implies weakness to my mind miss baird strength has its enemies i have always found what do you think ferdy asked clarice staggered by the lawyers air of conviction about uncle henry oh its all rot he was one of the best even though we didnt get on over well there mr barras said clarice with an air of triumph he took no notice of her but produced from his bag a sheaf of importantlooking documents i had better read the will said barras coldly one moment broke in jerce as barras unfolded a sheet of parchment with a judicial air we must tell you about the death and i have heard everything interrupted the lawyer mounting his golden pincenez i have read all that was to be read in the papers and you think i think that my late client was the eighth victim of the purple fern series murdered by the surviving villain and the motive questioned miss baird suddenly the same motive that brought about the death of the other victims was the solicitors cold replywealth or if you like robbery i dont agree with you nothing was taken from the room how do you know because i know everything that is in the room and nothing is missing that is plain enough on the face of it admitted barras but i think that i can show you your error do you mean to say that the motive for uncle henrys murder was robbery asked ferdy sitting up from his lounging attitude i do and i have good reason to say so then explain said clarice curtly but secretly bewildered i am about to do so if you will permit me said barras with his most acid smile i beg your pardon go on mr barras made a short explanation before reading the will as they thought he was about to do your parents he began looking at the twins mr and mrs baird lived at tremby hall a short distance out of this town mr baird died and left the property which came to about four thousand a year more or less solely to his wife your mother when she died the property was handed over to my late client mr henry horran who acted as your guardian for this he received under the late mrs bairds will five hundred a year it was much needed by mr horran as he was then desperately poor how do you know that questioned clarice listening intently i was mrs bairds lawyer and afterwards became mr horrans said the irongrey man severely so i speak of what i know mr horran as i have just explained received five hundred a year as your guardian he had also seeing that you both were infants so to speak complete control of the propertythat is you each were left two thousand a year and it was arranged that you should come into possession at the age of twentyfive meanwhile mr horran was to look after you educate you and guide you he did all that said clarice with emotion although ferdy did not openly second her speech and wriggled uneasily at five hundred a year remarked barras pointedly go ongo on said jerce impatiently you mr baird and you miss baird being twins were each three years of age when your mother died you are now each three and twenty and in another two years will come into unfettered possession of four thousand a year divided equally you mr baird receive at the age of twentyfive two thousand a year and you miss baird also at the age of twentyfive receive the same sum annually yes yes said jerce who appeared to be irritated by the minute way in which the lawyer was detailing everything and of course there is the accumulation on the income of four thousand a year forlet me seetwenty years up to the present that is the whole point remarked barras solemnly but i shall come to that point shortly you mr baird were allowed two hundred a year from the age of twentythat is for the last three years yes snapped ferdy and little enough it is i quite understand that seeing you are young and gay said the lawyer drily well then for three years you have been receiving this allowance which comesi may tell youfrom the letting of tremby hall to those americans so you see all of you that the income of mr ferdinand baird coming from this outside source so to speak leaves the four thousand a year intact clarice heaved a weary sigh why explain all this she asked we know the most part of it quite so said barras deliberately but you do not know all all what all that i am about to tell you if you will permit me to speak the girl looked at him hard there seemed to be a great deal lurking behind the solicitors manner go on please she said apprehensively when dr jerce refers to the accumulation on the income of four thousand a year for twenty years continued mr barras he must not forget that besides the five hundred per annum to mr horran there was also the sum required for education for the keep of this house and for the clothing of the childreni allude to you two added barras looking over his pincenez ferdy nodded i understand and so does clarry now then said mr barras having reached this point i shall read the will as you no doubt understand exactly how the monies standthat is how they were left by your late mother but we dont understand about the accumulations protested clarice i am coming to that said the lawyer significantly allow me to conduct this conversation in my own way so as to make everything plain the willlistenthe will of mr henry horran but he had nothing to leave burst out ferdy you said so i did not exactly say so said barras deliberately but it is a fact since the five hundred a year ceased at mr horrans death seeing that he could not longer continue his duties as guardian he certainly had nothing to leave but the will of the late mrs baird gave him the power to appoint a new guardian what a shame cried ferdy flushing weclarry and iare old enough to handle our own money possibly but the will must stand said barras drily and after all as you will see the new guardian is the best that could be appointed from what i have seen of this young ladyhe bowed to clariceand from the frequency with which i have come into contact with her since mr horrans illness i am quite sure that a better appointment could not have been made ferdy started what has clarry to do with it he demanded angrily barras took no notice but read the will of horran it was short and to the point containing a few legacies to servants a disposal of his jewellery to friends and the appointment of clarice baird to the post of guardian which horrans death would leave vacant ferdy could scarcely contain his wrath when barras ceased do you mean to say that clarry has been appointed over my head he asked white with rage over my head when i am the man i do say so said barras quietly and in my opinion seeing what i know of miss baird it is an excellent suggestion its a shame i should have been made guardian ferdyclarice pulled the fuming youth down into his chair with a strong handyou and i can talk of that later meanwhile as the appointment has been made you can do nothing ill see a lawyerill go into courtill you can do nothing said jerce calmly and soothingly horran had the full right to appoint whom he chose and if he thought that miss baird was the most suitable person you must accept the decision ferdy sat down silenced for once but in a royal rage clarice laid her hand on his arm but he jerked himself angrily away whereupon a look of pain passed over her face you will not find me a hard guardian she said softly then as he still remained sullen she turned to barras are there any arrangements made as to where we shall live she asked no answered the solicitor replacing the will in his bag you can live here or wherever you like the will gives you complete control of four thousand a year until you reach the age of twentyfive in two years when you will of course give your brother half that income and thenas you knowyour guardianship ceases i wont have clarice as my guardian cried ferdy wrathfully you must said the girl in a firm tone what is the use of going on like this ferdy the will is a good one in law a very excellent will said barras primly a great responsibility for you miss baird said jerce quietly i am perfectly well able to bear it doctor she replied sharply see here said young baird suddenly and rousing himself from a brown study this will gives clarice control of the four thousand a year yes answered barras and of course your allowance of two hundred can continue still arising from the letting of the hall well then went on ferdy rapidly the willso far as i can see and so far as you tell medoes not say anything about the accumulations on the four thousand during the last twenty years on two thousand if you please mr baird said barras leisurely do not forget that the late mr horran received five hundred for his servicesthat is annuallyand that the rest of two thousand was required for the various items i have mentioned i remember said ferdy hastily well then the accumulation on two thousand a year for twenty years must be in the bank or invested and free from clarices control no by the will miss baird would deal with the accumulations as well as with the income for the next two years she receives the four thousand a year and what she does not spendhaving full power under both willsshe can let out at interest oh said clarice quickly then two thousand of our united income was let out at interest by mr horran that i cant tell you miss baird but it must have been insisted clarice for mr clarke my late client certainly allowed him a loan of one thousand pounds some years ago at ten per cent said barras politely but that is all the loan i know of but the rest of the money what money asked jerce suddenly the two thousand a year which uncle henry did not spend even if nothing was done with it the amount in twenty years would increase to forty thousand pounds and that should be given to me put in ferdy quickly seeing that clarry has the full income half of which is in trust for you mr baird said barras in his dry way but the accumulations miss baird he added addressing clarice certainly amount to the sum you mention and if these monies were let out at the same rate of interest which my late client extorted from mr clarke the amount in the banks ought to be much greater unfortunatelymr barras stopped and hesitated well asked clarice impatiently well the money isnt in the bank i have all the books of the late mr horran and all his business papers but in no instance can i find what he has done with forty thousand pounds or with possible accumulations jerce started up in dismay is this the reason why you asked me if horran was a scoundrel he demanded that is the reason replied barras serenely i want to know what has become of that money i think i can guess however you can guess repeated clarice puzzled yes you wondered why mr horran was murdered i answer for the sum of forty thousand pounds barras said this so quietly that he took away the breath of his hearers and they looked at one another unable to speak seeing this barras explained himself still further i collected the rents of the baird property he said two thousand a year i paid into the london bank according to the directions of mr horran and that i can account for by the books and the papers since it went in mr horrans income as guardian in keeping up this house and in educational and clothing expenses but the remaining two thousand a year i paid personally to mr horran as it came in and he never accounted to me for its use there was no reason that he should do so added the lawyer coolly seeing that mr horran had full power under mrs bairds will to deal with the estate as he chose certainly judging from mr clarkes loan which came under my notice i fancied that mr horran might be investing the money or letting it out at large interest but i can find nothing in the papers left by the deceased likely to throw any light on its disposal it is most extraordinary said clarice thoughtfully do you mean to say mr barras that uncle henry had forty thousand pounds in his room when he died barras placed his fingertips together and leaned back i leave it to you miss baird mr horran always insisted that i should bring to him two thousand a year of the rents in gold i always according to his wish paid him in gold you sent me up the papers from his desk and of course i have all his business letters deeds and the rest of such things in my office but in no case can i find what has become of this forty thousand pounds when i saw in the papers that no cause could be assigned for the murder of my late client and recollected that the purple fern villains always struck down the rich it dawned upon me that instead of investing the two thousand a year which he regularly receivedand in gold emphasised the lawyer mr horran kept the money in his room and was murdered for its possession but why should he have kept the money in his room instead of at the bank you would say mr barras shrugged his shoulders again well my late client must have been a miserthat is all the explanation i can give but i am certain that he was murdered for the sake of that forty thousand pounds and that it has been stolen and now dr jerce you will understand why i asked you if your friend was an honest man or a scoundrel an honest man said jerce energetically you have supplied the reason for the money being missed yourself horran may have been a miser although i never noticed that he was he may have kept this money in his room and he may have been murdered for it i would have you observe doctor said barras dryly that all your sentences commence with may this is all theory but if the money has been stolen suggested clarice it may be traced in some way you cant trace gold miss baird and horran always insisted upon having the money in gold that is what makes me think that he was a miser i called him a scoundrelif he spent the money on his own pleasures he certainly was a scoundrel if on the other hand he merely kept the gold to enjoy looking at and it was stolen from him at the time of his death he was simply a miser and has paid by his painful end for being a miser howeverbarras stood upthere is no more to be said i think that i have made myself plain miss baird and whenever you like to come to my office i shall talk over future money arrangements meanwhile i must prove the will pay the death duties and legacies and put things straight i shall now take my leave will you not stop to tea or dinner mr barras no i thank you said the lawyer stiffly and taking up his bag he walked in a stately manner out of the house ferdy rose and after hesitating for a moment ran after him quickly jerce and clarice were left alone what will you do asked jerce slowly i must ask anthony said clarice mechanically captain ackworth anthony she repeated quietly the man i intend to marry chapter xiii the new epoch dr jerce looked at clarice with a lowering face and his expressive eyes flashed with anger he was a strongwilled man accustomed to having his own way in the face of all obstacles and the merest hint of opposition annoyed him having set his heart on marrying miss baird he was determined to bring about the match and notwithstanding the hint of refusal which she had given him while horran was alive his determination remained unchanged to be sure he had then been ignorant of her engagement with ackworth and had calculated upon an easier conquest of her objections but now that he knew her affections were engaged he saw clearly that it would be extremely difficult for him to achieve his purpose clarice as he knew was no weak girl to be talked into surrender but for all that jerce attempted to bend her to his will the doctor was too clever a man to give way to bad temper knowing that such a weakness might lose him the prize he aimed at inwardly angry he was outwardly calm and after that first swift look of annoyance he regained his suavity does captain ackworth know that you intend to marry him asked jerce politely clarice threw back her head haughtily certainly he has proposed to me and we are engaged since when may i ask you may ask but i am not bound to answer i am your oldest friend miss baird now that poor horran is dead clarice lifted her eyebrows still i fail to see that being an old friend gives you the right to crossexamine me about things which do not concern you it concerns me a great deal that you should be happy said jerce disconcerted by her calmness then you can set your mind at rest doctor i am happy jerce looked down at his neat boots i should have thought that a girl of your strong character would have chosen otherwise really said clarice indifferently in fact stammered jerce flushing i thought of offering myself as your husband oh i saw that long ago doctor and you had no pity upon me why should i have pity asked clarice with a perceptible smile i have not played the coquette with you no said jerce bitterly i am bound to say that at the first hint i gave you of my feelings you recoiled and have since held me at arms length seeing that i am engaged that is as it should be jerce bit his lips it angered him that she should be so calm and so completely mistress of herself there is no hope for me i suppose he inquired with great humility none anthony is the man i love and anthony will be my husband perhaps said jerce under his breath but she heard him why do you say that she asked abruptly theres many a slip twixt cup and lip thats a very wellknown proverb doctor but it does not explain what you mean then will you permit me to speak plainer if you are wise you will not said clarice quietly we are good friends doctor why should we become strangers i could never be a stranger to you he said fervently oh i think so if i chose and would you choose certainly if you would not accept the situation i cannot cried jerce his emotions getting the better of his judgment i am a man and i feel like a man for years i have loved you and for a long time i have wished to make you my wife i spoke to horran and he was agreeable that i should marry you indeed cried clarice with a flush of anger then permit me to remind you doctor that mr horran much as i loved him had not the right to dispose of my hand that goes with my heart which is possessed by captain ackworth said jerce bitterly exactly you leave nothing to be desired in the way of explanation but ackworth is not worthy of you urged the doctor really and in what way jerce was puzzled how to reply he knew next to nothing about captain ackworth he doesnt look as if he had brains ah looks are deceptive sometimes now you doctor look as though you had common sense yet your conversation at present doesnt reveal that quality you are hard clarice i thought that you were not going to call me clarice until you had the right i wish to acquire the right it is too late come doctor said clarice tired of this quibbling it is useless to prolong this conversation there are more important things to talk about than my marriage which after allas i have reminded youis entirely my own affair let us agree to be friends and she held out her hand smiling jerce did not take it i can be nothing less than your husband he said drawing down his long upper lip obstinately in that case doctor we may as well part for ever for ever jerce started to his feet much agitated oh clarice you dont mean that i love youi adore youi worship you no doubt it may seem ridiculous to you that a man of my age should speak like a schoolboy and should show his deepest feelings so plainly but i have had a lonely life and you are all the world to me dont send me away without hope only say that some dayin some sweet houri can come and take your hand in mine clarice rose also and her eyes sparkled with anger you are mad to talk in this way she cried passionately how can i say what you want me to say when i am engaged and when i love i am rich pleaded jerce eagerly i have a great name i have heard that my name will be included in the list of new years honours i shall be sir daniel jerce and you i shall be mrs ackworth interrupted clarice imperiously not a word more doctor my mind is made up and so is mine said jerce with a snarl his face livid and his eyes hard you shall not marry this man who will prevent me asked clarice with superb disdain who will prevent me from becoming anthonys wife i will you shall become my wife if there was not another man in the world i would decline that honour and let me remind you that i am no schoolgirl to be frightened by stage thunder how dare youhow dare you clarice stamped her foot and clenched her hands go away and never come near me again jerce remained silent for one moment then without a word he took up his hat and walked slowly to the door only when he had opened it and stood with the handle in his hand did he speak i shall go away he said with a steady look at the girl and i shall not return until you summon me when the door closed clarice sank back in her seat overwhelmed with emotion she had small sympathy for the doctor since he had merely cried like a child for the moon which he knew was entirely beyond his reach but his last words impressed her with a sense of danger and she wondered what he meant by this sudden obedience had he defied her and remained to argue she would have felt safer dr jerceas she knewwas too strong a man to give in without a struggle and that he should do so in this instance was ominous in the words of the french proverb he had but recoiled to spring the higher yet clarice could not see how he could harm her or anthony in any way she was now her own mistress free from supervision of any kind horrans death was no mystery and although the murderer was still at large he would certainly be caught sooner or later ferdyhere clarice rose again and her face grew white what if jerce could harm her by harming ferdy jerce knew all about the boy and his fast life and jerce if put to it would not hesitate to sacrifice ferdy or anyone else to achieve his ends but the question waswhat did jerce know about ferdy while clarice asked herself this ferdy himself entered looking very sulky i do call it a shame clarry he said flinging himself into a chair and thrusting his hands into his pockets why should uncle henry have treated me in this beastly way i think uncle henry has acted very wisely said clarice harshly the tone of her voice made ferdy look up from his gloomy contemplation of the carpet and he was struck by the whiteness of her face whats the matter with you he inquired crossly i should think that you ought to be satisfied seeing that everything has come your way clarry do you think that it is a pleasure for me to take your burdens upon my shoulders asked clarice fiercely i would much rather that uncle henry had named dr jerce as your guardian seeing that dr jerce knows so much about you ferdy started to his feet changing colour like a chameleon what has jerce been saying about me he demanded with a sick look nothing he did not even mention your name then what are you jawing about snapped ferdy sitting down again clarice placed herself before him and tried to make him meet her eyes but he would not and kept them on the carpet shuffling his feet uneasily meanwhile dr jerce asked me to marry him she said in a clear voice i refused him he has accepted my refusal so calmly that i am certain he intends mischief what rot said ferdy uneasily as though a great man like jerce would bother his head over you oh said clarice with a chill smile perhaps it is king cophetua and the beggarmaid bosh you are not polite ferdy said his sister restraining a strong impulse to box his ears now you listen to me but that you are my brother and my twin i should let you go your own way to ruin and destruction thats rather strong but not too strong for your weakness she persisted i know you thoroughly ferdy you are a charming weak impulsive boy with many attractions of person and manner likely to lead you into undesirable company people like you and as liking with the majority means selfishness they will make use of youperhaps in bad ways what do you mean by bad ways asked ferdy crossly ways of pleasureways of follyways which do not lead to hard work and an honoured name you are the kind of person neither good nor bad who goes dancing along the primrose path out of sheer weakness because others dance beside you if you were a wicked man ferdy you would be clever as wickedness needs cleverness to aid its full accomplishment but you are merely weak and that is dangerous to you and to me i dont know what you are talking about said ferdy restlessly but i do cried clarice passionately i know you better than you do yourself i know that with your weakness you will bring disgrace on yourself and on me were i selfish as you are i would decline this guardianship and let you have your money to go your own silly weak way which will lead to ruin but i love you and and so you bully me i am not bullying you i am talking sense if you only have the brain power to enter into my feelings because you are my brother and my twin i accept the responsibility laid upon me if you were not i should marry anthony next week and forget much of the past what past are you referring to that which has just closed with the death of uncle henry for years you and i have gone with him down a long and pleasant lane now with his death has come the turning and another lane opens before us whether it will be as pleasant remains with you with me yes i could marry anthony as i say and let you go alone but i love you too well to see you ruin yourself i shall take a house in london and we will live there together then i shall be able to look after you ferdy rose pale with anger and i am to be tied to your apronstrings all my life god forbid as i have my own life to look after even for love one should not sacrifice ones whole lifethat is the kind of love the sisterly affection which i have for you my love for anthony is different i have no right to sacrifice him to you but when you are married to prudence my task will be ended she will look after youshe will take care of you and i can then marry and be happy knowing that you are safe and suppose i object to this scheme you have of taking a london house asked ferdy savagely in that case ill stop your allowance you cantyou darent i can and i dare i have complete power there is only one other way if you will marry prudence in a month or so ill allow you one thousand a year i can do that as guardian although you will not come in for your full income for two years im sure id like to marry prudence said ferdy uneasily you are engaged to her yes but mr clarke has been objecting i dont see why he should ill see mr clarke and sweep away his objections i can do that seeing he is in my debt to the tune of one thousand odd pounds well then will you come and live with me in london or marry prudence and get the money ferdy shuffled if i do neither i have already said what i would do you cant live without money dr jerce will look after me blurted out ferdy significantly clarice shrugged her shoulders perhaps he has the name of being a philanthropist but i should like to know if there is any chance of jerce threatening me through you what rubbish of course not i am not so certain said clarice dryly and striving to read the weak handsome face before her jerce is deeply in love with me and would give much to stop my marriage he hinted as much now i know that he cannot hurt anthony or me as both our lives are above reproach the sole trouble in my life is the death of uncle henry and the inquest has explained that the motive for the crime undoubtedly is robbery you believe that after what mr barras explained i do although added clarice in a thoughtful manner i never would have taken uncle henry to be a miser chalks might know something about that money if uncle henry really had it concealed in his room ill speak to him however you can see that there is no reason why i should be afraid of dr jerce now is there any reason why you should fear him no said ferdy earnestly and turning a frank face to his sister i have been reckless and fast jerce has helped me with money and i have run up bills for motorcars and suppers and tailors and flowers and suchlike things but if you will pay these bills jerce can say nothing against me how much do the bills amount to two thousand pounds clarice sat down gasping two thousand pounds and in one year she said utterly bewildered ferdy youyou fool there said the young man bitterly i make a clean breast of it because you want me to and then you bullyrag me but here he pulled a sheaf of papers out of his breast pocket i had intended to give these to barras when the will was read thinking that i would get my own money and that barras would be able to arrange for the payment but when i spoke to him just now he referred me to you as my guardian here is a list of my debts with the bills attached if you will pay these off clarry i swear to turn over a new leaf you neednt look so angrily at me i am no worse than other chaps my poor boy said clarice mournfully i am not angry but only sorry for your weakness but i am forced to be strong since i have to deal with a reed i shall take theseshe reached for the billsand they will be paid as soon as i can arrangeon conditions conditions ferdy began to gloom again what conditions firstly that you have nothing more to do with zara dumps i am quite sure that she has led you into spending money theres nothing wrong about her grumbled ferdy wincing zara is perfectly respectable i dare say seeing that i have heard how she wishes to make a good marriage all the same she is not averse to making use of you to amuse her and her amusements are expensive you must give her up oh im quite agreeable said ferdy readily then added in a most candid manner the fact is clarry i must give her up as she has chucked me i see said clarice rather disgusted you make a virtue of necessity still so long as you give her up i dont ask for your reason well then you have it without asking retorted ferdy airily and the other condition you must marry prudence clarke in two monthsthat will be a sufficiently long time after uncle henrys death and i want you to be settled as soon as possible ferdy looked at her very straightly and then dropped his eyes on the carpet ill marry prudence if shell marry me shes engaged to you she loves you as i said before her father ill interview mr clarke interrupted miss baird quickly he was delighted when your engagement was announced and i do not see why he should change his mind if he refuses to permit the marriage yes said ferdy hastily if he refuses you must agree to live with me in london for two yearsthat is until you get your money i dont know what jerce will say say what should he say you are not bound to him in any way no but he is famous and can help me a lot when i become a doctor rely on your own brains ferdy said clarice quickly and not on the patronage of any influential person besides you can attend your classes and to your studies all the same while we live together very well assented the boy sullenly if you dont pull the strings too tightly of the money bags do you mean asked clarice smiling you need have no fear ferdy i am not stingy youre a good sort clarry said her brother with sudden emotion iiill do whatever you like andand ill always come to you in trouble dear hastily kissing her he fairly ran out of the room leaving clarice much puzzled she had rarely seen ferdy so moved and wondered why he had left so suddenly clarice may have been unduly suspicious but she did not think that the new epoch was opening auspiciously and yet so far she had got everything her own way chapter xiv prudence the dead having been buried and the will read and the business arranged by mr barras with the assistance of clarice things settled down into the usual quiet jogtrot of existence the reward offered for the apprehension of alfred osip remained unclaimed as neither sims nor his fellowdetectives could discover the whereabouts of the assassin he had vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed him up and gradually all interest in the case died away even in crumel people almost forgot and indeed horran had been merely a name to the townspeople for so long that he was not missed as a more prominent man would have been ferdy returned to london and to his studies under dr jerce on the day after the funeral leaving clarice to manage affairs the doctor himself never reappeared again at crumel for some time and never even sent a message through ferdy when the boy wrote nevertheless clarice could not help thinking that in some way jerce was not inactive and that he would yet make trouble she had attempted to see mr clarke and his daughter after ferdy had taken his departure but found to her surprisefor the parson was a notable stayathomethat they had gone to brighton for a few weeks a locum tenens occupied the pulpit of the ancient church and his sermons pleased the congregation much more than the discourses of mr clarke prudence had left a note for clarice saying that her father was ill and had to take a rest and also asking her to do nothing about the thousand pound loan until the vicar returned but clarice noted that the girl gave no address where letters might be sent to and on making enquiries at the vicarage found that the same reticence had been observed there mr clarkes letters therefore accumulated until his returnin three weeks clarice heard the news when she was conversing with anthony captain ackworth came over nearly every day and had long conversations with clarice he urged hernow that she was her own mistressto marry him forthwith and be happy but this she resolutely declined to do on this very occasion three weeks after the burial of henry horran the young man was still urging and clarice was still refusing dear she said to her lover i have my duty to perform towards ferdy anthony who was walking up and down the long drawingroom uttered an angry growl why should you make yourself miserable over that silly boy he demanded crossly just because he is a silly boy and my brother wait until he is married to prudence and then ill become your wife whenever you like my dear im sure added clarice with a sigh i would give anything to marry you now and be happy that rests with yourself said anthony coming to the sofa and putting his arm round her waist clarice you suffer too much from a very aggressive conscience all the better for our married life said the girl gaily think how anxious i shall be to please my fireside tyrant i am afraid you will be the tyrant dearest see how unable i am to make you do what i want because it would not be right anthony i wish to settle all things connected with the past before i begin a new life with you i fanciedaccording to your own way of putting itthat the new epoch had begun joked ackworth it has and it has not my new epoch begins with my marriage to you darling and the old epoch ended with uncle henrys death this is a kind of interregnum which will end when ferdy is married and when will that be as soon as i can arrange anthony what is the use of talking more about the matter i have told you how necessary it is that ferdy should have someone to guide him while he is unmarried i must be his guide but when prudence becomes his wife i have every hope that she will be able to keep him in order well then i wish you would marry the young scamp as soon as you can said ackworth rather wounded it seems to me clarice that you love him more than you do me my dearest the weakest always require the most love you are strong anthony you can walk alone but poor weak ferdy selfish greedy ferdy contradicted ackworth i should like to give him a good thrashing well said clarice musingly i dont think that would hurt him it would said ackworth grimly if i administered it what nonsense dont frownshe smoothed away a wrinkle or two on his forehead and then kissed him as he was about to speak i do not wish to argue any more my dear obstinate darling sweetheart i may as well tell you that the clarkes return tomorrow as i heard this morning ill see them in the afternoon and arrange as soon as possible about ferdys marriage thenand not till thenwe all right interrupted anthony and stole a kiss in his turn but will ferdy give up that dancing girl why i told you that he had done so zara went away immediately after the funeral and her mother accompanied her to stop in town for a week or so ferdy has forgotten all about zara by this time it is just as well sighed clarice as i had to pay those awful bills two thousand pounds anthony think of it oh i always knew that ferdy could get through no end of cash said ackworth coolly especially when butterfly had him in tow but now that he has escaped her i dare say hell marry miss clarke he is willing enough to do so said clarice and i think that he really loves her as much as his weak nature will allow him to love anyone but himself the oppositionso i gathered from ferdyis on the part of mr clarke but why seeing that mr clarke is in your debt and should be glad that his daughter should make a rich marriage i cant explain anthony mr clarke certainly seemed to be pleased when the marriage was announcedthat is the engagement why he should have changed his mind i cant say but ill know tomorrow well then when this is settled we can look after our own happiness said the captain yes you know i want to have you all to myself i know i know i am of the same way of thinking also my father and mother are most anxious to meet you again they are old and want a sweet daughter in the house i am an only child you know clarice so when i marry you ill chuck the army and we can live near the old people i should not like you to leave the army said clarice thoughtfully you must have something to do in life ill make love to you dear however ill obey your slightest command indeed clarice i often wish that you would allow me to help you now in what way i have arranged all business affairs with mr barras the search for osip is in the hands of the detectives i am arranging about ferdys future as i tell you andandwell everything is going smoothly theres nothing to be done have you found out where that forty thousand pounds went not a trace of it uncle henry received it in gold but we have searched the room and the house and even the garden without coming upon any buried treasure chalks declares that he never heard uncle henry say anything about money and never saw him with any save a few sovereigns could mr horran have hidden the gold without chalks knowing anything about the hiding oh yes chalks was not always with uncle henry he was frequently away for hours and rarely sat up with him a night unless by the doctors orders uncle henry received the gold in small sums so could easily hide it if he wished or spend it in london said ackworth significantly ah you mean that uncle henry went secretly to london said clarice recalling the story anthony had told about the shahs rooms well i saw him there with osip you know are you sure that his companion was osip yes i did not know at the time but when jerce described that crisscross scar and the thin lean figure of the man i am sure it was osip and mr horran also i knew him well enough ended ackworth with emphasis and even in the glimpse i caught of him i was certain but i cant see how uncle henry ill as he was could have travelled to town objected clarice my dear we argued all this before and i stated then as i state now that a quick motorcar could easily take mr horran from here to london and now clarice this large sum of money which is missing points to the fact that mr horran must have secretly led a gay life and that his illness was merely an excuse to hide his real existence no no said clarice with horror i cant think uncle henry was so wicked and remember the doctors found out what he suffered from and that it was a real disease humph perhaps said ackworth grudgingly but the money i cant say anything about that if mr horran had forty thousand paid to him in gold said anthony firmly he must either have spent it by secretly going to town and to places like the shahs rooms where i saw him or he must have concealed the money somewhere now you cant find the money and the lawyer cant account for it in a business way it only remains from a commonsense point of view that horran really was a profligate and used his illness as a mask but the doctorsboth dr jerce and dr wentworthsay that the postmortem examination showed that uncle henry really was ill persisted clarice much distressed the thing in the brain whatever they called it quite accounted for the symptoms which so puzzled them then i give it up said anthony so do i replied clarice promptly i am not going to trouble any more about that missing money or about the capture of osip or about anything else i must settle ferdys future and then we can marry this speech was quite agreeable to ackworth who had long wished to bring her to this point while they were talking about more pleasant subjects connected with their marriage jane limped in at the open window and immediately went to anthony the dog was fond of the young man and showed her pleasure by rubbing her head against his knee and looking up at him with faithful eyes jane loves you as much as she hates dr jerce said clarice patting the dogs shaggy coat why should she hate jerce i dont know especially as he was kind to her he found her in whitechapel starving and wet and took her home but she hated him so much that he had to get rid of her he intended to have her poisoned but i asked him to give her to me dear jane she is so faithful all the same she should like dr jerce for his kindness i am glad she doesnt said anthony i dont like dr jerce why not everyone does clarice how can you ask me that when you know that he had the cheek to propose to you i dont like jerce oh hes clever enough and very philanthropic and all that all the same it was impertinent of an old man to propose to you a famous man teased clarice remember he is now sir daniel jerce and more famous than ever you need not be jealous of him anthony he has never come here since the day he proposed and i refused well i hope well never set eyes on him again i hope jane wont laughed the girl she will certainly bite him if she does hm said ackworth examining the dogs strong white teeth i cant say id like to get a bite from these jaws but anyone could run away seeing that jane is lame i think jane is obstinate enough to follow until she can get her bite said clarice dryly i never knew so dogged a dog theres a pun for you anthony why dont you laugh to please her anthony did laugh and was rebuked for the obvious effort he made then clarice romped with jane who barked and danced as well as her lameness permitted the trio in short behaved like children and their careless glee went far to dispel the gloomy atmosphere which for weeks had pervaded the house and clarice by this time was recovering from the effects of the tragedy and was more like her old bright self on this especial evening anthony stopped to dinner and heedless of the necessity of a chaperon they enjoyed themselves greatly it was quite a foretaste of the time when they would be darby and joan by their own particular fireside however after pleasure comes business and next afternoon miss baird set out for the vicarage she had ascertained that the clarkes had returned in the morning and called a few hours later anxious to get ferdys business settled so that she could arrange her own life often had the girl wondered why mr clarke who had seemed markedly pleased when the engagement was announced should have placed any bar in the way of the marriage she was resolved to come to a complete understanding to learn the reason for this whim and to use any power she possessed to bring about the desirable match whatever objection mr clarke could urge against ferdy clarice was certain that prudence would remain true to her absent lover prudence had always loved ferdy deeply from the time they were boy and girl together mr clarke proved to be in his study and clarice found him unpacking some parcels she was astonished to see how ill the man looked he had never enjoyed the best of health and was invariably badly dressed and absentminded but now he looked leaner than ever and his eyes avoided her own uneasily clarice sat down in a perfect state of consternation my dear mr clarke she said as soon as she could get her breath what on earth is the matter nothing said the vicar with a weary sigh and went on with his unpacking in a restless disturbed manner but you went away for your health persisted miss baird and you have been breathing the seaair for three weeks it doesnt seem to have done you a particle of good when the mind is ill at ease clarice there is no chance of the body regaining health whats the matter now asked clarice abruptly my son frank is dead said the vicar with a sob oh clarice was dreadfully shocked and now quite understood the sick looks of the bereaved father she knew that frank had been the apple of mr clarkes eyes notwithstanding that he had always behaved like the rascal he inherently was i am sorry she said rising perhaps you would like me to go away no no stop please ill send prudence to you as i have to attend to some pastoral matters myself but your poor son dont say anything more clarice interrupted the vicar looking an untidy but pathetic figure my son is dead and i never wish to hear his name mentioned again as he has sown so has he reaped and i hope that god will have mercy upon his soul how did he die no no say no more cried mr clarke and before clarice could apologise he hurried from the room clarice was puzzled frank was dead andstrange to saythe vicar seemed glad that he was dead frank undoubtedly was a prodigal son but his father had always condoned his follies and rascalities yet apparently at the eleventh hour frank had done something which even the lenient parent could not forgive clarice did not wish to know what the deed was she had quite enough troubles of her own without thinking of those of other people still the attitude and wild words of mr clarke astonished her not a little prudence came in looking almost as ill as her father had done the girl was tall handsome and dark with a cool confident manner and with a considerable fund of common sense but she appeared very sick and very ill at ease and accepted the kiss of her old friend in a mechanical way which provoked clarice into speech you dont seem very pleased to see me prudence i am said prudence in a dull heavy voice if you had not come to me i should have called at the laurels i want help you shall have it said clarice impetuously whatever is the matter is it your brothers death yesthat is one thing father is worried about that but there is something else if i explain myself to you you must promise me never to speak of what i say to anyone no i wont said clarice struck by her earnestness and wondering what fatal secret was about to be unfolded is it something that ferdy has done dont speak of ferdydont speak of him my poor darling boy ill never see him againnevernevernever a wild fear was in clarices heart prudence she exclaimed catching the girls arm has ferdy been doing anything wrong no ferdy is all that can be desired but i can never marry him why not because said prudence in a solemn manner if i marry ferdy my father will be accused of murdering mr horran chapter xv the vicars troubles in the dingy study an eloquent silence prevailed after making her startling announcement prudence sat tearless and with a drawn white face plucking at the damp handkerchief she carried in her hands poor girl she had wept until she could weep no more and all she could do with wornout emotions was to hold her peace until clarice could help her to continue the conversation that young lady as whitefaced as her hostess sat tonguetied and horrified she looked at the sad figure before her at the grim line of theological books bound in calf at the unclean window with its ragged curtains and at the grimy carpet worn and faded it took her some time to collect her thoughts when she did recover her speech it was to energetically deny the truth of the girls speech i dont believe it cried clarice decisively dont talk to me prudence she went on as the girl was about to speak you know perfectly well that uncle henry was murdered by that wretched osip and that a verdict to that effect was brought in by the jury besides what possible object could your father have to commit murder prudence looked up with a scared look and stealthily glanced at the door as she answered in a whisper the loanthe interest said prudence in the voice of a ghost so thin and low was her speech clarice started and reflected there certainly was a motive here to make clarke commit a crimethat is if horran grinding him to the dust had proposed to sell him up but that is exactly what the dead man never intended to do uncle henry would never have behaved like a usurer said clarice he charged father ten per cent said prudence scathingly if he had been a shylock he would have charged him fifty per cent my dear and also he would not have allowed the interest to run on for three years without claiming his own and now i think of it added clarice recalling a late conversation with mr barras uncle henry knew very little about the matter he instructed mr barras to lend your father one thousand pounds and omitted to mention the interest mr barras charged ten per cent on his own it is a large percentage but then mr barras is not the most amiable of men and i suppose he thought he was doing right in getting as much as he could for the money father owed mr horran one thousand pounds and three hundred for interest said prudence and one moment dear he owed this and still owes this to the estate of myself and ferdy mr horran had a settled income for acting as our guardian but the money he lent was ours and not his i have taken this debt upon myself and when you marry ferdy ill give your father a discharge prudence lifted up her hands with a low wail i can never marry ferdy she said in a broken voice what nonsense you shall marry him and see my father stand in the dock as a felon there is no chance of that prudence what does your father say clarice do you think that i have told him she said vehemently oh no poor father has enough troubles to bear without my heaping more on him he knows nothing of my reason for refusing to marry but he objects himself said clarice much perplexed yes because of my brother frank has brought disgrace on us and has died in disgrace when and where prudence i cant tell you anything rejoined the girl all i know is that just after the burial of your guardian father received some bad news about frank i have not seen frank for years nor have i heard anything about him he was always in trouble and father was always sending him money he borrowed that thousand to help frank and get him out of some scrape but this time the news must have been awful for father came to me and saying that frank was dead and that he never wished to hear his name mentioned again he wrote off to get another clergyman and arranged that we should go away for a time but has he never told you what your brother did no i have asked him three or four times he will not say a word about poor dead frank and then father told me that because frank had done something wicked that i was to give up all thought of marrying ferdy did you agree to that no i said that franks sins should never spoil my life and father was very angry with me that was perfectly right said clarice heartily her common sense coming to her aid if the sins of the father are visited on the children that is no reason that the additional burden of a brothers faults should be heaped on a sisters shoulders you were quite right to stick to ferdy my dear but what caused you to change your mind prudence i was told that my father had murdered mr horran said the poor girl again and in the same terrified whisper and that if i married ferdy information would be given to the police which would lead to his arrest what a preposterous story said clarice indignantly did you believe it prudence the girl glanced round again and seemed to shrink into nothing as she whispered yes clarice stared at her you ought to stick up for your father said she with some slang but with great truth god help me i wish i could wailed prudence clasping her hands clarice caught one of her hands be more explicit she said quickly you have told me so much that you must tell me all you wont let the police know about fathers guilt no because i dont believe that he is guilty why the jury brought in a verdict against osip the evidence was perfectly plain go on tell me all you know prudence drew her chair close to that of her visitors and placed her lips to clarices ear father owed that money as you know she explained hurriedly and mr barras wrote saying that unless the interest was paid immediately after new year father would be sold up he was nearly frenzied as he could not have stopped in the parish if such a sale had taken place and we are so poor that we had nowhere to go to then as father said the bishop might have interfered private matters of this sort have nothing to do with the bishop father thought otherwise and went about the house moaning that he was in disgrace and did not know what to do then you came on the day ferdy and i became engaged father was more cheerful after you had gone both on account of my engagement and from something which you said to him i said that i would speak to uncle henry and settle the loan said clarice rapidly go on dear i want to know all before your father returns afterwards father fell into low spirits again and wanted to see mr horran for himself he tried to but was refused admittance i know nodded clarice dr jerce thought that such a visit would irritate uncle henry now that i know mr barras charged ten per cent and that uncle henry who respected your father was ignorant of such extortion i quite understand why dr jerce did not want uncle henry to be upset he was quite right but then prudence your father did see my guardian yes he went in by the open french window and i remember what he said at the inquest interrupted clarice with a musing air ah she started as the memory came back to her he stated that uncle henry denied giving mr barras permission to lend the money no said prudence quickly if you will refer to the newspaper report clarice he really said that mr horran declared that he had not given mr barras permission to lend the money at ten per cent so that agrees with what you say mr barras was allowed to make the loan but charged ten per cent on his own account so to speak clarice nodded well then uncle henry told your father not to worry and said that he would write to mr barras prudence nodded yes i remember there was a pause then clarice said impatiently well then my dear girl if matters were thus adjusted by my uncle henry and your father i dont see what motive mr clarke had to kill my guardian prudence thought for a few moments clarice it may be that my father did not tell the exact truth about the interview at the inquest you see he wished to avert suspicion from himself but he was never suspected wait clarice my father was very much agitated after the interview with mr horran although he said very little about it to me i heard no more about the matter until the inquest when father gave his evidence i thought that he spoke truly until until what until that woman called to see me while everyone was at the funeral clarice started womanwhat woman mrs dumps daughter zara dumpsbutterfly yes you know her as well as i do clarice sarah dumps is her name although she chooses to call herself zara she was always a most disagreeable girl as i knew when i had anything to do with her in the sunday school that was before she went away to appear on the stage as butterfly i never did think much of her said clarice contemptuously and indeed i never thought about her at all until i learned accidentally that ferdy admired her and she admires ferdy said prudence panting and with her dark eyes flashing i hate her oh how i hate her it is wonderful all the same clarice how that dowdy little country girl has blossomed into a welldressed woman of the world all superficial prudence i dare say shes as ignorant as ever i know from what little i saw of her at church festivals and school treats that she couldnt speak english she speaks it very well now said prudence bitterly well enough at all events to tell me that i must give up ferdy and you didat that minxs bidding clarice clenched her fist so that the glove split i would have turned her out of the housethe insolent creature to dare to love ferdyto dare to address you in such a way what did you say at first i laughed at her but when she spoke well asked clarice seeing that the girl hesitated what did she say she told me that my father had murdered mr horran and that if i did not refuse to marry ferdy she would tell the police clarice laughed derisively and you believed this storya story which such a brazen girl had every inducement to tell not at first but afterwards i found proof against your father i can never believe that said miss baird very decidedly what proofno tell me first on what grounds this dumps woman based her accusation she said that she was stopping at the savoy hotel with her mother for a rest quite right i know she was mrs rebson told me go on mrs dumps on that night what night the night when mr horran was killed he was murdered between one and two in the morning well then during the hours of darkness said prudence impatiently on that night or morning if you like mrs dumps was taken ill and sarah was awakened to attend to her sal volatile was needed so sarah put on her things and went out to the chemist i dont believe it the chemist would not attend to anyone at that hour by the way what do you say the hour was two oclock said prudence softly and then the chemist is a relative of mrs dumps clarice and would probably give sarah what she wanted sal volatile humph said clarice inelegantly well sarah said that she went along quietly and passed your house she would have to if she came up the lane to go to the high street remarked clarice trying mentally to follow the wanderings of butterfly so as to be certain of the truth of her evidence it was a moonlight night and sarah kept in the shadow on the other side of the lane so that no one should see her going out so late why should she have done that did she expect to meet anyone she said something about the chances of meeting a policeman was prudences reply do let me get on with the story clarice or ill never get it finished i am all attention well then sarah says that she saw my father come quickly out of the window of your uncles bedroom and run out of the garden and up the lane she was in the shadow and he passed her rapidly but she saw for one second in the moonlight his face white and terrified she went and got the sal volatile and told no one of what she had seen not even her mother until she came to use her knowledge to part me from ferdy when prudence paused clarice looked at her with an unmoved face well my dear well said prudence that is sarah dumps story a very weak one i believe she made it up she could not get your father arrested on that evidence but clarice prudence placed her lips at the girls ear i laughed at sarahs wild story but when she went i examined my fathers bedroom i found a shirt thrown into the washing basket which had not been called forthe basket i meanowing to the holidays i found that the wrists were spotted with blood oh clarice started are you certain that it was blood quite certain i dipped one of the cuffs in water and the spots turned perfectly red clarice she gripped her friends hand tightly do you think that my father really is guilty i cant think that prudence he had no reasoneverything was arranged between him and uncle henry yes father said that at the inquest but he may have told an untruth to shield himself prudence do you believe that your father is guilty sometimes i do and sometimes i dont father has had so much worry that he is not always accountable for his actions he may have gone out in a frenzy and finding the window open he may haveoh the poor girl broke off weeping what am i to do ask your father to prove his innocence i dare not clarice what with his own troubles and the death of frank and this mysterious wickedness of which frank has been guilty poor father is nearly crazy did he know that he was accused of murder he would go out of his mind altogether but if sarah dumps tells the police he she will hold her tongue i said that i would give up ferdy i wrote and told ferdy that i could not marry him and said that my father did not approve of the match ferdy said something about this said clarice well then prudence you leave everything to me ill speak to anthony he is very clever and will be able to help me dont worry andhush your father clarke entered the room with a wild look hurriedly and frowned when he saw the two girls together i thought you had gone clarice he said fretfully i wish you would go prudence has much to do i am going said clarice pressing the girls arm so as to make her humour the excited man i only waited to tell you mr clarke that i have seen mr barras and have assumed the rights of your loan you will have no further trouble about it it is good of you said clarke gloomily and a few days ago i should have hailed your news with joy but it is now too late i am an outcast and accursed and father father said prudence placing her hand on his arm he shook it off i tell you girl we must leave this house and hide our shameful heads the angel of the lord will pursue meme my child and not youwith a fiery brand mr clarke said clarice in a firm way and fastening her eyes very steadily on the excited face of the poor parson you are talking nonsense sit down and no you shall not direct me in my own house it is for your good speaking softly clarice placed her hand on clarkes arm and drew him gently towards the arm chair with her eyes fixed on his all the time prudence watched in awestricken silence as miss baird seemed to be quite mistress of the situation sit down sit down whispered clarice softly and when the parson dropped heavily into the chair she placed a cool hand on his burning brow you will sleep now and wake feeling much better i will not sleep said clarke trying to remove his eyes from her as the mesmeric influence was dominating him go away yes when you sleep sleep sleep sleep clarices voice took on a kind of singsong and she drew her warm firm hand gently across the mans wrinkled brow gradually clarkes muscles relaxed and his eyes grew calmer then they closed and he began to breath gently wake up in an hour feeling perfectly well commanded clarice and then beckoned the astonished prudence from the room i used to do that to uncle henry for his headaches she laughed chapter xvi a strange communication having thus quieted the overwrought vicar clarice took leave of poor prudence however she left the girl in a much more cheerful frame of mind as she asserted her belief in mr clarkes innocence in spite of all appearance to the contrary and promised every assistance but when miss baird returned home and thought over what she had learned it appeared difficult to keep her word certainly she did not think that the parson was guilty even though the evidence of the bloodspotted cuffs was almost proof positive in some way this might be explained although at the moment clarice could not suggest to herself any possible explanation but she believed that clarke had given true evidence at the inquest and that horran had quite intended to put matters right for years her late guardian had known the vicar and had always respected him although he had never approved of clarkes devotion to his miserable son it was quite probable that horran had instructed barras to give the vicar a loan of one thousand pounds but it was improbable that he had insisted upon ten per cent or indeedknowing clarkes circumstancesupon any percentage whatsoever owing to horrans illness he had given barras a power of attorney to execute small matters connected with the estate and thus save himself trouble so it was probable that barras for the benefit of the estate had charged the large percentage this could easily be ascertained by a conversation with the lawyer and clarice determined to pay a visit to london and see him as soon as she could with regard to the story told by sarah dumps the girl was doubtful it might or it might not be true assuredly zara dumps anxious to marry ferdy had every reason to get mr clarke into trouble so as to prevent the marriage of prudence then again she really might have seen clarke leave the death chamber and thus have made use of her secret knowledge to gain her ends if this was the case clarice asked herself what clarke was doing in her guardians room at such an early hour of the morning according to the medical evidence horran was murdered between one and two and it was at the latter houraccording to zara dumpsthat clarke had left the laurels this question could be settled by asking the vicar bluntly to explain but seeing that the poor man was so overwrought it was impossible to question him for the moment the examination would have to come sooner or later if things were to be put right but miss baird thought that it would be as well to wait for a few days the irony of the situation lay in the fact that zara need not have accused the vicar so as to gain the refusal of prudence and procure the stoppage of the marriage mr clarke himself refused to allow the ceremony to take place and for some reason connected with the prodigal son what that reason was clarice very much wanted to know and determined to insist upon an explanation when she questioned the vicar about his presumed midnight visit clarice was naturally of an impatient character and would have been delighted to then and there have interviewed clarke so as to learn the truth but the man was not in a fit state of mind to calmly discuss his troubles and clarice trusted that a few days would reduce his excitement to normal limits then she could have a quiet conversation and induce him to be frank with her meanwhile she reflected upon what was best to be done after some cogitation she determined to go the next day to see mr barras and learn exactly how the matter stood as regards the loan afterwards she could return and see mr clarke and meanwhile she intended to explain matters to anthony so as to have the benefit of his common sense having thus arranged things clarice possessed her soul in patience for the day but all her schemes were upset when ferdy unexpectedly arrived about seven oclock and just in time for dinner he looked nervous and shirked all explanation of his appearance until dinner was over and he was seated with his puzzled sister in the drawingroom now then ferdy said clarice when coffee was served and her brother had lighted his inevitable cigarette perhaps you will tell me why you have come down arent you glad to see me questioned ferdy evasively delighted but that does not answer my question why did you come to see you clarry of course and your other reason ferdy hesitated and sought inspiration from the ceiling then in his usual crafty way he began to explain by degrees i suppose you know that everything is ended between myself and prudence he said clarice looked hard at him and wondered if it would be wise for her to admit that she had seen prudence and knew the reason why the engagement had been broken off a moments reflection convinced her that in dealing with so shifty a young man as he was it would be better to deny all knowledge ferdy was playing some game she was certain and what the game might be she wanted very much to learn if she gave him rope enough he would assuredly hang himself so this she proceeded to do by pretending ignorance you hinted when we last met that there was some misunderstanding between you there is no misunderstanding on my part cried ferdy falling at once into the trap i love prudence and i am willing to marry her but she refuses to marry me and has broken off the engagement indeed and what reason does she assign for this sudden change her father will not accept me as his soninlaw on what grounds ferdy shrugged his shoulders mr clarke according to prudence does not approve of the match have you been doing anything to make him disapprove asked clarice quickly and pointedly no replied ferdy indignantly i dont know why you are always suspecting me of doing wrong clarry im straightthat is i am as straight as most fellows that is not saying much rejoined clarice sarcastically well then i am as straight as ackworth that you are not ferdy anthony always speaks the truth so do i you have no right to say otherwise ferdy all your life you have told halftruths and those are much worse than rightdown lies oh hang it thats too bad i tell you what it is clarry if you have such a bad opinion of me i am not fit for your society give me my income and let me go out of your life ill do nothing of the sort said clarice sternly you are not fit to look after your own life if i gave you the two thousand a yearand remember i cannot do that until the two years are pastyou would simply go headlong to ruin no ferdy you must marry prudence and she will look after you how impossible you are clarry cried ferdy greatly exasperated i tell you that i should like to marry prudence but she wont allow me to both herself and her father are against my becoming her husband you can ask them if you doubt me oh i believe what you say remarked clarice readily then what am i to do leave it to time to right things i dare say mr clarke will change his mind again he may not for years even if he changes it at all grumbled ferdy and i cant wait on his pleasure for ever if you love prudence you can i dont know i do love her but she doesnt love me said the young man sulkily and if i cant get love in one quarter i must in another do you see oh yes said clarice cruelly i see that you love only one person and that is yourself whats the other womans name ferdy started and grew red thethetheother woman yes you talk about getting love in another quarter in the dumps quarter i dare say shes a lovely girl and as good as they make them said ferdy in a furious way dont you say a word against her clarry for i wont stand it you must respect her as my future sisterinlaw yes said ferdy getting up to add dignity to his declaration oh remarked miss baird coolly so you have proposed i have proposed because prudence chucked me and zara has accepted my hand how delightfully you have arranged it all ferdy does miss dumps know about your income she knows everything and she is willing to wait for two years until i come in for my money how considerate of her she must love you very much ferdy to be willing to accept you with a paltry two thousand a year she does love me said ferdy with sulky dignity and you love her yes i do what about your love for prudence i love her but in a different way clarice laughed really ferdy you must have a large heart why not turn turk or mormon its all very well to laugh said ferdy with a wounded air but if you had been chucked by one you loved you would seek love elsewhere i am certain of that ah you judge me by yourself well then ferdy suppose i refuse to allow you to marry zara you cant i am my own master and over age you are not master of your money i shall be in two years quite so and zara who must be a most selfdenying person is willing to wait until you are rich in two years i understand but in the meantime ferdy what if i stop your allowance i shall go to law said ferdy pompously i am afraid that wont do you much good retorted his sister with a calm smile in the first place you have no money and no lawyer will undertake the case unless certain fees are paid down in the second place you will fail in your action the will is perfectly clear as to my powers and duties as guardian i have full power to do what i like until you are legally of age in two years its an infernal shame muttered ferdy who had sense enough to see that she spoke the truth i dont think so and any sensible person who understood the position of things would not think so either however you can see that it is waste of time for you to go to law what else can you do i can go on the stage with zara yes said ferdy triumphantly and rubbing his hands ah you didnt think id say that did you i expected to hear anything so long as it was sufficiently silly said clarice in her coldest tone really ferdy you are a child you wont find it so when i take my own way what is your own way i have told you i am engaged to zara and i intend to marry her now that prudence has behaved so badly if you refuse to allow me money ill chuck the medical profession and go on the stage to act with zara in her butterfly sketch at the mascot music hall she isnt satisfied with the chrysalis and i can act that act what asked clarice puzzled by the scientific word the chrysalis in the sketchit is called the birth of a butterflytheres a chrysalis acted by a man which wriggles about the stage out of it comes zara as the butterfly and oh i understand what a high ambition you have i should think a worm of that acrobatic kind would just suit you so this is your plan is it yes i came down especially to tell you what does dr jerce say he says nothing jerce is sulky with me because you because i refused to marry him what a child the man is in spite of his fame and knighthood as much a child as you are i am not here to discuss jerce said ferdy loftily but to hear what you have to say to my plan if you will allow me my income as usual i wont go on the stage but youll marry zara all the same yes she loves me and i love her no you dont you love prudence and are only dominated by a stronger will in the person of this dancer i know that prudence has treated you badly and so has mr clarke all the same if you truly love the lady and not the dancer you will wait until time brings mr clarke round to accepting you as his soninlaw no said ferdy very decidedly and i want your answer please so that i can arrange what to do ah that means you must decide whether you are to be a doctor or a chrysalis said clarice quietly and contemptuously give me a few minutes to consider the matter ferdy her brother looked at her suddenly apparently thinking that she was about to give way however he was sufficiently wise not to press his advantage for the time being ill play for a time he said crossing to the piano while you think will the music disturb you in any way no said clarice absently and ferdy began to play a soft murmurous piece of music which suggested waving green forests and gentle summer winds he played very well in an amateur sort of way and played also softly so clarice was quite able to follow her own thoughts as the music echoed through the room in ferdys defiance she saw again the hand of zara dumps apparently the dancer was bent upon marrying the boy and would stop at nothing to accomplish her aim perhaps she was in love as ferdy undoubtedly was a handsome and charming fellow also in two years he would be in possession of a very respectable income anthony had hinted that zara wished to marry money but either she had not chanced upon a millionaire sufficiently susceptible or else she had a genuine love for ferdy baird and was prepared to be happy with him on a moderate income clarice saw very plainly that her brother was absolutely dominated by the will of the dancer and that if she refused the allowance she would only throw him more completely into the arms of this clever woman on the other hand by letting things remain as they were she would be able by holding the purse strings to keep a certain hold over the headstrong boy it was out of the question to allow ferdy to ruin his career by going on the music hall stage moreover clarice began to feel piqued by zara that this woman should set herself to intrigue in this manner annoyed her zara apparently thought that she could get everything her own way clarice was determined that she should not be triumphant all along the line and looked forward with pleasure to thwarting the dancer also in the accusation of clarke by miss dumps clarice saw that much larger issues than ferdys future were involved zara evidently quite expected that clarice would refuse ferdys allowance and thus would compel him to rely on her miss baird at once resolved to countercheck the dancer by acting in a contrary way as she had done with ferdy so would she do with zarathat is she intended to give the dancer rope enough to hang herself clarice wished to find out what string zara was pulling and time was required to look into matters time could be gained by checkmating her in this manner so having made up her mind clarice called ferdy away from the piano my dear boy she said gently i dont want you to be unhappy i know as i said before that prudence has treated you badly so it is not to be wondered at that you should go to a woman who loves you zara doesoh she does said ferdy promptly well then said clarice in a caressing tone i shall continue your allowance as i dont want you to go on the stage but if i do this you must make me a promise anything cried ferdy delighted at having secured his end promise me that you will not contract a secret marriage with this dancer said miss baird earnestly i promise with all my heart replied ferdy and so the agreement was made and clarice thus gained time to fathom the schemes of miss dumps which had to do with greater things than ferdy imagined it was at this moment or a little later that anthony appeared in full mess kit he looked excited when he burst into the room which he did more noisily than usual i apologise for my dress he said coming forward to kiss clarice but i was in such a hurry to see you that i came over without changing in another fellows motorcar its waiting outside and i cant stop more than a few minutes and i expect you want to speak to clarry said ferdy quickly ill go out and have a look at the car anthony seemed pleased when the boy left the room and at once brought out a letter i came to see you about this he said handing it to the girl it came by tonights post and i lost no time in bringing it to you what does it mean clarice opened the letter which was written in a delicate hand and very neatly on fine thick paper the few lines ran as follows if captain anthony ackworth marries miss clarice baird his future brotherinlaw will be placed in the dock as guilty of the murder of his guardian mr henry horran from a friend chapter xvii the recall of dr jerce anthony looked apprehensively at clarice as she read the anonymous letter for he quite expected that she would be greatly agitated and had been rather afraid of showing it to her lest the shock of such an accusation brought against ferdy should be too great but the girl was perfectly cool and read the letter twice after the second reading she looked at her lover its a conspiracy she said calmly anthony was puzzled what do you mean by that someone wants to prevent our marriage she explained and so this accusation has been brought against ferdy i can see that of courseanthony looked anxiously at her againof course the accusation is ridiculous perfectly ridiculous replied clarice quietly and yet hesitated the soldier would anyone bring forward such a direct accusation unless she had evidence to go upon clarice who had been musing looked up why do you say she ackworth pointed to the caligraphy of the letter which lay on the table before them the handwriting is like that of a woman men and women write exactly alike nowadays my dear besides if a woman had written it she certainly would have assumed even a more masculine style of writing then you think that the letter was written by a man of course cant you think of a man who desires to prevent our marriage ackworth considered for one moment and drew inspiration from her steadfast eyes dr jerce he said suddenly sir daniel jerce give him his proper title what makes you think that several things one is that sir daniel quoted the slip betwixt cup and lip proverb in fact he hinted more in manner than words that i should never become your wife confounded cheek said anthony seating himselfhe had been standing hitherto what right has he to interfere the right of a man who is in love with a woman said clarice with an engaged woman corrected anthony humph he took up the letter again do you really think i am certain of it but a man in such a positiona great doctora famous medical mansurely would not clarice again did not allow him to finish yes he would if he wanted his own way as sir daniel jerce wants his you see anthony dear that sir daniel had always gained his ends by force of will he tried to dominate me but i was too strong for him naturally he is irritated and thus is ready to condescend to thisshe pointed to the letterin order to gain his ends well im hanged but you cant be certain ill soon find out if i can be certain in what wayby what means ill ask sir daniel himself if he wrote the letter he will deny that he did rejoined ackworth quickly you trust a woman to get at the truth denial or no denial said miss baird coolly and theres another thing anthony ferdy is perfectly innocent of course hesitated the captain still can you prove it very easily ferdy came home drunk on the night the crime was committed i locked him in his own room and took the key to mine he could not have got out and did not until i released him next morninghours after the murder was perpetrated anthony nodded his satisfaction that settles the business this letter is all bluff anything more clarice nodded in her turn ferdy was engaged to marry prudence clarke she said was engaged is the engagement at an end yes had you not come over i should have sent for you i saw prudence today and she declines to marry ferdy why i thought she was in love with him she wasshe is but zara the dancer butterfly yes i know go on well she called on prudence on the day my guardian was buried and told her that if she married ferdy mr clarke would be accused of the murder what rubbish everyone knows that osip is guilty quite so said clarice slowly but i am beginning to doubt that anthony i thought that there was no mystery about this crime but from this letter and from the attitude of zara i begin to think that there is hm from ackworth you believe that there is a conspiracy yes i do and sir daniel has to do with it also zara the man wants to marry me and the woman to marry ferdy but i had better tell you everything i have learned so that you may be in a position to see things from your point of view anthony listened carefully while clarice detailed her interview with prudence and also related what clarke had said i am perfectly sure she ended firmly that there is some connection between zara and sir daniel i dont see that clariceupon my word i cant see it zara evidently went on her own so as to get ferdy to herself sir daniel fried his own fishif indeed that letter is written by him ill soon learn that rejoined miss baird putting the letter into the pocket of her dinner gown then i have to tell you something about ferdy and she related how the boy had attempted to bluff her and how she had got the better of him it seems to me said ackworth when she finished that ferdy is being made use of in some way i am quite certain of that and the crime is being used as a threat to make him do what he is told by jerce or by zara i grant that the whole thing is a mystery although you and i can see the reasons for the actions of jerce and this dancer marriage in both cases said anthony musingly but why not question ferdy clarices lip curled ferdy would only tell lies she said disdainfully no i must learn what ferdy has to do with these matters in some way which will not arouse his suspicions anthonyshe placed her hands on his shouldersyou trust me he placed his hands on hersdearest what a question well then i am going to do something very daring what is it asked ackworth anxiously i cant tell you i only ask you to trust me ackworth looked at her closely of course ill trust you that is true love said clarice and kissed him now in the first place i shall write this night to sir daniel and ask him to come and see me then i can learn if indeed he wrote the letter which i have in my pocket nextand this is your share of the plot i have in my headyou must ask ferdy down for a couple of days and nights to gattlinsands he is always glad to stop with you ill do so willingly said anthony but why do you want him out of the way you have answered your own question i want him out of the way because i want him out of the way what do you mean i am mysterious am i not but in this case everything is now becoming extremely mysterious and we must beat these people with their own weapons i want to marry you i want ferdy to marry prudence to bring these things about i have to learn the meaning of these threats when i know then i can act but what do you intend to do asked anthony dubiously you promised to trust me yes butbut dont be rash dearest am i ever rash no you are a very levelheaded girl as i know ill trust you only i hope you wont get into any difficulty if i do ill send for you at once now when you get back to your quarters write and ask ferdy down for tomorrow night and for the next night i can ask him now hes in the house no i want you to ask him by letter write to him at sir daniels anthony nodded very good anything else yes when ferdy leaves youin a couple of daysgo up to london and to tea street whitechapel what for clarice to find out all you can concerning the young man who died of consumption therethe man who was one of the purple fern murderers i want to know his name and all about him what good will that do it may lead us to discover the whereabouts of osip when we catch him then we can be certain of his guilt and both sir daniel and zara will be unable to accuse ferdy or mr clarke do you see in a way and yet no dont raise objections or ask questions i know exactly how to act when you learn what i want you to learn come here and tell it to me in the meantime ill be searching on my own account not in whitechapel i hope said anthony quickly no i am sending you to whitechapel she laughed do you know my dear boy i am quite enjoying this excitement it gives me something to do and i love a life of action she looked so brilliant and her eyes were so bright that anthony did what any lover would have done under the like circumstances he took her in his arms and kissed her then as it was growing late clarice insisted that he should go and escorted him to the door ferdy was conversing with anthonys brother officer who had brought over the car and of course the amateur chauffeur was introduced to miss baird she chatted so gaily for a few minutes that anthony could not believe she had anything on her mind yet he knew very well that she was extremely anxious and was nerving herself to face her enemies finally he insisted that she should go indoors as the night was chilly and the car surged off down the lane with the buzz of an angry bee clarice stood on the steps and watched it vanish then she went inside and spoke to ferdy i want you to take a letter to sir daniel tomorrow for me she said going to her desk when do you start in the morning by the eight fiftyfive ill be in town by ten or a trifle later why are you writing i want sir daniel to come down as i wish to speak with him about business connected with the estate what business asked ferdy persistently oh nothing particular said clarice airily it has to do with a ring which poor uncle henry wished me to give the doctor ahaaa she shiveredi believe that i have caught cold she had indeed for the next morning ferdy had to go to her bedroom to receive the letter for jerce as clarice did not get up her eyes were brilliant her cheeks vividly red and her voice was somewhat hoarse ferdy guessed that she had caught cold from standing in the porch on the previous night and declined to kiss her when he went in case he should suffer also that was ferdy all overhe never ran the chance of getting into trouble if it was not likely to benefit himself clarice sighed when he departed and then laughed sad as she was at ferdys selfishness the thought of her plot cheered her up the boyas she was resolvedshould be saved from zara dumps in spite of himself sir daniel was extremely astonished to receive clarices note asking him to come down and his elderly heart beat rapidly as he reflected that she had called him back he had told her that he would not see her again unless she asked him to come and here the very message for which he had longed was in his hand he went down to crumel by the midday train and shortly arrived at the laurels here he found clarice up and dressed and seated in the drawingroom looking very unwell she occupied a large chair near the fire and was enveloped in a multiplicity of wraps to keep her from shivering when sir daniel entered she did not rise or offer him her hand i might give you my cold said clarice hoarsely dear dear you are very sick remarked jerce quite at his ease in the presence of illhealth how did you get this cold i was standing in the porch last night talking to anthony jerce bit his lip as she mentioned the name and stretched out his hand let me feel your pulse clarice kept her hands under the shawl no i have asked you to come for another reason than to prescribe for me also i have taken some simple remedies and will be well in a few days still no i cant ask the famous sir daniel jerce to attend to a trifling case like mine since the famous sir daniel is here observed the doctor goodhumouredly he may as well exercise his profession and you know he added earnestly i would do anything for you even though you have treated me so cruelly you will persist in saying that cried clarice petulantly when you know that i never loved you that i never gave you any encouragement and that you have no reason to blame me in any way if you have come here to make yourself disagreeable i have come because you sent for me said jerce calmly and if you remember i said that i would never see you again unless you did send for me oh and i suppose you thought that my invitation meant that i had changed my mind about marrying anthony i did hope that said sir daniel plainly as i can conceive no other reason why you should ask me down unless he added with some bitterness you wish to torture me your own conscience should do that sir daniel my own conscience i dont understand you miss baird think again you hinted that i should never marry anthony i did rejoined jerce steadily and i hope you wont why not because i wish to marry you myself i see clarice drew the anonymous letter from her pocket and placed it in his hand and to gain your ends you are willing to go to these lengths the doctor read the few lines gravely and then handed back the letter still i dont understand yes you do sir daniel you wrote that letter jerce sprang to his feet with an agility astonishing in so stout a man you insult me he said with cold suppressed fury have i not reason to she flashed out when you seek to prevent my marriage by accusing ferdy of murder i did not accuse him i never wrote that letter it is not in my handwriting it is not written on my own stationery of course not you would have signed your name if it had been did you ask me down to accuse me of this asked sir daniel contemptuously yes i did and i tell you that your plot will fail as ferdy is perfectly innocent i never said that he was guilty that letter i did not write that letter clarice looked at him steadily his face was calm his nerves were unshaken either she had failed to take him unawares with her abrupt accusation or the man was innocent if i have made a mistake i ask your pardon she said quietly but you have read the letter just this moment i never set eyes on it before what do you think of the accusation i dont know what to think said jerce coolly oh then you believe that the writerif not yourselfhas certain grounds upon which to accuse my brother of murder i dont know the writer and i dont know the grounds any other man would have lost his temper at the insult you have offered but being in love with you i forgive your unfair suspicions still in justice to myself i shall take my leave as i cannot inflict upon you the company of a man of whom you think so meanly one moment said clarice who could not tell if he was really innocent or if he was acting a part what would you do about the letter if you were me i should obey the writer said jerce promptly ah then you have an interest in stopping my marriage i have i would do anything in my power to break off your engagement with ackworth so that i could marry you precisely i believe you wrote the letter after all said clarice between her clenched teeth i defy you to look me in the face and deny it i do look you in the face and i do deny it said jerce coldly but the writer of that letter has done me a good turn and i thank him how do you know it is a man sir daniel shrugged his shoulders i dont know i only surmise surmise what that a man wrote it why not a woman sneered clarice why not indeed you know as much about the matter as i do beaten by his imperturbability the girl adopted another mode of attack why should ferdy be accused i dont know unless it is that ferdy lives a wild life as i told you and would do much for money for money what do you mean i mean that the forty thousand pounds is yet unaccounted for oh and ferdy murdered uncle henry for that money the writer accuses him of the crime said jerce quietly i am not prepared to endorse the accusation as i know nothing but i know cried clarice vehemently ferdy was locked in his room by me on the night of the crime because he had been taking too much to drink you had better answer this letter and say so retorted jerce to whom should i writeto what address i cant say he answered steadily but you will be wise if you break off your engagement with captain ackworth ferdinand may be innocent in one way and yet guilty in another explain he may be an accomplice after the fact doctor cried clarice rising quickly you know something i know nothing save that ferdy lives a wild and fast life and is of an undisciplined nature he walked to the door i take my leave with a last warning obey that anonymous note and give up ackworth or else or else questioned clarice eagerly or else ferdinand may be hanged chapter xviii the unexpected happens clarice sank back in her chair as jerce left the room wondering if she had heard aright sir daniel had certainly said in plain english that failing the breaking of the engagement ferdy would be hanged that meant the guilt of ferdy and yet she could prove that the boy had been locked in his room what was meant by being an accessory after the fact she would have to ask mr barras the meaning of that legal phrase in some way howevershe guessed that muchit implicated ferdy in the crime ferdy was wild assuredly and to get money would do much but he would never dare to commit a vile murder in the first place his nature was too mild and in the second he was too timid ferdy must be innocent and yetit was strange that he should always be so mysterious and so ready to take alarm clarice recalled several occasions when ferdy had appeared startled by apparently innocent remarks then again ferdy was in the toils of zara dumps and zarafrom her accusation of mr clarkeknew something about the crime what if she was throwing the blame on the parson to shield ferdy whom she loved at this point of her agonised reflections the door opened and sir daniel jerce again appeared i think he said coldly yet very pointedly that if you take a walk and put away those medicine bottles you will find that your illness will vanish goodday and he was gone in a moment clarice flung off the shawl and ran to the door jerce then saw through her feigned disorder what a fool she was to try and deceive so clever a physician by the time she gained the hall jerce had already passed out of the front door and when she opened that he was passing out of the gate for the moment she felt inclined to call him back and insist upon her illness but knowing that she could not deceive so capable a judge she closed the door again and returned to the drawingroom there she wrapped herself up again it was necessary to deceive those in the house since no one was so acute as jerce to tell a false illness from a real one she could not carry out her plot unless she pretended to be ill and so had taken advantage of being in the porch on the previous night to secure her ends intending to go secretly to london on that same evening clarice wished to keep to her room so that no one save mrs rebsonin whom she would have to confideshould know that she was out of the house and especially had she wished to deceive jerce yet he had seen through her scheme of pretended sickness and would be on the lookout to see why she had acted in such a manner clarice was certain that in some way jerce was plotting against her and anthony notwithstanding his denial of the anonymous letter it would take her all her ingenuity clever as she thought herself to circumvent the doctor he was uncommonly sharp and uncommonly suspicious and if he found out what she intended to do he would nullify the success of her plot in some way what a fool she had been to see him especially when she had gained nothing by the interview in the face of this first failure to impose upon a clever man who wanted his own way many a woman would have thrown up the sponge but clarice only stiffened her back in the face of the increasing difficulties come what may she would masquerade as she intended and learn the truth of ferdys hidden life her plan was at once daring and simple in looks she exactly resembled ferdy and dressed in a suit of his clothes no one would be able to recognise her as his sister also she could mimic ferdys tricks of speech and ordinary gestures exactly and thus would be able to pass as her brother even with those who knew him well once arrayed as ferdy clarice intended to go to london and pass the evening at the mascot music hall in order to witness the performance of sarah dumps thenas ferdyshe would go round and see the dancer and perhaps zara might let slip something which would put her on the track of the boys delinquencies if she could arrive at the truth of ferdys fast life at which jerce had hinted she might learn how he came to be implicated in the crime and he was implicated rather than clarke since clarice believed that zara had only accused clarke to save her lover as well as to prevent the marriage with prudence also the direct accusation in the anonymous letter hinted that someoneif not jerceknew that ferdy had some connection with the death of henry horran jerce himself hinted that ferdy was mixed up in the matter and was ready to use his informationwhatever it might beto place ferdy in the dock if the match with ackworth was not broken off it can thus be seen why clarice had asked anthony to invite her brother to gattlinsands on that evening and to detain him if possible for the next night she did not want to run the risk of meeting ferdy at the mascot music hall or to haveas it weretwo richmonds in the field on this one night she hoped to learn sufficient to force ferdy into open confession and when she knew all she might be able to save him but failing success on this night she trusted to be more successful on the ensuing evening but in any case she felt that she must be successful if ferdy was to be saved from the tricksters who were around him and from his own weak self of course her experiment was a daring one and anthony certainly would not approve of it but too much was at stake to hesitate so clarice went up to her room about five oclock to get ready for her masquerade on the stroke of the hour mrs rebson appeared with a telegram which proved to be from anthony he wired that ferdy had accepted his invitation and was on his way to gattlinsands thats all right said clarice putting the wire carefully away whats all right deary asked mrs rebson who was smoothing her nurslings bed nanny come here said the girl and led mrs rebson to a chair i dare say you remember what you said about disgrace the domestic prophet replied mrs rebson smoothing her apron yes and disgrace will come say what you like it will come i fear mrs rebson clapped her gnarled old hands ive brought you to your senses she cried in her cracked voice and with great triumph you will never doubt the domestic prophet again oh no answered clarice artfully disgrace is coming i fear nanny and to ferdy mrs rebsons hands fell by her side and she began to shake disgrace and to my darling boy she whimpered oh miss clarice what is it what have you been doing its not what i have been doing but what i am about to do said miss baird resolutely now nanny if you want to save ferdy from disgrace from imprisonment and perhaps from worse you must hold your tongue about what i am going to tell you i swear it on the bible whimpered mrs rebson again oh my pretty boymy sweet darling she began to cry in a senile manner clarice knew that she could trust the old woman to be silent as her affection for the unworthy ferdy would have sealed her lips even had she been threatened with the gallows to open them if clarice wanted to leave the laurels secretly for her masquerade and to return without her absence being known it was absolutely necessary that she should trust the old woman therefore she risked telling mrs rebson all that she knew and again impressed upon her at the end of the confession the absolute necessityfor ferdys sakeof silence mrs rebson wept all the time and cried out at intervals and exclaimed indignantly at ferdys enemies and altogether conducted herself as a partisan of that shifty youth but i knew that the domestic prophet could not lie cried mrs rebson though i never thought he meant my precious lamb oh miss clarice what is to be done they will hang and quarter my darling baby no no nanny i can save him said clarice soothingly and you willyou will if you will consent to help me i would go to the scaffold for my ferdy sweetheart said mrs rebson fervently whereupon clarice explained how she meant to masquerade as her twin brother mrs rebson was startled and expostulated in alarm oh my deary its a dreadful thing you would do what would the world say the world will never know nanny that is why i want you to help me i am supposed to be ill with this cold so i can be thought to be in this room nursing it while i am away dont let anyone enter but attend to me as if i were really ill in bed everyone will think that i am indisposed when will you be back asked mrs rebson shaking and nervous tomorrow some time i can stop at some hotel in town oh miss clarice a young lady without a chaperon i wont be a young lady but a young man said clarice impatiently and crossing the room to look into a gladstone bag which she had packed with masculine belongings a young gentleman seeing that you are to be master ferdy said mrs rebson with dignity then she began to beat her hands on her old knees oh dear it is all very dreadful and i dont know what your poor pa and ma would say i dont think i should allow it clarice forbore to tell mrs rebson that she had no power to forbid since she was not now a nursery autocrat but she wanted to set the old woman entirely on her side so as to carry out her plans if you think it would be better to let ferdy get into trouble no no oh dear me no miss clarice anything but that ill say that you are ill in bed and i shant allow anyone into the room but how will you get out of the house and away from the station without being recognised i can dress as ferdy and slip out of the drawingroom window explained clarice quietly and getting a pair of scissors as to the station there will probably be a crowd there and i can get unnoticed into a carriage besides everyone will take me to be ferdy not those who know you oh yes i think so i can imitate ferdy exactly i shall have to if i want to deceive zara dumps the hussy said mrs rebson vigorously then with a cracked scream miss clarice what are you doing to your hair cutting it off said clarice snipping vigorously i cant expect to masquerade successfully with a womans hair oh miss clarry miss clarry your lovely hair wept mrs rebson and but that ferdys lifeas she thoughtdepended upon the assumption of ferdys personality she would then and there have refused to join in what seemed to her to be a mad fantastic scheme whats the use of going on in this way asked clarice angrily perhaps i am acting foolishly but its the only chance that i can see of saving ferdy from his enemies come nanny cut my hair and trim itnot too short mrs rebson with the tears streaming down her wrinkled face manipulated the scissors what will the captain say nothing retorted clarice when i tell him my reason anthony has every confidence in me i dare say hell be shocked but i cant help that there she surveyed her cropped head in the glass and was surprised to see how remarkably she resembled ferdyno one will ever guess that i am not my brother ah said mrs rebson pointedly you may deceive a man but youll never get a woman to believe in you ill try at all events said clarice thinking of zara come nanny help me to dress mrs rebson was not of much use and she wept most of the time so clarice set her to work to repack the gladstone bag in it was stowed a tweed suit since clarice was rapidly assuming a spare evening dress of ferdys also he had left behind him luckily a furlined coat and clarice had purchased in the high street a silk hat ostensibly for her brother but really for her masquerade ferdy was very extravagant in the matter of clothes and no doubt much of the squandered two thousand pounds had gone on his wardrobe so that the girl was easily able to array herself in the evening purple and fine linen of a young man about town when she was dressedwhen the fur coat was on when the silk hat was worn and when clarice placed a cigarette in her moutheven mrs rebson was startled and stared openmouthed at the change oh deary mercy me cried mrs rebson raising her hands i really should take you for master ferdy my dear rippin old nanny said clarice with so exact an imitation of her brothers voice that mrs rebson jumped its not rightit really aint right she blubbered you might be my darling boy from the looks of you and the voice of you thats as it should be now nanny kiss me and wish me god speed never said mrs rebson energetically when youre doing exactly what moses said you shouldnt do and wearing mans clothes to save ferdy nanny murmured clarice and gained the kiss and the blessing then the servants being at their tea she slipped down with the gladstone bag in her hand and went out by the french window of the drawingroom mrs rebson at the bedroom window saw her disappear up the lane it might be master ferdy himself said mrs rebson with a heavy heart and prepared to carry out her part of the deception there was as clarice had anticipated a crowd at the station as it was market day in crumel and many sellers and buyers were leaving by the train slipping unnoticed through the crowd she obtained her ticket from a clerk too busy to glance up and got into an empty firstclass smoking carriage she did not like the atmosphere as her sense of smell was delicate but it was necessary to keep up the deception of manliness and moreover in a smoker she was not likely to meet with any local women friends who might penetrate her disguise also clarice smoked herself a little having first done so out of bravado because anthony had laughed at her early attempt she therefore lighted a cigarette and tried to feel herself a man what she did feel was undoubtedly a delightful sense of freedom and regretted again as she had often regretted before that she had not been born with a beard nature had undoubtedly made a mistake in creating clarice a woman perhaps owing to the similarity of the twins looks she had confused the souls and had given to clarice the body which was truly ferdys in due time the young gentlemanclarice felt herself to be truly a young gentlemanarrived at liverpool street station and hailed a cab she told the man to drive to a quiet west end hotel where ferdy sometimes stopped when it was too late to return home to his quarters in dr jerces harley street house here clarice was quite delighted with the result of her masquerade everyone including the landlord the barmaid and the waiters took her for ferdy and she was given the dinner table at which ferdy usually sat and from the smirk of the barmaid who inquired if mr baird would take a glass of sherry before dinner clarice gathered some information as to ferdys urban habits after clarice had placed her bag in the bedroomand only then did it occur to her that she could have assumed her evening dress in townshe ordered a hansom and drove to the mascot music hall it was a magnificent palatial structure decorated and painted and gilded like the golden house of nero for the first time in her quiet life clarice found herself in such a place and was astonished at the blaze of light the number of welldressed people the quantity of flowers and the numerous aids to pleasure which she beheld on every hand also she was surprised to see what a lot of liquor was drunk and wondered if it was necessary to keep up her assumed character by ordering a whisky and soda although some acrobats were performing on the splendid stage it was yet early and the house was not yet quite full clarice was thus enabled to secure a very comfortable stall as the evening grew later the seats on all sides of her were gradually filled but she found that the one next to her remained empty the performance was of the usual class and showed little originality although it was entirely new to the girl who had lived most of her life in crumel acrobats tumbled thoughtreaders performed their wonders musical americans played various instruments and interspersed their jangling with united states slang delivered in nasal voices and various crack comedians sang the comic songs of the day which wereclarice thoughtbut dreary productions she enjoyed the performance however as it was all new to her but wondered what ferdy could find in the turns to come there night after night perhaps the birth of the butterfly would be more artistic and amusing and it came on at nine oclock this was the especial moment for which clarice had waited all the evening immediately before the curtain rose on the sketch a little overdressed woman came pushing along to the vacant seat beside miss baird she turned to see who it was and to her dismay recognised mrs dumps the little woman also recognisedas she thoughtclarices brother and exchanged greetings very affably though im not astonished to see you here mr ferdinand said mrs dumps in her voluble way zara says that you come nearly every night to see her sketch dont you come yourself mrs dumps said clarice carefully imitating her brothers voice and rejoiced to see that even keeneyed mrs dumps did not know her i dont said mrs dumps screwing up her mouth ive been weeks in london but this is the first time ive been to see zara play although she has begged me on her bended knees but i was brought up a churchwoman and i dont hold with theatres much less with ungodly musichalls zara would go on the stage being always bent on having her own way although i said id curse her if she did and did you asked clarice quietly perfectly certain that her disguise could not be penetrated what would have been the good said mrs dumps crossly seeing that zara is my own daughter and my only one and not dumps child either though she took his name my first husband was her father mr ferdinand so when you marry her you will have to take her as sarah twine that being the poor mans name hush heres the piece beginning i do hope its respectable zara said it was else i should not have come oh dear me wailed mrs dumps in an under tone how dreadful it is to have my child and twines appearing on the wicked wicked bad evil shameless stage clarice would have liked to question mrs dumps further about the marriage but that the curtain rose and she had to pay attention to the sketch the scene represented very picturesquely a garden of roses and at the back was a brobdignagian flower upon which lay stretched out a gigantic green worm this was probably the chrysalis which it had been ferdys ambition to act while the music thrilled through the air and the lights rapidly changed the worm began to writhe and to execute acrobatic feats it twisted and turned on the small spacecomparatively speakingof the flower and finally crawled across the stage wriggling grotesquely mrs dumps was annoyed to think that a child of mine and twine should make such an exhibition of herself she said indignantly that is not zara whispered clarice smiling she appears as the butterfly you know then all i can say is that she aint like the butterflies ive met with said mrs dumps angrily me having chased them as a girl wait till zara appears was the reply of the charming handsome young gentleman whom the landlady of the savoy hotel took to be mr ferdinand baird of the laurels mrs dumps sniffed aggressively and sat very rigid with the fullest intention of giving her daughter a good talking to for daring to lower the dignity of the twine name meanwhile the eyes of all were watching the pretty picture on the stage a wind swept through the garden of flowers and the blossoms withered under its blighting breath in one moment the radiant paradise of roses took on a wintry aspect snow fell thickly the trees shed their leaves the sky turned dark and the ungainly green chrysalis shivered and wriggled in a wonderful manner to the shrill blowing of flutes and trumpets in the orchestra it was so realistic that the audience could almostas one enthusiast declaredfeel the cold then came the mellow sound of flutes and the delicate trilling of stringed instruments the roses began to bloom again the sky regained its brilliant blue and the trees budded afresh under the touch of sudden spring the green worm writhed its way to the gigantic rose and lay there exhausted and still until the rising petals of the flower concealed it from sight then came a pause and afterwards with a triumphal burst of music out of the closed rose sprang a light and airy figure with glittering glorious butterfly wings scintillating and vast zara shot up to the flies like a rocket and then swooped gracefully down to the front of the stage supported in her airy flights by invisible wires she fluttered amongst the blossoms like an immense jewelled insect coquetting and caressing and hovering marvellously on iridescent pinions over all played the everchanging limelights so that the girl floated lightly as thistledown in the midst of a kingopal of prismatic hues then she dropped lightly on to the stage and began a dreamy sensuous dance which would have driven st anthony out of his senses when the dance was at its height and zara whirled fast and furious in the radiant lights and colours a dismal note sounded in the orchestra the butterfly paused and shivered as a cold wind bent the flowers and chilled them again the dance commenced but this time it was slower the music grew sadder the many flowers began to fade once more and finally the snow began to fall in feathery white flakes shortly the garden was again strewn in ruins and the poor butterfly frozen and dying sank weakly to the ground while the snow piled a white mound over its shortlived beauty when the dancer was completely buried the curtain fell it rose again in answer to thunderous applause and zara appeared leading by the hand her fellowartiste who had so wonderfully performed the chrysalis he had put aside his mask and came to the front of the stage where he could be plainly seen clarice looked at him indifferently but when she glanced aside at mrs dumps she saw that the little womans face was bloodless and pinched oh mr ferdinand gasped mrs dumps clutching her companions arm thats osipthats the murderer chapter xix zara the butterfly in the noise of the applause which greeted osip and zara the terrified whisper of mrs dumps passed unnoticed the girl naturally searched for her mother and she smiled on catching sight of her next to the pretended ferdy baird the eyes of osip followed those of zara and alighted on the pallid face of the country landlady at once he bowed abruptly to the audience and walked hurriedly from the stage leaving butterfly rather discourteously to follow at her leisure clarice who had immediately grasped the significance of mrs dumps whisper half rose and tried to shake off the detaining grasp of the little woman hes trying to escape said clarice excitedly and as the applause had now ceased several people overheard and looked round inquiringly no murmured mrs dumps dragging the girl down with unexpected strength hold your tongue mr ferdinandfor zaras sake justice must be done retorted clarice anxious to have the miscreant captured forthwith for your own sake then muttered the woman with white lips clarice truly surprised dropped back into her seat what do you mean by that she demanded indignantly you knowyou know murmured the other still holding on convulsively zara said that she had power to make you marry her if you make trouble over osip she may use that power in another way what nonsense returned clarice shrugging all the same she remained quiet for the time being from mrs dumps hurried speech it was apparent that zara really had some hold over ferdy and would not hesitate to use it to his harm if anything came of his supposed interference with her shady doings but clarice wondered that zara bold and daring as she was cared to connect herself with so dangerous a man as the assassin of so many people osips association with her and her accusation of the vicar and her admitted presence near the house about the hour of the crime looked as though she knew much more than she chose to tell also her power over ferdy might implicate him in some way in the infernal doings of the purple fern clarice therefore to save ferdy from a possible accusation resolved to take no measures to have osip captured until such time as she knew more exactly how matters stood shortly mrs dumps released her hold and turned paler than ever take me out get me brandythree star whispered the little woman who had undoubtedly received a great shock clarice saw that she was on the verge of fainting so at once piloted her along the row of seats to the nearest bar and procured her a glass of liqueur brandy the flighty barmaidno doubt a friend of ferdyssaluted clarice with an engaging smile and a slangy greeting finally remarking that the old girlmeaning mrs dumpslooked chippy the insult to her years as well as the strong liquor brought back the colour to mrs dumps cheeks and the stiffness to her back replacing the glass on the counter with a bang she frowned on the saucy girl you are a bold painted hussy snapped mrs dumps aggressively the brandys gone to your aunts head ferdy giggled the barmaid in no wise disturbed take her home dear boy else shes bound to be run in for looking so pretty you brazen bagarags sniffed mrs dumps you jezebel of the slums how dare you insult a lady you horrid here clarice fearing that there would be trouble since the barmaid was losing her temper dragged mrs dumps hurriedly away if you keep company with such bold sluts mr ferdinand she said indignantly you shant marry my daughter im not so sure that i do want to marry her said clarice artfully mrs dumps tossed her head oh i know mr ferdinand none better you changed your mind about zara once before and wanted to marry that ugly girl of parson clarkes id have let you go myself but zara who is fairly crazy about youi dont know why as you aint my idea of what a husband should befound means to bring you back again and keep them vows you wanted so lightheartedly to break did zara tell you the means she employed asked clarice quickly no she didnt though i begged her to make a clean breast of it so you neednt think that she has betrayed you whatever you have donethough im sure i dont know if you are bad smiling there as if butter wouldnt melt in your mouth this speech assured clarice that whatever power zara possessed over ferdy certainly mrs dumps did not know its source and therefore she merely laughed then to gain further information clarice carried the war into the enemys camp it is very easy blaming me mrs dumps she said spiritedly but how can you expect me to marry a girl who associates with a man like osip there wailed mrs dumps as they went down the grand staircase of the music hall i thought youd say that as if i knew zara never said that osip was with her if she had id have made her come home again you dont think that i want twines child and mine murdered and stamped with purple ferns like a letter but ill have it out with her tonight shell tell me what she means by keeping gory assassins from the gallows you should tell the police i shant and you shant either mr ferdinand though why the policea silly lot i saydont spot the man coming forward in that brazen way is more than i know i saw who he was the very moment i clapped eyes on him and though i do owe him seven and sixpence thats no reason i should disgrace zara by hanging him but ill speak to zara when i take her home in that steam engine of hers as is so expensive and useless you neednt come mr ferdinand but clarice did not intend to give up her chase for information yet especially as she was now on the way to learn much oh but i must come mrs dumps she said coolly you know that i escort zara home every night this was a chance shot but it told i know you do and why shouldnt you seeing you are to be my soninlaw whimpered mrs dumps much as i hate the musichall id have come myself during the past three weeks to take the child home rather than let her go alone but i always trusted that you would look after her mr ferdinand though you do know grinning jezebels behind bars heres the stage doorwhat a hole why my backyard is cleaner and aint got such dirt about it oh that a child of twine should come to this and him a godly man with a gift of speech surprising though he did wag his elbow more than he need have done and was brought to an early grave with a handsome tombstone in consequence while mrs dumps ran on in this disconnected fashion clarice saw at the far end of the alley which led to the stage door of the mascot music hall a smart motorcar in charge of a smart chauffeur she was about to ask mrs dumps if this was the steamengine she referred to as belonging to zara when the stage door opened and the girl herself came out looking wonderfully pretty and wonderfully angry she mistook clarice for her brother as everyone else had done and came up to him at once oh there you are ferdy she said speaking as fast as her mother was in the habit of doing i am glad you have come im in such a rage i cant do my second turn tonight at the muses hall as brown has gone off brown who is brown you knowyou know said zara pettishly he does the chrysalis and very badly too ive only had him for a few weeks as a kind of makeshift hes gone mad i think for he bolted immediately after the call and in his stage kit too ill have to pay a forfeit to the muses hall manager and i dont like doing that its bad for my pocket and for my reputation but we cant stop talking here all night come on mothershe took mrs dumps armwere you very much shocked with my sketch ive had a shock said mrs dumps as she was hurried down the alley that will last me till my dying day oh bother said zara apparently thinking that the puritanic little woman referred to the sketch i wish you hadnt come now i might have guessed that you would find fault now how are we going ferdy they were standing beside the motorbrougham by this time i get inside and mr ferdinand can go with the driver said mrs dumps determinedly i shant chance the night air after the turn i had when you had to get the sal volatile for me zara and i want to speak to you miss how dare you here here dont talk but get in and zara dexterously pushing her parent into the brougham slipped inside herself get on the box with hastings ferdy and tell him to drive home clarice found it rather a new and quaint experience to be in the company of a smart chauffeur driving through the brilliantly lighted streets of the metropolis to keep up her assumed character she lighted a cigarette and really enjoyed the situation hastings seemed to be of a reticent turn of mind as he only made a few short remarks about the running of the car and carefully attended to his business clarice was glad as she would not have known what to say had the man been talkative and she knew that ferdy must have been in the habit of chattering to the chauffeur from the remark hastings made when the brougham stopped before a door in saracen square where zara dwelt youre very quiet tonight mr baird said the man smiling i expect youd rather have been inside the machine clarice stared haughtily at the familiarity of this speech and hastings looked rather puzzled ferdy apparently was very free and easy with zaras servants but there was no time to consider the matter for zara stepped out of the brougham and bustled her mother up the stairs in a hurry mrs dumps was in tears and took no notice of the supposed ferdy a waiting maidservant took clarices coat and ushered her into a tiny drawingroom where the irritated girl found several portraits of ferdy smiling and debonair she must love him thought the outraged sister and glanced in the mirror over the fireplace to see how her disguise looked in this dimlylighted room where the redshaded lamps gave out rosy hues clarice thought that zara would never find her out she looked exactly like ferdy and had imposed successfully on the barmaid on mrs dumps and on the chauffeur so she had little fear of carrying her adventure to a successful conclusion shortly zara entered in a maizecoloured teagown but no longer in a bad temper indeed from the pallor of her face she seemed to have received a shock clarice immediately guessed that mrs dumps had been conversing about osip in the brougham it seemed to her that zara after all might not have known the truth about the man open a bottle of fizz ferdy said zara throwing herself on a sofa and give me some i shant eat any supper you can if you like i ought to open these i suppose she glanced at some letters lying on a small bamboo table near at hand but i cant be bothered give me the fizz quick ferdy or ill faint clarice had rather awkwardly opened a pint bottle of champagne and handed zara a glass are you tired she asked with pretended sympathy and anxious to make the girl talk zara drank off the wine before replying and nodded im tired and worried she said handing back the glass come and sit down beside me ferdy we must have a talk your mother oh bother my mother she has gone to bed and intends to return to crumel tomorrow i suppose she thinks im a bad lot i wish i had not asked her to come up now and im especially sorry that i asked her to come to the hall tonight no eliza this to the servant who entered with a hot dish we dont want any supper tonight go away and close the door oh dear me she sprang up when the maid departed and ruffled her red hair while looking into the mirror i wish youd marry me tomorrow ferdy and take me to paris i could get an engagement there and we could be happy but my sister clarice ventured to say boldly oh the deuce take your sister i cant stand her she looks upon me as though i were dirt youre always quoting your sister to me i detest her myself and if you marry me ill expect you to do the same why should she look down on me im not born a lady i know and i am not such a fool as to make up a history especially when you know all about me but im an honest woman and a clever one would your sister have worked as i have done would she have made a name for herself as i have made would she be able to earn moneyand in a perfectly respectable way mind youto keep on this flat and a motorbrougham pshaw talk to me of something else than about that mincing useless sister of yours clarice felt annoyed at her character being thus traduced as she knew that she was not useless and neither did she mince but she certainly admitted that she did not approve of zara dumps notwithstanding the catalogue of qualifications for admiration that the dancer had set forth zara slim and dainty with her graceful figure and pretty face looked so wonderfully fascinating as she spoke that had clarice really been ferdy it is probable she would have taken this beauty into her arms but clarice happened to be herself therefore she looked disdainfully at zaras airs and graces and brought round the conversation to more important matters you are cross tonight zara and you are a bear holding me at arms length i never saw you so cold before one would think id lost my good looksshe glanced into the mirror and laughedno those are all right cross i am cross mother has been bothering me in the brougham about osip zara made a dart at clarice and clutched her arm you know i know that the man who played the part of the chrysalisif it may be called a partis alfred osip for whom the police are looking your mother recognised him when he took his mask off i know muttered zara moodily and he recognised her that is why he bolted in such a hurry i expect he thought the police would arrest him on mothers information before he could get away i wont see him again i suppose do you want to no hang it i dont she snapped and flung herself petulantly into a chair near the bamboo table whereon the letters were lying it gives me the shivers to think that i have been acting with such a wicked devil then you did not know know echoed zara savagely and glaring knowof course i didnt know the man came to me a few weeks agoafter the murder now i rememberand called himself brown i was in a hole as the man who did the chrysalis business had left in a hurrydrink you know i told you all about that yes admitted clarice with an air of recollection but you didnt say that osip had taken on the part how the dickens could i when i didnt know the man he called himself brown and seemed quiet and right enough though he wasnt much of an acrobat but he filled in the gap for the time being i never intended to keep him long ill have to get another man tomorrow didnt you recognise him from the police description no plenty of men are tall and thin and brown didnt wear grey clothes when he came to me but the crisscross scar on the left cheek he hadnt got one his face was disfigured on both cheeksin fact it was scarred all over and he told me that a jealous woman had thrown vitrol at him i guess he did it himself to obliterate that scar clever of him to come to me added zara musingly and to dare to appear before dozens of peoplei mean hundreds of course he knew that his safety lay in such boldness the police would hunt the slums and the shipping ports and country towns and what not but who would expect to find a man described in the papers and wanted for eight murders in a musichall acrobat i call brown or rather osip confoundedly clever and the dancer took another glass of wine heres to his health oh zara and oh zara she mimicked youre a soft one ferdy i admire cleverness wherever i find it even in a murderer all the same i dont want to have anything to do with such a criminal ugh she shuddered i might have had the purple fern on my forehead also brown has been visiting me here on business and ive been alone with him several times alone with him said clarice pretending to jealousy nice for me zara stared and then laughed as she began to lazily open the letters dont pretend to be angry ferdy youre not fond enough of me for that not fond when i am engaged to marry you pooh thats compulsory youd be off after that prudence creature if id let you but i wont you can make yourself easy on that score she ran her eyes over the letter she was reading i like you well enough and you are easy to manage in my business to be entirely respectable i must have a husband so youll do as well as any one else also there is always the two thousand a year i dare say i could get someone richer but youll doyoull do ill do said clarice calmly thank you as zara opened another letter whats the matter for the dancer suddenly started zara sent so swift and keen a glance in her direction that clarice fancied that her disguise had been penetrated but the fear was groundless for zara again laughed im amused at the side you are putting on she said calmly and replacing the letter in its envelope you asked me to let you go and when i refused you cut up rough now you are trying to make me think that you love me you are certainly very pretty said clarice wondering what to say to this bold frank creature who concealed her feelings so little you thought so once said zara rising and coming to the sofa i am pretty still only you have no eyes to see lookshe twitched the large red silk shade from the lamp and the blaze of white light shone brilliantly upon her beautyam i not prettier than that blackbrowed minx prudence clarke dont say a word against prudence ill say twenty if i choose said zara throwing herself on the sofa beside clarice and taking her hand dont get me into a rage dear boy you loved me once and so deeply that you said my name was written on your heart it certainly was tattooed on your right arm just above the wristshe rapidly drew up clarices shirtcuff before the girl could stop her i see the name isnt there now said zara jeeringly you have obliterated it from your arm as you have driven it from your heart my dear clarice was startled by this development you dont understand she stammered oh yes i domiss clarice baird cried zara rising i understand that ferdy is at gattlinsands and that youarehere chapter xx proof positive in that little room with its vivid colouring and heavy scented atmosphere the two women faced each other bent upon battle at the outset the advantage lay with zara seeing how she had penetrated the disguise of the devoted sister for one moment the dancer eyed the pale and startled face of her visitor and then crossed to a bronze tripod of classic shape and beauty wherein smouldered a pastille while lighting another one she threw a careless glance over her shoulder well she said quietly have you nothing to say clarice now on her feet looked at the gaudy comfort of the tiny room at the oriental draperies and ornaments at the persian praying mats at herself in the glass tall slim and boyish in her masculine attire and then her gaze came back to the graceful woman in the maizehued teagown zara met her gaze with insolence and a smile curved the red beauty of her full lips have you nothing to say she repeated and the question sounded like a challenge a great deal retorted clarice nerving herself for the battle in spite of this dress i am a woman and therefore can use my tongue you will have to use your brains also said zara with a shrug if you wish to conquer me how do you know that i wish to conquer you you would not be here else i can guess why you have come to save ferdy from becoming what you no doubt callmy prey bah as if ferdy was worth it he must be worth something said clarice dryly or you would not wish to marry him oh i explained that retorted zara lightly and dusting one hand with the other i explained if you remember when i still took you to be ferdy himself i am always frank with the boy and he knows as you do now miss baird that i only wish to marry him forshall we say professional purposes i like himoh yes he is handsome and very charming when he chooses also he is sure of a certain income even though it is a small one and not available for two years i can manage ferdy and that is necessary when a woman wants her own way on all occasions as i do i might do worse than marry your brother dont you think so certainly i do answered clarice now quite composed and resuming her seat only you shall not marry ferdy and use him as a catspaw for your respectability be polite if you please said the dancer frowning i am polite to you and desire the return compliment my respectability is like that of csars wifeabove suspicion you see with a gay laugh that in spite of my trifling education i have some classical knowledge come let us talk you have much to say and so have i will you have a cigarette no and in spite of smoking when you came into this room oh i see there is no need to keep up your manly pose you look very well even handsomer than ferdy though i really was taken in as my mother was dear me zara lighted a cigarette and lay back in a deep armchair puffing smoke with her hands clasped behind her head what will she say when she hears that miss clarice baird has been masquerading here as her brother she will say nothing answered clarice coolly for the very simple reason that she will never know oh yes she will know from me and all the inhabitants of crumel will know from her my mother is an excellent town crier you carry it off very well said clarice dryly but i am not quite so weak as ferdy remember i grant that i respect you more than i do him he would never have ventured upon such a bold step as you have taken i should like to know exactly why you ventured you explained yourself a few minutes ago i want to save ferdy my dear he isnt worth ithe isnt worth more than thatand zara flicked the grey ash off her cigarette will you have some fizz no a cigarette then no really with a shrug you are not much of a man my dear i beg pardon for the familiarity in that dress you look so like ferdy that i make mistakes on purpose you are a clever woman miss dumps i am but not that name please twine is my name and ferdy will marry me as sarah twine i prefer to be called zara or butterfly myself the other name is so plebeian but then i am a very common person and a very clever one said clarice again glancing at the gimcrack french clock on the draped mantelpiece but we are losing time and i have to get back to my hotel how did you recognise me ah zara clapped her hands was not that smart of me you will say yes but you are wrong it was chancethe chance upon which you did not reckon it was ingenious of you to send ferdy to gattlinsands to get him out of the way but it did not occur to you that ferdy might write she picked up an envelope from the table and threw it across to clarice here it has just arrived clarice threw the letter back there is no need i recognise ferdys writing on the envelope i dont wish to know how he writes to you in a perfectly proper way i assure you said zara coolly i dont allow that child to be too familiarit breeds contempt you know i have had too much of that sort of thing before i became famous so i dont want another dose so you knew that i was not ferdy said clarice slowly not at first not until by chance i opened that envelope i started as you saw and then came across to look at your arm as the namemy name zarawas not tattooed there i guessed at once that you were not ferdy and that you could be none other than miss baird the double of my dear sweet boy spare me the adjectives said clarice coldly im sparing you a great deal i think said zara viciously by what right do you thrust yourself into my affairs by the right of a sisters love bah i dont believe that there is such a thing certainly so far as ferdy is concerned there isnt brotherly love on his part he would sell you for a fivepound note clarice felt a pang for she knew how truly the dancer spoke i agree with you there she replied sadly my dear he isnt worth it said zara in a softer tone well well clarice looked up speak away said zara impatiently im all attention what do you want to ask me ah now we are coming to business about time interpolated the other woman oh i shall dispose of my business very shortly said clarice sharply you want to marry ferdy to gain your ends you told prudence clarke a lie about her father zara was quite unmoved and blew smoke through her delicate nostrils prudence has told you then yes you forced her to send away ferdy to save her father i did i want ferdy to myself and i have no particular reason to desire the hanging of mr clarke you couldnt hang him if you tried retorted clarice angrily oh yes i could supposefor the sake of argumentthat i went to inspector tick of crumel with my story of what i saw you saw nothing zara cast a surprised look at clarice well i suppose it is to your interest to decline to believe nevertheless what i told prudence is true for all that did you really see mr clarke leave the laurels at two in the morning zara threw away her cigarette and rose quietly i really did she said in her most decisive tone my mother was ill and i went out for sal volatile it was a mere chance of course that i should be out on that night of all nights on any other nightat any other time eveni should have seen nothing but the cosmic powers for their own ends and for my benefit i presume brought me abreast of the laurels when mr clarke was skipping out of the window clarice was greatly startled do you really believe that mr clarke killed my guardian zara looked at her swiftly oh i am not prepared to say that and i beg to remind you that i am not in the witnessbox which means that you cannot swear to the truth of your story yes i can but i cant swear that mr clarke is the murderer it certainly looks as though he were guilty but zara paused but you credit osip with the crime the jury didthe police dothe papers dopublic opinion does i cant lay claim to be more clever than others clarice looked at her keenly yes you can and you do i believe your story of mr clarke coming out of the room but as to his guilt pardon me i say nothing about that interrupted zara but if prudence sent ferdy away at my bidding it shows that she believes her father to be guilty clarice was too clever to relate the other evidence upon which prudence believed her father to be guilty you certainly coerced that poor girl into thinking that there was danger to her father should the story of his midnight visit become known it never will replied zara carelessly prudence has given up ferdy and i am going to marry ferdy theres no more to be said there is thisthat ferdy shall not marry you zara rose and put her hands behind her back he shall clarice rose and faced her he shall not and for at least one minute the two women faced one another defiantly what can you do inquired zara at length and annoyed because she could not sustain the gaze of her visitor i can go to the police and say that you employed osip not knowing that he was osip retorted the dancer her breath coming quick and sharp if i had known i should have handed him over to the authorities indeed and what would become of your accusation of mr clarke i dont accuse mr clarke hes a boreat least he was when i attended his rotten old sunday schoolbut i dont say that he is a murderer however you can tell the police about osip and ill tell them about clarke then we shall see very good clarice moved towards the door theres no more to be said goodnight zara stood for one moment with clenched hands and a frown on her pretty babyish face which could look so strong at times and which deceived men into thinking her a mere toywoman she had not expected clarice to take her at her word and thus had lost a move in the game in spite of her bravado she had no desire that the crumel police or the london detectives should know about osip it would be a good advertisement in one way and yet in another it might do her harm with the managers she had really been ignorant that the survivor of the famous purple fern triumvirate was acting with her but who would believe in her innocence did the fact become public property with a swift movement she placed herself between clarice and the door no i take back what i said you must not tell the police about osipit would do me harm very good ill hold my tongue if you will be silent about my masquerade in this dress ah you are afraid sneered zara in a way yesfor my promised husband since he would not like any one to know of my adventure for myself i am not afraid as i have done nothing wrong you are stronger than ferdy said the dancer suddenly i should hope so replied clarice contemptuously ferdy is a reeda piece of putty i wonder that a clever woman such as you are wants to marry so weak a man it is because he is weak that i wish him to become my husband said zara quickly i wish to marry so as to have a protector in my public life as i am sick of all these fops who come round me but i do not wish to wed a fireside tyrant and so she stretched out her arms in a french fashion and with a careless shrug i will hold my tongue she went on not even my mother will ever know that you are really clarice baird as to osipwhat will you do i shall say nothing at present replied clarice after a moments thought but you must be aware that it will not do to allow such a man to live he will only commit more murders i suppose so what a devil the man is yet you know as brown he really was rather nice ugh zara shivered again i am not a silly fainting woman but it turns me cold to think how often i have been in his company he might have killed me clarice took a cigarette out of the silver box and lighted up i must be going now she said quietly and so i have to keep up my pretence of being a man but one last word we understand one another yes said zara promptly i keep silent about clarke and you about osip of course also i marry ferdy no said clarice determinedly i wont leave this house until i have your promise to give up ferdy to prudence clarke sneered the dancer she wont have him yes she will she loves ferdy and ferdy loves her if the weak affection of ferdy can be called love said zara derisively but prudence wont marry him so long as she believes that her father is guilty but he is not i dont say that then he is said clarice daring her i dont say that either then what do you say i say that we had better leave things as they are and that you will please me by coming to my wedding with ferdy you must give my brother up youve said that so often miss baird but saying it wont make me change my mind besides as i said before ferdy isnt worth it hes an assand worse worse what do you mean zara looked into the other womans eyes come to the door she said taking clarice by the arm when in the hall she helped the girl on with her fur coat gave her the silk hat and placed the silverknobbed cane in her hand then she led her to the door of the flat all this clarice suffered in silence wondering what was coming goodnight said zara when clarice was on the mat but what do you say about ferdy asked clarice quickly i see i must tell you all sighed the dancer no ill let you find out for yourself she bent her head and whispered search ferdys bedroom at the laurels but began clarice impatiently only to find herself talking to the panels of the door zara had shut it abruptly and left the disguised girl standing irresolutely on the mat clarice hesitated and wondered if it would not be better to insist upon the door being opened again but on second thoughts she went down the stairs and drove back to her hotel the long evening and the battle with zara had worn out her strong nerves clarice passed a wakeful night she wondered what zara meant when she had told her to search ferdys bedroom it could not be possible that ferdy had anything to do with the crime as he had been locked in on that night also if zara knew that ferdy was guilty she certainly would not marry him there seemed to be no answer to the questions suggested by zaras last remark clarice therefore tried to sleep resolving to return to crumel the next day and search the bedroom as zara had told her she trembled to think what she might discover next morning the false mr ferdinand baird ate his breakfast paid his bill and drove to liverpool street station to catch the ten oclock train in the tweed suit clarice looked wonderfully handsome and distinguished and as she adopted a manly air no one had any suspicion that the goodlooking young man was really a beautiful woman she managed to get a firstclass to herself and thus escaped any chance of recognition but on the crumel platform she was greeted as mr baird and acknowledged the greetings calmly on reaching the house she found the french window open and no servants about in a few minutes she was safe in her own bedroom and was dressing herself again in her womans garb mrs rebson appeared its all right deary no one thinks but what youre ill how did you get along very well nanny ill tell you all later dont let any of the servants come upstairs for at least an hour what do you wish to do ill tell you later leave me alone for the present just one word miss clarice implored the nurse master ferdy is he quite safe now yes said clarice lying to save pain to that faithful old heart i think ferdy is safe nanny now go mrs rebson quite satisfied departed and kept the servants downstairs according to her instructions clarice went at once to ferdys room and began to search for twenty minutes she was unsuccessful as she came across nothing suspicious it was a difficult search as she did not know what to look for but she judged that it might be a letter or a bloodstained shirt or something likely to implicate her brother in the crime several times she stopped turning out drawers and examining the wardrobe to laugh at the folly which possessed her to believe in zaras lies but some feeling that there might be truth in the dancers hint made her search on and yet clarice could not believe that ferdy whom she had locked in this very room had anything to do with so awful a crime let alone the fact that ferdy although foolish was not wicked but the end came at last and she found what she soughtand what she sought was evidence implicating ferdy in a small drawer wrapped up carefully in an old silk tie the girl found a small indiarubber stamp with a wildly beating heart she dipped this in water to moisten it and pressed hard on a scrap of shaving paper she removed the stamp and found on the paper a faint impression of the purple fern chapter xxi ackworths news mrs rebson being a woman and fond of gossip had her fair share of curiosity also she was anxious to hear what clarice had been doing in london and to know exactly how she had saved ferdy although mrs rebson had a very vague idea of what ferdy was to be saved from that her darling had anything to do with the crime never entered her foolish old head however her impatience would not permit her to stay downstairs longer than an hour so she went back to the room of her young mistress as soon as she could clarice was not within and mrs rebson was puzzled she hunted through the other rooms on the same floor and at length came to ferdys apartment here she found the room in disorder and clarice lying on the carpet in a dead faint considerably alarmed mrs rebson got water and vinegar and sal volatile and all suchlike aids to insensible people shortly clarice revived and sat up with a dazed look but as soon as a memory of what she had found came back to her with a rush she struggled to her feet and crushed up the scrap of shavingpaper upon which she had impressed the fern the stamp itself she had held closely in her left hand all the time she was insensible so she did not think that her dimeyed old nurse had seen anything more than that mrs rebson ascribed to the london trip this unexampled behaviour on the part of the girl never before had strongminded clarice baird lost her senses come and lie down deary coaxed mrs rebson leading the girl back to her own room youre fairly worn out with gadding about that nasty london ill bring you up some tea do nanny said clarice faintly and when the nurse left the room she lay passively upon her bed what she felt at the moment no one knew and no one could ever know the stamp of the purple fern was inseparably connected with the many murders and that it should be in ferdys bedroom hidden away so carefully seemed terrible and inexplicable ferdy could not have murdered his guardian since he had been locked up in his room and yet the stamp which had been used to impress the fatal mark on the forehead of the dead was in ferdys possession of course osip who was really the murderer might have had another stamp certainly he must have had another stamp and no doubt each member of the triumvirate possessed a similar article ferdy was guiltless and osip had done the deed and yet how came it that ferdy had this particular stamp in his possession clarice could have shrieked with fear and horror and had to roll over on her pillow to prevent herself from crying out and then another agonised thought came into her tormented mind zara had told her to search ferdys room therefore zara must have known that the stamp was hidden away there and if zara knew it was in her power to hang the poor boy poor boycould even his own sister speak of him in that way when he was connected with a callous cruel crime he had not stabbed horran with the assegai since he had been locked in his room but he must have impressed the purple fern on the dead mans forehead unless osipoh yes osip must have done it not ferdynot ferdynot ferdy and so the girls distracted brain buzzed and droned with the hideous repetition of one word guilt guilt guilt i shall go mad moaned clarice what am i to do i dare not tell anthony i dare not marry him what is to be doneoh great heavens what is to be done then it came into her mind that zara had stated how clarke had paid his midnight visit to the deathchamber and at two oclock that was the timeaccording to the medical evidencewhen the deed had been committed between one and two oclock in the morning dr jerce had said at the inquest and clarke was there if he was innocent himself he might know who was guilty he could not have seen ferdy who was bolted and barred in his bedroom but he might have seen osip kill horran and impress that infernal seal of evil on the dead yes she would see clarkeshe must see clarke there was no need for her to say what she had discovered she would merely let clarke speak she would tax him with his visit and to exonerate himselfif he was guiltlesshe would certainly detail all that happened if he mentioned ferdys namebut then he would not do thathe could nothe dare not ferdy could prove an alibi his sister could prove an alibi for him whomsoever killed horran her brother was at least innocent and yet the stampthe stamp of the purple fern how could she explain that away my miss clarice you do look bad said mrs rebson entering with a dainty meal of tea and toast that nasty london here drink the tea youll feel better soon deary and after all you have saved master ferdy havent you my deary little maid clarice winced and lied bravely yes she said faintly i have saved ferdy you need have no fear nanny leave me for ten minutes rather reluctantly the old woman departed and clarice forced herself to drink a cup of tea and to eat a morsel of toast she would have to be strong if ferdy was to be saved zara knew the truth about the boy and might tell the police there was no one to save ferdy poor weak foolish creature but his sister and his sister would save him in the face of all obstacles clarice therefore fought with herself she struggled desperately with her womans weakness she braced herself with prayer and finally triumphed over the flesh by the strength of her spirit when mrs rebson stole back to the bedroom she was amazed to see how rapidly her young mistress had recovered her presence of mind she had left a palefaced tearful girl she found a calm selfcontained woman its wonderful what tea and toast will do mrs rebson with great complacency nanny observed clarice who had now determined what to do send to mr clarke and tell him to see me this afternoon you are not well enough deary i am i must see him but your hair deary whats the matter withoh yes clarice mechanically put her hand to her head it is rather awkward but it is not too closely cropped nanny get out the hair i cut off and well weave it into what i have left on my scalp mrs rebson laughed at what she conceived was a joke and between them they contrived very skilfully to fasten on the shorn tresses as ferdy usually wore his hair in a musicianlike way clarice had imitated the cut so it was not difficult to replace the severed locks in the style in which she generally wore them also since she wished to still play the part of invalid she made mrs rebson draw down the blinds and light the fire then swathed in blankets and shawls clarice sat ready for the visit of the parson she had failed to deceive sir daniel jerce but mr clarke being less clever and observant and not a doctor she felt certain that she would manage to trick him having thus arranged her stage the anxious girl waited for the vicar mr clarke appeared almost on the heels of the messenger and looked more wild and wan than ever with a weary air he shook hands with miss baird and expressed his regret that she was suffering from influenza then he sat down opposite to her and stared into the fire with lacklustre eyes clarice had to break the ice mr clarke she said hesitating for it was not easy to begin i wish to speak to you about a very important matter i am quite at your service clarice and one which touches your reputation said the girl mr clarke started and became paler than ever as he cast a keen wild look at the speaker iiidont understand he stuttered carry your thoughts back to the night when uncle henry was murdered said clarice significantly and you will understand the vicar considered for a few moments and then shook his head no i dont know what you mean i thoughti thought he moistened his dry lips i thought that you were going to speak of frank and i wont have his name mentioned he ended violently i did not intend to speak of frank said clarice wondering why the memory of his dead son should so agitate him but of your visit to uncle henrys room on that night my visit stammered the old man your midnight visit who said that i oh there is no need for me to give names interrupted clarice in sharp tones but someone saw you leaving the bedroom at two in the morning what were you doing there at that time oh yes i remember mr clarke spoke in a dreamy way i should have spoken to the police about that but franks wickedness put it quite out of my head and then of course it looked awkward for me clarice was almost too astonished to speak that he should take the revelation so calmly perplexed her greatly how do you mean that it looked awkward for you she asked after an embarrassing pause going to see poor horran at that hour said mr clarke innocently and then seeing his dead body clarice rose unsteadily was the man mad to admit what he had seen she could not make any remark but stared at him tonguetied the vicar still continued dreamy and absentminded and then i owed poor horran one thousand pounds with interest he went on slowly some people might have said that i had murdered him then youyouyou areinnocent gasped miss baird clarke looked up sharply struck by the speech and the significance of her tones innocent he said in a clear and vigorous voice i am innocent of course you never thought that i was guilty well the person who saw you who was it asked clarke quickly i decline to mention names no matter no matter but i am surprised that you should believe me guilty of a wicked deed clarice you have known me for years yet it now seems that you do not know me at all if you will explain yes ill explain at once i should have explained beforeand to the police but franks wickednessfranks deathoh he clasped his hands together in an agony of sorrow was ever a man tried so hardly as i have been hush say nothing sit down let me collect my thoughts and ill tell you everythingthat is about my visit to poor horran on that night nothing else need be talked about my own affairs aremy own affairs unable to remain seated he rose and walked up and down the room trying to compose himself clarice wondering what he was about to say resumed her seat and watched him in silence after a time mr clarke recovered his selfcontrol and still walking he told her all that she wanted to know i saw horran one afternoon he explained you remember what i said at the inquest i noticed that the bedroom window was open so i slipped in anxious to gain time from horran to pay the interest i did not wish to be sold up you know so i told him everything and he was very angry with you questioned clarice not with me certainly not with me barras was in fault he had told barras to lend me the thousand pounds for as long as i required them there was no question of interest and when i mentioned the ten per cent horran declared that he knew nothing about that and should have been told before that such an interest had been charged he had never intended that i should be hampered in that way the loan was to be from a friend to a friend it is strange mused clarke that in three years and more barras should never have mentioned to horran that he had charged interest he evidently charged the interest secretly said clarice after a thoughtful pause and naturally would say nothing about it and then you saw uncle henry frequently during those three years why did you not mention it yourself horran never during our earlier interviews touched on the subject of the loan and the matter was never discussed it was only of late when i found that i could not pay the interest that i wished to speak of my difficulties and then jerce would not allow me to see my old friend he was quite right said clarice reproachfully seeing how ill uncle henry was and you did upset him you know barras upset him expostulated the vicar he was angry with barras not with me and declared that i should have spoken before he also said that jerce had no right to prevent my seeing him and that there was no need for me to go to the front door when i wished to see him he said i could enter by the french window which was generally open yes it was said miss baird thinking of the difference of opinion which existed between the two doctors but why did you choose so late an hour to enter by that way clarke hesitated and looked down i was much disturbed on the night of the crime i had received bad news unable to sleep i walked in my garden on that bitterly cold night oh the thaw had come by that time you know i left my garden and walked about the town i had no idea of going to see horran for at that time i knew that he would be asleep however i walked back to the vicarage up the lane and saw a light in the bedroom and the window open you are certain that it was open asked clarice i entered by it as i thought i would see if horran was asleep or awake and then well was he asleep or awake he was dead said the vicar with great emotion he was lying in bed with the clothes in disorder and his breast streaming with blood with the clothes in disorder echoed clarice raising herself why when i saw poor uncle henrys corpse the clothes were carefully arranged and smoothed i did that said mr clarke in a broken voice i saw that he was dead so i arranged the clothes and hastily went away without touching anything in the room why did you not give the alarm why cried clarke astonished when i might have been accused of committing the crime am i a fool clarice my mere presence at such an hour would have accused me no i returned home and said nothing about what i had seen it was a few minutes past two oclock when i regained my bed and clarice asked the question in a low anxious voice did you see anyone within or without the house no i saw no one and heard nothing who was it saw me zara dumps who had gone out late at night to procure medicine for her mother and why did she not accuse me she did to prudence and so made prudence give up ferdy whom zara wishes to marry then zara made a false accusation and i wonder that my daughter believed her she did not at first explained clarice but prudence found blood on the cuffs of a shirt you had worn very likely when i was arranging the bedclothes of my murdered friend the blood could easily have got on to the cuffs so this was why prudence gave up your brother and i thought she did so because i wished it why did you wish it mr clarke you were pleased once yes said the vicar sadly for then i did not know what i know now about frank never mention his namenever speak of him i am not master of myself when i thinki think mr clarke clutched his scanty locks with both hands and rushed suddenly from the room clarice did not wish to call him back since she knew all that she wished to know clarke was innocent and he had not set eyes upon her brother so far ferdy was safe but who could have written that anonymous letter until the author of that was discovered clarice knew that she would have no peace of mind as always she would be apprehensive lest ferdy should be arrested all that afternoon clarice puzzled over what was best to be done and remained in her room with an aching head her feigned illness was rapidly turning to a real one so sick did she feel with worry and anxiety then she received a surprise anthonys card was brought up and mrs rebson said that he was waiting for her in the drawingroom why is he here clarice asked herself then hastily arranging her attire she went down filled with nervous fears clarice said anthony abruptly and coming forward with outstretched hands i have made a discoveryi must tell you at once what i have found out in whitechapel have you been there what about ferdy i left him in charge of another fellow hes still at gattlinsands wait ill explain later but my news the consumptive chap attended by jerceone of the purple fern murderers waswho do you thinknone other than frank clarke the vicars son chapter xxii the anonymous letter the announcement of ackworth was so terrible and so unexpected that clarice could scarcely believe her ears she knew that frank clarke was a rascal and extravagant that he was selfish and dishonourable but it never entered her head that he would turn out to be a coldblooded murderer no wonder the vicar who had forgiven much to his prodigal son had stopped short of finally pardoning such an unmitigated scoundrel he must have known what frank was said clarice involuntarily who must have known asked anthony quickly mr clarke he was here a short time ago and would not let me mention his sons name he must know yes clarice struck her hands together this was why he refused to let prudence marry ferdy i thought that it was prudence herself who refused to marry ferdy yes but for another reason i told you that reasonthe accusation of mr clarke by zara dumps i remember anthony ruffled his hair in sore perplexity what have you done about that i have seen zara you have seen that girl when where last nightin london at the mascot music hall and at her own rooms you look surprised i am you should not have gone to her rooms let alone the mascot music hall i know thatbut to save ferdy i did so it was just as well that i went for several reasons oh i have much to tell youclarice drew her lover to the sofa with gentle forceand perhaps you will be angry with me i said that i would trust you remarked ackworth slowly your trust has not been misplaced but i have done what you may think rather a bold thing still in this case what i have learned is so important that i can safely say that the end has justified the means what have you done anthony looked apprehensive she tapped his cheek nothing to make you colour up in that way my dear boy ill tell you everything when you have explained how you came to find out about frank clarke oh that will not take long i asked ferdy down yesterday as you desired me to do and he came without any suspicions that you wanted him out of the way we had a very jolly evening at least ferdy had for i was worrying about you and wondering what you were doing also i must admit that i had the detective fever what is that asked miss baird opening her eyes well the errand you wanted me to execute raised my curiosity to fever heat i felt that i could not rest until i had learned the name of jerces consumptive patient especially when i remembered that he was one of the purple fern triumvirate next morning i had no duties to attend to so i handed ferdy over to an irish chap who would amuse him and keep an eye on him and then bunked off to london by the ten oclock train you did not come up to see what i was doing asked clarice in a suspicious manner no i did not even know that you were in london replied anthony rather wounded by her doubts and in any case as i intended to trust you i should not have spied upon you i ask your pardon dear and she kissed him ackworth accepted the delightful apology and continued i went down to whitechapel and had a deuce of a hunt to find tea street but i came across a kind of sister of mercy who knew all about jerce and his philanthropic missions jerce has a surgery in tea street and goes there twice a week usually at night sister anneso she told me she was called and it reminded me of bluebeardshowed me where the consumptive young man had lived the police had been there after jerce had communicated that letter to scotland yard what letter the one given by the dying man to jerce warning him that he might be attacked by osip if you remember the sick chap confessed that he was one of the members of the triumvirate according to sister anne this young man was called felix exton but the police found stray letters in his rooms which showed that he was really frank clarke the son of the vicar clarice nodded and i expect the police came down and told mr clarke about the discovery poor man no wonder he suffers so terribly and will not allow his sons name to be mentioned that miserable frankand yet i remember him a handsome bright young man he was a bad lot said ackworth emphatically i scarcely blame a man for striking a blow in hot blood but to murder in such coldblooded ways as those adopted by the purple fern gang is too terrible to think of and now that we know frank clarke was an assassin it would seem as if the instinct to murder was hereditary no said clarice quickly you must not think so badly of the vicar anthony he is innocent and she related to her lover all that mr clarke had explained to her humph said ackworth when she ended thats a very plausible tale but we have only the vicars word for its truth and it is to his interest to exonerate himself his son was connected with osip so clarke himself through frank may be connected also with that blackguard i wish he could be foundosip i mean i wonder with such a personality he has not been spotted i saw him said clarice unexpectedly you anthony rose with a startled gesture yes she said faintly at the mascot music hall the young man looked at her anxiously clarice he said taking her cold hand you look pale mrs rebson said something about your having influenza yet you were all right when i saw you last clarice nodded i might say that i caught cold as you were afraid i should do when we were in the porch but i cant say that because it is not true i am quite well you dont look it i have not the influenza i mean she corrected i pretended to be ill so that i might carry out my scheme what scheme the one i had in my mind when i asked you to trust me anthony i want you to tell me do you trust me still of course i do he laid his hand caressingly on her head dont be afraid that ill blame you in anywhy clarice he might well utter her name in an astonished tone for the hair so lightly pinned on her head came off and the plaits remained in his hand there she sat with her head cropped like a mans and a pale smile on her face i intended to tell you said she quietly but it is just as well that you have found out in this way found out what why have you cut off your beautiful hair dont you think that i look rather like ferdy very but i dont want you to look like ferdy i prefer you as you are my dear my dear she echoed does that mean forgiveness for what anthony looked more puzzled than ever for my masquerade i cut off my hair i dressed in a suit of ferdys clothes i went to london as ferdy and stopped at his favourite hotel also i went to the mascot music hall as ferdy and to zara dumps flat as ferdy and learned a great deal anthony stared at her openmouthed do you mean to say that you dressed as a man he asked aghast yes it was necessary to learn ferdys secrets so i utilised my resemblance to him to find out what i wanted no one discovered that i was clarice baird save zara oh lord anthony clutched his head she will tell everyone no i have made that right i know too much about zara for her to betray me i am quite safe only zara knows and mrs rebson knows and now you know i am absolutely safe but what made you do such a mad thing i have told youto save ferdy but i could have gone up and no interrupted clarice imperiously zara would have laughed at you i did what i did with a full knowledge of what i was doing you must forgive me anthony and i think you will when you learn what terrible things i have discovered of course i am somewhat annoyed said ackworth slowly at least i would be were you an ordinary woman but you are so clever and so well able to look after yourself that i forgive you this time but i must ask you not to masquerade again as ferdy i promise that she said with a sigh ferdy is in such danger that you must help me ferdy in danger what sort of danger let me begin at the beginning and go on to the end dont interrupt anthony and then she related her adventures ackworth held his peace until she detailed her recognition of osip when he jumped with a muttered oath why did you not have him arrested he cried everything would then have been discovered yeseven to the fact that ferdy is implicated in these terrible crimes said clarice sarcastically ackworth jumped again her revelations were getting on his nerves what do you mean he asked irritably let me go on from where i saw osip said clarice and continued her recital up to the point when she fainted in ferdys bedroom with the stamp in her hand now what do you say she asked breathlessly i dont know what to say muttered ackworth much agitated it looks as though ferdy knew something yet if he was locked in his room he could not have murdered horran oh i dont for one moment believe that he did but having the stamp he might have impressed the purple fern on nonsense interrupted the soldier violently he was drunk and incapablehe was locked in clarice looked down anthony she said in a pained voice i have tried to fight against my doubts of ferdy but they will come he is so weak so tricky so deceitful and so carried away by his own selfish impulses that he is capable of all things save murder ferdy is a fool i grant you but a murdererno i never accused him of murder said the girl faintly but he may be an accomplice thats just as bad not when we know that ferdy is so weak a man osip is strongwilled and may have coerced ferdy into stamping uncle henrys forehead after the death of which osip is guilty yes i firmly believe from the warning sent that osip is guilty then you mean to say that osip went upstairs after killing horran released ferdy and brought him down to no no osip would not know where ferdys room was and he would not know that he was drunk and locked up but ferdy himself might have feigned drunkenness so as to induce me to lock him up had you ever done so before oh yes i punished ferdy in that way besides i was afraid that in his drunken mood he might wander about the house and perhaps set the place on fire ferdy always resented my locking him up but in this instance if he was likely to be implicated in a crime and forced to be an accomplice by the stronger will of osip the locked door would provide a convenient alibi ferdy might have pretended drunkenness and then have released himself with another key and havedone what i said anthony did not immediately reply he stood before clarice biting his nails and thinking when i went up to town this morning he said slowly ferdy asked me to get him any letters that might be waiting for him at sir daniel jerces place in harley street yes ferdy lives with him well jerce was away and had been for some time down in whitechapel i think the servant said it was just as well why asked clarice rising as ackworth took three letters from his pocket because he might have seen this especial letter addressed to ferdythis letter stamped with the purple fern clarice took the square envelope he held out it was addressed to her brother at jerces house and on the flap of the envelope in purple wax was stamped a small fern few people unless they looked very closely would have noticed the fern and certainly nine people out of ten would not have connected the stamp with the crimes unless the murders were in their minds apparently the tenth and more observant person was anthony i intend to take that letter to ferdy and make him open it in my presence said ackworth andoh clarice what are you doing i am opening the letter said the girl calmly i take all responsibility for doing so and will tell ferdy still it is not quite right to open not quite right repeated clarice fiercely do you think i care for that when ferdys neck may be at stake i do thisshe opened the letterin a most deliberate way and well knowing what i am doing now i shall read it anthony could not but admit that clarice was right and secretly thought that it would be better for her to read the letter than for the police to scan its contents she read quietly enough and then passed it to her lover theres a masked ball at the shahs rooms tonight she said irrelevantly is there said anthony puzzled but why read the letter ackworth did so it contained only a few lines saying that the writer wanted to meet mr ferdinand baird at the shahs rooms on that evening on particular business after last night wrote the anonymous correspondent for there was no name appended to the note you can scarcely wonder that i insist upon a meeting and you can guess who i am wear a red domino with a white favour and i will wear a purple domino with golden stars meet me at ten oclock under the omar khayym palm in the desert anthony read this twice i wonder who wrote it he said osip replied clarice promptly and whats moreexcuse me she hastily left the room much to the amazement of anthony but he had plenty to think about until she returned which she did almost immediately with an open letter in her hand this is the anonymous note sent to you said clarice handing it to him and looking over his shoulder see the writings are distinctly similar it was osip who tried to stop our marriage by threatening ferdy and now osip thinking that ferdy saw him at the mascot music hall last night wants to arrange a meeting and why asked ackworth recognising that the handwritings were indeed similar i cant tell you that until i see osip clarice how can you see osip this evening it is now five i can catch the seven train up and i can see him as i saw him last night he wont tell clarice baird anything but he may tell ferdy baird a lot do you want to disguise yourself again said ackworth looking angry i musti must she said eagerly if i am to save my brother but to go to those roomsthey arent respectable oh what does that matter said clarice impatiently i go as a young manno one will recognise me and ferdy stops tonight at gattlinsands but you promised you must release me from my promise she declared obstinately ackworth bit his lip i dont like it he said decidedly then you are not the man i took you for retorted the girl i should have thought you were above all this conventional rubbish anthony i am to be your wife and you must trust me in every way i do i am sure that i have proved my trust in you ah you did not know what i was about to do said clarice rather unjustly and now that you do know you refuse to trust me no i dont only i dont wish you to go alone to the shahs rooms ill be quite safe no one will know me this osip is a murderer said ackworth and he may kill you why should he kill me she interpolated thinking you are ferdy baird who recognised him at the mascot music hall i dare say that he believes that you have told the police and now seeks revenge ill risk that clarice you are a brave girl but i wont let you go alone ill come up with you tonight but ferdy he must be kept away flanigan will attend to him ill cut over to gattlinsands and arrange that there i can catch the train which will meet at the junction the seven oclock you come by well go together but you wont tell the police about osip not until you learnas ferdythe exact relations between that silly brother of yours and this blackguard chapter xxiii an important discovery the shahs rooms were the latest sensation of frivolous london and had lasted for six months with undiminished success the building contained a number of rooms and entertainments to suit all classes there was a variety theatre with three performances daily bars without number billiard tables lawntennis courts a sawdust football ground a motor and bicycle track and a large hall for wrestling and boxing but the glory of the shahs rooms was the desert as the conception was original and excellently carried out by clever workmen and designers this was a vast expanse of real sand covering several acres and bounded on all sides by painted scenery of tropical sky and arid rocks and occasional cities and one or two pyramids here and there was an oasis of palms with real grass and real trees and real water and with spotlessly white supper tents erected for the accommodation of gay parties caravans of camels and horses and donkeys took bands of pleasureseekers from oasis to oasis or into the desert itself to dine at one of the bedouin encampments for entertainment there were mirages skilfully managed with magiclanterns and forays of wild arabs storytellers relating the arabian nights could be hired singers could be obtained dancing girls could be engaged and eastern fortunetellers were frequently employed to read the future by means of sand diagrams it was all very new and very amusing and very fantastical so it was little wonder that the shahs rooms were crowded nightly they would be deserted when the novelty wore off but just now fashionable london was delighted with a sham life in a sham east anthony and clarice arrived about nine oclock and went at once to the great dancing saloon where a masked ball was in progress clarice had again assumed ferdys evening dress and ackworth was astonished to see how closely she resembled her brother when tricked out in masculine attire as anthony knew much more of the ways and means of midnight london than was good for him he had taken clarice to a costumiers shop in drury lane and there they had procured the necessary dominos for their adventure that of ackworth was merely one of black silk plain and unpretentious but clarice wore a red cloak with a bunch of loose white ribbons on the breast so that osip might recognise her gazing at the dancers and dresses the two looked vainly for the purple domino with gold stars but such a costume was nowhere to be seen then clarice reminded her companion that the meeting was to take place in the desert so hither they bent their steps and pending the arrival of osip they partook of a hasty supper both were hungry for the hurry of getting up from the country had left them no time to eat what am i to do when osip comes for you asked anthony remain here answered clarice looking round i wont go out of sight i promise you if you do i shall follow said ackworth resolutely i am not going to let you remain alone with a known murderer and i have brought this clarice looked sideways and saw that he was holding a heavy army revolver under the folds of his domino you wont require to use it she said hastily if osip means anything by asking for this meeting with ferdy it is that he wishes to escape he will therefore not try to hurt me in any way you cant trust such a scoundrel said ackworth quietly and if you go out of sight i followremember that they were seated under a tent on the extreme verge of the desert and between them was a small turkish table upon which stood a tray heaped with eastern food when the coffee came it was close upon ten oclock and anthony lighted a cigarette also he offered one to clarice who took it smiling i thought you did not like me to smoke she said nor do i but you must keep up your character of ferdy and he is rarely without a cigarette in his mouth look at the mirage it was extremely pretty for on the far horizon out of the air seemingly grew a delicate ethereal vision of spires and temples and embattled walls all white and glorious against a blue sky quivering with heat but clarice was too restless to be tempted with such pleasures and walked out of the tent while ackworth settled with the arab attendant here and there she looked in vain for the purple domino but could see no sign the desert was filling rapidly and there was much laughter and much talking camels paced about in a stately manner the troupes of bedouins were performing their raids and displaying wonderful horsemanship and from the near tents came the chatter of merry people enjoying the unaccustomed food shortly anthony adjusting his mask joined her and they stood watching for the coming of the man who was so ardently wanted by the police in a few minutes ackworth touched clarices arm and drew her attention silently to a couple of men in evening dress and unmasked who were walking towards an oasis some distance away clarice nearly betrayed herself by a feminine scream of surprise when she beheld sir daniel jerce arm in arm with barras the lawyer what does that mean she asked in a low astonished voice anthony shrugged his square shoulders theres nothing remarkable about that he said lightly jerce i suppose feels the need of a little excitement after his hard work so comes here its not the kind of place i should expect him to visit said miss baird staring after the retreating figures and with mr barras too who is the driest and most uninteresting of men i should not have thought that he would go in for amusement of any kind humph barras like jerce may have two sides to his character the sides we dont know of scarcely seem to be respectable retorted the girl who felt uneasy at the sight of the two men i wish you would follow them anthony she added as jerce and his companion entered the central oasis and learn why they are here i dont see what good that would do my dear besides i wish to keep an eye on you and osip hush dont mention his name there may be spies about i wonder when he will come anthony glanced at his watch it wants two minutes to ten he remarked quickly we had better go to the omar khayym palm i go alone said clarice hastily if heshe did not mention the namesees me with you he wont address me where is the palm you speak of in the central oasis said ackworth pointing seethe golden palm on the verge but dont disappear into the oasis clarice or ill come after you get that chap to converse where i can see you from this tent ill smoke and have a drink and keep an eye on you both clarice nodded and leaving anthony to reseat himself at the turkish table she walked slowly towards the golden palm which was some distance away it was an artificial tree of gigantic height and nearly touched the glass roof which shut in the fairy desert under it she saw already waiting a man clothed in a purple domino glittering with gold stars he stood smoking a cigar and gazed at the mirage now enveloped in rosy colours i am here said clarice touching him on the arm the man wheeled quickly and looked searchingly at her a red domino with a white favour he said softly will you please remove your mask mr baird anticipating this the girl had already loosened the strings and the next moment osipif it was osipfound himself staring into the face of the individual he took to be ferdy as he gave a nod of satisfaction clarice spoke to him in her turn will you now remove your mask she asked replacing her own the man glanced round and seeing that no one was sufficiently near to examine him closely he slipped off his mask clarice beheld a thin face woefully scarred especially on the cheeks the crisscross mark had been entirely obliterated and no one at a casual glance would have recognised osip as he had been it did great credit to mrs dumps powers of observation that she had so rapidly guessedand on the stage toothat the acrobat who played the chrysalis was the assassin so anxiously sought for are you satisfied asked osip replacing his mask i suppose you are the man said clarice trying to appear calm but shivering a little as she thought of what her companion had done only i dont know you by sight remember didnt mrs dumps tell you last night yes but how she recognised you without the crisscross mark i cannot say replied clarice quietly oh trust a woman to jump to conclusions said osip coolly it might have been my lean figure or the shape of my head or my general air that she knew me by but i certainly congratulate mrs dumps on her cleverness but you are wrong in saying that you do not know me by sight you saw me in the high street of crumel clarice suddenly recollected that ferdy had noticed the man in grey and had told jerce about him it was only a passing glance she protested i should never have remembered you ah you are not a woman said osip thoroughly imposed upon by her disguise and manly bearing but we cannot speak here someone might overhear and i have to be careful he ended with a slight laugh ugh said clarice and shuddered why do you do that asked osip suddenly and curiously granted that i amwhat i am are you any better mr baird clarice felt as though cold water was running through her veins what do you mean she faltered i think you know what i mean retorted osip but we will camp in the desert where there will be a wide space round us and no one can come within earshot without being seen come he led the way towards the sandy track beckoning to a picturesquely attired waiter to follow clarice cast a look in the direction of anthony who was watching at his tent door and followed in a short space of time the sham arab attendanthe was a bavarianhad spread a carpet and had arranged pillows he also placed a turkish stool in the middle and waited for orders the scarred man reclined on one set of pillows and signalled to clarice that she should recline on the other which she did will you have some turkish coffee and a narghile he asked we must be strictly eastern here you know clarice accepted although she secretly doubted if she could smoke a narghile and shortly the attendant brought them what was wanted then he went away and miss baird found herself smoking and drinking in company with a scoundrel who had killed eight people she shivered again as the waiter retreated and they were left comparatively alone osip noticed it is it the cold air or my company he asked jeeringly your company said clarice tartly oh then like doesnt draw to like i should think after what you have done mr baird you would be less scrupulous you dare to accuse me of murdering ta ta ta dont let us have any heroics please do you think that if i did not hold your life in my hand i would risk being here with you and so running the chance of capture we are in the same boat mr baird and if i am hanged for murder you will swing beside me i promise you it took all clarices selfcontrol to keep herself quiet after all ferdy really was guilty of murder and she had only to learn how he had contrived to escape from the locked room osip apparently knew all about it and she impatiently awaited his recital but had she not been masked he would have observed the pallor of her face and perhaps his suspicions would have been aroused as it was he quite believed her to be her brother and talked on leisurely owing to their solitary position no one could approach within hearing distance without being seen by the watchful osip of course i know why you did murder him said osip in a low and rapid voice that is you were coerced but what power has jerce over you to make you commit such a crime jerce clarice dropped the snaky twist of her narghile this was the last name she expected to hear yes snapped osip imperiously oh you neednt try to hide his doings ever since frank clarke betrayed me on his deathbedthe scoundreli have been watching jerce but why did you search him asked clarice perplexed osip raised himself angrily on his elbow you will pretend ignorance he said sharply when you know quite well that frank clarke gave jerce the gold box containing the stamp i searched jerce to find it and he had not got it on him i did not know what had become of it but now i am certain that he gave the stamp to you so that you might impress the purple fern on horrans forehead and so make the police believe your murder was of a piece with the other crimes you are quite wrong said clarice keeping her nerves in a wonderful manner considering the terrible communication the gold box was found on the terrace where you had dropped it i did not drop it jerce must have guessed why i was searching him and have flung it aside where is the gold box now jerce took it to scotland yard a clever and daring villain said osip bitterly and the stamp ii dont know where it is it was not in the box no jerce had removed it previously and had given it to you what a fool he was to carry the box about with him when did he give the stamp to you he never did whats the use of denying things cried osip angrily and striking with his clenched fist on the table you were seen in horrans bedroom after two oclock in the morning impressing the purple fern on the body of your victim and that was after clarke had fled mr baird i expect just as you killed horran you heard clarke coming and so concealed yourself when the parson went away afraid lest he should be accused you no doubt came out from your hidingplace and stamped the forehead then you returned to your own room and pretended innocence who told you this zara dumps told me after last night she knew who i was as her mother told her i went to her rooms today and she wanted to have me arrested but i told her that i would accuse her of killing horran for i knew that she accused clarke and had been near the laurels about the time of the murder how did you know that i learned it from clarke himself yes i went down secretly and in disguise to crumel after the murder to learn what had become of the stamp and saw clarke he could not denounce me as i told him that his son frank was concerned in the murders with me zara not only told prudence so as to break off the marriage with you but she also told clarke himself when i learned that zara had been near the house at the time of the crime i saw her today and made her confess she only saw clarke said clarice bravely she never told me that she had seen me i saw her last night zara told you as much as she thought proper said osip in sharp tones but i made her confess the rest after clarke had gone away she stole up to the window and saw you and what you were doing i think also added osip scathingly that she mentioned how you had concealed the stamp she did muttered clarice wondering if zara had betrayed her disguise but osips next words reassured her of course she did you wanted to get out of marrying her and she was forced to make use of her knowledge to make you consent i understand how she coerced you but how did jerce he did not yes he did you never murdered horran of your own free will jerce wanted money i suppose jerce has plenty of money no doubt he earns a lot and he borrows a lot and he steals a lot mr baird why do you try to stand up for jerce i have been watching him for weeks and i have been making enquiries in all sorts of quarters i know much that goes on owing to the faculties i have for discovering things people would rather were kept quiet jerce to the world is a genial philanthropist and a famous physician but you know as i know that he is one of the fastest men in london and a complete scoundrel and under the rose has spent no end of money on worthless women his pretended visits to whitechapel were all bosh he really went on the spree i wonder he has not been found out long ago you must have found him out living in the same house with him mr baird did jerce make you murder horran or did barras barras said clarice still more surprised and wondering how much of this was true the whole story seemed too terrible to be believed barras is quite as bad as jerce as i happen to know i am going to see that lawyer and utilise my knowledge of his shady doings to make him part mr baird england is getting too hot for me so i intend to leave the country but barras and jerce are in league in some way barras is horrans lawyer so their league may have something to do with the property perhaps it has murmured clarice white as a corpse under her mask she felt that it would be impossible to sustain her manly character much longer under these accumulated horrors pah said osip scornfully as he rose to his feet what is the use of pretending you know everything as i do i dont care if you did murder horran as i commit murders myself and have a fellowfeeling for such daring in fact i rather admire you mr baird and if i could remain in england i should propose a partnership since my partners are dead theres heaps of money to be made with the purple fern yet you know what a villain you are cried clarice involuntarily pooh you say that because you are new to the criminal business i am no more a villain than a swindling stockbroker in the city or one of your pious chapelgoing hypocrites who sweat those they employ you must get rid of your conscience if you want to succeed mr baird although i admit that you have made an excellent start it was a clever idea to use the purple fern stamp to shift the murder of horran on to my shoulders i know that i am accused but you know that i am innocent of this crime perhaps but not of others of four others said osip politely i murdered four people clarke murdered one and our third partner who was hanged poor chap killed the remaining two i invented the purple fern murder syndicate so i had to do most of the work stop stop no i must try and harden you as i have taken a fancy to you for your boldness and for your cleverness in using the stamp to implicate me its a pity we cant start the syndicate again with you and jerce and barras upon my word said osip musingly and lighting a cigar it would be a splendid idea and no one would suspect we made heaps of money you know mr baird some of the people we killed were put out of the way by the desire of relatives who paid very largely for the crimes i have saved money myself but have not enough clarkeor exton as he called himselfwas a spendthrift and indulged in swagger things you remember the gold boxa neat design but risky wasnt it clarkes ideapoor ass and the stationery asked clarice recollecting the superfine paper upon which the letters had been written clarkes also but i rather approved of that as i like to do things neatly of course you saw the stamped fern i sent to your guardian mr baird it was a hint that he should look out as i guessed that jerce having the stamp intended business i also sent the letter to ackworth forbidding him to marry your sister unless he wanted to see you in the dock why did you do that i wanted to make miss bairdyour sisterthink that jerce was mixed up with the purple fern business as i guessed that she would recognise the paper of the stamped fern and the paper of my letter to ackworth to be the same you see i have been trying all along to get at jerce and learn why he wished horran killed and how he managed to make use of you besides i want money jerce has money and so has barras i will get large sums from both as soon as i can prove that they are mixed up with horrans murder you committed it so you must confess all if you dont ill leave england but before leaving ill send a note to scotland yard telling the truth then both you and zara will be arrested she is innocent as i am oh she is innocent of course said osip easily but i dare say the police can build up a case against her since she was near the scene of the crime and practically saw you commit the murder she could be brought in as an accomplice after the fact you know did shedid shesee mecommit the crime stammered clarice hoarsely well no but she saw you stamp the corpse and stop for heavens sake stop cried the girl and sick with fear for her miserable brother she fell forward on the turkish table and on her outstretched arms not insensible but nearly so by this time the desert was crowded with people and many were wandering aimlessly here and there near at hand camels were grunting mules squealing arabs shrieking nautchgirls were dancing and the busy glittering life of pleasure hummed everywhere with feverish persistency osip rather amazed at what he took to be bairds unmanly weakness was about to stoop and raise him when he saw ackworth running rapidly forward he did not know the soldier but saw that some man was bearing straight down on him a trapa trap said osip with a glare at clarice and she overheard no no she gasped with a last effort but i am a womanbairds sister damn breathed osip thoroughly taken aback and casting one fearful look around at the people whose attention was now attracted he slipped away amongst the crowd anthony raced up breathless what has he done let me give the alarm he must be clarice clutched his arm desperately and raised herself to her feet no no for my sakefor ferdysfor and then she fainted in earnest the heatthe heat said ackworth sharply to an officious attendant my friendillhealthdelicate boy ill look after him get out clear the way damn you and the crowd accepting the natural excuse fell back chapter xxiv ferdinand baird at bay the next day late in the afternoon clarice sat in the drawingroom of the laurels waiting for the arrival of several people it was a very wet day and the rain beat drowsily against the windows through the streaming panes she could see the dull grey skies the leafless gardens and the soaking lawns dismal and depressing with a sigh the girl thought how the hopeless weather resembled her life at the present moment her brother was in danger of arrest and even if he were not arrested how could she have anything to do with him again when he was practically a murderer even now and in spite of zaras evidence as reported by osip the girl could not bring herself to believe that ferdy had actually struck the blow but only from his own lips could she hear the truththat is if he could be induced to speak it and she was anxiously waiting for him to be brought over from gattlinsands by ackworth until clarice accused him herself she and anthony had arranged that ferdy should be left in ignorance that the secrets of his life had been discovered also a telegram had been sent to sir daniel jerce asking him to come down on especial business and he likewise was ignorant of the true significance of the message finally mr clarke was expected these meetings had been arranged by clarice who could see no other way to clear up the many mysteries which seemed to environ the death of henry horran it was necessary to take some steps to come to some decision and as speedily as possible for it was likely that osip out of revenge for the trick clarice had played him would inform scotland yard of ferdys guilt so clarice clothed in her mourning for the dead man waited in silence and in sorrow never would she forget the return journey on the previous night after being revived by a glass of brandy anthony had taken her at once in a cab to liverpool street station and there they had been fortunate enough to catch a late train to the junction ackworth had telegraphed for a closed brougham and in this he drove with clarice to crumel some miles distant then after he had seen her safely in the hands of mrs rebson he had departed in the fly for gattlinsands promising to bring over ferdy on the afternoon of the ensuing day all that could be done had been done and now clarice waited with a sick heart for the coming interviews with ferdy and jerce both promised to be stormy ones exactly as the clock struck four ferdys voice gay and bright was heard in the hall clarice shuddered as she heard him it was extraordinary to her that ferdy could laugh at all seeing what he had on his conscience but he entered quite gaily smiling and brisk with anthony at his heels looking grave when the boy had kissed his sister he commented on ackworths low spirits gaily i cant make out whats up with anthony said he taking a seat by the fire and poking the coals into a blaze he came back late last night looking like an owl i was playing snooker with flanigan and he didnt even take an interest in the game although i made some ripping shots whats the matter with him you are said clarice indignantly ferdy dropped the poker with a clatter i am he echoed why what do you meanhe glanced at ackworth i say old chap whats the joke have i been doing anything wrong ackworth shrugged his shoulders and walked to the window then he glanced at his watch and mentally noted that jerces train was almost due if ferdy was to be disposed of before the doctor arrived it would be necessary to make him confess at once ferdy eyed anthony in astonishment but no reason for this pointed silence occurred to his shallow brain he turned to his sister i say clarry sit down she commanded harshly what do you mean he flushed up dont speak to me in that way anthony crossed the room rapidly and taking ferdy by the shoulders made him sit down you must not speak to your sister in that manner while i am by he declared sternly you are about to be spoken to in a way you wont like then ill go raged ferdy evading ackworths grip and making for the door how dare you lay hands on mehow dare you if you leave the room ferdy said clarice in a quiet and level voice you will run straight into the hands of the police the young mans face changed immediately to a chalky white and he fell nervelessly into a chair near the door the police he whispered yes said clarice pitilessly for his unmanly terror disgusted her you will probably spend your night in gaol clarice ferdy staggered to his feet violently trembling iiidont know what you mean ackworth gave a low laugh of scorn and strolled to the hearthrug to take up his position before the fire you had better confess he said in his sharp military way confess what oh clarice clenched her hands and her eyes shot fire why will you keep up this pretence you know well enough what you have to confess will you do so here or in the dock in the dock ferdy flung forward halfway across the room i donti never didwhat is itoh clarry you are making a mistake is this a mistake asked his sister and showed him the stamp ferdy was drawn towards it like the ship to the fabled magnetic rocks in the arabian tale wherewhere did you get it he whispered in your roomhidden away and who put itwho hid itwhooh he caught his breaththis is a conspiracy to ruin me zara will ruin you zara jerce will ruin you jerce osip will ruin you osip osip osip only anthony and i can save you tell the truththe whole truth clarryferdy collapsed into a chairii never killed him zara declares that you did she saw you through the window she saw meyesshe told me she saw mebut i was marking the forehead of uncle henry with thathe pointed to the stamp he was dead when i entered the room i swear that he was then you were in uncle henrys room on that night cried clarice springing to her feet with horrorfilled eyes you did stamp his poor flesh with that accursed purple fern oh anthony anthony she rushed towards her lover and caught at him with both hands how can i bear ithow can i bear it disgraceshamemurder ferdy slipped on to the floor and clutched at her dress he was terrified at seeing clarice desert him in this way and whimpered like a child that had been left alone in the dark not murder no no i swear not murder butbutbut he broke down crying and hid his shameful face in his hands sobbing bitterly a silence ensued clarice concealed her face in anthonys breast and he held her tightly to him feeling absolutely helpless under the strain of the moment and feeling also that he was unable to console her in any way the door creaked and swung inward gently under a scratching paw and old jane hobbled into the room on the lookout for afternoon tea seeing ferdy on the ground she went up to him and licked the hands which concealed his face in a mechanical manner he smoothed her head and in the stillness the clock on the mantelpiece could be heard ticking steadily in the pauses of the beating rain anthony was the first to recover his composure we must come to some arrangement before jerce arrives he said jerce ferdy leaped to his feet so unexpectedly that jane ran under the sofa with a howl of dismay jerce he is coming downhe will be here in a few minutes clarice dearhe led her to an armchairsit down and compose yourself i am all right now said clarice in a suffocating voice and calmed her unruly nerves with a violent effort now then ferdy she said in an ominously quiet voice we are waiting for your story how much do you know of it asked the miserable young man as much as zara could tell me said his sister in a sad voice as much as osip knew you have seen osip yes i need not tell you how i came to meet him but he accuses you of the murder of uncle henry and for all i know he may already have given notice to the police what asked ferdy in a grating voice when he is wanted himself and for that crime osip is innocent of this particular crime interposed ackworth then if he did not kill uncle henry i dont know who did declared ferdy his face becoming sullen you will tell lies said clarice between her teeth it is the truth i swear it is the truth tell your story and let us judge said ackworth imperiously and remember that your life is at stake would you betray me we would save you and only by knowing the absolute truth can we save you come baird out with it ferdy stared at the ground and felt that he was being very hardly treated by the two before him he stole a look at their set faces and saw that he would have to lay bare the secrets of his shallow false life a bolder man would have braved the matter out a weaker man would have fainted in the extremity of his terror but ferdy baird half fool half knave acted up to his double characterthat is he told all that could place him in a pleasant light and suppressed what he could but by questioning and browbeating the lovers got the truth out of him at last in substance his story came to this but he told it in a somewhat different way since you must know all he said sullenly and with his eyes on the carpet jerce is the one to blame for the whole trouble and uncle henry is also not a word against him said clarice sternly and placed her hand in that of ackworths for she felt that she needed what solace she could obtain in this hour of sorrow and disgrace uncle henry should have allowed me more money said ferdy doggedly and then i should not have got into trouble with jerce i thought that i would be able to get what i wanted since i was heir to two thousand a year and when i went to london i had a good time a mad timea reckless timea wicked time said clarice that depends upon the way you look at it said the young man i had a ripping time i say but it cost money jerce lent me some because he wanted to marry you clarry and wished me to use my influence to bring about the marriage you never had any influence said clarice while anthony looked at his future brotherinlaw with the air of a man who wished to kick him out of the house jerce thought i had and lent me money but i got into debt i was in love with zara a year ago and she made me spend no end of cash on motordrives and flowers and jewels and all the rest of it but you told me of two thousand pounds ferdy was there more much more i gambled you see and lost heavily on bridge but its no use saying what i did or how i spent the money as i was simply desperate i did not dare to go to uncle henry so i asked jerce again he refused to help me so ii here ferdy kicked a mat with his feet and blurted out the shameful truth unwillingly i forged his cheque for two hundred pounds what clarice nearly fainted you young scoundrel gasped ackworth his face growing red thats right preach away and kick a chap when hes down i didnt exactly forge the name but i altered the figures of a cheque for twenty pounds given me by jerce to one for two hundred so you see i am not quite a forger ended ferdy cheerfully go on commanded anthony curtly and soothed the girl who was weeping bitterly hush clarice darling we have heard the worst now nothing more shameful can be revealed a forger and a murderer cried clarice in agonymy own brother i am neither the one nor the other said ferdy in a brazen manner if youll only listen to me i can explain jerce got the cheque and held it over me as a whip he said that he would put me in gaol if i did not do what he wanted for a long time he left me alone and thenferdy sank his voice to a terrified whisperthen he brought me the stamp of the purple fern and told me that i was to kill uncle henry and stamp his forehead with the fern so that the crime would look like the work of osip and you accepted shrieked clarice with horror i accepted to gain time said ferdy sulkily what else could i do i was in jerces power and could be sent to prison but i never intended to kill uncle henry why did jerce want him killed asked ackworth suddenly well he said that uncle henrys disease puzzled him and that the reason could not be found out unless he was dead and his body was examined it was scientific curiosity pshaw said anthony while clarice heard this explanation with incredulous horror do you mean to tell me that jerce would place his neck in a noose in order to gain surgical knowledge he was going to place my neck in a noose corrected ferdy sulkily and jerce was quite mad about science i found out a lot about his devilries when i lived with him he was a vivisection enthusiast too yes you often wondered clarry why janehe glanced at the dog lying quietly under the sofawhy jane hated jerce so well it was because he started to vivisect her and lamed her leg what a wretch cried clarice trembling with horror oh anthony i cant bear iti cant bear it hush dear hush he sat beside her in the chair and held her in his arms like a mother nursing a babe go on baird he commanded jerce wasnt altogether bad said ferdy grudgingly he let jane go when he found that she wasnt much use as a subject and gave her to you clarry jane jane called the girl faintly and when the dog came she patted the smooth head my poor jane how cruelly you have been treated whereon jane licked the kind hand which caressed her and sat down with her tongue out the picture of happiness well said ferdy after a pause you see how i was placed i had to kill uncle henry or go to gaol through jerce i tried to find out something against jerce that would give me the whip hand of him but he was too clever but i did find out some things jerce used to pretend to go to whitechapel and sometimes he did but usually he changed his dress and went on the spree what do you mean by on the spree asked clarice sharply i shouldnt like to tell you said ferdy with great simplicity for jerce was a terror im no great shakes but jerce was worse he spent money like water on women buying jewels and houses and furniture and dresses and running racehorses and gambling and in fact ended ferdy with an air of fatigue jerce was and is a blackguard and even i dont know everything about him its impossible that a wellknown man like sir daniel jerce could go on in this way said anthony decidedly oh but he did i found lots of shady people who knew him but jerce was clever in covering his trail then barras was in with him good heavens cried clarice in despair are there no good men barras wasnt good he used to lark about also but i think jerce led him away from what i can gather remember dear said anthony bending over clarice we saw them together at the shahs rooms what cried ferdy quickly have you been there never you mind go on with your story you say that jerce wanted uncle henry to be killed so that he might find out the reason for the disease that was the reason jerce gave me and said that it would be a merciful release as uncle henry could not live long but one night i overheard a conversation between barras and jercenot the whole of it but scraps and i gathered that barras was giving jerce some of uncle henrys moneythat is our money oh clarice started to her feet the forty thousand pounds i am beginning to see sir daniel jerce had that money i cant sayim not sure but there was some question of our money being lent for barrasas i heardsaid something about uncle henry becoming suspicious of the business i couldnt exactly make out what was meant ended ferdy but i gathered that the finances of the estateour estatewere wrong i can see said clarice quickly i can understand barras told a lie when he said that he gave uncle henry the forty thousand in gold he gave it to jerce and made uncle henry the scapegoat nothing wrong was ever suspected by poor uncle henry he told me some days before he was murdered that i should find everything in order well you did yes said clarice indignantly because mr barras cooked the accounts and put the blame of the missing thousands on to my poor guardian who could not defend himself the villain and you knew this ferdyyou knew this and did not tell me how could i when i was in jerces power over that bill besides i didnt clearly understand things i only heard bits of the conversation you know go ongo on said ackworth quickly tell us how you committed the murder i did noti did not cried ferdy furiously i swear i am innocent of that crime after christmas jerce said that if i didnt kill uncle henry before the end of the year that he would denounce me he said that if i stamped the corpse with the purple fern everyone would think that osip had killed him then he told me about frank clarke and how he had given him the stamp and the gold box then he did have the gold box asked clarice yes he gave me the stamp but he kept the box in his pocket as he thought it was safest there he feared lest it should be found and lest the amethyst fern on it should give him away when osip attacked him out thereferdy pointed to the terracejerce managed to throw it away and then bamboozled me when i came up about not having osip arrested he dared not cried ferdy tauntingly as osip might have given him away oh great heavens moaned clarice rocking herself to and fro is there much more of this no said her brother quickly im sure i want to end it as much as you do clarry i never intended to kill uncle henry but jerce insisted youve said that several times said anthony impatiently and i say it again i got drunk on that night because jerce worried me so i was quite feverish were you really drunk asked clarice eagerly yes i was mother dumps had been feeding me up with bad champagne in honour of zaras coming home i came back and you locked me in my room clarry i fell asleep and didnt wake up until nearly two oclock in the morning are you sure of the time asked his sister quickly yes i am i lighted the candle and looked at my watch then i drank some water and sat on the bed to think of what i should do i felt jolly miserable i can tell you said ferdy in an aggrieved tone what with all my debts and being in love with prudence and with zara worrying me and with jerce making things hot then i thought that it would be best to go down and see uncle henry and tell him all remembering the conversation of jerce and barras i fancied that the accounts were wrong and that if jerce made it hot for me over the bill that uncle henry could make it hot for jerce i swear cried ferdy again that when i went down the stairs i never intended to lay a hand on the man who had been like a father to me i intended to tell him all and throw myself on his mercy how did you get out when i had locked you in ferdy cast a contemptuous look on her why i had another key of course you locked me in several times and thought that i was safe but i could get out whenever i liked i unlocked the door and went down to see uncle henry in my cloth slippers and dressinggown if you intended no harm asked anthony why did you take the stamp with youthe purple fern stamp i intended to give it to uncle henry and tell him how jerce had got it from frank clarke and the use he intended to make of it well then i went down carefully and opened the bedroom door i thought that uncle henry might be awake but he wasnt he was dead there was a pause are you sure asked clarice in a husky voice i can swear to it he was deadstabbed to the heartwith the bedclothes all disarranged and i very nearly gave the alarm then i thought that as uncle henry was dead all i had to do was to stamp his forehead with the purple fern to get the cheque from jerce into my possession i was about to do so said ferdy frankly while his sister groaned at this fresh instance of callous wickedness when i heard a noise outside and slipped under the bed why on earth did you do that demanded anthony bluntly it was very natural protested ferdy sulkily i was afraid lest the murderer should return and kill me and of course i didnt want anyone to see me beside the dead body of uncle henry considering the circumstances i fancied chalks might be coming and dreaded lest i should get into trouble as i had no business in the room at that time oh there were plenty of reasons for me to make myself scarce well and was it chalks said clarice tapping her foot impatiently no it wasnt old clarke came in at the window calling softly on uncle henry i heard his voice and peeped out to see him he nearly squealed when he spotted the body so i dont think that he is guilty then he groaned and prayed and for some reason arranged the bedclothes smoothly afterwards he cut as hard as he could frightened out of his life as i was in a few minutes i crept out and stamped the corpses forehead which was the only thing i could do to put myself square with jerce when i crept upstairs and locked myself again in my room i thought that everything was safe but it wasnt grumbled ferdy apparently thinking himself aggrieved zara was knocking about and spotted me through the window she made me break off with prudence by threatening to tell the police i said that prudence wouldnt let me off but zara said she could manage that and she did too by telling the poor girl that mr clarke had committed the crime which i swear he hadnt finished ferdy generously is that all questioned clarice when he ended out of breath what more do you wish me to say asked ferdy indignantly im not to blame as i couldnt help uncle henry being killed and i never forged the chequethat is the name you know clarryi only altered the figures a little and i swear i never stabbed uncle henry but just stamped him with the fern that was an abominable thing to do cried ackworth angrily i dont see that said the young man obstinately what did it matter when uncle henry was dead i had to get even with jerce and save myself somehow and i did too jerce when he came for the postmortem and saw the stamp on the forehead gave me back the cheque right enough and i burnt it so no one can harm me in that way i think you are making a great row over nothing ended ferdy in an injured tone as i am quite innocent clarice looked at anthony and anthony at clarice in despair both of them were amazed at the callous view ferdy took of the case he really did not seem to be aware of the enormity of his fault and looked upon his crimesfor crimes they wereas merely mistakes of ordinary life perhaps anthonyfor clarice was too heartbroken to speakwould have proceeded to lecture ferdy on his iniquities but that a ring came to the front door jane at miss bairds feet raised her head and ackworth went to the drawingroom door when he opened it the cheerful bland voice of sir daniel jerce was heard remarking on the bad weather to mrs rebson at once jane began to growl and she flew across the room anthony catch her cried clarice and the young man had only time to grip jane by the scruff of the neck and swing her aside when the doctor entered the room jerce looked quiet and smiling and apparently had no idea of the danger of his position he laughed when he saw jane snapping and snarling with blazing eyes the picture of impotent wrath i really wonder why that dog hates me so said sir daniel shrugging she knows you better than we do retorted clarice sternly chapter xxv the whole truth sir daniel looked surprised when he heard clarices remark and glanced from her to ferdy he saw that both brother and sister were white and troubled but feeling absolutely safe he never ascribed their emotion to anything connected with himself advancing to the fire he warmed his hands and smiled more blandly than ever i should think you should know me by this time miss baird he said cheerfully wet weather isnt it clarice said nothing and ferdy evaded the eye of jerce while anthony having put jane out into the garden returned and closed the drawingroom door considering what was to be said it was best as he thought to keep the conversation as private as possible the doctor also noted that ackworth looked stern and white by this time he showed a slight uneasiness as trouble was too palpably in the air for him to ignore it perhaps some thought of betrayal crossed his mind for he suddenly looked apprehensively at young baird ferdy dodged his eye again and the doctor to break an oppressive silence made an uneasy joke you are all very quiet said he smiling in a wry way is it because i have forgotten my manners and have not shaken hands i ask all your pardons and will do so now miss baird no said clarice putting her hands behind her back and i wonder that you have the assurance even to speak to me considering that you asked me down that is a strange speech said jerce frowning and losing his suave looks i thought that you were satisfied with my assurance that i never wrote that anonymous letter of which you complained i know that you did not write it in that case i shall be glad to know why you greet me in this way said jerce in icy tones is it that captain ackworth is angry with me because i dared to love you no said anthony in his turn and to save you further surmises as to what is the matter allow me to inform you dr jerce sir daniel if you please interrupted the other his large face becoming watchful and cunning give me my proper title i can do that said clarice who was restraining her wrath with great difficulty you are a scoundrel indeed said jerce blanching and wincing but maintaining his composure in a most wonderful manner considering the provocation i regret that you should call an old friend by so harsh a name an old friend who plotted the death of its a lie broke in jerce with a sudden flash of rage i never intended horran any harm by your own mouth you are condemned said anthony quickly miss baird never mentioned names why should you think that she meant mr horran i ask you because horran is dead and death was mentioned said jerce striving to extricate himself from the difficulty perhaps you will explain why i have been asked here to be insulted would you rather that the police insulted you asked anthony coldly you speak in riddles captain ackworth i think you can answer them sir daniel i fear that i cannot rejoined jerce shrugging but with all his calmness an air of fear pervaded his whole bearing and his cold eyes glanced uneasily from one person to another will you explain the meaning of all this ferdinand he said addressing himself to the one person in the room who had not yet spoken i have explained said ferdy half afraid and half defiantly they know everything concerning what asked jerce wincing again but still selfcontrolled clarice and anthony know the whole business cried the young man his voice loud and angry as he strove to assert himself in the presence of the man he so greatly feared i have told them how you got the purple fern stamp and how you tried to make me kill uncle henry there you can say what you like now sir daniels nostrils dilated and his eyes grew hard you are talking nonsense i think he said perfectly calmly nonsense stormed ferdy quailing under those stern eyes it is not nonsense and you know it i have had quite enough of being bullied by you jercehe did not pay him the compliment of a respectful use of the great mans title you have been my master too long it is my turn now and who are you to dictate to meyou who lead a fast life who squander money who play fast and loose with women of the worst stop cried jerce so loudly that the young mans voice died away remember that your sister is present my character is high enough to need no denial to the charges you bring against it the king does not honour men such as you have described with knighthoods ah you have always been clever enough to keep things dark said ferdy bitterly but i overheard you talking to barras i know that you were in league with him to cheat uncle henry out of our money and the forty thousand pounds went into you lieyou lie interrupted the doctor losing his temper and a perspiration broke out on his high bald forehead you know that you lie you cant prove a word you say barras can and barras will barras will not send for barras now i appearl to you miss baird i appeal to you captain ackworth my character is at stake i demand that you telegraph to london for barras that he may be confronted with this young liar i am not afraid to face the truth the doctor spoke so bravely and so fiercely that for the moment anthony and clarice wavered in their belief of ferdys story they knew well that ferdy was a supreme liar and on the face of it sir daniel jerces character had always been above reproach the doctor saw that he had made an impression and followed up his advantage swiftly and vehemently that ferdinand should accuse me is no surprise he went on in a ringing voice i have done so much for him that it is natural he should be ungrateful i have always found that those i have helped have been my worst enemies ferdinand is indebted to me for money for advice for education and for liberty for liberty echoed clarice drawing near to the speaker yes that young whelp received a cheque from me for twenty pounds as a loan he altered the figures and the writing to two hundred pounds with a cleverness which would have done credit to an accomplished forger i could have put him in gaol but i forgave him and this ingratitude is my reward one moment ferdy said clarice checking her brothers speech with a gesture where is the forged cheque sir daniel jerce was taken aback i gave it to ferdinand he said sullenly you did when you could have used it to stop his evil doings i wished to give him another chance of reforming protested jerce you liar shouted ferdy beside himself with rage you gave me the cheque after i had stamped uncle henrys dead body with the purple fern according to your directions yes said jerce rashly losing his selfcontrol and after you had murdered your guardian i did not i did not on what grounds do you base this accusation jerce asked ackworth on the grounds that felix exton the young man who died in tea street whitechapel gave me the stamp of the purple fern you never said that before there was no need i never said so because ferdinand stole the stamp from me and i thought that he might make use of it horran was angry with him and ferdinand wished to get rid of him thinking that he would then come into the money i base my accusation upon the fact that the purple fern was stamped on my poor friends forehead and only ferdinand who possessed the stamp could have done that for your sake miss baird i have held my peace cruelly though you have treated me but now when ferdinand seeks to throw the blame of his wickedness on me i must speak out to protect myself if need be i shall go to the police and tell all that i know i am not a man to be defied with impunity the clever turn which the doctor gave to ferdys story startled clarice as she saw how dangerous the man was and to what lengths he was prepared to go to save his own skin you had the gold box she said rather weakly pardon me osip dropped that when he searched me he denies that he said that you had the box for which he was looking and threw it away osip says thatand how comes it that you have seen osip i saw him by appointment at the shahs rooms last night said clarice boldly and there i also saw you and mr barras what of that said jerce coolly i have a right to go to any place i choose i should hope so you saw osip and you did not have him arrested for the murder of your guardian you forget said anthony swiftly you have just accused ferdinand of that crime sir daniel and i do still ferdinand is osips accomplice both of them are concerned in the matter and i am accused falsely there is no one can prove that i am guilty in any way a knock came to the door and mrs rebson made her appearance will you please to come out here miss she said there is a gentleman wants to see you sir daniel wriggled uneasily and went a shade whiter but he still maintained his defiant attitude while clarice wondering who had come to visit her and anticipating fresh trouble with a sinking heart went into the hall closing the drawingroom door after her here she found mr clarke looking more wild and wan than ever and very much agitated on seeing her he came up at once while mrs rebson discreetly withdrew to her own room is it true that sir daniel jerce is here asked clarke abruptly yes i sent for him to clear up things why did you not come in i dont wish to see sir daniel said clarke nervously he has behaved very badly to me he threatened to tell about something connected with aaaa relative ended clarke evasively clarice knew as well as if he had spoken openly that the vicar referred to his scapegoat son however it was not her aim to frighten clarke away by pretending to know too much so she merely picked up some newly arrived letters from the hall table as she replied you must come in and face sir daniel jerce she said quietly we are bringing him to book bringing him to book what do you mean go in and youll hear said clarice and was about to usher the vicar into the room when she caught sight of the writing on one of the letters go ingo in she said hurriedly ill follow shortly rather perplexed and not at all anxious to face jerce the vicar approached the drawingroom door with hesitating steps there he glanced back and saw clarice hurriedly reading a letter with a white face and an agitated manner for the moment he was inclined to return but gathering his courage together he boldly opened the door and saw sir daniel jerce facing ferdy defiantly you can say what you like were the words which struck the parsons ear but you know that i am as innocent of horrans death as you are guilty you stabbed him you no cried clarke coming forward rapidly what do you mean sir daniel by accusing this young man of such a crime jerce wheeled and his eyes flashed when he beheld clarke the vicar had quite thrown aside his nervous hesitating manner and with an unflinching face he looked at the great doctor anthony anticipating some fresh revelation rose from his seat while ferdy stared openmouthed at prudences father he had never seen the vicar look so bold i accuse him said jerce with a snarl and keeping his hard eyes firmly on the weak face of the parson because he is guilty not of murder i swear not of murder there you see cried ferdy triumphantly i never killed uncle henry you did said jerce fiercely i defy clarke to contradict me i do contradict you remember clarke what i know said jerce menacingly know said the vicar despairingly yes you know and you have made use of what you know to make me act unjustly towards ferdinand i should have had him for a soninlaw but for you and my poor girl would have been happy i held my peace because you threatened to expose my unhappy sons guilt but i shall do so no longer i refuse to stand by and see ferdinand accused of murder your own son is a murderer said jerce savagely ah said anthony significantly so you knew that he knew it and he threatened me with it he wanted to let all the world know that felix exton was frank clarke cried the vicar and ifor my daughters sakeheld my peace about what asked anthony quickly take care clarketake care said jerce despairingly i take care no longer said the parson fiercely i have told my sons shame here and if necessary i shall tell it to all the world rather than let ferdinand suffer unjustly he did not murder horran then who did asked clarice entering swiftly and standing with her back to the door clarke pointed to the doctor sir daniel jerce you liar foamed the accused man i saw you in your motor coming along by the common during my midnight walk said clarke rapidly i saw you hide the motor in the woods i followed you secretly to the house you entered by the window and i stole up to see you kill horran with the assegai which you tore from the wall you fled and i ran after you i caught you in the lane near the wood and accused you then you told me that frank was a murdererone of the purple fern gangand swore to denounce him dead though he was unless i held my peace i did soyes god help mei did so and concealed your wickedness to save the good name of my dead son while osip was accused i still held my peace for another murder set down to him mattered little but now that you accuse ferdinand i say boldly and i will say it to the police that you and none other murdered henry horran its false gasped jerce quailing and shrinking and looking towards the window as though anxious to escape it is true after i left you i went back to the room that was when i was under the bed said ferdy quickly were you i did not know but you are innocent my poor boy i arranged the bedclothes and then returned home zara dumps accused me and i said nothing although i knew the truth but there stands the murderer he pointed to jerce who trembled go for the police no no cried sir daniel ghastly white let me go i promise to destroy myself anything rather than public shame ill have you in gaol tonight said ferdy triumphantly take care snarled jerce if i killed horran you stamped the fern on the forehead of the dead ill swear that you were my accomplice clarice cried ferdy gasping with fear you hear i hear and i know how to act said clarice calm and white anthony have you pen and ink and paper there they are she indicated a rosewood desk in the corner of the drawingroom sit down and write what sir daniel says what would you do asked ackworth obeying her i would save ferdy and hang jerce cried ferdy viciously hold your tongue cried his sister harshly sir daniel she added turning towards the miserable doctor if you will confess your crime and sign the confession you shall leave this house free no no no cried anthony from the desk you are wrong i am right insisted the girl with such a confession we are safe ferdy will say nothing neither will mr clarke i shall hold my tongue so long as ferdinand is not arrested for a crime he never committed said the parson and so long as franks good name is saved frank was an evil man but he was also my son confess then said clarice to jerce he wiped his brow and accepted the situation without argument it was impossible for him to face the direct evidence of clarke i thank you for the chance of escape he said to the girl quietly and i promise you that tonight i shall die i will not live to run the risk of being hanged write captain ackworth and i shall sign anthony dipped the pen into the ink and waited ferdy sat down mr clarke leaned against the wall listening intently and clarice determined not to let jerce go until the confession was signed stood with her back to the door sir daniel cast a glance around and composing himself with a mighty effort which showed the strong nature of the man he began to speak quietly i did murder horran he said slowly and for two reasons one was that i wished to learn the nature of the disease which he suffered from and that could only be made plain by a postmortem examination the other and more ignoble motive was that i was in league with barras to get money out of him then you had the forty thousand pounds inquired clarice quickly and more answered the doctor coolly i have a double naturea jekyl and hyde nature as in stevensons wonderful story as sir daniel jerce i have won my position by brain power and hard work and am a philanthropist and a reasonable man but as daniel jerce the creature i am devoured by passions and am capable of lowering myself to the level of the beasts my life in harley street was and is above reproachbut my other life oh cried clarice with sudden horror ferdy has told us something of that say no moreits too terrible jerce bowed you have been so kind miss baird that your wish is my law he said politely well then for my secret life i required money i made much and spent it and i wanted more horran being only your guardian and not having money of his own was too honest to help me barras came to me years and years ago to be cured of a disease i did cure him and he was grateful he lent me his own money for a time but i still wanted more then he lent me some that belonged to the estate when i was in difficulties and he lent it out of sheer gratitude to me dont blame barras miss baird he was as good a man as was henry horran but to make a long story short from the moment barras tampered with the trust money he was in my power and i threatened to tell horran unless i received more blackmail muttered anthony with disgust and swiftly writing yes i told you that the jekyl side of my character was unpleasant captain ackworth well then barras cooked the accounts i thought soi said so muttered clarice then you are very clever said jerce calmly for barras managed to conceal things in a wonderful way of course when horran became ill and gave barras a power of attorney it was easier to deceive him and barras also deceived you miss baird clever as you thought you were your ignorance of business helped him i quite understand said clarice coldly a girl such as i am was unequal to such clever scoundrels you got the money and i spent it said jerce coolly forty thousand pounds barras gave me the money as it came in and used some himself he made up the story about giving it to horran in gold so that we might be deceived interposed miss baird well we were oh dont blame yourself said jerce in a jeering manner barras would have cheated a much more clever person than you are miss baird with the facilities at his commandhorrans illness the power of attorneyno one to interfere and all the rest of it spare me more details sir daniel you got the forty thousand pounds and spent it then you determined to kill uncle henry i did because he was getting dangerous barras according to horrans wish had given clarke here one thousand poundsbut on his own account he charged ten per cent clarke tried to see horran but to keep back that fact i used my medical power as horrans physician to prevent an interview but i did see him at length said the vicar triumphantly yes snapped jerce and so sealed horrans death warrant do you remember on the day preceding the murder that i had an interview with horran he asked turning to clarice yes and you said that uncle henry was angry with ferdy he was angry with barras and declared that he would get the accounts looked into by a clever city man i knew that was fatal barras and i could deceive horran and you but we couldnt hope to deceive this accountant who was mentioned i then determined to prevent the exposure by murdering horran you villain cried clarice shuddering your old friend he would have been my new enemy had he learned the truth about the accounts said jerce cynically however we must get on he looked at his watch it is getting late well then i went up to town having arranged with ferdinand here that he should kill horran and stamp his forehead with the purple fern i need not tell you how i got that miss baird i know she replied with horror but were you arranging a deliberate murder with my brother when anthony and i saw you walking to the station yes you were driving i believe ferdinand agreed to kill i did interrupted ferdy quickly but i intended to tell uncle henry everything i never intended murder so i thought said jerce with a shrug you are such a weak fool that i fancied you would flinch at the last moment that was why i came down during the night i pretended to go to whitechapel and did not take my chauffeur which was often the case no suspicion was thus aroused in harley street as to my destination i motored down to crumel in a little over two hours and acted in the way clarke here has told you but the murder i expected to find horran dead said jerce and yet knowing what a weak fool this boy is i feared lest he should fail i entered by the window which that ass of a wentworth had ordered to be opened as i knew he would and horran raised himself in bed he recognised me and unable to explain my intrusion i caught an assegai from the wall and stabbed him to the heart he cried out but only feebly then i ran away and clarke caught me i kept him quiet by saying that i would tell about frank afterwards i motored back to town in another two hours and a trifle more and regained my house in safety oh you villain said clarice again striking her hands together next day as you know i came down and played my part in the comedy miss baird i saw the mark of the purple fern and ferdinand here told me how he had stamped the dead body i gave him back my cheque and so acted honourably so that is all unless added jerce with hesitation my love for youmy true and genuine love oh no no cried clarice with horror and ran across to anthony have you got it written down then let that wretch sign it and send him out of the house but the police ought to be told said ackworth in a low voice i say no cried clarice stamping her foot i will tell you why at a later period sign sir daniel sign and rid this house of your wicked presence jerce looked at her gravely then deliberately signed the paper on the spot pointed out by ackworth anthony and clarke signed as witnesses and then the soldier handed the paper to clarice who thrust it into her bosom this having been done she went to the window and opened it go she said to sir daniel surely you will let me get my coat and hat he said quietly and with a last look at her he went into the hall shortly he appeared at the door again goodbye for ever he said in an unemotional voice ill go this wayby the front door and tomorrow you shall hear of my death unhappy man cried clarke do not add sin to sin but jerce was gone he went out of the house and into the gathering darkness of the nightbut not to the merciful death he designed for himself as he passed through the gate jane limped after him quietly not barking as was her custom she seemed to know that her time had come and so jerce all unknowingly went to his doom chapter xxvi nemesis hardly had sir daniel jerce disappeared when clarice dropped like a log to the ground the strain had been too much for her and for the second time in her life she fainted anthony hastily summoned mrs rebson and the poor girl was taken up to her room then captain ackworth left the house business must go on in spite of all untoward events and he was forced to return to gattlinsands and to his duties but before leaving he told mrs rebson that he would come over the next day and then addressed himself to ferdy you had better remain in the house he said coldly as it will be necessary for clarice and myself to arrange tomorrow about your future you have escaped a great danger and everything must be made safe for your sisters sake i can arrange my own future thank you said ferdy haughtily you will do exactly what you are told said ackworth stern and unbending or else i shall inform the police you would not darefor clarices sake for her sake i would dare you have made her life miserable for years and i wont permit you to spoil it any longer also i wish to avoid a public scandal if osip holds his tongue this may be done but my forbearance depends entirely upon your obeying orders but clarry will rage at me all the evening whimpered ferdy now very afraid for his skin let me go to the vicarage yes interposed the vicar let him come with me and see prudence now there is no bar to the marriage what cried ackworth recoiling would you have a scamp like this for your soninlaw im not a scamp cried ferdy furiously clarke raised his hand mildly my own son is worse than this boythat is he was worse seeing that he is dead frank was a murderer so who am i to blame ferdinand for his wickedness he is all right if he is kept in the strait way and prudence shall do this oh anthony was too disgusted for words would you force the girl to marry him no but he shall tell prudence everything the acceptance or refusal shall rest with her you hear cried ferdy in triumph other people are not so hard on me as you and clarry are can i go to the vicarage yes said ackworth seeing the hopelessness of bringing ferdy to a sense of his sins go and for heavens sake never let me see you again you are worse than a villain ferdyyou are a fool and he walked out wondering how a girl like clarice ever came to have such a blackguard for a brother the next morning clarice rose feeling as though a black cloud had been lifted from her life things were bad certainly but they were not so bad as they had been she dressed herself with great care and ate a good breakfast in her room ferdy had sent up to ask her to come down to the meal but she felt that she could not sit opposite to him again like anthony she wished to see the last of ferdy even though he was her twin brother when she was getting ready to go downstairs and meet ackworth who was expected at eleven oclock mrs rebson rushed in oh deary meoh deary me she cried wringing her hands what bad news miss claricewhat dreadful news what is it now asked the girl quietly she had received so many shocks that one more or less mattered little has ferdy hes all right missthe darling boy you have saved him though what you had to save him from i dont know and he wont tell his own dear nanny better not ask mrs rebson said clarice with a weary sigh but your newswhat is it that doctor and jane dr jerce yes loveysir daniel as was oh he is dead i quite expected to hear that mrs rebson stared you expected to hear that sir daniel was torn in pieces by jane she asked incredulously what clarice could scarcely believe her ears its true miss you know that jane always hated sir daniel though why she did so i know why said clarice thinking of the vivisection go on well then miss jane followed sir daniel when he went away last night the groomthomassaw her this morning he found her with her jaws all over blood footsore and weary as though she had come a long way and shes been stabbed in the side with a penknife miss as the woundsthree of themare so small well well asked clarice impatiently while mrs rebson stopped for sheer want of breath what has this to do with sir daniel whats it got to do with him screeched the housekeeper sitting down why miss news has just come by a couple of labourers that the body of sir daniel has been found on barnes common fifteen miles away with his throat tore out and the poor man as dead as a herring it is thought that the dog did it since she hated him and the police are coming in an hour to make enquiries its impossible said clarice hardly able to believe that jane had thus revenged herself on her enemy sir daniel went up to london by the train no miss he didnt begging your pardon mrs dumps saw him at the gate hesitating and he really did walk towards the high street on his way to the station may be but then he changed his mind and went down the lane she saw him pass and jane following him as good as gold no doubt he walked on to barnes common and there jane killed him oh aint it dreadful cried mrs rebson again wringing her wrinkled hands the domestic prophet never said anything like that clarice did not reply she wondered why jerce had walked he must have seen the dog who hated him follow but perhaps because jane limpedthe doctors own workhe did not think that she was dangerous and it might be that jerce intended to kill himself in the open instead of in his harley street house but be this as it may jerce was dead and jane had killed him no doubt she had followed persistently all that long way and having been left behind jerce had sat down to rest clarice could picture the grim yelloweyed dog stealing up in the dark night to the unsuspecting man seated on some dripping bench on the common she could picture the silent spring the closing of those long white teeth on jerces fat throat and then the end with the dead body lying on the soaking ground and the dog trailing home weary but satisfied with bloodstained jaws truly jerce had not escaped punishment after all and the gods had brought home his crime to him in a terrible way master ferdy wants to see you deary said mrs rebson after she had expressed her conviction that jane would be shot and had mentioned twice her wonder that a limping dog should have caught up with a smart walker i am coming down now said the girl quietly and leaving mrs rebson to shake her head over the wickedness of jane she went into the breakfastroom where ferdy was impatiently waiting for her clarry have you heard the news he asked shaking a newspaper dont call me that said clarice coldly i have done with you ferdinand you are not worthy to be my brother dont go on like that clarice said the young man struck to the heart by the stiff way in which she addressed him im in such trouble that osip will tell the police about my having the stamp and then ill be arrested you deserve the worst that can befall you ferdinand but osip hes arrested and barras is dead clarice sat down how many more tragedies was she to hear of ferdy pointed out a sensational heading in the daily planet see jercehave you heard clarryhas been killed by jane and now osip has killed barras their crimes have come home to them and your crimes ought to come home to you cried clarice feeling sick with ferdys egotism you areyou arebut i cant say what you are your wickedness and weakness are beyond the power of language to express how did osip kill mr barras ferdy grew sulky and apparently regarded himself as a very illused person osip went to barras office yesterday to get money out of him and barras kicked at the idea osip then murdered him and rifled the safe with keys taken from barras pocket he stamped the purple fern on barras forehead and was cutting with the money when someone came into the room the alarm was given and osip fled down the street with everyone after him a policeman caught him and now he is in gaol and i dare say hell give me away lamented ferdy selfishly so hard on me just when everything is settled nicely prudence has promised to marry me and prudence cried clarice starting to her feet and throwing down the daily planet which she was reading does she know what you are yes said ferdy sulkily and she knows that i am not a bad sort either her brother was a murderer so she says that im not so bad as he was and mr clarke thinks the same but we dont want to stop in crumel after we are married mr clarke says he will come with us to australia i think i shall like that ended ferdy musingly i hear its a ripping climate clarice looked at him helplessly it seemed impossible to do anything with this blind fool however she made an attempt to frighten him i suppose you forget that you may be arrested if osip speaks oh clarry you must stop that said ferdy imploringly i know im not so good as i might be but there are worse than i amjerce for instance look what a bad oh be silent said clarice in sheer despair and listen you are in no danger of arrest do you know why i allowed sir daniel jerce to leave yesterday after he had signed the confession no but im glad you did as if he had been arrested he might have turned nasty quite so well then i received a letter when i went to meet mr clarke in the hall it was from osip he said that because i had been so brave in trying to save you by meeting him at the shahs rooms and because i had not told the police about him that he would acknowledge that he was guilty of uncle henrys death no said ferdy delighted what a good chap but why ugh said his sister her teeth on edge with ferdys joy osip can easily take a fifth murder on his conscience since he will certainly be hanged for the other four you can make yourself easy ferdinand osip will plead guilty to jerces crime and as the police and the public already believe in his guilt no enquiries will be made sir daniel jerces wickedness will never be discovered noras i will not move in the matterwill the defalcations of mr barras come to light the world will say that two good men are gone and osip will be hanged while poor jane will be shot for having killed a villain who thoroughly deserved his doom so clarice spoke and afterevents proved that she was a true prophetess jane was shot osip was hanged keeping silence to the end out of some odd admiration for her bravery in facing him and the notices about jerce and barras were all that could be desired in the way of praising their good deeds and wonderful lives and amiable dispositions there was something ironical about the whole business and not the least ironical part was that ferdy should be happy when he deserved punishment there was only one danger namely that zara dumps sooner than lose ferdy might reveal what she knew and thus reopen the business but when anthony came an hour later to see clarice he found her alone and was enabled to set her mind at rest on this point i am late explained anthony when the two were seated on the old familiar sofa because i have been seeing mrs dumps and her daughter is zara in crumel yes she came yesterday as she is not acting just now a new man to play the part of the chrysalis has to be obtained and zara finds some difficulty in getting the person she wants i have explained to her that she and her mother must hold their tongues unless zara wants to get into trouble in what way asked clarice quickly can you see zara could get into trouble for not having given the alarm when she saw ferdyas she thoughtkill horran then again the mere fact that osip was in zaras company is suspicious i have made it clear that ferdy is innocent and that jerce was guilty and that now the doctor and barras are dead and osip is arrested the best thing will be for zara to give up ferdy and hold her tongue for her own sake and for her mothers and what does she say she has agreed and so has mrs dumps they will neither of them say a single word but mrs dumps has such a long tongue about other peoples affairs but about her own she can be silent enough you need have no fear clarice the purple fern murders are at an end with the death of barras but it is strange dearest that osip should act in this way towards me said clarice who had explained the letter anthony agreed i cant understand the mans nature he said except that we are told that everything evil has some good in it i suppose he was touched by your devotion to ferdy i suppose he was said clarice wearily but now anthony you must see the new lawyershe gave him the nameand arrange everything for me send ferdy to australia with prudence i never wish to see him again i am so sick and tired and illohshe put her arms round his neck and placed her cheek against hisi am illi am very very ill and she was anthony had to carry her to her room and there she lay for three weeks between life and death wentworth said that she had narrowly escaped an attack of brain fever but the devotion of mrs rebson brought her successfully back to health yet for weeks she was still weak although out of danger and anthony would not allow her to talk of the past she never asked for ferdy although the brother she had been devoted to never put in an appearance ackworth saw the new lawyer and arranged the affairs of the estate and made all provisions for his marriage six months later they were married very quietly in the parish church of anthonys native town and went for the honeymoon to switzerland there one day while sitting on the mountains above les avants watching the grey peak of jaman soaring into the cloudless summer sky clarice heard all that her husband knew about the conclusion of the troubles which had begun with the death of horran ferdy is in australia as you know darling said the loverhusband and is married to prudence mr clarke writes me that ferdy is behaving very well and is studying for a doctor mr clarke himself has got a church up the country in victoria i think everything is right there he is getting the five hundred a year as you arranged my dear when he is twentyfive of course he will get the two thousand and let us hope he will be more sensible i hope so sighed mrs ackworth but ferdy is a most extraordinary character he never seems to think that he is in the wrong well a wife like prudence will keep him straight then osip as you know is dead no noclarice clung to her husbanddont talk of such things in this place anthony i never wish to hear the mans name again i wont mention it said anthony gravely but for your peace of mind dear i may tell you that he held his tongue to the last everyone thinks that osip killed horran as he killed barras and jerce is looked upon as a martyr would you like me to read his obituary notices i kept them no i dont wish to hear but there are two things i should like to know added clarice thoughtfully firstly how you fancied that you saw uncle henry at the shahs rooms oh ferdy informed me that barras masqueraded as his client so as to deceive people into thinking that mr horran was spending the money and that his illness was a blind for profligacy what a wretch mr barras was well he is dead so well forgive him now said clarice secondly how did zara know that the stamp was hidden in ferdys bedroom she made him tell her where he had put it replied anthony you know how weak ferdy was clarice sighed it is weak people who usually get into trouble she said and know no escape has zara held her tongue yes and they saythe press says i meanthat she is going to marry a wealthy american for her own sake she will be silent i dont think we need worry any more about that past i am glad of that anthony it is more pleasant to look forward to a bright and quiet future but i still worry about ferdy after all he is my twin brother you know dont trouble about him sweetest he is not worth it and you may be sure that he never gives you a thought well said mrs ackworth gravely i dont know that i mind i have you and you are my world but theres only one thing anthonyill never wear purple however fashionable it may become ackworth laughed at this truly feminine speech and you will never look at this again he said teasingly picking a fern ugh said clarice and catching it from his hand she flung it down on the sunny grass therethe past is gone with that the purple fern has gone with the green fern said anthony well let it go darling heart you and i are together for ever and ever and ever said clarice nestling in his arms amen breathed the husband piously and truly meant it finis clarke

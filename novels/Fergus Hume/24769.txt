a small income a small estate and a mind considerably smaller than either he dwelt at wargrove in essex and spent his idle hours of which he possessed a daily and nightly twenty four in snarling at his faded wife and in snapping between whiles at his son mrs beecot having been bullied into old age long before her time accepted sour looks and hard words as necessary to god's providence but paul a fiery youth resented useless nagging he owned more brain power than his progenitor and to this favoring of nature paterfamilias naturally objected paul also desired fame which was likewise a crime in the fire side tyrant's eyes as there were no other children paul was heir to the beecot acres therefore their present proprietor suggested that his son should wait with idle hands for the falling in of the heritage in plain words mr beecot coming of a long line of middle class loafers wished his son to be a loafer also again when mrs beecot retired to a tearful rest her bully found paul a useful person on whom to expend his spleen should this whipping boy leave mr beecot would have to forego this enjoyment as servants object to being sworn at without cause for years mr beecot indulged in bouts of bad temper till paul finding twenty five too dignified an age to tolerate abuse announced his intention of storming london as a scribbler the parents objected in detail mrs beecot after her kind dissolved in tears and made reference to young birds leaving the nest while her husband puffed out like a frog and redder than the wattles of a turkey cock exhausted himself in well chosen expressions paul increased the use of these by fixing a day for his departure the female beecot retired to bed with the assistance of a maid burnt feathers and sal volatile and the male as a last and clinching argument figuratively buttoned up his pockets not one shilling will you get from me said beecot senior with the graceful addition of vigorous adjectives i don't ask for money said paul keeping his temper for after all the turkey cock was his father i have saved fifty pounds not out of my pocket money he added hastily seeing further objections on the way i earned it by writing short stories the confounded mercantile instinct snorted paterfamilias only he used stronger words your mother's uncle was in trade thank heaven none of my people ever used hands or brains the beecots lived like gentlemen i should say like cabbages from your description father no insolence sir how dare you disgrace your family writing tales indeed rubbish i expect here several adjectives and you took money i'll be bound eh eh i have just informed you that i took all i could get said beecot junior quietly i'll live in town on my savings when i make a name and a fortune i'll return never never gobbled the turkey cock if you descend to the gutter you can wallow there i'll cut you out of my will very good sir that's settled let us change the subject but the old gentleman was too high spirited to leave well alone he demanded to know if paul knew to whom he was talking inquired if he had read the bible touching the duties of children to their parents instanced the fact that paul's dear mother would probably pine away and die and ended with a pathetic reference to losing the prop of his old age paul listened respectfully and held to his own opinion in defence of the same he replied in detail i am aware that i talk to my father sir said he with spirit you never allow me to forget that fact if another man spoke to me as you do i should probably break his head i have read the bible and find therein that parents owe a duty to their children which certainly does not include being abused like a pick pocket my mother will not pine away if you will leave her alone for at least three hours a day and as to my being the prop of your old age your vigor of language assures me that you are strong enough to stand alone paterfamilias never bearded before hastily drank a glass of port the two were enjoying the usual pleasant family meal when the conversation took place and said but it is useless to detail his remarks they were all sound and no sense in justice to himself and out of pity for his father paul cut short the scene by leaving the room with his determination unchanged mr beecot thereupon retired to bed and lectured his wife on the enormity of having brought a parricide into the world having been countered for once in his life with common sense he felt that he could not put the matter too strongly to a woman who was too weak to resent his bullying early next day the cause of the commotion not having swerved a hair's breadth from the path he had marked out took leave of his mother and a formal farewell of the gentleman who described himself as the best of fathers beecot senior turkey cock and tyrant was more subdued now that he found bluster would not carry his point but the wave of common sense came too late paul departed bag and baggage and his sire swore to the empty air even mrs beecot was not available as she had fainted once paul was fairly out of the house paterfamilias announced that the glory of israel had departed removed his son's photograph from the drawing room and considered which of the relatives he had quarrelled with he should adopt privately he thought he had been a trifle hard on the lad and but for his obstinacy which he called firmness he would have recalled the prodigal but that enterprising adventurer was beyond hearing and had left no address behind him beecot the bully was not a bad old boy if only he had been firmly dealt with so he acknowledged that paul had a fine spirit of his own inherited from himself and prophesied incorrectly he'll come back when the fifty pounds is exhausted said he in a kind of dejected rage and when he does a clenched fist shaken at nothing terminated the speech and showed that the leopard could not change his spots so paul beecot repaired to london and after the orthodox fashion began to cultivate the muses on a little oatmeal by renting a bloomsbury garret there he wrote reams on all subjects and in all styles and for six months assiduously haunted publishers' doors with varying fortunes sometimes he came away with a cheque but more often with a bulky manuscript bulging his pocket when tired of setting down imaginary woes he had time to think of his own but being a cheerful youth with an indomitable spirit he banished trouble by interesting himself in the cheap world by this is meant the world which costs no money to view the world of the street here he witnessed the drama of humanity from morning till night and from sunset till dawn and on the whole witnessed very good acting the poorer parts in the human comedy were particularly well played and starving folks were quite dramatic in their demands for food note book in hand paul witnessed spectacular shows in the west end grotesque farces in the strand melodrama in whitechapel and tragedy on waterloo bridge at midnight indeed he quite spoiled the effect of a sensation scene by tugging at the skirts of a starving heroine who wished to take a river journey into the next world but for the most part he remained a spectator and plagiarised from real life shortly the great manager of the universal theatre enlisted paul as an actor and he assumed the double role of an unappreciated author and a sighing lover in the first capacity he had in his desk ten short stories a couple of novels three dramas and a sheaf of doubtful verses these failed to appeal to editor manager or publisher and their author found himself reduced to his last five pound note then the foolish ardent lad must needs fall in love who his divinity was what she was and why she should be divinised can be gathered from a conversation her worshipper held with an old school fellow it was in oxford street at five o'clock on a june afternoon that paul met grexon hay turning the corner of the street leading to his bloomsbury attic the author was tapped on the shoulder by a resplendent bond street being that is the said being wore a perfectly fitting frock coat a silk hat trousers with the regulation fold back and front an orchid buttonhole grey gloves boots that glittered and carried a gold topped cane the fact that paul wheeled without wincing showed that he was not yet in debt your grub street old time author would have leaped his own length at the touch but paul with a clean conscience turned slowly and gazed without recognition into the clean shaven calm cold face that confronted his inquiring eyes beecot said the newcomer taking rapid stock of paul's shabby serge suit and worn looks i thought i was right the voice if not the face awoke old memories hay grexon hay cried the struggling genius well i am glad to see you and he shook hands with the frank grip of an honest man and i you hay drew his friend up the side street and out of the human tide which deluged the pavement but you seem it's a long story interrupted paul flushing come to my castle and i'll tell you all about it old boy you'll stay to supper won't you see here paul displayed a parcel a pound of sausages you loved 'em at school and i'm a superfine cook grexon hay always used expression and word to hide his feelings but with paul whom he had always considered a generous ass at torrington school a trifle of self betrayal didn't matter much beecot was too dense and it may be added too honest to turn any opportunity to advantage it's a most surprising thing said hay in his calm way really a most surprising thing that a torrington public school boy my friend and the son of wealthy parents should be buying sausages come now said paul with great spirit and towing hay homeward i haven't asked you for money if you do you shall have it said hay but the offer was not so generous a one as would appear that was hay all over he always said what he did not mean and knew well that beecot's uneasy pride shied at loans however small paul the unsophisticated took the shadow of generosity for its substance and his dark face lighted up you're a brick hay he declared but i don't want money no this in reply to an eloquent glance from the well to do i have sufficient for my needs and besides with a look at the resplendent dress of the fashion plate dandy i don't glitter in the west end which hints that those who do are rich said grexon with an arctic smile wrong beecot i'm poor only paupers can afford to dress well in that case i must be a millionaire laughed beecot glancing downward at his well worn garb but mount these stairs we have much to say to one another much that is pleasant said the courtly grexon paul shrugged his square shoulders and stepped heavenward on your part i hope he sang back certainly not on mine come to poverty castle and the fashionable visitor found his host lighting the fire in an apartment such as he had read about but had never seen it was quite the proper garret for starving genius small bleak bare but scrupulously clean the floor was partially covered with scraps of old carpet faded and worn the walls were entirely papered with pictures from illustrated journals one window revealing endless rows of dingy chimney pots was draped with shabby rep curtains of a dull red in one corner behind an indian screen stood a narrow camp bedstead covered with a gaudy eastern shawl and also a large tin bath with a can of water beside it against the wall leaned a clumsy deal bookcase filled with volumes well thumbed and in old bindings on one side of the tiny fireplace was a horse hair sofa rendered less slippery by an expensive fur rug thrown over its bareness on the other was a cupboard whence beecot rapidly produced crockery knives forks a cruet napkins and other table accessories all of the cheapest description a deal table in the centre of the room an antique mahogany desk heaped high with papers under the window completed the furnishing of poverty castle and it was up four flights of stairs like that celebrated attic in thackeray's poem as near heaven as i am likely to get rattled on beecot deftly frying the sausages after placing his visitor on the sofa the grub will soon be ready i'm a first class cook bless you old chap housemaid too clean eh he waved the fork proudly round the ill furnished room i'd dismiss myself if it wasn't but but stammered hay much amazed and surveying things through an eye glass what are you doing here trying to get my foot on the first rung of fame's ladder but i don't quite see read balzac's life and you will his people gave him an attic and a starvation allowance in the hope of disgusting him bar the allowance my pater has done the same here's the attic and here's my starvation paul gaily popped the frizzling sausages on a chipped hot plate and here's your aspiring servant hoping to be novelist dramatist and what not to say nothing of why not mustard there you are wait a bit i'll brew you tea or cocoa i never take those things with meals beecot your kit assures me of that champagne's more in your line i say grexon what are you doing now what other west end men do said grexon attacking a sausage that means nothing well you never did work at torrington so how can i expect the leopard to change his saucy spots hay laughed and during the meal explained his position on leaving school i was adopted by a rich uncle he said when he went the way of all flesh he left me a thousand a year which is enough to live on with strict economy i have rooms in alexander street camden hill a circle of friends and a good appetite as you will perceive with these i get through life very comfortably ha said paul darting a keen glance at his visitor you have the strong digestion necessary to happiness have you the hard heart also if i remember at school oh hang school said grexon flushing all over his cold face i never think of school i was glad when i got away from it but we were great friends at school paul something after the style of steerforth and david copperfield was paul's reply as he pushed back his plate you were my hero and i was your slave but the other boys he looked again they hated me because they did not understand me as you did if that is so grexon why did you let me slip out of your life it is ten years since we parted i was fifteen and you twenty which now makes us twenty five and thirty respectively said hay dryly you left school before i did yes i had scarlet fever and was taken home to be nursed i never went back and since then i have never met an old torrington boy have you not asked hay eagerly no my parents took me abroad and i sampled a german university i returned to idle about my father's place till i grew sick of doing nothing and having ambitions i came to try my luck in town he looked round and laughed you see my luck well said hay lighting a dainty cigarette produced from a gold case my uncle who died sent me to oxford and then i travelled i am now on my own as i told you and haven't a relative in the world why don't you marry asked paul with a flush hay wary man about town as he was noted the flush and guessed its cause he could put two and two together as well as most people i might ask you the same question said he the two friends looked at one another and each thought of the difference in his companion since the old school days hay was clean shaven fair haired and calm almost icy in manner his eyes were blue and cold no one could tell what was passing in his mind from the expression of his face as a matter of fact he usually wore a mask but at the present moment better feelings having the upper hand the mask had slipped a trifle but as a rule he kept command of expression and words and actions an admirable example of self control was grexon hay on the other hand beecot was slight tall and dark with an eager manner and a face which revealed his thoughts his complexion was swart he had large black eyes a sensitive mouth and a small moustache smartly twisted upward he carried his head well and looked rather military in appearance probably because many of his forebears had been army men while hay was smartly dressed in a bond street kit paul wore a well cut shabby blue serge he looked perfectly well bred but his clothes were woefully threadbare from these and the garret and the lean meal of sausages hay drew his conclusions and put them into words your father has cut you off said he calmly and yet you propose to marry how do you know both things i keep my eyes open paul i see this attic and your clothes i saw also the flush on your face when you asked me why i did not marry you are in love i am said beecot becoming scarlet and throwing back his head it is clever of you to guess it prophesy more hay smiled in a cold way i prophesy that if you marry on nothing you will be miserable but of course he looked sharply at his open faced friend the lady may be rich she is the daughter of a second hand bookseller called norman and i believe he combines selling books with pawnbroking hum said hay he might make money out of the last occupation is he a jew by any chance no he is a miserable looking one eyed christian with the manner of a frightened rabbit one eyed and frightened repeated hay musingly but without change of expression desirable father in law and the daughter sylvia she is an angel a white lily a of course said grexon cutting short these rhapsodies and what do you intend to marry on beecot fished a shabby blue velvet case out of his pocket on my last five pounds and this he said opening the case hay looked at the contents of the case and saw a rather large brooch made in the form of a jewelled serpent opals diamonds and gold he said slowly then looked up eagerly sell it to me chapter ii deborah junk duenna number forty five gwynne street was a second hand bookshop and much of the stock was almost as old as the building itself a weather stained board of faded blue bore in tarnished gold lettering the name of its owner and under this were two broad windows divided by a squat door open on week days from eight in the morning until eight at night within the shop was dark and had a musty odor on either side of the quaint old house was a butcher's and a baker's flaunting places of business raw in their newness between the first named establishment and the bookshop a low narrow passage led to a small backyard and to a flight of slimy steps down which clients who did not wish to be seen could arrive at a kind of cellar to transact business with mr norman this individual combined two distinct trades on the ground floor he sold second hand books in the cellar he bought jewels and gave money on the same to needy people in the shop pale youths untidy abstracted old men spectacled girls and all varieties of the pundit caste were to be seen poring over ancient volumes or exchanging words with the proprietor but to the cellar came fast young men aged spendthrifts women of no reputation and some who were very respectable indeed these usually came at night and in the cellar transactions would take place which involved much money exchanging hands in the daytime mr norman was an innocent bookseller but after seven he retired to the cellar and became as genuine a pawnbroker as could be found in london touching books he was easy enough to deal with but a shylock as regards jewels and money lent with his bookish clients he passed for a dull shopkeeper who knew little about literature but in the underground establishment he was spoken of by those who came to pawn as a usurer of the worst in an underhand way he did a deal of business aaron norman such was the name over the shop looked like a man with a past a miserable past for in his one melancholy eye and twitching nervous mouth could be read sorrow and apprehension his face was pale and he had an odd habit of glancing over his left shoulder as though he expected to be tapped thereon by a police officer sixty years had rounded his shoulders and weakened his back so that his one eye was almost constantly on the ground suffering had scored marks on his forehead and weary lines round his thin lipped mouth when he spoke he did so in a low hesitating voice and when he looked up which was seldom his eye revealed a hunted look like that of a wearied beast fearful lest it should be dragged from its lair it was this strange looking man that paul beecot encountered in the doorway of the gwynne street shop the day after his meeting with hay many a visit had paul paid to that shop and not always to buy books norman knew him very well and recognizing him in a fleeting look as he passed through the doorway smiled weakly behind the counter stood bart tawsey the lean underling who was much sharper with buyers than was his master but after a disappointed glance in his direction paul addressed himself to the bookseller i wish to see you particularly he said with his eager air i am going out on important business said norman but if you will not be very long it's about a brooch i wish to pawn the old man's mouth became hard and his eyes sharper i can't attend to that now mr beecot he said and his voice rang out louder than usual after seven it's only six now said paul looking over his shoulder at a church clock which could be seen clearly in the pale summer twilight i can't wait well then as you are an old customer of books said aaron with emphasis i'll stretch a point you can go below at a quarter to seven and i'll come round through the outside passage to see you meantime i must go about my business and he went away with his head hanging and his solitary eye searching the ground as usual paul in spite of his supposed hurry was not ill pleased that aaron had gone out and that there was an idle hour before him he stepped lightly into the shop and under the flaring gas which was lighted so dark was the interior of the shop in spite of the luminous gloaming he encountered the smile of barty paul who was sensitive and proudly reticent grew red he knew well enough that his apparent admiration of sylvia norman had attracted the notice of bart and of the red armed wench deborah junk who was the factotum of the household not that he minded for both these servants were devoted to sylvia and knowing that she returned the feelings of paul said nothing about the position to aaron beecot could not afford to make enemies of the pair and had no wish to do so they were coarse grained and common but loyal and kindly of heart got any new books bart asked beecot coming forward with roving eyes for he hoped to see sylvia glide out of the darkness to bless his hungry eyes no sir we never get new books replied bart smartly leastways there's a batch of second hand novels published last year but bless you mr beecot there ain't nothing new about them 'cept the bindings you are severe bart i hope to be a novelist myself we need one sir for the most part them as write now ain't novelists if that means telling anything as is new but i must go upstairs sir miss sylvia said i was to tell her when you came oh yes er er that is she wants to see a photograph of my old home i promised to show it to her paul took a parcel out of his pocket can't i go up no sir 'twouldn't be wise the old man may come back and if he knew as you'd been in his house bart jerked his head towards the ceiling he'd take a fit why he doesn't think i'm after the silver lor' bless you no sir it ain't that what's valuable silver and gold and jewels and such like is down there bart nodded towards the floor but mr norman don't like people coming into his private rooms he's never let in anyone for years perhaps he fears to lose the fairest jewel he has bart was what the scotch call quick in the uptake he don't think so much of her as he ought to sir said he gloomily but i know he loves her and wants to make her a great heiress when he goes to the worms miss sylvia will have a pretty penny i only hope added bart looking slyly at paul that he who has her to wife won't squander what the old man has worked for beecot colored still more at this direct hint and would have replied but at this moment a large red faced ponderous woman dashed into the shop from a side door there said she clapping her hands in a childish way i know'd his vice an' i ses to miss sylvia as is sittin' doing needlework which she do do lovely i ses 'that's him' and she ses with a lovely color 'oh deborah jus' see fur m'eart's abeating too loud for me t'ear 'is vice' so i ses here she became breathless and clapped her hands again so as to prevent interruption but paul did interrupt her knowing from experience that when once set going deborah would go on until pulled up can't i go up to miss norman he asked you may murder me and slay me and trample on my corp said deborah solemnly but go up you can't master would send me to walk the streets if i dared to let you innocent as you are go up them stairs paul knew long ago how prejudiced the old man was in this respect during all the six months he had known sylvia he had never been permitted to mount the stairs in question it was strange that aaron should be so particular on this point but connecting it with his downcast eye and frightened air paul concluded though without much reason that the old man had something to conceal more that he was frightened of someone however he did not argue the point but suggested a meeting place can't i see her in the cellar he asked mr norman said i could go down to wait for him sir said deborah plunging forward a step like a stumbling 'bus horse don't tell me as you want to pawn well i do replied paul softly but you needn't tell everyone it's only bart cried deborah casting a fierce look in the direction of the slim sharp faced young man and if he was to talk i'd take his tongue out that i would i'm a training him to be my husband as i don't hold with the ready made article and married he shall be by parsing and clark if he's a good boy and don't talk of what don't matter to him i ain't goin' to chatter said bart with a wink lor' bless you sir i've seen gentlemen as noble as yourself pawning things down there he nodded again towards the floor ah and ladies too but hold your tongue cried deborah pitching herself across the floor like a ship in distress your a talking now of what you ain't a right to be a talkin' of drat you come this way mr beecot to the place where old nick have his home for that he is when seven strikes you shouldn't speak of your master in that way protested paul oh shouldn't i snorted the maid with a snort surprisingly loud and who have a better right sir i've been here twenty year as servant and nuss and friend and 'umble well wisher to miss sylvia coming a slip of a girl at ten which makes me thirty i don't deny not that it's too old to marry bart though he's but twenty and makes up in wickedness for twice that age i know master and when the sun's up there ain't a better man living but turn on the gas and he's an old nick bart attend to your business and don't open them long ears of yours too wide i won't have a listening husband i can tell you this way sir mind the steps by this time deborah had convoyed paul to a dark corner behind the counter and jerked back a trap door here he saw a flight of wooden steps which led downwards into darkness but miss junk snatched up a lantern on the top step and having lighted it dropped down holding it above her red and touzelled head far below her voice was heard crying to beecot to come on therefore he followed as quickly as he could and soon found himself in the cellar all around was dark but deborah lighted a couple of flaring gas jets and then turned with her arms akimbo on the visitor now then sir you and me must have a talk confidential like said she in her breathless way it's pawning is it by which i knows that you ain't brought that overbearing pa of yours to his knees paul sat down in a clumsy mahogany chair which stood near a plain deal table and stared at the handmaiden i never told you about my father he said exhibiting surprise oh no of course not miss junk tossed her head me being a babe an' a suckling not fit to be told anything but you told miss sylvia and she told me as she tells everything to her debby god bless her for a pretty flower she pointed a coarse red finger at paul if you were a gay deceiver mr beecot i'd trample on your corp this very minute if i was to die at old bailey for the doing of it seeing deborah was breathless again paul seized his chance there is no reason you shouldn't know all about me and no indeed i should think not begging your pardon sir but when you comes here six months back i ses to miss sylvia i ses 'he's making eyes at you my lily' and she ses to me she says 'oh debby i love him that i do' and then i ses ses i 'my pretty he looks a gent born and bred but that's the wust kind so we'll find out if he's a liar before you loses your dear heart to him' but i'm not a liar began paul only to be cut short again as well i knows burst out miss junk her arms akimbo again do you think sir as i'd ha' let you come loving my pretty one and me not knowing if you was judas or jezebel not me if i never drank my nightly drop of beer again what you told miss sylvia of your frantic pa and your loving ma she told me pumping you may call it shouted deborah emphasising again with the red finger but everything you told in your lover way she told her old silly debby i ses to bart if you loves me bart go down to wargrove wherever it may be if in england which i doubt and if he meaning you don't tell the truth out he goes if i have the chucking of him myself and a police court summings over it so bart goes to wargrove and he find out that you speaks true which means that you're a gent sir if ever there was one in spite of your frantic pa so i hopes as you'll marry my flower and make her happy bless you and deborah spread a large pair of mottled arms over paul's head it's all true said he good naturedly my father and i don't get on well together and i came to make a name in london but for all you know deborah i may be a scamp that you are not she burst out why bart's been follerin' you everywhere and he and me which is to be his lawful wife and master knows all about you and that there place in bloomsbury and where you go and where you don't go and let me tell you sir again she lifted her finger threateningly if you wasn't what you oughter be never would you see my pretty one again no not if i had to wash the floor in your blue blood for blue it is if what bart learned was true of them stone figgers in the church and she gasped paul was silent for a few minutes looking at the floor he wondered that he had not guessed all this often it had seemed strange to him that so faithful and devoted a couple of retainers as bart and deborah junk should favor his wooing of sylvia and keep it from their master seeing that they knew nothing about him but from the woman's story which he saw no reason to disbelieve the two had not rested until they had been convinced of his respectability and of the truth of his story thus they had permitted the wooing to continue and paul privately applauded them for their tact in so making sure of him without committing themselves to open speech all the same he said aloud and following his own thoughts it's strange that you should wish her to marry me miss junk made a queer answer i'm glad enough to see her marry anyone respectable let alone a gent as you truly are with stone figgers in churches and a handsome face though rather dark for my liking mr beecot twenty year ago a slip of ten i come to nuss the baby as was my loving angel upstairs and her ma had just passed away to jine them as lives overhead playing harps all these years i've never heard a young step on them stairs save miss sylvia's and bart's him having come five years ago and a brat he was and would you believe it mr beecot i know no more of the old man than you do he's queer and he's wrong altogether and that frightened of being alone in the dark as you could make him a corp with a turnip lantern what is he afraid of ah said deborah significantly what indeed it may be police and it may be ghosts but ghosts or police he never ses what he oughter say if he's a respectable man which i sadly fear he ain't he may have his reasons to miss junk tossed her head and snorted again loudly oh yes he has his reasons she admitted and old bailey ones they are i dessay but there's somethin' 'anging over his head don't ask me what it is fur never shall you know by reason of my being ignorant but whatever it is mr beecot it's something wicked and shall i see my own pretty in trouble how do you know there will be trouble interrupted paul anxiously i've heard him pray said miss junk mysteriously yes you may look for there ain't no prayer in the crafty eye of him but pray he do and asks to be kept from danger danger danger's the word for i won't deceive you no not if you paid me better wages than the old man do give and he's as near as the paring of an inion so i ses to bart if there's danger and trouble and old baileys about the sooner miss sylvia have some dear man to give her a decent name and pertect her the more happy old deborah will be so i looked and looked for what you might call a fairy prince as i've heard tell of in pantomimes and when you comes she loses her heart to you so i ses find out bart what he is and yes yes i see well deborah you can depend upon my looking after your pretty mistress if i were only reconciled with my father i would speak to mr norman don't sir don't cried the woman fiercely and making a clutch at paul's arm he'll turn you out he will not being anxious fur anyone to have my flower though love her as he oughter do he don't no cried deborah nor her ma before her who died with a starvin' 'eart but you run away with my sweetest and make her your own though her pa swears thunderbolts as you may say take her from this place of wickedness and police courts and deborah looked round the cellar with a shudder suddenly she started and held up her finger nodding towards a narrow door at the side of the cellar master's footstep she said in a harsh whisper i'd know it in a thousand just like a thief's ain't it stealing as you might say don't tell him you've seen me but sylvia cried paul catching her dress as she passed him her you'll see if i die for it said deborah and whirled up the wooden steps in a silent manner surprising in so noisy a woman paul heard the trap door drop with a stealthy creak as a key grated in the lock of the outside door he glanced round the place to which he had penetrated for the first time it was of the same size as the shop overhead but the walls were of stone green with slime and feathery with a kind of ghastly white fungus overhead from the wooden roof which formed the floor of the shop hung innumerable spider's webs thick with dust the floor was of large flags cracked in many places and between the chinks in moist corners sprouted sparse colorless grass in the centre was a deal table scored with queer marks and splotched with ink over this flared two gas jets which whistled shrilly against the wall which was below the street were three green painted safes fast locked but the opposite wall had in it the narrow door aforesaid and a wide grated window the bars of which were rusty though strong the atmosphere of the place was cold and musty and suggestive of a charnel house certainly a strange place in which to transact business but everything about aaron norman was strange and he looked strange himself as he stepped in at the open door beyond paul could see the shallow flight of damp steps leading to the yard and the passage which gave admission from the street norman locked the door and came forward he was as white as a sheet and his face was thickly beaded with perspiration his mouth twitched more than usual and his hands moved nervously twice as he advanced towards paul who rose to receive him did he cast the odd look over his shoulder beecot fancifully saw in him a man who had committed some crime and was fearful lest it should be discovered or lest the avenger should suddenly appear deborah's confidential talk had not been without its effects on the young man and paul beheld in aaron a being of mystery how such a man came to have such a daughter as sylvia paul could not guess here you are mr beecot said aaron rubbing his hands as though the cold of the cellar struck to his bones well i want to pawn a brooch said beecot slipping his hand into his breast pocket wait said norman throwing up his lean hand let me tell you that i have taken a fancy to you and i have watched you all the many times you have been here didn't you guess no said paul wondering if he was about to speak of sylvia and concluding that he guessed what was in the wind well then i have said the pawnbroker and i think it's a pity a young man should pawn anything have you no money he asked paul reddened very little he said little as it may be live on that and don't pawn said aaron i speak against my own interests but i like you and perhaps i can lend you a few shillings i take money from no one thank you all the same said beecot throwing back his head but if you can lend me something on this brooch and he pulled out the case from his pocket a friend of mine would have bought it but as it belongs to my mother i prefer to pawn it so that i may get it again when i am rich well well said aaron abruptly and resuming his downcast looks i shall do what i can let me see it he stretched out his hand and took the case slowly opening it under the gas he inspected its contents suddenly he gave a cry of alarm and the case fell to the floor the opal serpent the opal serpent he cried growing purple in the face keep off keep off he beat the air with his lean hands oh the opal and he fell face downward on the slimy floor in a fit or a faint but certainly unconscious chapter iii dulcinea of gwynne street near the temple station of the metropolitan railway is a small garden which contains a certain number of fairly sized trees a round band stand and a few flower beds intersected by asphalt paths here those who are engaged in various offices round about come to enjoy rus in urbes to listen to the gay music and in many cases to eat a scanty mid day meal old women come to sun themselves loafers sit on the seats to rest workmen smoke and children play on a bright day the place is pretty and those who frequent it feel as though they were enjoying a country holiday though but a stone's throw from the thames and lovers meet here also so it was quite in keeping that paul beecot should wait by the bronze statues of the herculaneum wrestlers for the coming of sylvia on the previous day he had departed hastily after committing the old man to deborah's care at first he had lingered to see aaron revive but when the unconscious man came to his senses and opened his eyes he fainted again when his gaze fell on paul deborah therefore in her rough practical way suggested that as beecot was upsetting him he had better go it was in a state of perplexity that paul had gone away but he was cheered on his homeward way by a hasty assurance given by miss junk that sylvia would meet him in the gardens near them niggers without clothes said deborah it was strange that the sight of the brooch should have produced such an effect on aaron and his fainting confirmed paul's suspicions that the old man had not a clean conscience but what the serpent brooch had to do with the matter beecot could not conjecture it was certainly an odd piece of jewellery and not particularly pretty but that the merest glimpse of it should make norman faint was puzzling in the extreme apparently it is associated with something disagreeable in the man's mind soliloquised paul pacing the pavement and keeping a sharp look out for sylvia perhaps with death else the effect would scarcely have been so powerful as to produce a fainting fit yet aaron can't know my mother hum i wonder what it means while he was trying to solve the mystery a light touch on his arm made him wheel round and he beheld sylvia smiling at him while he was looking along the embankment for her coming she had slipped down norfolk street and through the gardens to where the wrestlers clutched at empty air in her low voice which was the sweetest of all sounds to paul she explained this looking into his dark eyes meanwhile but i can't stay long finished sylvia my father is still ill and he wants me to return and nurse him has he explained why he fainted asked paul anxiously no he refuses to speak on the matter why did he faint paul the young man looked puzzled upon my word i don't know he said just as i was showing him a brooch i wished to pawn he went off what kind of a brooch asked the girl also perplexed paul took the case out of his breast pocket where it had been since the previous day my mother sent it to me he explained you see she guesses that i am hard up and thanks to my father she can't send me money this piece of jewellery she has had for many years but as it is rather old fashioned she never wears it so she sent it to me hoping that i might get ten pounds or so on it a friend of mine wished to buy it but i was anxious to get it back again so that i might return it to my mother therefore i thought your father might lend me money on it sylvia examined the brooch with great attention it was evidently of indian workmanship delicately chased and thickly set with jewels the serpent which was apparently wriggling across the stout gold pin of the brooch had its broad back studded with opals large in the centre of the body and small at head and tail these were set round with tiny diamonds and the head was of chased gold with a ruby tongue sylvia admired the workmanship and the jewels and turned the brooch over on the flat smooth gold underneath she found the initial r scratched with a pin this she showed to paul i expect your mother made this mark to identify the brooch she said my mother's name is anne replied paul looking more puzzled than ever anne beecot why should she mark this with an initial which has nothing to do with her name perhaps it is a present suggested sylvia paul snapped the case to and replaced it in his pocket perhaps it is he said however when i next write to my mother i'll ask her where she got the brooch she has had it for many years he added musingly for i remember playing with it when a small boy don't tell your mother that my father fainted why not does it matter sylvia folded her slender hands and looked straight in front of her for some time they had been seated on a bench in a retired part of the gardens and the laughter of playing children the music of the band playing the merriest airs from the last musical comedy came faintly to their ears i think it does matter said the girl seriously for some reason my father wants to keep himself as quiet as possible he talks of going away going away oh sylvia and you never told me he only spoke of going away when i came to see how he was this morning she replied i wonder if his fainting has anything to do with this determination he never talked of going away before paul wondered also it seemed strange that after so unusual an event the old man should turn restless and wish to leave a place where he had lived for over twenty years i'll come and have an explanation said paul after a pause i think that will be best dear father said that he would like to see you again and told bart to bring you in if he saw you i'll call to day this afternoon and perhaps your father will explain and now sylvia that is enough about other people and other things let us talk of ourselves sylvia turned her face with a fond smile she was a delicate and dainty little lady with large grey eyes and soft brown hair her complexion was transparent and she had little color in her cheeks with her oval face her thin nose and charming mouth she looked very pretty and sweet but it was her expression that paul loved that was a trifle sad but when she smiled her looks changed as an overcast sky changes when the sun bursts through the clouds her figure was perfect her hands and feet showed marks of breeding and although her grey dress was as demure as any worn by a quakeress she looked bright and merry in the sunshine of her lover's presence everything about sylvia was dainty and neat and exquisitely clean but she was hopelessly out of the fashion it was this odd independence in her dress which constituted another charm in paul's eyes the place was too public to indulge in love making and it was very tantalising to sit near this vision of beauty without gaining the delight of a kiss paul feasted his eyes and held sylvia's grey gloved hand under cover of her dress further he could not go but if you put up your sunshade he suggested artfully paul that was all sylvia said but it suggested a whole volume of rebuke brought up in seclusion like the princess in an enchanted castle the girl was exceedingly shy paul's ardent looks and eager wooing startled her at times and he thought disconsolately that his chivalrous love making was coarse and common when he gazed on the delicate dainty shrinking maid he adored you should not have stepped out of your missal sylvia he said sadly whatever do you mean dearest i mean that you are a saint an angel a thing to be adored and worshipped you are exactly like one of those lovely creations one sees in mass books of the middle ages i fear sylvia paul sighed that you are too dainty and holy for this work a day world what nonsense paul i'm a poor girl without position or friends living in a poor street you are the first person who ever thought me pretty you are not pretty said the ardent beecot you are divine you are beatrice you are elizabeth of thuringia you are everything that is lovely and adorable and you are a silly boy replied sylvia blushing but loving this poetic talk all the same do you want to put me in a glass case when we marry if you do i sha'n't become mrs beecot i want to see the world and to enjoy myself then other men will admire you and i shall grow jealous can you be jealous paul horribly you don't know half my bad qualities i am poor and needy and ambitious and jealous and there there i won't hear you run yourself down you are the best boy in the world poor world if i am that he laughed and squeezed the little hand oh my love do you really think of me always always you know i do why ever since i saw you enter the shop six months ago i have always loved you i told debby and debby said that i could supposing debby had said that you couldn't oh she would never have said that why paul she saw you the young man laughed and colored do i carry my character in my face he asked sylvia don't think too well of me that is impossible she declared you are my fairy prince well i certainly have found an enchanted princess sleeping in a jealously guarded castle what would your father say did he know sylvia looked startled i am afraid of my father she replied indirectly yes he is so strange sometimes he seems to love me and at other times to hate me we have nothing in common i love books and art and gaiety and dresses but father only cares for jewels he has a lot down in the cellar i have never seen them you know added sylvia looking at her lover nor have deborah or bart but they are there bart and deborah say so has your father ever said so no he won't speak of his business in the cellar when the shop is closed at seven he sends bart away home and locks deborah and i in the house that is she explained anxiously lest paul should think her father a tyrant he locks the door which leads to the shop we can walk over all the house but there we stop till next morning when father unlocks the door at seven and bart takes down the shutters we have lived like that for years on sunday evenings however father does not go to the cellar but takes me to church he has supper with me upstairs and then locks the door at ten but he sleeps upstairs no he sleeps in the cellar impossible there is no accommodation for sleeping there sylvia explained there is another cellar a smaller one off the large place he has the safes in the door is in a dark corner almost under the street line this smaller cellar is fitted up as a bedroom and my father has slept there all his life i suppose he is afraid of his jewels being stolen i don't think it is good for his health added the girl wisely for often in the morning he looks ill and his hands shake sylvia does your father drink alcohol oh no paul he is a teetotaller and is very angry at those who drink to excess why once bart came to the shop a little drunk and father would have discharged him but for deborah paul said nothing but thought the more often it had struck him that norman was a drunkard though his face showed no signs of indulgence for it always preserved its paleness but the man's hands shook and his skin often was drawn and tight with that shiny look suggestive of indulgence he either drinks or smokes opium thought paul on hearing sylvia's denial but he said nothing to her of this i must go home now she said rising oh no not yet he implored well then i'll stay for a few minutes longer because i have something to say she remarked and sat down again paul do you think it is quite honorable for you and i to be engaged without the consent of my father well hesitated beecot i don't think it is as it should be were i well off i should not fear to tell your father everything but as i am a pauper he would forbid my seeing you did he learn that i had raised my eyes to you but if you like i'll speak though it may mean our parting for ever paul she laid a firm small hand on his arm not all the fathers in the world will keep me from you often i have intended to tell all but my father is so strange sometimes he goes whole days without speaking to me and at times he speaks harshly though i do nothing to deserve rebuke i am afraid of my father said the girl with a shiver i said so before and i say so again he is a strange man and i don't understand him at all i wish i could marry you and go away altogether well let us marry if you like though we will be poor no said sylvia sorrowfully after all strange and harsh though my father is he is still my father and at times he is kind i must stay with him to the end what end sylvia shook her head still more sorrowfully who knows paul my father is afraid of dying suddenly by violence asked beecot thinking of deborah's talk i can't say but every day after six he goes to church and prays all alone deborah told me as often she has seen him leave the church then he is afraid of every stranger who enters the shop i don't understand it cried the girl passionately i don't like it i wish you would marry me and take me away paul but oh how selfish i am my own i wish i could but the money oh never mind the money i must get away from that house if it was not for deborah i would be still more afraid i often think my father is mad but there sylvia rose and shook out her skirts i have no right to talk so and only do so to you that you may know what i feel i'll speak to my father myself and say we are engaged if he forbids our marriage i shall run away with you paul said poor sylvia the tears in her eyes i am a bad girl to talk in this way after all he is my father beecot had an ardent desire to take her in his arms and kiss away those tears but the publicity of the meeting place denied him the power to console her in that efficacious fashion all he could do was to assure her of his love and then they walked out of the gardens towards the strand i'll speak to your father myself said paul we must end this necessary silence after all i am a gentleman and i see no reason why your father should object i know you are everything that is good and true said sylvia drying her eyes if you were not debby would not have let me become engaged to you she finished childishly debby made inquiries about me said paul laughing to cheer her yes she sent bart to wargrove and found out all about me and my family and my respected father she wished to be certain that i was a proper lover for her darling i am your darling now whispered sylvia squeezing his arm and you are the most charming lover in the world paul was so enchanted with this speech that he would have defied public opinion by embracing her there and then but sylvia walked away rapidly down gwynne street and shook her head with a pursed up mouth when paul took a few steps after her recognizing that it would be wise not to follow her to the shop lest the suspicious old man should be looking out beecot went on his homeward way when he drew near his bloomsbury garret he met grexon hay who was sauntering along swinging his cane i was just looking for you he said greeting paul in his usual self contained manner it worries me to think you are so hard up though i'm not a fellow given to sentiment as a rule let me lend you a fiver paul shook his head thank you all the same well then sell me the brooch beecot suddenly looked squarely at hay who met his gaze calmly do you know anything of that brooch he asked what do you mean it is a brooch of indian workmanship that is all i know i want to give a lady a present and if you will sell it to me i'll take it to help you thus killing two birds at one shot i don't want to sell it said paul looking round his eyes fell on a respectable man across the road who appeared to be a workman as he had a bag of tools on his shoulder he was looking into a shop window but also as paul suddenly thought seemed to be observing him and hay however the incident was not worth noticing so he continued his speech to grexon i tried to pawn it with aaron norman he said well what did you get on it asked hay with a yawn nothing the old man fainted when i showed him the brooch that is why i asked you if you know anything strange about the article hay shook his head but looked curiously at beecot do you know anything yourself he asked you seem to have something on your mind about that brooch there is something queer about it said paul why should aaron norman faint when he saw it hay yawned again you had better ask your one eyed friend i think you said he was one eyed he is and a frightened sort of man but there's nothing about that opal serpent to make him faint perhaps he did so because it is in the shape of a serpent suggested grexon a constitutional failing perhaps some people hate cats and other fluttering birds your one eyed friend may have a loathing of snakes and can't bear to see the representation of one it might be that said beecot after a pause aaron is a strange sort of chap a man with a past i should say you make me curious said grexon laughing in a bored manner i think i'll go to the shop myself and have a look at him come with me when i next go said paul i had intended to call this afternoon but i won't until i hear from my mother what about i want to learn how she came into possession of the brooch pooh nonsense said hay contemptuously you think too much about the thing who cares if a pawnbroker faints why i wish to go to the shop is because i am anxious to see your lady love well when you do want me to go send for me you have my address 'day old man and the gorgeous being sauntered away with apparently not a care in the world to render him anxious paul was anxious however the more he thought of the episode of the brooch the stranger it seemed and sylvia's talk of her father's queer habits did not make paul wonder the less however he resolved to write to his mother and was just mounting his stairs to do so when he heard a beg pardon sir and beheld the working man bag of tools pipe and all beg pardon sir said the man civilly but that gentleman you was a talking to know his name sir what the devil's that to you asked paul angrily nothing sir only he owes me a little bill go and ask him for it then i don't know his address sir oh be hanged paul went on when the man spoke again he's what i call a man on the market sir have a care and he departed quickly paul stared what did the working man mean and was he a working man chapter iv the unforeseen paul did not go near the gwynne street shop for the next few days much as he wanted to do so being deeply in love he could hardly bear to be away from sylvia even for a few hours but in spite of this he remained away for two reasons the first of these was that he awaited a reply to his letter written to mrs beecot as he wished to be able to tell aaron norman where the brooch had been obtained he thought by doing this to ingratiate himself with the old man and perhaps if thus confidential might learn for the satisfaction of his curiosity why the sight of the brooch had produced such an effect on the pawnbroker the other reason was that not having been able to sell the brooch or rather pawn it since he did not wish to lose it altogether funds were running low and now he had but a few shillings left a call at the office of a penny weekly had resulted in the return of three stories as being too long and not the sort required but the editor in a hasty interview admitted that he liked paul's work and would give him three pounds for a tale written on certain lines likely to be popular with the public paul did not care to set forth another person's ideas especially as these were old and very sensational but as he required money he set to work and labored to produce what would bring him in the cash he made several attempts before he reached the editor's level which was low rather than high and succeeded in getting the tale accepted with three golden pounds in his pocket and exultation in his heart for every success seemed to bring him nearer to sylvia paul returned to his aerial castle and found waiting for him the expected letter it was written in a low spirited sort of way characteristic of mrs beecot but with a true motherly heart after two pages of lamentation over his absence and a description of how the head of the household managed to bear up against the affliction of his son's absence mrs beecot proceeded to explain about the brooch why do you ask me about the opal brooch my dear boy wrote mrs beecot in her scratchy handwriting all i know is that your father bought it out of a pawnbroker's shop in stowley which is some town in the midlands your father was travelling there and saw the brooch by chance as i always thought opals unlucky he was anxious to make me see the folly of such a superstition so he bought the brooch and took it away with him afterwards i believe he received a letter from the pawnbroker saying that his assistant had sold the brooch by mistake that the time for redeeming it had not run out when your father bought it the pawnbroker asked that the brooch might be returned and wanted to pay back the money but you know what your father is he refused at once to give back the brooch and insisted on my wearing it i had a bad fall while wearing it and then was thrown out of that high dog cart your father would insist on driving i am sure the brooch or the stones is unlucky and as after a time your father forgot all about it i let it lie in my jewel case for years i had not worn it and as i think it is unlucky and as you need money my darling boy i hope you will sell it there is no need to pawn it as you say i never want to see the brooch again but regarding your health etc etc so mrs beecot wrote in her verbose style and with some errors of grammar paul saw in her simple tale fresh evidence of his father's tyranny since he made his wife wear gems she detested and was superstitiously set against possessing them the dog cart episode paul remembered very well mr beecot in his amiable way had no patience with his wife's nerves and never lost an opportunity of placing her in unpleasant positions whereby she might be what he called hardened paul sighed to think of his mother's position as he folded up the letter she had a bad time with the truculent husband she had married and i can't believe she became his wife of her own free will thought paul probably the governor bullied her into it in his own sweet way however there was nothing in the letter to explain norman's faint it was certainly strange that the pawnbroker from whom the brooch had been originally purchased should have demanded it back and the excuse given seems rather a weak one however paul did not waste time in thinking over this but resolved to tell aaron what his mother had said he had received two letters from sylvia mentioning amongst other things that her father now quite well was asking after paul and urging him to come and see him my father appears to have a fancy for you wrote sylvia so if you are very nice as nice as you can be perhaps he won't be very angry if you tell him we are engaged there was much more to the same effect which paul thought good advice and he intended to adopt the same it was necessary that he should tell aaron of his love if things were to be conducted in a straightforward and honorable manner and paul had no desire to conduct them otherwise having made up his mind to see aaron again paul bethought himself of grexon hay that gentleman had never appeared again at the bloomsbury garret and had never even written but paul was anxious that hay whom he regarded as a clever man of the world should see the old man and as our trans atlantic cousins say size him up norman's manner and queer life puzzled paul not a little and not being very worldly himself he was anxious to have the advice of his old school friend who seemed desirous of doing him a good turn witness his desire to buy the brooch so that paul might be supplied with money so beecot wrote to grexon hay at his camden hill chamber and told him he intended to go to gwynne street on a certain day at a certain time to this grexon responded by saying that he was at paul's service and would come especially as he wanted to see dulcinea of gwynne street paul laughed at the phrase i suppose grexon thinks i am very quixotic he thought coming to london to tilt with the windmills of the press but don quixote was wise in spite of his apparent madness and grexon will recognize my wisdom when he sees my dulcinea bless her humph i wonder if hay could pacify my father and make him look more kindly on my ambitions grexon is a clever fellow a thoroughly good chap so here paul paused to think the incident of the working man and the warning he had given about hay recurred to his mind also the phrase man on the market stuck in his memory why should grexon hay be called so and what did the phrase mean paul had never heard it before moreover from certain indications beecot did not think that the individual with the bag of tools was a working man he rather appeared to be a person got up to play the part the fellow watching them both and accosting paul alone certainly seemed a doubtful character beecot regretted that he had been so short with the man else he might have learned why he had acted in this way the story of the little bill was absurd for if grexon owed the man money the man himself would certainly have known the name and address of his creditor altogether the incident puzzled paul almost as much as that of aaron's fainting and he resolved to question grexon but it never crossed his mind that hay was anything else but what he appeared to be a man about town with a sufficient income to live upon comfortably had paul doubted he would never have asked grexon to go with him to gwynne street however he had done so and the appointment was made so there was no more to be said the man about town duly made his appearance to the very minute i always keep appointments he explained when paul congratulated him on his punctuality there's nothing annoys me so much as to be kept waiting so i invariably practise what i preach well paul and how is dulcinea of gwynne street she is very well replied paul who was still a young enough lover to blush but i have not seen her since we last met i waited for a letter from my mother about the brooch so that i might explain to aaron how she got it the old man has been asking after me oh confound the brooch said grexon in his cool manner i don't want to hear about it let us talk of dulcinea rather let us talk of yourself said paul not an interesting subject replied hay rising as paul opened his garret door for departure you know all about me no i don't know why you are called a man on the market hay flushed and turned sharply what do you mean he asked in a particularly quiet tone i don't know what i do mean said paul do you remember that working man with the bag of tools who was across the road when we last conversed no said hay staring i never notice creatures of that class why because he asked me who you were and where you lived it seems you owe him some money that is very probable said hay equably i owe most people money and if this man has a debt against me he would certainly know all about me as to address and name so i thought replied paul but the queer thing is that he told me to take care and called you a man on the market what does it mean i never heard the phrase before i have said hay proceeding calmly down the somewhat steep stairs a man on the market means one who wants to marry and is eligible for any heiress who comes along with a sufficient rent roll but why should a fellow like that talk the shibboleth of society paul shrugged his shoulders i can't say perhaps the man guessed i intended to take you to see sylvia and warned me against you as it seems from his phrase that you wish to marry ah then your dulcinea is an heiress said hay fixing his eye glass carefully if so you needn't fear me i am almost engaged and won't be on the market any longer what confounded cheek this fellow addressing you in that way and talking of me as he did i suppose he added with a cold laugh it is not necessary for me to defend myself what rubbish replied beecot good naturedly all the same it is strange the man should have spoken to me as he did i told him to go to the devil and go to the devil he assuredly will if i meet him was the dry reply i'll break his head for not minding his own business i think i can explain and will do so as soon as you take that telegram the lad is holding out for you grexon was quicker sighted than paul for the moment they arrived at the bottom of the stairs and were about to emerge into the street he saw the messenger do you know if any gent of that name lives here guvnor asked the boy holding out the buff colored envelope beecot to his surprise saw his own name who can be wiring to me he said taking the telegram wait boy there may be an answer and he skimmed through the lines don't sell the brooch but send it back read paul puzzled your father angry mother he paused and looked at the boy got a form he asked the lad produced one and a stumpy pencil with these materials beecot wrote a reply saying the brooch would be returned on the morrow when the boy went away with the answer paul felt in his breast pocket and took out the old blue case i've a good mind to send it now he said aloud what's that asked hay who was yawning at the door no bad news i hope it's about that brooch again hay laughed upon my word it seems to you what the monster was to frankenstein said he send it back to mrs beecot i presume and have done with it he cast a glance at the case i see you have it with you he ended lightly yes said paul and replacing the case in his pocket went down the street with his friend then he determined to ask his opinion and related the gist of mrs beecot's letter and now the mater wires to have it back he said i expect my father has found out that she has sent it to me and is furious well send it back and have done with it said hay impatiently you are in danger of becoming a bore with that brooch beecot i'll lend you money if you like no thanks i have three pounds honestly earned however we'll speak no more of the brooch i'll send it back this very day tell me he linked his arm within that of his friend tell me of that man that man of the working creature said hay absently pooh the man was no more a working man than i am well i thought myself he was a bit of a fraud detectives never do make up well said grexon calmly paul stopped as they turned into oxford street what was the man a detective i think so from your description of his conversation the fact is i'm in love with a lady who is married we have behaved quite well and no one can say a word against us but her husband is a beast and wants a divorce i have suspected for some time that he is having me watched thanks to you paul i am now sure so perhaps you will understand why the man warned you against me and talked of my being a man on the market i see said paul hesitating but don't get into trouble hay oh i'm all right and i don't intend to do anything dishonorable if that is what you mean it's the husband's fault not mine by the way can you describe the fellow yes he had red hair and a red beard rather a ruddy face and walked with a limp all put on said hay contemptuously probably the limp was affected the beard false the hair a wig and the face rouged very clumsy indeed i daresay he'll appear pale and gentlemanly the next time he watches me i know the tricks of these fellows the two friends talked for some time about this episode and then branched off into other subjects hay described the married lady he adored and paul rebuked him for entertaining such a passion it's not right hay said he positively you can't respect a woman who runs away from her husband she hasn't run away yet sir galahad laughed grexon by jove you are an innocent if that means respecting the institution of marriage and adoring women as angels i hope i'll remain an innocent oh women are angels of course said hay as they walked down gwynne street it's a stock phrase in love making but there are angels of two sorts dulcinea is here we are interrupted paul quickly somehow it irritated him to hear this hardened sinner speak of sylvia and he began to think that grexon hay had deteriorated not that he was considered to be particularly good at torrington school in fact paul remembered that he had been thoroughly disliked however he had no time to go into the matter for at this moment aaron appeared at the door of the shop he stepped out on to the pavement as paul approached come in he said i want to see you privately he added casting a frightened look at hay in that case i'll leave you said grexon disengaging his arm from paul dulcinea must wait for another occasion go in and do your business i'll wait without paul thanked his friend by a look and went into the shop with the old man that brooch said aaron in a timid whisper have you got it give it to me quick quick there was no one in the shop as bart had apparently gone out on an errand the door leading to the stairs down which sylvia had so often descended was closed and no one was about to overhear their conversation i have the brooch said paul but give it to me give it panted aaron i'll buy it at a large price ask what you want why are you so eager to get it demanded beecot astonished that's my business said norman in a suddenly imperious manner i want it the stones take my fancy he ended weakly was that why you fainted asked paul suspiciously no the man grew white and leaned against the counter breathing heavily where did you get the brooch he asked trying to keep himself calm but with a visible effort i got it from my mother and she received it from my father beecot beecot said the old man fingering his lips much agitated i know no one of that name save yourself and you are not a spy a scoundrel a a he caught the eyes of paul fixed on him in amazement and suddenly changed his tone excuse me but the brooch reminds me of trouble you have seen it before yes that is no don't ask me he clutched at his throat as though he felt choked i can't talk of it i daren't how did your father get it more and more astonished paul explained aaron listened with his one eye very bright and made uneasy motions with his lean hands as the young man spoke when beecot ended he bit his nails yes yes he murmured to himself it would be asked for back but it sha'n't go back i want it sell it to me mr beecot i'm sorry i can't replied paul good naturedly but my mother wired that it was to be returned my father has discovered that she sent it to me and is not pleased did you tell your mother you had shown it to me no there was no need god bless you breathed the man pulling out a crimson handkerchief of course there was no need he tittered nervously it doesn't do to talk of pawning things not respectable eh eh he wiped his face and passed his tongue over his white lips well you won't sell it to me i can't but i'll ask my mother if she will no no don't do that say nothing say nothing i don't want the brooch i never saw the brooch what brooch pooh pooh don't talk to me of the brooch and so he babbled on mr norman said beecot gravely what is the story connected with the brooch aaron flung up his hands and backed towards the counter no no don't ask me what do you mean i know no story of a brooch what brooch i never saw one i never ah he broke off in relief as two pale faced spectacled girls entered the shop customers what is it ladies how can i serve you and he bustled away behind the counter giving all his attention to the customers yet not without a sidelong look in the direction of the perplexed paul that young gentleman finding it impossible to get further speech with aaron and suspecting from his manner that all was not right left the shop he determined to take the brooch to wargrove himself and to ask his mother about it then he could learn why she wanted it back if not from her then from his father this knowledge might explain the mystery did you sell the brooch asked grexon as they walked up gwynne street no i have to send it back to my mother and hold on cried hay stumbling orange peel ah his stumble knocked paul into the middle of the road a motor car was coming down swiftly before hay could realize what had taken place paul was under the wheels of the machine chapter v trouble oh debby wept sylvia he will die he will die not he my precious pet said the handmaiden fondling the girl's soft hands within her own hard ones them sort of young men have as many lives as tom cats bless you my flower he'll be up and ready waiting at the altar before the fashions change and that's quick enough added deborah rubbing her snub nose for they're allays an altering and a turning and a changing of 'em the two were in the sitting room over the bookshop it was a low ceilinged apartment long and narrow with windows back and front as it extended the whole depth of the house the back windows looked out on the dingy little yard but these norman had filled in with stained glass of a dark color so that no one could see clearly out of them why he had done so was a mystery to sylvia though deborah suspected the old man did not want anyone to see the many people who came to the back steps after seven from the front windows could be seen the street and the opposite houses and on the sills of the windows sylvia cultivated a few cheap flowers which were her delight the room was furnished with all manner of odds and ends flotsam and jetsam of innumerable sales attended by aaron there were japanese screens empire sofas mahogany chairs persian praying mats louis quatorz tables arabic tiles worcester china an antique piano that might have come out of the ark and many other things of epochs which had passed away sylvia herself bloomed like a fair flower amidst this wreckage of former times but the flower drooped at this moment and seemed in danger of dying for lack of sunshine that indeed had been taken away by the removal of the young lover bart who had witnessed the accident returned hastily to tell sylvia and so great had the shock of the dreadful news been that she had fainted whereupon the foolish shopman had been severely dealt with by deborah when sylvia recovered however she insisted upon seeing bart again and then learned that paul had been taken to charing cross hospital they drawed him from under the wheels miss as white as a vellum binding as ain't bin used that gent as he was a walking arm in arm with slipped and knocked mr beecot spinning under the steam engine so did bart describe the latest triumph of civilisation he was that sorry in a cold blooded way as i never saw he helped to git mr beecot into a cab and druve off then i come to tell you and a nice way you've told it grunted deborah driving him to the door get back to the shop you threadpaper of a man my husband shall never be such a fool the engagement's off oh debby whimpered bart who strange to say was fondly attached to the stout servant but that may have been habit get along with you she said and banged the door in his face and don't tell master she bawled after him else he'll be fainting again drat him for a lily livered duck so aaron never knew that the man who possessed the brooch had been run over by a motor or was in the hospital sylvia and deborah both tried to look as cheerful as possible and schemed how to see the lover who had thus been laid low deborah boldly announced that she was taking sylvia to buy her a new dress that is to choose it for the cost was to be paid out of the servant's wages and went with her one afternoon to the hospital they heard that paul's arm was broken and that he had been slightly hurt about the head but there was no danger of his dying and although they were not allowed to see him the two women returned greatly cheered but sylvia frequently gave way to low spirits thinking that at any moment the good symptoms might give way to bad ones deborah always cheered her and went daily to get news always she returned to say he's a goin' on nicely and has that color as he might be a sunset so sylvia was bright until her next fit of low spirits came meanwhile their attention was taken up by the odd behavior of aaron the old man suddenly announced that he was about to sell the shop and retire and displayed a feverish haste in getting rid of his stock even at a low price whether he sold the jewels so cheap as the books no one ever knew but certainly the pundit caste did well out of the sale within the week the shop below was denuded and there were nothing but bare shelves much to the disgust of bart who like othello found his occupation gone the next day the furniture was to be sold and when deborah was comforting sylvia at the week's end the fiat had already gone forth whither he intended to transfer his household the old man did not say and this in particular was the cause of sylvia's grief she dreaded lest she should see her lover no more this she said to deborah see him you shall and this very day cried the maiden cheerfully why there's that dress i can't make up my mind whether to have magenter or liliac both being suited to my complexion not that it's cream of the valley smother in rosebuds as yours is my angel but a dress i must have and your pa can't deny my taking you to choose but debby it seems wrong to deceive father in this way it do admitted debby and it is we'll speak this very night you and me in duets as you might say my pretty he sha'n't say as we've gone to hide behind a hedge but we have debby for six months said sylvia because i'm a hardened and bold creature said deborah fiercely so don't say it's you as held your tongue for that you didn't my honeycomb many and many a time have you said to me ses you 'oh do tell my par' and many a time have i said to you ses i 'no my precious not for joseph' whoever he may be drat him now debby you're taking all the blame on yourself and who have the broader shoulders you or me my flower asked debby fondly i'm as wicked as bart and that's saying much for the way he bolts his food is dreadful to think of never will i have a corkidile for a husband but here cried deborah beginning to bustle it's the dress i'm thinking of magenter or lilacs in full boom what do you think my honey pot so the end of deborah's shameless diplomacy was that the two went not to the inferior draper's where debby bought her extraordinary garments though they went there later in a jesuitical manner but to the hospital where to her joy sylvia was allowed to see paul he looked thin and pale but was quite himself and very cheerful my darling he said kissing sylvia's hand while debby sat bolt upright near the bed with a large handbag and played propriety by glaring now i shall get well quickly the sight of you is better than all medicine i should think so sniffed debby graciously where's your orchards with sich a color you mean orchids debby laughed sylvia who blushed a rosy red it's them things with lady slippers a size too large for your foot i'm a thinking of pet and small it is enough for glarse boots as the fairy story do tell but i'm a taking up the precious time of billing and cooing so i'll shut my mouth and my ears while you let loose your affections my sweet ones if you'll excuse the liberty sir me being as fond of my lovey there as you is your own self no i can't admit that said paul kissing sylvia's hand again and holding it while he talked darling how good of you to come and see me it may be for the last time paul said sylvia trying to keep back her tears but you'll give me your address and i'll write oh sylvia what is it my father has sold the books and is selling the house we are going away where to i don't know tumbucktook would suit him snapped debby suddenly he's trying to get into some rabbit hole why i don't know i do said paul lying back thoughtfully he guessed that aaron was moving because of the brooch though why he should do so was a mystery sylvia he asked did your father see my accident no paul he was busy in the shop bart saw it but debby said he wasn't to tell father because of the fainting explained debby the man ain't strong though sampson he may think himself ah and goliath too for all i care but why ask mr beecot paul did not reply to her but asked sylvia another question do you remember that opal brooch i showed you the serpent yes well it's lost lost paul the young man nodded mournfully i'm very vexed about it he said in a low tone my mother wanted it back i was going to send it that very day but when i met with the accident it got lost somehow it wasn't in my pocket when my clothes were examined though i asked for it as soon as i became conscious my friend also couldn't tell me him as caused the smashes said deborah with several sniffs a nice pretty friend i do say sir it wasn't his fault deborah mr hay stumbled on a piece of orange peel and jostled against me i was taken by surprise and fell into the middle of the road just as the motor came along mr hay was more than sorry and has come to see me every day with books and fruit and all manner of things the least he could do snapped the servant knocking folks into orspitals with his fine gent airs i sawr him out of the winder while you was in the shop and there he spoke law de daw to a brat of a boy as ought to be in gaol seeing he smoked a cigar stump an' him but a ten year old guttersnipe ses i oh a painted maypole you is i ses with a face as hard as bath bricks a bad un you are ses i no deborah you are wrong mr hay is my friend never shall he be my pretty's friend declared debby obstinately for if all the wickedness in him 'ud come out in his face pimples would be as thick as smuts in a london fog no mr beecot call him not what you do call him meaning friend for judas and julius cezar ain't in it with his belzebubness beecot saw it was vain to stop this chatterer so he turned to talk in whispers to sylvia while debby murmured on like a brook only she spoke loud enough at times to drown the whispering of the lovers sylvia said paul softly i want you to send your father to me yes paul why do you wish to see him because he must be told of our love i don't think he will be so hard as you think and i am ashamed of not having told him before i like to act honorably and i fear sylvia darling we have not been quite fair to your father i think so too paul and i intended to speak when we went home but give me your address so that if we go away unexpectedly i'll be able to write to you beecot gave her his bloomsbury address and also that of his old home at wargrove in essex write care of my mother he said and then my father won't get the letter would he be angry if he knew asked the girl timidly paul laughed to himself at the thought of the turkey cock's rage i think he would dearest said he but that does not matter be true to me and i'll be true to you here the nurse came to turn the visitors away on the plea that paul had talked quite enough debby flared up but became meek when sylvia lifted a reproving finger then paul asked debby to seek his bloomsbury lodgings and bring to him any letters that might be waiting for him i expect to hear from my mother and must write and tell her of my accident said he i don't want to trouble mr hay but you debby bless you mr beecot it ain't no trouble said the servant cheerfully and better me nor that 'aughty peacock as ain't to be trusted say what you will seeing criminals is a looking out of his eyes hide one though he may with a piece of glarse and i ses you must go now please interposed the nurse oh thank you ma'am but my own mistress as is a lady do i obey only debby debby murmured sylvia and after kissing paul a farewell which debby strove to hide from the nurse by getting in front of her and blocking the view the two departed the nurse laughed as she arranged paul's pillows what a strange woman mr beecot very assented paul quite a character and as true as the needle of the compass meanwhile debby ignorant of this flattering description conducted sylvia to the draper's shop and finally fixed on a hideous magenta gown which she ordered to be made quite plain with none of your fal de lals commanded miss junk snorting plain sewing and good stuff is all i arsk for and if there's any left over you can send home a 'at of the same which i can brighten with a cockes feather as my mar wore at her wedding there my own added debby as they emerged from the shop and took a 'bus to gwynne street that's as you'll allways see me dressed plain and 'omely with no more trimmings than you'll see on a washing day jint as i know to my cost from my mar's ecomicals economy debby it ain't fur me to be using fine words miss sylvia cockatoos' feathers on a goose they'd be in my mouth the 'ole dixionary kin do for you my flower but pothooks and 'angers never was my loves me having been at the wash tub when rising eight and stout at that in this way debby discoursed all the way home on arriving in the room over the shop they found themselves confronted by aaron who looked less timid than usual and glowered at the pair angrily where have you been sylvia he asked the girl could not tell a direct lie and looked at debby that handmaiden less scrupulous was about to blurt forth a garbled account when sylvia stopped her with a resolute expression on her pretty face no debby she commanded let me speak father i have been to see mr beecot at the charing cross hospital and you couldn't have my flower do less as a good smart 'un put in debby anxiously so as to avert the storm girls is girls whatever you may think sir of them being dolls and dummies and hold your tongue woman cried norman fiercely let me talk why is mr beecot in the hospital he was knocked down said sylvia quietly and his arm is broken a motor car ran over him in gwynne street he wants to see you to tell you that he lost something norman turned even whiter than he was by nature and the perspiration suddenly beaded his bald forehead the opal serpent he cried yes the brooch he showed me he showed you cried aaron with a groan and what did he tell you about it what what what the truth or he became passionate debby grasped aaron's arm and whirled him into the middle of the room like a feather then she planted herself before sylvia with her arms akimbo and glared like a lioness you can pinch me sir or gives me black eyes and red noses if you like but no finger on my precious if i die for it aaron was staggered by this defiance and looked fierce for the moment then he became timid again and cast the odd anxious look over his shoulder leave the room deborah he said in a mild voice the faithful maid replied by sitting down and folding her arms get your wild horses sir she said breathing heavily for only by them will i be tugged away and she snorted so loudly that the room shook pshaw said norman crossly sylvia don't be afraid of me he wiped his face nervously i only want to know of the brooch i like the opals i wanted to buy it from mr beecot he is poor he wants money i can give it to him for the the brooch he brought out the last word with a gasp and again glanced over his shoulder sylvia not at all afraid approached and took the old man's hand the watchful deborah moved her chair an inch nearer so as to be ready for any emergency dear father said the girl mr beecot doesn't know where the brooch is it was stolen from him when the accident happened if you will see him he can tell you not where the brooch is interrupted aaron trying to appear calm well well it doesn't matter he glanced anxiously at sylvia you believe me child when i say it doesn't matter a snort from deborah plainly said that she had her doubts sylvia cast a reproving glance in her direction whereupon she rose and committed perjury of course it don't matter sir she said in a loud hearty voice which made aaron wince my precious believes you though lie it might be but folk so good as you sir who go to church when there ain't anyone to see wouldn't tell lies without them a choking of them in their blessed throats how do you know i go to church asked norman with the snarl of a trapped animal bless you sir i don't need glarses at my age though not so young as i might be church you enjiy say what you may you being as regular as the taxes which is saying much lor' save us all deborah might well exclaim this her master flung himself forward with outstretched hands clawing the air and with his lips lifted like those of an enraged dog you she cat he said in a painfully hissing voice you're a spy are you they've set you to watch to drag me to the gallows he broke off with a shiver his rage cooled as suddenly as it had heated and staggering to the sofa he sat down with his face hidden not that not that oh the years of pain and terror to come to this to this deborah don't sell me don't i'll give you money i am rich but if the opal serpent if the opal he rose and began to beat the air with his hands sylvia who had never seen her father like this shrank back in terror but deborah with all her wits about her though she was wildly astonished seized a carafe of water from the table and dashed the contents in his face the old man gasped shuddered and dripping wet sank again on the sofa but the approaching fit was past and when he looked up after a moment or so his voice was as calm as his face what's all this he asked feebly nothing father said sylvia kneeling beside him you must not doubt debby who is as true as steel are you deborah asked aaron weakly i should think so she declared putting her arms round sylvia so long sir as you don't hurt my flower i don't want to hurt her there's feelings as well as bones said deborah hugging sylvia so as to keep her from speaking and love you can't squash try as you may though bless you i'm not given to keeping company myself love said aaron vacantly he seemed to think more of his troubles than of sylvia going to visit a young man love and mr beecot said deborah she wants to marry him why then said aaron calmly she shall marry him sylvia fell at his feet oh father father and i have kept it from you all these months forgive me forgive me and she wept my dear he said gently raising her there is nothing to forgive chapter vi a noise in the night both deborah and sylvia were astonished that aaron should be so indifferent about their long concealment they had expected and dreaded a storm yet when the secret was told mr norman appeared to take it as calmly as though he had known about the matter from the first indeed he seemed perfectly indifferent and when he raised sylvia and made her sit beside him on the sofa he reverted to the brooch i shall certainly see mr beecot he said in a dreamy way charing cross hospital of course i'll go to morrow i had intended to see about selling the furniture then but i'll wait till the next day i want the brooch first yes yes and he opened and shut his hand in a strangely restless manner the girl and the servant looked at one another in a perplexed way for it was odd norman should take the secret wooing of his daughter so quietly he had never evinced much interest in sylvia who had been left mainly to the rough attentions of miss junk but sometimes he had mentioned that sylvia would be an heiress and fit to marry a poor peer the love of paul beecot overthrew this scheme if the man intended to carry it out yet he did not seem to mind sylvia thinking entirely of paul was glad and the tense expression of her face relaxed but deborah sniffed which was always an intimation that she intended to unburden her mind on an unpleasant subject well sir she said folding her arms and scratching her elbow i do think as offspring ain't lumps of dirt to be trod on in this way i arsk she flung out her hand towards sylvia is she your own or is she not she is my daughter said aaron mildly why do you ask 'cause you don't take interest you should take in her marriage which is made in heaven if ever marriage was norman raised his head like a war horse at the sound of a trumpet call who talks of marriage he asked sharply dear father said sylvia gently did you not hear i love paul and i want to marry him aaron stared at her he is not a good match for you was his reply he is the man i love cried sylvia tapping with her pretty foot love said norman with a melancholy smile there is no such thing child talk of hate for that exists he clenched his hands again hate that is as cruel as the grave well i'm sure sir and what 'ave hates to do with my beauty there as to love exist it do for bart's bin talked into filling his 'eart with the same by me i got it out of a family herald explained deborah incoherently where gentry throw themselves on their knees to arsk 'ands in marriage bart was down on his hunkers every night for two weeks before he proposed proper and i ses ses i will you hold your tongue interrupted aaron angrily you gabble gabble till you make my head ache you confuse me i want to clear your 'ead retorted miss junk seeing you take no interest in my pretty's livings norman placed his fingers under sylvia's chin and tipped it up so that he could gaze into her eyes child do you love him he asked gravely oh father whispered sylvia and said no more the expression of her eyes was enough for aaron and he turned away with a sigh you know nothing about him he said at length begging pardon sir for being a gabbler said deborah witheringly but know what he is we do a fine young gent with long descents and stone figgers in churches as bart knows beecot's his par's name as is fighting with mr paul by reason of contrariness and 'igh living him being as stout as stout perhaps you will explain sylvia said aaron turning impatiently from the handmaiden i should have explained before said the girl quietly and very distinctly i loved paul from the moment i saw him enter the shop six months ago he came again and again and we often talked then he told me of his love and i confessed mine deborah wanted to know who he was and if he was a good man from what i learned of paul's people he seemed to be all that was good and generous and high minded and loving deborah sent bart one holiday to wargrove in essex where paul's parents live and bart found that paul had left home because he wanted to be an author paul is very popular in wargrove and everyone speaks well of him so deborah thought we might be engaged and and have you a word to say against it sir demanded deborah bristling no said aaron after a pause but you should have told me we should admitted sylvia quickly but paul and i feared lest you should say 'no' my child said the old man gravely so long as you wed a kind and good man i have nothing to say sylvia i have worked hard these many years and have made much money which by will i have left to you when i die you will be rich he is poor paul yes he is poor but what of that many fathers might think that an objection went on aaron without noticing her remark but i do not you shall marry paul before i go to america lor' cried deborah whatever are you a goin' there for sir that's my business said aaron dryly but i go as soon as i can i have sold the books and the furniture of these rooms shall be disposed of before the end of the week my gems i take to amsterdam for sale and i go abroad next week when i return in a fortnight you can marry mr beecot he is a good young man i quite approve of him deborah snorted seems to me as though you was glad to get quit of my pretty she murmured but too low to be overheard oh father cried sylvia putting her arms round norman's neck how good you are i do love him so i hope the love will continue said her father cynically and removing the girl's arms to the secret indignation of deborah i shall call on mr beecot to morrow and speak to him myself about the matter if we come to an arrangement for i have a condition to make before i give my entire consent i shall allow you a certain sum to live on then i shall go to america and when i die you will inherit all my money when i die he added casting the usual look over his shoulders but i won't die for many a long day he said with a determined air at least i hope not you are healthy enough father yes yes but healthy people die in queer ways deborah intervened impatiently i'm glad you wish to make my lily queen happy sir said she nodding but change your mind you may if mr beecot don't fall in fall in queried aaron with this arrangements what is they aaron looked undecided then spoke impulsively walking towards the door as he did so let mr beecot give me that opal serpent he said and he shall have sylvia and enough to live on but father it is lost cried sylvia in dismay she spoke to the empty air norman had hastily passed through the door and was descending the stairs quicker than usual sylvia in her eagerness to explain would have followed but deborah drew her back with rough gentleness let him go lily queen she said let sleeping dogs lie if you love me deborah what do you mean asked sylvia breathlessly i don't mean anything that have a meaning said miss junk enigmatically but your par's willing to sell you for that dratted brooch whatever he wants it for and you to be put against a brooch my honey pot i'm biling yes biling hard and deborah snorted in proof of the extremity of her rage never mind debby father consents that i shall marry paul and will give us enough to live on then paul will write great books and his father will ask him home again oh oh sylvia danced round the room gaily how happy i am and happy you shall be if i die for it shouted deborah screwing up her face for she was not altogether satisfied though mysteries i don't hold with are about america what's he going to america for and with that brooch and him locking us up every night to sleep in cellars police courts and old baileys said miss junk frowning i don't like it sunbeam and when you're married to mr beecot i'll be that happy as never was sylvia opened her grey eyes in wide surprise and a little alarm oh debby you don't think there's anything wrong with father miss junk privately thought there was a good deal wrong but she folded sylvia in her stout arms and dismissed the question with a snort no lovey my own there ain't it's just my silly way of going on orange buds and brides the sun shines on is your fortunes miss sylvia though how i'm going to call you mrs beecot beats me and deborah rubbed her nose i shall always be sylvia to you bless you lady bird but don't ask me to live with mr beecot's frantic par else there'll be scratchings if he don't do proper what he should do and don't so there deborah swung her arms like a windmill my mind's easy and dinner's waiting for love or no love eat you must to keep your insides' clockwork when bart heard the joyful news he was glad but expressed regret that norman should go to america he did not wish to lose his situation and never thought the old man would take him to the states also deborah vowed that if aaron did want to transport bart so she put it she would object then she unfolded a scheme by which with bart's savings and her own they could start a laundry and i knows a drying ground said deborah while talking at supper to her proposed husband as is lovely and cheap one of them suburbs on the line to essex where my pretty will live when her husband's frantic par makes it up jubileetown's the place and victoria avenue the street the sweetest cottage at twenty pun' a year as i ever set eyes on and m'sister as is married to a bricklayer is near to help with the family the family echoed bart looking scared in course they will come though it's early to be thinking of names for 'em i'll do the washing bart and you'll take round the cart so don't you think things 'ull be otherwise i don't want 'em to said bart affectionately i always loved you debby darling ah said miss junk luxuriously i've taught you to in quite a genteel way what a scrubby little brat you were bart yuss said mr tawsey eating rapidly i saw myself to day in a looking glarse lor' debby no but there wos a brat all rags and dirty face and sauce as i was when you saw me fust he come into the shop as bold as brass and arsked fur a book i ses 'what do you want with a book' and he ses looking at the shelves so empty 'i sees your sellin' off' he ses so i jumped up to clip him over the 'ead when he cut tray's his name debby and he's the kid as talked to that cold gent mr beecot brought along with him when he got smashed tray that's a dog's name said deborah old dog tray and quite good enough for guttersnipes as to mr hay don't arsk me to say he's good for that he ain't what's he want talking with gutter trays and what do gutter trays want with books asked bart though to be sure 'twas impertinence maybe deborah nodded that it was and what you'd have done when you was a scrubby thing don't bolt your food but make every bit 'elp you to 'ealth and long living you won't 'ave gormandising when we've got the laundry i can tell you next day aaron went off in the afternoon to charing cross hospital after holding a conversation with a broker who had agreed to buy the derelict furniture the shop being empty was supposed to be closed but from force of habit bart took down the shutters and lurked disconsolately behind the bare counter several old customers who had not heard of the sale entered and were disappointed when they learned that aaron was leaving their lamentations made bart quite low spirited however he was polite to all but his manners broke down when a hindoo entered to sell boot laces i ain't got nothing to sell and don't want to buy nohow said bart violently the man did not move but stood impassively in the doorway like a bronze statue he wore a dirty red turban carelessly wound round his small head an unclean blouse which had once been white circled by a yellow handkerchief of some coarse stuff dark blue trousers and slippers with curled up toes on naked feet his eyes were black and sparkling and he had a well trimmed moustache which contrasted oddly with his shabby attire hokar is poor hokar need money he whined in a monotone but with his eyes glancing restlessly round the shop give hokar give and he held out the laces don't want any i tell you shouted bart tartly i'll call a peeler if you don't git ho ho who stole the donkey cried a shrill voice at the door and from behind the hawker was poked a touzelled curly head and a grinning face which sadly needed washing you leave this cove alone won't y he's a pal o' mine d'y see you git along with your pal then cried bart indignantly if he don't understand king's english you do tray tray darted into the middle of the shop and made a face at the indignant shopman by putting his fingers in his mouth to widen it and pulling down his eyes hokar never smiled but showed no disposition to move bart angered at this blocking up the doorway and by tray's war dance jumped the counter he aimed a blow at the guttersnipe's head but missed it and fell full length the next moment tray was dancing on his body with his tongue out derisively then hokar gave a weird smile kalee he said to himself kalee how the scene would have ended it is impossible to say but while bart strove to rise and overturn tray aaron walked in past the indian what's this he asked sharply tray stopped his dancing on bart's prostrate body and gave a shrill whistle by placing two dirty fingers in his mouth then he darted between norman's legs and made off hokar stood staring at the bookseller and after a pause pointed with his finger one eye he said calmly no good aaron was about to inquire what he meant by this insult when the indian walked to the counter and placed something thereon after which he moved away and his voice was heard dying away down the street hokar is poor hokar need money hokar christian what's this demanded norman again assisting bart roughly to his feet blest if i know replied tawsey staring they're mad i think and he related the incoming of the indian and the street arab as for that tray said he growling i'll punch his blooming 'ead when i meets him agin dancing on me yah allays meddlin' that brat jus' as he wos when mr beecot was smashed you saw that accident asked his master fixing his one eye on him yuss said bart slowly i did but deborah she told me to say nothink mr beecot was smashed and his friend the cold eye glarsed gent pulled him from under the wheels of that there machine with tray to help him and between 'em they carried him to the pavement humph said aaron resting his chin on his hand and speaking more to himself than to his assistant so tray was on the spot humph bart having brushed himself moved behind the counter and took up what hokar had left why it's brown sugar he exclaimed touching it with his tongue coarse brown sugar a handful he stretched out his palm heaped with the sugar to his master what do that furrein pusson mean by leaving dirt about i don't know nor do i care snapped aaron who appeared to be out of temper throw it away which bart did after grumbling again at the impudence of the street hawker norman did not go upstairs but descended to the cellar where he busied himself in looking over the contents of the three safes in these were many small boxes filled with gems of all kind cut and uncut also articles of jewellery consisting of necklaces bracelets stars for the hair brooches and tiaras the jewels glittered in the flaring gaslight and aaron fondled them as though they were living things you beauties he whispered to himself with his one eye gloating over his hoard i'll sell you though it goes to my heart to part with lovely things but i must i must and then i'll go not to america oh dear no but to the south seas they won't find me there no no i'll be rich and happy and free sylvia can marry and live happy but the serpent he said in a harsh tone oh the opal serpent the pawnbroker's shop stowley yes i know it i know it stowley they want it back but they sha'n't i'll buy it from beecot by giving him sylvia it's lost lost he looked over his shoulder as he spoke in a terrified whisper perhaps they have it and then then he leaped up and flung the armful of baubles he held on to the deal table and then i must get away away he pulled out three or four coarse sacks of a small size and filled these with the jewellery then he tied a cord round the neck of each sack and sealed it afterwards with a sigh he closed the safe and turned down the gas he did not leave by the trap which led through the shop but opened and locked the back door of the cellar ascended the steps and went out into the street through the side passage if they come he thought as he walked into the gathering night they won't find these no no and he hugged the bags closely sylvia upstairs waited anxiously for the return of her father from the hospital as she both wanted to hear how her lover was progressing and what he said about the permission to marry being given but aaron did not come to supper as was his usual custom bart said when inquiries were made that the master had gone down into the cellar and was probably there meanwhile according to his usual habit he put up the shutters and departed sylvia and deborah ate their frugal meal and retired to bed the girl much disturbed at the absence of her father outside in the street the passers by diminished in number and as the night grew darker and the lamps were lighted hardly a person remained in gwynne street it was not a fashionable thoroughfare and after nightfall few people came that way by eleven o'clock there was not a soul about even the one policeman who usually perambulated the street was conspicuous by his absence sylvia in her bed had fallen into a troubled sleep and was dreaming of paul but not happily she seemed to see him in trouble then she woke suddenly with all her senses alert and sat up faintly she heard a wild cry and then came the twelve strokes of the church bells announcing midnight breathlessly she waited but the cry was not repeated in the darkness she sat up listening until the quarter chimed then the measured footsteps of a policeman were heard passing down the street and dying away sylvia was terrified why she hardly knew but she sprang from her bed and hurried into deborah's room wake up she said there's something wrong deborah was awake in a moment and lighted the lamp on hearing sylvia's story she went down the stairs followed by the girl the door at the bottom strange to say was not locked deborah opened this and peering into the shop gave a cry of alarm and horror lying on the floor was aaron bound hand and foot chapter vii a terrible night go back go back my precious cried deborah her first thought being how to spare sylvia the sight but the girl remembering that agonized cry which had awakened her faint and far away as it sounded pushed past the servant and ran into the middle of the shop the lamp held high by deborah over her head cast a bright circle of light on the floor and in the middle of this sylvia saw her father breathing heavily his hands were bound behind his back in a painful way his feet were tightly fastened and his head seemed to be attached to the floor at least when the body as it seemed from its stillness suddenly writhed it rolled to one side but the head remained almost motionless the two women hung back clutching each other's hands and were almost too horrified to move at the sight look look cried sylvia gasping the mouth deborah looked and gave a moan aaron's mouth was rigidly closed under a glittering jewel deborah bent down still moaning so great did the horror of the thing paralyse her speech and saw the lights flash back from many diamonds she saw bluish gleams and then a red sparkle like the ray of the setting sun it was the opal serpent brooch and aaron's lips were fastened together with the stout pin on his mouth and across his agonised face in which the one eye gleamed with terrific meaning the jewelled serpent seemed to writhe oh poor soul cried deborah falling on her knees with the lamp still held above her head sylvia see the girl gasped again and impulsively knelt also trying with nerveless fingers to unfasten the cruel pin which sealed the man's lips he still lived for they heard him breathing and saw the gleaming eye but even as they looked the face grew black the eye opened and closed convulsively deborah set down the lamp and tried to raise the head she could not lift it from the floor then the bound feet swung in the air and fell again with a dull thud the eye remained wide open staring in a glassy manner the breathing had stopped and the body was motionless he's dead said deborah leaping to her feet and catching away the girl help help her loud voice rang fiercely through the empty shop and echoed round and round but there came no answering cry not a sound could be heard in the street on the bare floor was the lamp shining on that dreadful sight the body with sealed lips and the glittering jewel and leaning against the wall were the two women deborah staring at her dead master but with sylvia's eyes pressed against her bosom so that she might not witness the horror and the stillness deepened weirdly every moment sylvia tried to move her head but deborah pressed it closer to her breast don't my pretty don't she whispered harshly i must i ah the girl freed her head from those kind arms with a wrench and looked at the gruesome sight she staggered forward a few steps and then fell back deborah received her in her arms and thankful that sylvia had fainted carried her up the stairs to lay the unconscious girl on her own bed then she descended rapidly locked the door leading from the shop to the stairs and again looked at the body the time she had been away was about seven or eight minutes and the body still remained with the one open eye staring meaninglessly at the ceiling deborah drawn by fascination like a bird by a serpent crept forward and touched the head it moved and she again tried to lift it this time she found she could do so the head she lifted against her breast and then laid it down with horror when she found the bosom of her nightgown was stained with blood pulling her wits together for she felt that she needed them every one she examined the head and neck to her horror she found round the throat a strong thin copper wire which disappeared through a hole in the floor apparently this had been pulled so tightly as to keep the head down and to choke the old man and so cruelly as to cut deeply into the flesh with a moan of horror deborah dropped the head and ran to the trap door in the corner if anywhere those who had murdered aaron norman were lurking in the cellar but the trap door would not open and then she remembered that it was closed by a bolt underneath she could not reach the midnight assassin that way the front door she gasped and ran to unbolt it the bolts were easily removed but the door was also locked and aaron usually had the key deposited nightly in the cellar by bart repugnant as it was for her to approach the dead body deborah again went forward and felt in the pockets and loose clothing the man was completely dressed even to an overcoat which he wore but she could not find the key and wondered what she was to do probably the key had been hung up in the cellar as usual necessity being the mother of invention she remembered that the window glass was fragile and ran up in the hope of breaking through but the stout shutters were up so deborah found that she was sealed in the house almost in a state of distraction for by this time her nerve had given way she unlocked the door to the stairs and ran up three steps at a time to the sitting room here she opened the window and scrambled out on to the ledge among sylvia's flower pots just as she was wondering how she could get down the measured tread of a policeman was heard and by craning her neck deborah saw him coming leisurely along the street swinging his dark lantern on the windows and doors it was a moonlight night and the street was extraordinarily well lighted as the moon shone straightly between the houses gathering her strength for a last effort deborah yelled as only she could yell and saw the startled officer spinning round looking up and down and sideways to see where the shrieks came from up up oh look up you fool screamed deborah murder oh murder burst in the door call the police drat you help help by this time she was the centre of a circle of bright light for the policeman had located her and his lantern was flashing on her white nightgown as she clung to the window sill what are you making that noise for called up the officer gruffly murder you fool screamed deborah master's murdered number forty five the door's locked break it open police police before she finished the sentence the officer blew his whistle shrilly and ran to the door of the shop against which he placed his shoulder deborah climbed in again by the window and ran down again but even then in her excitement and horror she did not forget to lock the door leading to the stairs so that sylvia might not be disturbed as she descended she flung a thick shawl over her shoulders which she had caught up when leaving her room though for the rest she had nothing on but a nightgown but the poor woman was too terrified to be troubled by any scruples at the moment and reached the shop to hear heavy blows on the door between the thuds deborah could hear footsteps running inward from every quarter i ain't got the key she shrieked through the keyhole break in the door drat you murder murder from the noise she made those without concluded that some terrible crime was taking place within and redoubled their efforts deborah had just time to leap back after a final scream when the door fell flat on the floor and three policemen sprang into the room with drawn batons and their lights flashing like stars the lamp was still on the floor shedding its heavy yellow light on the corpse master gasped deborah pointing a shaking finger dead the the cellar the and here she made as to drop a policeman caught her in his arms but the woman shook herself free i sha'n't faint no i sha'n't faint she gasped the cellar look look she ran forward and raised the head of the dead man when the officers saw the dangling slack wire disappearing through a hole in the floor they grasped the situation the passage outside cried deborah directing operations the trap door she ran to it fast bolted below and them murdering people are there how many are there asked a policeman while several officers ran round the back through the side passage oh you dratted fool how should i know cried deborah fiercely there may be one and there may be twenty go and catch them you're paid for it send to number twenty park street bloomsbury for bart who is bart go and fetch him cried deborah furious at this delay number twenty park street bloomsbury oh what a night this is i'm a goin' to see miss sylvia who has fainted and small blame and she made for the locked door an officer came after her go away shrieked deborah pushing him back i've got next to nothink on and my pretty is ill go away and do your business seeing she was distracted and hardly knew what she was saying the man drew back and deborah ran up the stairs to sylvia's room where she found the poor girl still unconscious meanwhile an inspector had arrived and one of the policemen was detailing all that had occurred from the time deborah had given the alarm at the window the inspector listened quietly to everything and then examined the body strangled with a copper wire he said looking up go for a doctor one of you it goes through the floor he added touching the wire which still circled the throat and must have been pulled from below examine the cellar even as he spoke and while one zealous officer ran off for a medical man there was a grating sound and the trap door was thrown open a policeman leaped into the shop and saluted when he saw his superior by this time the gas had been lighted we've broken down the back door sir said he the cellar door it was locked but not bolted nothing in the cellar everything in order but that wire he pointed to the means used for strangling dangled from the ceiling and a cross piece of wood is bound to the lower end who does the shop belong to aaron norman said the policeman whose beat it was he's a second hand bookseller a quiet harmless timid sort of man anyone about no sir i passed down gwynne street at about a quarter past twelve and all seemed safe when i come back later it might have been twenty minutes and more say twenty five i saw the woman who was down here clinging to a window on the first floor and shouting murder i gave the summons sir and we broke open the door inspector prince laid down the dead man's head and rose to his feet with a nod i'll go upstairs and see the woman he said tell me when the doctor comes upstairs he examined the sitting room and lighted the gas therein then he mounted another storey after looking through the kitchen and dining room in a bedroom he found an empty bed but heard someone talking in a room near at hand flinging open the door he heard a shriek and found himself confronted by deborah who had hastily flung on some clothes don't come in she cried extending her arm for i'm just getting miss sylvia round nonsense said the inspector and pushing her roughly aside he stepped into the room on the bed lay sylvia apparently still unconscious but as the man looked at her she opened her eyes with a long sigh deborah put her arms round the girl and began to talk to her in an endearing way shortly sylvia sat up bewildered what is it she asked then her eyes fell on the policeman oh where is my father he's dead pretty said deborah fondling her don't take on so yes i remember the body on the floor the serpent across the mouth oh oh and she fainted again there cried deborah with bitter triumph see what you've done come come said inspector prince though as gently as possible i am in charge of this case tell me what has happened if you'd use your blessed eyes you'd see murder has happened said miss junk savagely let me attend to my pretty just at this moment a tall young man entered the room it was the doctor the policemen said you were up here he said in a pleasant voice i've examined the body inspector the man is quite dead he has been strangled and in a cruel manner with that copper wire which has cut into the throat to say nothing of this and the doctor held out the brooch that drat it cried deborah vigorously it's the cause of it all i do believe if i died in saying so and she began to rub sylvia's hands vigorously who is this young lady asked the doctor another patient and well she may be said miss junk call yourself a doctor and don't help me to bring her to do what you can said prince and you he added to deborah come down with me i wish to ask you a few questions deborah was no fool and saw that the inspector was determined to make her do what he wanted besides sylvia was in the hands of the doctor and deborah felt that he could do more than she to bring the poor girl to her senses after a few parting injunctions she left the room and went downstairs with the inspector the police had made no further discovery prince questioned not only the gwynne street policeman who had given his report but all others who had been in the vicinity but they could tell him nothing no one suspicious had been seen leaving gwynne street north or south so finding he could learn nothing in this direction prince turned his attention to the servant now then what do you know he asked don't say anything likely to incriminate yourself me shouted deborah bouncing up with a fiery face don't you be taking away my character why i know no more who have done it than a babe unborn and that's stupid enough i 'opes mr policeman ho indeed and we pays our taxes to be insulted by you mr policeman she was very aggravating and many a man would have lost his temper but inspector prince was a quiet and self controlled officer and knew how to deal with this violent class of women he simply waited till deborah had exhausted herself and then gently asked her a few questions finding he was reasonable deborah became reasonable on her part and replied with great intelligence in a few minutes the inspector by handling her deftly learned all that had taken place on that terrible night from the time sylvia had started up in bed at the sound of that far distant cry of a soul in agony and that from what miss sylvia says ended deborah was just before the church clock struck the hour of twelve you came down a quarter of an hour later i did when miss sylvia woke me said deborah she was frightened out of her seven senses and couldn't get up at once yes it was about twenty minutes after the hour we come down to see it and the woman strong nerved as she was shuddered humph said the inspector the assassin had time to escape begging your pardon sir them or him or her or it as murdered master was below in the cellar when we saw the corp not that it was what you'd call a corp then will you say precisely what you mean deborah did so and with such wealth of detail that even the hardened inspector felt the creeps down his official back there was something terribly merciless about this crime the man had been bound like a sheep for the slaughter his mouth had been sealed with the brooch so that he could not cry out and then in the sight of his child and servant he had been slowly strangled by means of the copper wire which communicated with the cellar one of the policemen brought up an auger which evidently had been used to bore the hole for the wire to pass through for the fresh sawdust was still in its whorls who does this belong to prince asked deborah it's bart's said deborah staring he was using it along with other tools to make some deal boxes for master who was going away i expect it was found in the cellar in the tool box for bart allays brought it in tidy like after he'd done his work in the yard weather being fine of course ended deborah sniffing where is this bart in bed like a decent man if he's to be my husband which he is said miss junk tartly i told one of them idle bobbies to go and fetch him from bloomsbury one has gone said another policeman bart tawsey isn't he mr bartholemew tawsey if you please said the servant grandly i only hope he'll be here soon to protect me you're quite safe said prince dryly whereat there was a smile on the faces of his underlings for deborah in her disordered dress and with her swollen flushed excited face was not comely but what about this brooch you say is the cause of it all deborah dropped with an air of fatigue if you kill me i can't talk of it now she protested the brooch belonged to mr paul beecot and where is he in the charing cross hospital if you want to know and as he's engaged to my pretty you needn't think he done it so there i am accusing no one said the inspector grimly but we must get to the bottom of this horrible crime ah well you may call it that wailed deborah with that serping on his poor mouth and him wriggling like an eel to get free but 'ark there's my pretty a calling and miss junk dashed headlong from the shop shouting comfort to sylvia as she went prince looked at the dead man and at the opal serpent which he held in his hand this at one end of the matter and that at the other what is the connecting link between this brooch and that corpse chapter viii the verdict of the jury as may be guessed the murder of aaron norman caused a tremendous sensation one day the name was unknown the next and it was in the mouths of the millions the strange circumstances of the crime the mystery which shrouded it the abominable cruelty of the serpent brooch having been used to seal the man's lips while he was being slowly strangled deepened the interest immensely here at last was a murder worthy of wilkie collins's or gaboriau's handling such a crime as one expected to read of in a novel but never could hope to hear of in real life fact had for once poached on the domains of fiction but notwithstanding all the inquiries which were made and all the vigilance of the police and all the newspaper articles and all the theories sent by people who knew nothing whatever of the matter nothing tangible was discovered likely to lead to a discovery of the assassins or assassin it was conjectured that two people at least had been concerned in the committal of the crime as weak physically though he was the deceased would surely not have allowed himself to be bound by one person however strong that person might be in such a case there would certainly have been a scuffle and as the daughter of the murdered man heard his cry for help which was what sylvia did hear she would certainly have heard the noise of a rough and tumble struggle such as norman would have made when fighting for his life but that single muffled cry was all that had been heard and then probably the brooch had been pinned on the mouth to seal it for ever later the man had been slowly strangled and in the sight of his horrified daughter poor sylvia received a severe shock after witnessing that awful sight and was ill for some days the faithful deborah attended to her like a slave and would allow no one save the doctor to enter the sick room bart tawsey who had been summoned to gwynne street from his bed remained in the empty shop and attended to any domestic duties which miss junk required to be performed she made him cook viands for sylvia and for herself and as he had been trained by her before to act as an emergency cook he did credit to her tuition also bart ran messages saw that the house was well locked and bolted at night and slept on a hastily improvised bed under the counter even deborah's strong nerves were shaken by the horrors she had witnessed and she insisted that bart should remain to protect her and sylvia bart was not over strong but he was wiry and moreover had the courage of a cock sparrow so while he was guarding the house deborah had no fears and could attend altogether to her sick mistress one of the first people to call on miss norman was a dry wizen monkey of a man who announced himself as jabez pash the solicitor of the deceased he had so he said executed aaron's legal business for years and knew all his secrets yet when questioned by the police he could throw no light on the murder but he knew of something strange connected with the matter and this he related to the detective who was now in charge of the case this officer was a chatty agreeable pleasant faced man with brown eyes brown hair and brown skin also to match his face no doubt he wore brown clothes brown boots a brown hat and a brown tie in fact in body face and hands and dress he was all brown and this prevalent color produced rather a strange effect he must ha' bin dyed said miss junk when she set eyes on him but brown is better nor black miss sylvia though black you'll have to wear for your poor par as is gone to a better land let us hope though there's no knowing the brown man who answered to the name of hurd or as he genially described himself billy hurd saw mr pash the lawyer after he had examined everyone he could lay hold of in the hopes of learning something likely to elucidate the mystery what do you know of this matter sir asked the brown man pleasantly pash screwed up his face in a manner worthy of his monkey looks he would have been an absolute image of one with a few nuts in his cheek and as he talked in a chattering sort of way very fast and a trifle incoherent the resemblance was complete i know nothing why my esteemed client should meet with such a death he said but i may mention that on the evening of his death he called round to see me and deposited in my charge four bags of jewels at least he said they were jewels for the bags are sealed and of course i never opened them can i see those bags asked hurd amiably the legal monkey hopped into the next room and beckoned hurd to follow shortly the two were looking into the interior of a safe wherein reposed four bags of coarse white canvas sealed and tied with stout cords the odd thing is said mr pash chewing his words and looking so absurdly like a monkey that the detective felt inclined to call him jacko that on the morning of the murder and before i heard anything about it a stranger came with a note from my esteemed client asking that the bags should be handed over what sort of a man well said pash fiddling with his sharp chin what you might call a seafaring man a sailor maybe would be the best term he was stout and red faced but with drink rather than with weather i should think and he rolled on his bow legs in a somewhat nautical way what name did he give asked hurd writing this description rapidly in his note book none i asked him who he was and he told me with many oaths i regret to say to mind my own business he insisted on having the bags to take back to mr norman but i doubted him oh yes added the lawyer shrewdly i doubted him mr norman always did his own business and never in my experience of him employed a deputy i replied to the unknown nautical man a sailor as you might say he certainly smelt of rum which as we know is a nautical drink well mr hurd i replied that i would take the bags round to mr norman myself and at once this office is in chancery lane as you see and not far from gwynne street so i started with the bags and with the nautical gentleman no he said he would remain behind until i returned so as to receive my apology when i had seen my esteemed client and become convinced of the nautical gentleman's rectitude when i reached gwynne street i found that mr norman was dead and at once took the bags back to replace them in this safe where you now behold them and this sailor asked hurd eyeing mr pash keenly the lawyer sucked in his cheeks and put his feet on the rungs of his chair oh my clerk tells me he left within five minutes of my departure saying he could not wait have you seen him since i have not seen him since but i am glad that i saved the property of my client was norman rich very well off indeed but he did not make his money out of his book selling business in fact said pash putting the tips of his fingers delicately together he was rather a good judge of jewels and a pawnbroker interrupted hurd dryly i have heard all about that from bart tawsey his shopman skip it and go on i can only go on so far as to say that miss norman will probably inherit a fortune of five thousand a year beside the jewels contained in those bags that is said mr pash wisely if the jewels be not redeemed by those who pawned them is there a will asked hurd rising to take his leave pash screwed up his eyes and inflated his cheeks and wriggled so much that the detective expected an acrobatic performance and was disappointed when it did not come off i really can't be sure on that point he said softly i have not yet examined the papers contained in the safe of my deceased and esteemed client he would never allow me to make his will leases yes he has some house property mortgages yes investments yes he entrusted me with all his business save the important one of making a will but a great many other people act in the same strange way though you might not think so mr hurd they would never make a lease or let a house or buy property without consulting their legal adviser yet in the case of wills most important documents many prefer to draw them up themselves consequently there is much litigation over wrongly drawn documents of that nature all the better for you lawyers well i'm off to look for your nautical gentleman do you think he is guilty i can't say said hurd smiling and i never speak unless i am quite sure of the truth it will be hard to come at in this case said the lawyer billy the detective smiled pleasantly and shrugged his brown shoulders so hard that it may never be discovered he said you know many mysteries are never solved i suspect this gwynne street crime will be one of them hurd had learned a great deal about the opal brooch from sylvia and deborah and what they told him resulted in his visiting the charing cross hospital to see paul beecot the young man was much worried his arm was getting better and the doctors assured him he would be able to leave the hospital in a few days but he had received a letter from his mother whom he had informed of his accident she bewailed his danger and wrote with many tears as paul saw from the blotted state of the letter that her domestic tyrant would not allow her to come to london to see her wounded darling this in itself was annoying enough but paul was still more irritated and excited by the report of aaron's terrible death which he saw in a newspaper so much had this moved him that he was thrown into a high state of fever and the doctor refused to allow him to read the papers luckily paul for his own sake had somewhat calmed down when hurd arrived so the detective was permitted to see him he sat by the bedside and told the patient who he was beecot looked at him sharply and then recognized him you are the workman he said astonished yes mr beecot i am i hear that you have not taken my warning regarding your friend mr grexon hay ah then you knew his name all the time of course i did i merely spoke to you to set you on your guard against him he'll do you no good but he was at school with me said beecot angrily that doesn't make him any the better companion replied hurd see here mr beecot we can talk of this matter another time at present as i am allowed to converse with you only for a short time i wish to ask you about the opal serpent paul sat up although hurd tried to keep him down what do you know of that why do you come to me i know very little and want to know more as i told you my name is billy hurd and as i did not tell you i am the detective whom the treasury has placed in charge of this case norman's murder yes have you read the papers a few but not enough the doctors took them from me and gently mr beecot let us talk as little as possible where did you get that brooch why do you want to know you don't suspect me i hope hurd laughed no you have been in this ward all the time but as the brooch was used cruelly to seal the dead man's mouth it seems to me and to inspector prince that the whole secret of the murder lies in tracing it to its original possessor now tell me all about it said billy and spread out his note book i will if you'll tell me about miss norman i'm engaged to marry her and i hear she is ill oh she is much better said hurd pausing pencil in hand don't distress yourself that young lady is all right and when you marry her you'll marry an heiress as i learn from the lawyer who does the business of the deceased i don't care about her being the heiress will you take a message to her from me certainly what is it hurd spoke quite sympathetically for even though he was a detective he was a human being with a kindly heart tell her how sorry i am and that i'll come and see her as soon as i can leave this confounded hospital thanks for your kindness mr hurd now what do you wish to know oh yes about the opal serpent which as you say and as i think seems to be at the bottom of all the trouble listen and paul detailed all he knew taking the story up to the time of his accident hurd listened attentively oh said he with a world of meaning so mr grexon hay was with you hum do you suppose he pushed you into the road on purpose no said paul staring i'm sure he didn't what had he to gain by acting in such a way money you may be sure said hurd that gentleman never does anything without the hope of a substantial reward hush we'll talk of this when you're better mr beecot you say the brooch was lost yes it must have slipped out of my pocket when i fell under the wheels of that machine i believe there were a number of loafers and ragged creatures about so it is just possible i may hear it has been picked up i've sent an advertisement to the papers hurd shook his head you won't hear he said how can you expect to when you know the brooch was used to seal the dead man's lips i forgot that said paul faintly my memory is not so good as it was hurd rose i'll go as i see you are exhausted good bye wait you'll keep me advised of how the case goes certainly if the doctors will allow me to good bye and hurd went away very well satisfied with the information he had obtained the clue as he thought it was led him to wargrove where he obtained useful information from mr beecot who gave it with a very bad grace and offered remarks about his son's being mixed up in the case which made hurd who had taken a fancy to the young fellow protest from wargrove hurd went to stowley in buckinghamshire and interviewed the pawnbroker whose assistant had wrongfully sold the brooch to beecot many years before there he learned a fact which sent him back to mr jabez pash in london i says sir said hurd when again in the lawyer's private room that nautical gentleman of yours pawned that opal serpent twenty years ago more or less never said the monkey screwing up his face and chewing yes indeed the pawnbroker is an old man but he remembers the customer quite well and his description allowing for the time that has elapsed answers to the man who tried to get the jewels from you mr pash chewed meditatively and then inflated his cheeks pooh he said twenty years is a long time a man then and a man now would be quite different some people never change said hurd quietly you have not changed much i suspect no cackled the lawyer rather amused i grew old young and have never altered my looks well this nautical gentleman may be the same he pawned the article under the name of david green a feigned one i suspect then you think he is guilty i have to prove that the brooch came into his possession again before i can do that said hurd grimly and as the brooch was lost in the street by mr beecot i don't see what i can do however it is strange that a man connected with the pawning of the brooch so many years ago should suddenly start up again when the brooch is used in connection with a terrible crime it is strange i congratulate you on having this case mr hurd it is an interesting one to look into and a mighty difficult one said hurd rather depressed i really don't see my way i have got together all the evidence i can but i fear the verdict at the inquest will be wilful murder against some person or persons unknown hurd who was not blind to his own limitations like some detectives proved to be a true prophet the inquest was attended by a crowd of people who might as well have stayed away for all they learned concerning the identity of the assassin it was proved by the evidence of sylvia and deborah how the murder had taken place but it was impossible to show who had strangled the man it was presumed that the assassin or assassins had escaped when deborah went upstairs to shout murder out of the first floor window by that time the policeman on the gwynne street beat was not in sight and it would have been easy for those concerned in the crime if more than one to escape by the cellar door through the passage and up the street to mingle with the people in the strand which even at that late hour would not be deserted or else the assassin or assassins might have got into drury lane and have proceeded towards oxford street but in whatever direction they went none of the numerous policemen around the neighborhood on that fatal night had spotted any suspicious persons it was generally assumed from the peculiar circumstances of the crime that more than one person was inculpated and these had come out of the night had committed the cruel deed and then had vanished into the night leaving no trace behind the appearance of the fellow whom mr pash called the nautical gentleman certainly was strange and led many people to believe that robbery was the motive for the commission of the crime this man who was powerful and could easily have overpowered a little creature like norman came to rob said these wiseacres finding that the jewels were gone and probably from a memorandum finding that they were in the possession of the lawyer he attempted the next morning to get them and so on but against this was placed by other people the cruel circumstances of the crime no mere robbery would justify the brooch being used to pin the dead man's lips together then again the man being strangled before his daughter's eyes was a refinement of cruelty which removed the case from a mere desire on the part of the murdered to get money finally one man as the police thought could not have carried out the abominable details alone so after questions had been asked and evidence obtained and details shifted and theories raised and pros and cons discussed the jury was obliged to bring in the verdict predicted by mr hurd wilful murder against some person or persons unknown said the jury and everyone agreed that this was the only conclusion that could be arrived at of course the papers took up the matter and asked what the police were doing to permit so brutal a murder to take place in a crowded neighborhood and in the metropolis of the world what was civilisation coming to and etc etc all the same the public was satisfied that the police and jury had done their duty so the inquest was held the verdict was given and then the remains of aaron norman were committed to the grave and from the journals everyone knew that the daughter left behind was a great heiress a million of money said the press and lied as usual chapter ix castles in the air so aaron norman the second hand bookseller of gwynne street was dead and buried and it may be said forgotten sylvia and those connected with her remembered the old man and his unhappy end but the public managed to forget all about the matter in a wonderfully short space of time other events took place which interested the readers of the newspapers more and few recalled the strange gwynne street crime many people when they did think said that the assassins would never be discovered but in this they were wrong if money could hunt down the person or persons who had so cruelly murdered aaron norman his daughter and heiress was determined that money could not be better spent and billy hurd knowing all about the case and taking a profound interest in it by reason of the mystery which environed it was selected to follow up what clues there were but while london was still seething with the tragedy and strangeness of the crime mr jabez pash came to the heterogeneously furnished sitting room in gwynne street to read the will for there was a will after all deborah and bart who had witnessed it at the request of their master told mr pash of its existence and he found it in one of the three safes in the cellar it proved to be a short curt document such as no man in his senses would think of making when disposing of five thousand a year aaron was a clever business man and pash was professionally disgusted that he had left behind him such a loose testament why didn't he come to me and have it properly drawn up he asked as he stood in the cellar before the open safe with the scrap of paper in his hand deborah standing near with her hands on her haunches laughed heartily i think master believed he's spent enough money with you sir lor' bless you mr pash so long as the will's tight and fair what do it matter don't tell me as there's anything wrong and that my pretty won't come into her forting oh the will's right enough said pash screwing up his cheeks let us go up to the sitting room is miss sylvia there that she are sir and a getting back her pretty color with mr paul pash looked suspiciously at the handmaiden who is he nobody to be spoke of in that lump of dirt way retorted deborah he's a gentleman who's going to marry my pretty oh the one who had the accident i met him but forgot his name miss junk nodded vigorously and a mercy it was that he wasn't smashed to splinters with spiled looks and half his limbses orf she said why bless you mr pash could i let my sunbeam marry a man as wasn't all there 'eart of gold though he may have but the blessing of providence kept him together shouted deborah in a burst of gratitude and there he sits upstairs with arms to put about my lily queen for the drying of her dear eyes mr pash was not at all pleased at this news and rubbed his nose hard if a proper will had only been made he said aggressively a proper guardian might have been appointed and this young lady would not have been permitted to throw herself away beggin' your parding mr pash said deborah in an offended tone but this marriage is of my making to say nothing of heaven which brought him and my pretty together mr beecot ain't got money but his looks is takin' and his 'eart is all that an angel can want my pretty's chice added the maiden shaking an admonitory finger and my pretty's happiness so don't you go a spilin' of it i have nothing to say save to regret that a young lady in possession of five thousand a year should make a hasty contract like this said mr pash dryly and hopping up the cellar stairs it wasn't hasty cried deborah following and talking all the time six months have them dears billed and cooed lovely and if my queen wants to buy a husband why not just you go up and read the will proper and without castin' cold water on my beauty's warm 'eart or trouble will come of your talkin' i'm mild said deborah chasing the little lawyer up the stairs leading to the first floor mild as flat beer if not roused but if you make me red my 'and flies like a windmill and mr jabez pash heard no more he stopped his legal ears and fled into the sitting room where he found the lovers seated on a sofa near the window sylvia was in paul's embrace and her head was on his shoulder beecot had his arm in a sling and looked pale but his eyes were as bright as ever and his face shone with happiness sylvia also looked happy to know that she was rich that paul was to be her husband filled the cup of her desires to the brim moreover she was beginning to recover from the shock of her father's death and was feverishly anxious to escape from gwynne street and from the house where the tragedy had taken place well said mr pash drawing a long breath and sucking in his cheeks you lose no time young gentleman paul laughed but did not change his position sylvia indeed blushed and raised her head but paul still held her with his uninjured arm defying mr pash and all the world i am gathering rosebuds while i may mr pash said he misquoting herrick's charming line you have plucked a very pretty one grinned the monkey but may i request the rosebud's attention sylvia extricated herself from her lover's arm with a heightened color and nodded gravely seeing it was business she had to descend from heaven to earth but she secretly hoped that this dull little lawyer who was a bachelor and had never loved in his dry little life would soon go away and leave her alone with prince charming deborah guessed these thoughts with the instinct of fidelity and swooped down on her young mistress it's the will poppet she whispered loudly but if it do make your dear head ache mr beecot will listen i wish mr beecot to listen in any case said pash dryly if he is to marry my young and esteemed client we are engaged with the consent of my poor father said sylvia taking paul's hand i shall marry no one but paul and paul will marry an angel said that young man with a tender squeeze although he can't keep her in bread and butter oh i think there will be plenty of bread and butter said the lawyer miss norman we have found the will if added mr pash disdainfully this he held out the document with a look of contempt can be called a will it's all right isn't it asked sylvia anxiously i mean the form and the writing and the paper young lady it is a good will in law and duly signed and witnessed me and bart having written our names lovey put in deborah pash frowned her into silence the will he said looking at the writing consists of a few lines it leaves all the property of the testator to 'my daughter' your daughter screamed deborah why you ain't married i am reading from the will snapped pash coloring and read again i leave all the real and personal property of which i may die possessed of to my daughter sylvia norman cried deborah hugging her darling there you are wrong corrected pash folding up the so called will the name of sylvia isn't mentioned does that make any difference asked paul quietly no miss norman is an only daughter i believe and an only child said deborah so that's all right my pretty you will have them jewels and five thousand a year oh paul what a lot of money cried sylvia appalled whatever will we do with it all why marry and be happy of course said paul rejoicing not so much on account of the money although that was acceptable but because this delightful girl was all his very very own the question is said mr pash who had been reflecting and now reproduced the will from his pocket as to the name what name asked sylvia and deborah echoed the question your name pash addressed the girl direct your father's real name was krill lemuel krill sylvia looked amazed deborah uttered her usual ejaculation lor' but paul's expression did not change he considered that this was all of a piece with the murder and the mystery of the opal brooch undoubtedly mr lemuel krill alias aaron norman must have had good reason to change his name and to exhibit terror at the sight of the brooch and the reason he dreaded whatever it might be had been the cause of his mysterious and tragic death but paul said nothing of these thoughts and there was silence for a few minutes lor' said deborah again and i never knew do he put that name to that mister she asked pointing to the will yes it is signed lemuel krill said pash i wonder you didn't notice it at the moment why bless you mr pash there weren't no moment said deborah her hands on her hips as usual master made that there will only a short time before he was killed pash nodded i note the date said he all in order quite master went on deborah looking at paul never got over that there fainting fit you gave him with the serping brooch and he writes out that will and tells bart and me to put our names to it but he covered up his own name with a bit of red blotting paper i never thought but that he hadn't put aaron norman which was his name it was not his name said pash his real name i have told you and for years i have known the truth do you know why he changed his name asked beecot quickly no sir i don't and if i did i don't know if it would be legal etiquette to reveal the reason to a stranger he's not a stranger cried sylvia annoyed well then to a young gentleman whom i have only seen twice why do you ask mr beecot i was wondering if the change of name had anything to do with the murder said paul hesitating how could it said pash testily when the man never expected to be murdered beggin' your parding mr pash but you're all out said deborah master did expect to have his throat cut or his 'ead knocked orf or his inside removed deborah cried paul hastily you are making sylvia nervous don't you worrit pretty said the maiden it's only silly old debby's way but master your par as was my pretty went to church and prayed awful against folk as he never named to say nothin' of lookin' over the left shoulder blade and sleepin' in the cellar bolted and barred and always with his eye on the ground sad like old baileys and police courts was in his mind say what you like i say nothing rejoined pash putting on his hat and hopping to the door mr lemuel krill did not honor me with his confidence so far he came here over twenty years ago and began business i was then younger than i am and he gave me his business because my charges were moderate i know all about him as aaron norman added pash with emphasis but as lemuel krill i knowing nothing but the name can say nothing nor do i want to young people ended the lawyer impressively let sleeping dogs lie what do you mean asked sylvia looking startled nothing he means nothing interposed paul hastily for the girl had undergone quite enough torments what about the change of name ah yes said the lawyer inquiringly will you call yourself krill or norman miss sylvia seein' her name's to be changed to beecot in a jiffy cried deborah it don't matter and it sha'n't matter you leave krill and its old baileys if old baileys there are in it alone my lovey and be miss norman till the passon and the clark and the bells and the ringers and the lawr and the prophets turn you into the loveliest bride as ever was and deborah nodded vigorously i wish father had mentioned my name in his will said sylvia in a low voice and then i should know what to call myself paul addressed the lawyer i know little about the legal aspect of this will this amateur will said pash slightingly but i should like to know if there will be any difficulty in proving it i don't think so i have not gone through all the safes below and may come across the marriage certificate of miss krill's i beg pardon miss norman's mother and father then there's the birth certificate we must prove that miss sylvia is the daughter of my late esteemed client what's that shouted deborah why i knowed her mother as died she's the daughter right enough and there's no need to shout chattered pash angrily i know that as well as you do i must act however as reason dictates i'll prove the will and see that all is right then dreading deborah's tongue he hastily added good day and left the room but he was not to escape so easily deborah plunged after him and made scathing remarks about legal manners all the way down to the door paul and sylvia left alone looked and smiled and fell into one another's arms the will had been read and the money left to the girl thereby the future was all right so they thought that pash's visit demanded no further attention he'll do all that is to be done said paul i don't see the use of keeping a dog and having to bark yourself and i'm really a rich woman paul said sylvia gladly really and truly as i am a pauper i think perhaps said beecot sadly that you might make a better match than sylvia put her pretty hand over his moustache i won't hear it paul she cried vehemently with a stamp of her foot how dare you as if you weren't all i have to love in the world now poor father is is de a d and she began to weep i did not love him as i ought to have done paul my own he would not let you love him very much n o o said sylvia drying her eyes on paul's handkerchief which he produced i don't know why sometimes he was nice and sometimes he wasn't i never could understand him and you know paul we didn't treat him nicely no admitted beecot frankly but he forgave us oh yes poor dear he did he was quite nice when he said we could marry and he would allow us money you saw him i did he came to the hospital didn't he tell you when he returned sylvia i never saw him she wept he never came upstairs but went out and i went to bed he left the door leading to the stairs open too on that night a thing he never did before and then the key of the shop bart used to hang it on a nail in the cellar and father would put it into his pocket after supper deborah couldn't find it in his clothes and when she went afterwards to the cellar it was on the nail on that night paul father did everything different to what he usually did he seems to have had some mental trouble said paul gently and i believe it was connected with that brooch when he spoke to me at the hospital he said he would let you marry me and would allow us an income if i gave him the serpent brooch to take to america but why did he want the brooch asked sylvia puzzled ah said beecot with great significance if we could find out his reason we would learn who killed him and why he was killed sylvia wept afresh on this reference to the tragedy which was yet fresh in her memory but as weeping would not bring back the dead and paul was much distressed at the sight of her tears she dried her eyes for the hundredth time within the last few days and sat again on the sofa by her lover there they built castles in the air i tell you what sylvia said paul reflectively after this will business is settled and a few weeks have elapsed we can marry oh paul not for a year think of poor father's memory i do think of it my darling and i believe i am saying what your father himself would have said the circumstances of the case are strange as you are left with a lot of money and without a protector you know i love you for yourself and would take you without a penny but unless we marry soon and you give me a husband's right you will be pestered by people wanting to marry you paul thought of grexon hay when he made this last remark but i wouldn't listen to them cried sylvia with a flush and debby would soon send them away i love you dearest dear then marry me next month said paul promptly you can't stop here in this dull house and it will be awkward for you to go about with deborah faithful though she is no darling let us marry and then we shall go abroad for a year or two until all this sad business is forgotten then i hope by that time to become reconciled to my father and we can visit wargrove sylvia reflected she saw that paul was right as her position was really very difficult she knew of no lady who would chaperon her and she had no relative to act as such certainly deborah could be a chaperon but she was not a lady and pash could be a guardian but he was not a relative paul as her husband would be able to protect her and to look after the property which sylvia did not think she could do herself these thoughts made her consent to an early marriage and i really don't think father would have minded i am quite sure we are acting as he would wish said beecot decisively i am so thankful sylvia sweetest that i met you and loved you before you became an heiress no one can say that i marry you for anything save your own sweet self and i am doubly glad that i am to marry you and save you from all the disagreeable things which might have occurred had you not been engaged to me i know paul i am so young and inexperienced you are an angel said he embracing her but there's one thing we must do and his voice became graver we must see pash and offer a reward for the discovery of the person who killed your father but mr pash said let sleeping dogs lie objected sylvia i know he did but out of natural affection little as your poor father loved you we must stir up this particular dog i suggest that we offer a reward of five hundred pounds to whom asked sylvia thoroughly agreeing to anyone who can find the murderer i think myself that hurd will be the man to gain the money apart from any reward he has to act on behalf of the treasury and besides he is keen to discover the mystery you leave the matter to me sylvia we will offer a reward for the discovery of the murderer of aaron norman said sylvia quickly no replied her lover gravely of lemuel krill chapter x a bolt from the blue paul's reason for advertising the name of lemuel krill was a very natural one he believed that in the past of the dead man was to be found his reason for changing his name and living in gwynne street and in that past before he became a second hand bookseller and a secret pawnbroker might be found the motive for the crime therefore if a reward was offered for the discovery of the murderer of lemuel krill alias aaron norman something might come to light relative to the man's early life once that was known the clue might be obtained then the truth would surely be discovered he explained this to hurd i think you're right mr beecot said the detective in his genial way and looking as brown as a coffee bean i have made inquiries from the two servants and from the neighbors and from what customers i could find aaron norman certainly lived a very quiet and respectable life here but lemuel krill may have lived a very different one and the mere fact that he changed his name shows that he had something to conceal when we learn that something we may arrive at the motive for the murder and given that the assassin may be caught the assassin echoed paul then you think there was only one hurd shrugged his shoulders who knows he said i speak generally from the strange circumstances of the crime i am inclined to think that there is more than one person concerned in this matter however the best thing to be done is to have hand bills printed offering the five hundred pounds reward people will do a lot to earn so much money and someone may come forward with details about mr krill which will solve the mystery of norman's death i hope you will gain the reward yourself hurd the detective nodded i hope so too i have lately married the sweetest little wife in the world and i want to keep her in the way she has been accustomed to be kept she married beneath her as i'm only a thief catcher and no very famous one either but if you solve this mystery it will do you a lot of good that it will agreed billy heartily and it will mean advancement and extra screw besides the reward if i can get it you may be very sure mr beecot that i'll do my best oh by the way he added have you heard that mr pash is being asked for many of those jewels no who are asking for them not that nautical man hurd shook his head he's not such a fool said he no but the people who pledged the jewels are getting them back redeeming them in fact pash is doing all the business thoroughly well and will keep what jewels remain for the time allowed by law so that all those who wish to redeem them can do so if not they can be sold and that will mean more money to miss norman by the way i presume she intends to remain miss norman until i make her mrs beecot said paul smiling well replied hurd very heartily i trust you will both be happy i think miss norman will get a good husband in you and you will gain the sweetest wife in the world bar one everyone thinks his own crow the whitest laughed beecot but now that business is ended and you know what you are to do will you tell me plainly why you warned me against grexon hay hum said the detective looking at paul with keen eyes what do you know about him sir beecot detailed his early friendship with hay at torrington and then related the meeting in oxford street and so far as i have seen added paul justly there's nothing about the man to make me think he is a bad lot it is natural you should think well of him as you know no wrong mr beecot all the same grexon hay is a man on the market you made use of that expression before what does it mean ask mr hay he can explain best i did ask him and he said it meant a man who was on the marriage market hurd laughed very ingenious and untrue untrue certainly mr hay knows better than that if that were all he wouldn't think a working man would warn anyone against him he guessed you were not a working man said paul and intimated that he had a liaison with a married woman and that the husband had set you to watch wrong again my interest in mr hay doesn't spring from divorce proceedings he paints himself blacker than he is in that respect mr beecot my gentleman is too selfish to love and too cautious to commit himself to a divorce case where there would be a chance of damages no he's simply a man on the market and what that is no one knows better than he does well i am ignorant you shall be enlightened sir and i hope what i tell you will lead you to drop this gentleman's acquaintance especially now that you will be a rich man through your promised wife miss norman's money is her own said paul with a quick flush i don't propose to live on what she inherits of course not because you are an honorable man but i'll lay anything you like that mr hay won't have your scruples and as soon as he finds your wife is rich he'll try and get money from her through you he'll fail then rejoined beecot calmly i am not up to your london ways perhaps but i am not quite such a fool perhaps you will enlighten me as you say hurd nodded and caught his smooth chin with his finger and thumb a man on the market he explained slowly is a social highwayman i am still in the dark hurd well to be more particular hay is one of those well dressed blackguards who live on mugs he has no money i beg your pardon he told me himself that his uncle had left him a thousand a year pooh he might as well have doubled the sum and increased the value of the lie he hasn't a penny what he did have he got through pretty quickly in order to buy his experience now that he is hard up he practises on others what was practised on himself hay is well bred good looking well dressed and plausible he has well furnished rooms and keeps a valet he goes into rather shady society as decent people having found him out won't have anything to do with him but he is a card sharper and a fraudulent company promoter he'll borrow money from any juggins who is ass enough to lend it to him he haunts piccadilly bond street and the burlington arcade and is always smart and bland and fascinating if he sees a likely victim he makes his acquaintance in a hundred ways and then proceeds to fleece him in a word mr beecot you may put it that mr hay is captain hawk and those he swindles are pigeons paul was quite startled by this revelation and it was painful to hear it of an old school friend he does not look like a man of that sort he remonstrated it's not his business to look like a man of that sort rejoined the detective he masks his batteries all the same he is one of the most dangerous men on the market at the present in town a young peer whom he plucked two years ago lost everything to him and got into trouble over some woman it was a nasty case and hay was mixed up in it the relatives of the victim i needn't give his title asked me to put things right i got the young nobleman away and he is now travelling to acquire the sense he so sadly needed i have given mr hay a warning once or twice and he knows that he is being watched by us when he slips as he is bound to do sooner or later then he'll have to deal with me oh i know how he hunts for clients in fashionable hotels smart restaurants theatres and such like places he is clever and although he has fleeced several lambs since he plucked the pigeon i saved he has as yet been too clever to be caught when i saw you with him mr beecot i thought it just as well to put you on your guard i fear he'll get little out of me said paul i am too poor you are rich now through your promised wife and hay will find it out i repeat that miss norman's money has nothing to do with me and i may mention that as soon as the case is in your hands mr hurd which it is now interpolated the detective i intend to marry miss norman and then we will travel for a time that's very wise of you give hay a wide berth of course if you meet him you needn't tell him what i have told you but when he tries to come captain hawk over you be on your guard i shall and thanks for the warning so the two parted hurd went away to have the bills printed and paul returned to gwynne street to arrange with sylvia about their early marriage deborah was in the seventh heaven of delight that her young mistress would soon be in a safe haven and enjoy the protection of an honorable man knowing that she would soon be relieved from care she told bart tawsey that they would be married at the same time as the young couple and that the laundry would be started as soon as mr and mrs beecot left for the continent bart of course agreed he always did agree with deborah and so everything was nicely arranged meanwhile pash worked to prove the will pay the death duties and to place sylvia in full possession of her property he found in one of the safes the certificate of the girl's birth and also the marriage certificate of aaron norman in the name of lemuel krill the man evidently had his doubts of the marriage being a legal one if contracted under his alias he had married lillian garner who was described as a spinster but who she was and where she came from and what her position in life might be could not be discovered krill was married in a quiet city church and pash having searched found everything in order mrs krill or norman as she was known lived only a year or two after her marriage and then died leaving sylvia to the care of her husband there were several nurses in succession until deborah grew old enough to attend alone on her young mistress then norman dismissed the nurse and deborah had been sylvia's slave and aaron's servant until the tragic hour of his death so everything being in order there was no difficulty in placing sylvia in possession of her property pash was engaged in this congenial work for several weeks and during that time all went smoothly paul paid daily visits to the gwynne street house which was to be vacated as soon as he made sylvia his wife deborah searched for her laundry and obtained the premises she wanted at a moderate rental sylvia basked in the sunshine of her future husband's love and hurd hunted for the assassin of the late mr norman without success the hand bills with his portrait and real name and a description of the circumstances of his death were scattered broadcast over the country from land's end to john o'groats but hitherto no one had applied for the reward the name of krill seemed to be a rare one and the dead man apparently had no relatives for no one took the slightest interest in the bills beyond envying the lucky person who would gain the large reward offered for the conviction of the murderer then one day deborah while cleaning out the cellar found a piece of paper which had slipped down behind one of the safes these had not been removed for many years and the paper apparently placed carelessly on top had accidentally dropped behind deborah always thinking something might reveal the past to sylvia and afford a clue to the assassin brought the paper to her mistress it proved to be a few lines of a letter commenced but never finished but the few lines were of deep interest my dear daughter these ran when i die you will find that i married your mother under the name of lemuel krill that is my real name but i wish you to continue to call yourself norman for necessary reasons if the name of krill gets into the papers there will be great trouble keep it from the public i can tell you where to find the reasons for this as i have written here the letter ended abruptly without any signature norman apparently was writing it when interrupted and had placed it unfinished on the top of the safe whence it had fallen behind to be discovered by deborah and now it had strangely come to light but too late for the request to be carried out oh paul said sylvia in dismay when they read this together and the bills are already published with the real name of my father it is unfortunate admitted paul frowning but after all your father may have been troubled unnecessarily for over the fortnight the bills have been out and no one seems to take an interest in the matter but i think we ought to call the bills in said sylvia uneasily that's not such an easy matter they are scattered broadcast and it will be next to impossible to collect them besides the mischief is done everyone knows by this time that aaron norman is lemuel krill so the trouble whatever it may be must come what can it be asked the girl anxiously paul shook his head heaven only knows said he with a heavy heart there is certainly something in your father's past life which he did not wish known and which led to his death but since the blow has fallen and he is gone i do not see how the matter can affect you my darling i'll show this to pash and see what he says i expect he knows more about your father's past than he will admit but if there should be trouble paul you will have me to take it off your shoulders he replied kissing her my dearest do not look so pale whatever may happen you will always have me to stand by you and deborah also she is worth a regiment in her fidelity so sylvia was comforted and paul putting the unfinished letter in his pocket went round to see pash in his chancery lane office he was stopped in the outer room by a saucy urchin with an impudent face and a bold manner mr pash is engaged said this official so you'll 'ave to wait mr beecot paul looked down at the brat who was curly headed and as sharp as a needle how do you know my name he asked i never saw you before i'm the new office boy said the urchin wishin' to be respectable and leave street 'awking which ain't what it was m'name's tray an' i've seen you afore mister i 'elped to pull you out from them wheels with the 'aughty gent as guv me a bob fur doin' it oh so you helped said paul smiling well here is another shilling i am much obliged to you master tray but from what deborah junk says you were a guttersnipe how did you get this post i talked m'self int' it said tray importantly newspapers ain't good enough and you gets pains in wet weather so i turns a good boy he grinned evilly and goes to a ragged kids' school to do the 'oly the superintendent ses i'm a promising case and he arsked mr pash as is also sunday inclined to 'elp me the orfice boy 'ere went and i come tray tossed the shilling and spat on it for luck as he slipped it into the pocket of quite a respectable pair of trousers so i'm on m'waiy to bein' lord mayor turn agin wittington as they ses in the panymine well said beecot amused i hope you will prove yourself worthy tray winked ho i'm straight es long es it's wuth m'while i takes m'sal'ry 'ome to gran and don't plaiy pitch an' torse n'more he winked again and looked as wicked a brat as ever walked paul had his doubts as to what the outcome of mr pash's charity would be and being amused was about to pursue the conversation when the inner door opened and pash looking troubled appeared when he saw paul he started and came forward i was just about to send tray for you said he looking anxious something unpleasant has come to light in connection with krill beecot started and brought out the scrap of paper look at that he said and you will see that the man warned sylvia pash glanced hurriedly over the paper most unfortunate he said folding it up and puffing out his cheeks but it's too late the name of krill was in those printed bills a portrait also and now well what asked paul seeing the lawyer hesitated come inside and you'll see said pash and conducted beecot into the inner room here sat two ladies the elder was a woman of over fifty but who looked younger owing to her fresh complexion and plump figure she had a firm face with hard blue eyes and a rather full lipped mouth her hair was white and there was a great deal of it under a widow's cap it was dressed a la marie antoinette and she looked very handsome in a full blown flowery way she had firm white hands rather large and as she had removed her black gloves these paul saw were covered with cheap rings altogether a respectable well dressed widow but evidently not a lady nor was the girl beside her who revealed sufficient similarity of features to announce herself the daughter of the widow there was the same fresh complexion full red lips and hard blue eyes but the hair was of a golden color and fashionably dressed the young woman she likewise was not a lady was also in black this said pash indicating the elder woman who smiled is mrs lemuel krill the wife of the man who called himself aaron norman went on the widow and this she indicated her daughter is his heiress chapter xi a cuckoo in the nest paul looked from the fresh colored woman who spoke so smoothly and so firmly to the apish lawyer hunched in his chair with a sphinx like look on his wrinkled face for the moment so taken aback was he by this astounding announcement that he could not speak the younger woman stared at him with her hard blue eyes and a smile played round her full lips the mother also looked at him in an engaging way as though she rather admired his youthful comeliness in spite of his well brushed shabby apparel i don't know what you mean said beecot at length mr pash the lawyer aroused himself to make a concise statement of the case so far as i understand he said in his nervous irritable way these ladies claim to be the wife and daughter of lemuel krill whom we knew as aaron norman and i think by his real name also said the elder woman in her deep smooth contralto voice and with the display of an admirable set of teeth the bills advertising the reward and stating the fact of the murder bore my late husband's real name norman was not your husband madam cried paul indignantly i agree with you sir lemuel krill was my husband i saw in the newspapers which penetrate even into the quiet little hants village i live in that aaron norman had been murdered i never thought he was the man who had left me more than twenty years ago with an only child to bring up but the bills offering the reward assured me that norman and krill are one and the same man therefore she drew herself up and looked piercingly at the young man i have come to see after the property i understand from the papers that my daughter is an heiress to millions not millions said pash hastily the newspapers have exaggerated the amount five thousand a year madam and it is left to sylvia who is sylvia asked mrs krill in the words of shakespeare's song she is the daughter of mr norman said paul quickly and is engaged to marry me mrs krill's eyes travelled over his shabby suit from head to foot and then back again from foot to head she glanced sideways at her companion and the girl laughed in a hard contemptuous manner i fear you will be disappointed in losing a rich wife sir said the elder woman sweetly i have not lost the money yet replied paul hotly not that i care for the money of course not put in mrs krill ironically with another look at his dress but i do care for sylvia norman with whom i have nothing to do she is your husband's daughter but not mine this is my daughter maud the legal daughter of lemuel and myself she added meaningly good heavens madam cried beecot his face turning white what do you mean mrs krill raised her thick white eyebrows and shrugged her plump shoulders and made a graceful motion with her white be ringed hand is there any need for me to explain she said calmly i think there is every need cried beecot sharply i shall not allow miss norman to lose her fortune or or lose it yourself sir i quite understand nevertheless i am assured that the law of the land will protect through me my daughter's rights she leaves it in my hands yes said the girl in a voice as full and rich and soft as her smooth faced mother i leave it in her hands paul sat down and concealed his face with a groan he was thinking not so much of the loss of the money although that was a consideration as of the shame sylvia would feel at her position then a gleam of hope darted into his mind mr norman was married to sylvia's mother under his own name you can't prove the marriage void i have no wish to when did this marriage take place beecot looked at the lawyer who replied twenty two years ago and he gave the date mrs krill fished in a black morocco bag she carried and brought out a shabby blue envelope i thought this might be needed she said passing it to pash you will find there my marriage certificate i became the wife of lemuel krill thirty years ago and as i am still living i fear the later marriage she smiled blandly and shrugged her shoulders again poor girl she said with covert insolence sylvia does not need your pity cried beecot stung by the insinuation indeed sir said mrs krill sadly and with the look of a treacherous cat i fear she needs the pity of all right thinking people many would speak harshly of her seeing what she is but my troubles have taught me charity i repeat that i am sorry for the girl and again i say there is no need rejoined paul throwing back his head and you forget madam there is a will mrs krill's fresh color turned to a dull white and her hard eyes shot fire a will she said slowly i shall dispute the will if it is not in my favor i am the widow of this man and i claim full justice besides she went on wetting her full lips with her tongue i understood from the newspapers that the money was left to mr krill's daughter certainly to sylvia krill norman sir she has no right to any other name but i really do not see why i should explain myself to you sir if you choose to give this girl your name you will be doing a good act at present the poor creature is nobody she let the last word drop from her lips slowly so as to give paul its full sting beecot said nothing he could not dispute what she said if this woman could prove the marriage of thirty years ago then krill or norman as he called himself had committed bigamy and in the hard eyes of the law sylvia was nobody's child and that the marriage could be proved paul saw well enough from the looks of the lawyer who was studying the certificate which he had drawn from the shabby blue envelope then the will the money is left to sylvia he said with obstinacy i shall defend her rights of course said mrs krill significantly i understand that a wife with five thousand i would marry sylvia without a penny indeed sir that is the only way in which you can marry her if you like i shall allow her twenty pounds for a trousseau paul rose and flung back his head again you have not got the money yet madam he said defiantly not at all disturbed mrs krill smiled her eternal smile i am here to get it there is a will you say she added turning to pash and i understand from this gentleman she indicated beecot slightly that the money is left to mr krill's daughter does he name maud or sylvia pash slapped down the certificate irritably he names no one the will is a hasty document badly worded and simply leaves all the testator died possessed of to my daughter which of course means maud here i congratulate you dear she said turning to the girl who looked happy and flushed your father has made up to us both for his cruelty and desertion seeing that there was nothing to be said paul went to the door but there his common sense left him and he made a valedictory speech i know that mr krill left the money to sylvia oh no said the widow to his daughter as i understand the wording of the will runs in that case this nameless girl has nothing pash cried beecot turning despairingly to the little solicitor the old man shook his head and sucked in his cheeks i am sorry mr beecot said he in a pitying tone but as the will stands the money must certainly go to the child born in wedlock i have the certificate here he laid his monkey paw on it but of course i shall make inquiries by all means said mrs krill graciously my daughter and myself have lived for many years in christchurch hants we keep the inn there not the principal inn but a small public house on the outskirts of the village it will be a change for us both to come into five thousand a year after such penury of course mr pash you will act for my daughter and myself mr pash acts for sylvia cried paul still lingering at the door the lawyer was on the horns of a dilemma if what mrs krill says is true i can't dispute the facts he said irritably and i am unwilling to give up the business prove to me ma'am that you are the lawful widow of my late client and that this is my late esteemed client's lawful daughter and i will act for you mrs krill's ample bosom rose and fell and her eyes glittered triumphantly she cast a victorious glance at beecot but that young man was looking at the solicitor rats leave the sinking ship said he bitterly you will not prosper pash everyone prospers who protects the widow and the orphan said pash in a pious tone and so disgusted paul that he closed the door with a bang and went out tray was playing chuck farthing at the door and keeping mr grexon hay from coming in you there beecot said this gentleman coldly i wish you would tell this brat to let me enter brat yourself y' toff cried tray pocketing his money ain't i a doin' as my master tells me he's engaged with two pretty women he leered in a way which made paul long to box his ears so i don't spile sport you've got tired of them mr beecot how do you know mr beecot's name asked hay calmly lor' sir didn't you and me pull him from under the wheels oh said grexon suddenly enlightened were you the boy since you have washed your face i didn't recognize you well beecot you look disturbed i have reason to and since you and this boy pulled me from under the wheels of the motor said paul glancing from one to the other i should like to know what became of the brooch i'm sure i don't know said grexon quietly we talked of this before i gave it as my opinion if you remember that it was picked up in the street by the late aaron norman and was used to seal his mouth at least that is the only way in which i can conjecture you lost it you never saw it drop from my pocket i should have picked it up and returned it had i seen it said hay fixing his eye glass perhaps this boy saw it saw what asked tray who was listening with both his large ears an old blue velvet case with a brooch inside said beecot quickly tray shook his head vigorously if i'd seen it i' ha' nicked it he said impudently catch me givin' it back t' y' mr beecot there's a cove i knows a fence that is as 'ud give me lots fur it lor' said tray with deep disappointment to think as that dropped out of your pocket and i never grabbed it wot crewel luck ho and he spat paul looked hard at the boy who met his gaze innocently enough apparently he spoke in all seriousness and really lamented the lost chance of gaining a piece of jewellery to make money out of moreover had he stolen the brooch he would hardly have talked so openly of the fence he alluded to hay the young man could not suspect as there was positively no reason why he should steal so comparatively trifling an article sharper as he was hay flew at higher game and certainly would not waste his time or risk his liberty in stealing what would bring him in only a few shillings why don't you ask the detectives to search for the brooch said hay smiling it is in the detective's possession said paul sullenly but we want to know how it came to pin norman's lips together i can't imagine unless he picked it up if lost at all it must have been lost in the street the old man lived in and you told me he wanted the brooch badly but he wasn't on the spot wot cried tray suddenly the one eyed cove ho yuss but warn't he why when they was a gitin' the ambulance an' the peelers wos a crowdin' round he come dancing like billeo out of his shorp beecot thought this was strange as he understood from deborah and bart and sylvia that norman had known nothing of the accident at the time then again norman himself had not mentioned it when he paid that visit to the hospital within a few hours of his death i don't think that's true he said to tray sharply oh cuss it said that young gentleman wot d' i care th' ole cove come an' danced in the mud and then he gits int' his shorp again trew is trew saiy wot y' like mister ho beecot turned his back on the boy after all he was not worth arguing with and a liar by instinct still in this case he might have spoken the truth norman might have appeared on the scene of the accident and have picked up the brooch paul thought he would tell hurd this and meantime held out his hand to hay in spite of the bad character he had heard of that young man he saw no reason why he should not be civil to him until he found him out meantime he was on his guard one moment said grexon grasping the outstretched hand i have something to say to you and he walked a little way with paul i am going in to see pash on business which means a little money to me i was the unfortunate cause of your accident beecot so i think you might accept twenty pounds or so from me no thank you all the same said paul gratefully yet with a certain amount of caution i can struggle along after all it was an accident a very unfortunate one said hay more heartily than usual i shall never forgive myself is your arm all right oh much better i'll be quite cured in a week or so and meantime how do you live i manage to get along replied paul reservedly he did not wish to reveal the nakedness of the land to such a doubtful acquaintance you are a hard hearted sort of chap said hay coldly but rather annoyed at his friendly advances being flouted well then if you won't accept a loan let me help you in another way come and dine at my rooms i have a young publisher coming also and if you meet him he will be able to do something for you he's under obligations to me and you may be certain i'll use all my influence in your favor come now next tuesday that's a week off you can't have any engagement at such a long notice paul smiled i never do have any engagements he said with his boyish smile thank you i'll look in if i can but i am in trouble grexon very great trouble you shouldn't be said hay smiling i know well enough why you will not accept my loan the papers say sylvia your dulcinea has inherited a million you are to marry her unless said hay suddenly this access of wealth has turned her head and she has thrown you over is she that sort of girl no said paul quietly she is as true to me as i am to her but you are mistaken as to the million it is five thousand a year and she may not even inherit that what do you mean i am not at liberty to say but with regard to your dinner added paul hastily changing the conversation i'll come if i can get my dress suit out of pawn then i count on you said hay blandly though you will not let me help you to obtain the suit however this publisher will do a lot for you by jove what a good looking girl he said this under his breath miss maud krill appeared on the doorstep where the two young men stood and stumbled against grexon in passing his hat was off at once and he apologized profusely miss krill who seemed a young woman of few words as paul thought from her silence in the office smiled and bowed but passed on without saying a thank you mrs krill followed escorted by the treacherous pash who was all smiles and hand washings and bows apparently he was quite convinced that the widow's story was true and paul felt sick at the news he would have to tell sylvia pash saw the young man and meeting his indignant eyes darted back into his office like a rabbit into its burrow the widow sailed out in her calm serene way without a look at either paul or his companion yet the young man had an instinct that she saw them both that's the mother i expect said hay putting his glass firmly into his eye a handsome pair gad paul that young woman eh perhaps you'd like to marry her said paul bitterly hay drew himself up stiffly i don't marry stray young women i see on the street however attractive he said in his cold voice i don't know either of these ladies pash will introduce you if you make it worth his while why the deuce should i retorted hay staring well said beecot impulsively telling the whole of the misfortune that had befallen him that is the wife and that is the daughter of aaron norman alias krill the daughter inherits five thousand a year so marry her and be happy but your dulcinea asked grexon dropping his eye glass in amazement she has me and poverty said paul turning away nor could the quiet call of hay make him stop but at the end of the street he looked back and saw grexon entering the office of the lawyer if hay was the man hurd said he was paul guessed that he would inquire about the heiress and marry her too if her banking account was large and safe chapter xii the new life for obvious reasons beecot did not return to gwynne street it was difficult to swallow this bitter pill which providence had administered in place of an assured future with sylvia he found himself confronted with his former poverty with no chance of marrying the girl and with the obligation of telling her that she had no right to any name paul was by no means a coward and his first impulse was to go at once and inform sylvia of her reverse of fortune but it was already late and he thought it would be only kind to withhold the bad news till the morrow and thus avoid giving the disinherited girl a tearful and wakeful night therefore after walking the embankment till late paul went to his garret to the young man's credit it must be said that he cared very little for the loss of the money although he grieved on sylvia's account had he been able to earn a small income he would have married the girl and given her the protection of his name without the smallest hesitation but he was yet unknown to fame he was at variance with his father and he could scarcely bring sylvia to share his bitter poverty which might grow still more bitter in that cold and cheerless garret then there was another thing to consider paul had written to his father explaining the circumstances of his engagement to sylvia and asking for the paternal blessing to gain this he mentioned that his promised wife had five thousand a year bully and tyrant as beecot senior was he loved money and although well off was always on the alert to have more brought into the family with the bribe of a wealthy wife paul had little doubt but what the breach would be healed and sylvia welcomed as the sweetest and most desirable daughter in law in the world then paul fancied the girl would be able to subdue with her gentle ways the stubborn heart of his father and would also be able to make mrs beecot happy indeed he had received a letter from his mother congratulating him on his wealthy match for the good lady wished to see paul independent of the domestic tyrant also mrs beecot had made many inquiries about sylvia's goodness and beauty and hoped that he had chosen wisely and hinted that no girl living was worthy of her son after the fashion of mothers paul had replied to this letter setting forth his own unworthiness and sylvia's perfections and mrs beecot had accepted the good news with joy but the letter written to beecot senior was yet unanswered and paul began to think that not even the chance of having a rich daughter in law would prevail against the obstinacy of the old gentleman but when he reached his garret after that lonely and tormenting walk on the embankment he found a letter from his father and opened it with some trepidation it proved to contain joyful news mr beecot thanked heaven that paul was not such a fool as he had been of yore and hinted that this sudden access of sense which had led him to engage himself to a wealthy girl had come from his father and not from his mother he beecot senior was aware that paul had acted badly and had not remembered what was due to the best of fathers but since he was prepared to settle down with a rich wife beecot senior nobly forgave the past and paul's many delinquences mentioned in detail and would be glad to welcome his daughter in law then beecot becoming the tyrant again insisted that the marriage should take place in wargrove and that the fact of sylvia's father being murdered should be suppressed in fact the old gentleman left nothing to the young couple but arranged everything in his own selfish way even to choosing in wargrove the house they would inhabit the house he mentioned was one of his own which could not be let on account of some trivial tale of a ghost and mr beecot would give this as a marriage gift to paul thus getting rid of an unprofitable property and playing the part of a generous father at one and the same time in spite of his bucolic ways and pig headed obstinacy and narrow views beecot senior possessed a certain amount of cunning which paul read in every line of the selfish letter before him however the main point was that the old gentleman seemed ready to overlook the past and to receive sylvia paul wanted to return to his home not so much on account of his father as because he wished to smooth the remaining years of his mother and he knew well that sylvia with her gentle ways and heart of gold would make mrs beecot happy so long as paul loved the girl he wished to marry the mother was happy but beecot senior had an eye to the money and thus was ready to be bribed into forgiveness and decent behavior now all this was altered from the tone of the letter paul knew his father would never consent to his marrying a girl not only without a name but lacking the fortune which alone rendered her desirable in his eyes still the truth would have to be told and if beecot senior refused to approve of the marriage the young couple would have to do without his sanction the position thought paul would only make him work the harder so that within a reasonable time he might be able to provide a home for sylvia so the young man facing the situation bravely wrote to his father and explained how the fortune had passed from sylvia but declared with all the romance of youth that he intended to marry the girl all the same if beecot senior said paul would permit the marriage and allow the couple a small income until the husband could earn enough to keep the pot boiling the writer would be grateful if not paul declared firmly that he would work like a slave to make a home for his darling but nothing in the world would make him give up sylvia this was the letter to his father and then paul wrote one to his mother detailing the circumstances and imploring her to stand by him although in his own sinking heart he felt that mrs beecot was but a frail reed on which to lean he finished these letters and posted them before midnight then he went to bed and dreamed that the bad news was all moonshine and that sylvia and he were a happy rich married pair but the cold grey searching light of dawn brought the actual state of things again to his mind and so worried him that he could hardly eat any breakfast he spent the morning in writing a short tale for which he had been promised a couple of sovereigns and took it to the office of the weekly paper which had accepted it on his way to gwynne street paul's heart was heavy thinking of what he had to tell but he did not intend to let sylvia see that he was despondent on turning down the street he raised his head assumed a smile and walked with a confident step into the shop as he entered he heard a heavy woman plunge down the stairs and found his arm grasped by deborah very red faced and very furious the moment he crossed the threshold bart could be heard knocking boxes together in the cellar as he was getting deborah's belongings ready for removal to jubileetown where the cottage and the drying ground for the laundry had already been secured through pash but paul had no time to ask what was going on a glance at the hand maiden's tearful face revealed that she knew the worst in which case sylvia must also have heard the news yes cried deborah seeing the sudden whiteness of paul's cheeks and shaking him so much as to hurt his injured arm she knows she do oh lor' bless us that things should come to this and there she's settin' a crying out her beautiful eyes for you mr beecot thinking of your throwin' her over and if you do shouted deborah with another shake you'd better ha' bin smashed to a jelly than face me in my presingt state seein' you from the winder i made bold to come down and arsk your intentings for if them do mean no marriage and the breaking of my pretty's 'eart never shall she set eyes agin on a double faced jonah and and here deborah gasped for breath and again shook paul deborah he said in a quiet voice releasing himself i love sylvia for herself and not for her money deborah threw her brawny arms in the air and her apron over her red head i knowed it oh yuss indeed she sobbed in muffled tones ses i i ses mr paul's a gentleman whatever his frantic par may be and marry you my own lovey he will though not able to afford the marriage fees the same as will come out of debby's pocket though the laundry go by the board 'eaven knows what we'll live on all the same pore wurkhus ijets as me an' bart are not bein' able to make you an' miss sylvia 'appy miss sylvia krill an' norman both ended deborah with emphasis whatever that smooth cat with the grin and the clawses may say drat her fur a slimy tabby yah i see you know all said paul as soon as he could slip in a word know all almost yelled deborah dragging down the apron and revealing flashing eyes and it's a mussy i ain't in old bailey this very day for scratching that monkey of a pash oh if i'd known wot he wos never should he 'ave got me the laundry though the same may have to go worse luck ho yuss he come and she come with her kitting as is almost as big a cat as she is mrs krill bless her oh yuss mrs krill the sneakin' smiling jezebel did she see sylvia asked beecot sharply yuss she did admitted deborah me lettin' her in not knowin' her scratchin's an' the monkey an' the kitting come too a spyin' out the land as you may say w'en i 'eard the noos i 'owled mr paul but my pretty she turned white like one of them plaster stateys as boys sell cheap in the streets and ses she she ses 'oh paul' if you'll forgive me mentioning your name sir without perliteness bless her my darling did she think of me said beecot tenderly ah when do she not think of you sir 'eart of gold though none in her pocket by means of that old bailey woman as is a good match fur my old bailey master ho he wos a bad 'un and 'ow miss sylvia ever come to 'ave sich a par beats me but i thank 'eaven the cat ain't my pretty's mar though she do 'ave a daughter of her own the painted stuck up parcel of bad bargains paul nodded calling names won't do any good deborah he said sadly we must do the best we can there ain't no chance of the lawr gettin' that woman to the gallers i 'spose sir the woman is your late master's lawful wife pash seems to think so and has gone over to the enemy here deborah clenched her mighty fists and gasped sylvia's mother was married later and as the former wife is alive sylvia is no shouted deborah flinging out her hand don't say it sylvia is poor ended paul calmly what did you think i was about to say deborah what that cat said insulting of my pretty but i shoved her out of the door tellin' her what she were she guv me and bart and my own sunbeam notice to quit gasped deborah almost weeping an' quit we will this very day bart bein' a packin' at this momingt 'ear 'im knocking and i wish he wos a knockin' at mrs krill's 'ead that i do the flauntin' hussy as she is drat her i'll go up and see sylvia no deborah don't you come for a few minutes when you do come we'll arrange what is to be done deborah nodded acquiescence take my lovely flower in your arms sir she said following him to the foot of the stairs and tell her as your 'eart is true which true i knowed it would be beecot was soon in the sitting room and found sylvia on the sofa her face buried in her hands she looked up when she recognized the beloved footsteps and sprang to her feet the next moment she was sobbing her heart out on paul's faithful breast and he was comforting her with all the endearing names he could think of my own my sweet my dearest darling whispered paul smoothing the pretty brown hair don't weep you have lost much but you have me dear she wept do you think it is true i am afraid it is sylvia however i know a young lawyer who is a friend of mine and i'll speak to him but paul though my mother may not have been married to my father she was sylvia but mrs krill was married to him earlier your father committed bigamy and you poor child have to pay the penalty well even if the marriage is wrong the money was left to us to you dear said beecot leading her to the sofa that is the money was left in that loosely worded will to 'my daughter' we all thought it was you but now this legal wife has come on the scene the money must go to her daughter oh sylvia cried paul straining her to his breast how foolish your father was not to say the money was left to 'my daughter sylvia' then everything would have been right but the absence of the name is fatal the law will assume that the testator meant his true daughter and am i not his true daughter she asked her lips quivering you are my own darling sylvia murmured paul kissing her hair don't let us talk of the matter i'll speak to my lawyer friend but i fear from the attitude of pash that mrs krill will make good her claim were there a chance of keeping you in possession of the money pash would never have left you so easily i am so sorry about the money on your account paul my own he said cheerily money is a good thing and i wish we could have kept the five thousand a year but i have you and you have me and although we cannot marry for a long time yet not marry paul oh why not dearest i am poor i cannot drag you down to poverty sylvia looked at him wide eyed i am poor already she looked round the room nothing here is mine i have only a few clothes mr pash said that mrs krill would take everything let me marry you darling she whispered coaxingly and we can live in your garret i will cook and mend and be your own little wife beecot groaned don't tempt me sylvia he said putting her away i dare not marry you why i have hardly enough to pay the fees no dear you must go with debby to her laundry and i'll work night and day to make enough for us to live on then we'll marry and but your father paul he won't do anything he consented to our engagement but solely i believe because he thought you were rich now when he knows you are poor and i wrote to tell him last night he will forbid the match paul she clung to him in sick terror my sweetest he caught her in his arms do you think a dozen fathers would make me give you up no my love of loves my soul my heart of hearts come good come ill we will be together you can stay with debby at jubileetown until i make enough to welcome you to a home however humble dear be hopeful and trust in the god who brought us together he is watching over us and knowing that why need we fear don't cry darling heart i'm not crying for crying sobbed sylvia hiding her face on his breast and speaking incoherently but i'm so happy in spite of the bad news asked paul laughing gently yes yes to think that you should still wish to marry me i am poor i i have no name and dearest you will soon have my name but mrs krill said i don't want to hear what she said cried paul impetuously she is a bad woman i can see badness written all over her smiling face we won't think of her when you leave here you won't see her again my own dear little sweetheart whispered paul tenderly when you leave this unhappy house let the bad past go you and i will begin a new life come don't cry my pet here's debby sylvia looked up and threw herself into the faithful servant's arms oh debby he loves me still he's going to marry me whenever he can deborah laughed and wiped sylvia's tears away with her coarse apron tenderly you silly flower she cried caressingly you foolish queen of 'oney bees of course he have you in his 'eart you'll be bride and i'll be bridesmaid though not a pretty one and all will be 'oney and sunshine and gates of pearl my beauty debby i'm i'm so happy deborah placed her young mistress in paul's arms then let 'im make you 'appier pretty lily of the valley lor' as if anything bad 'ud ever come to you two while silly old debby have a leg to stan' on an' arms to wash though the laundry oh lor' and she rubbed her nose till it grew scarlet what of it mr beecot i do ask have you enough money to pay a year's rent yes me and bart have saved one 'undred between us rent and furniture and taxes can come out of it sure and my washin's what i call washin' said deborah emphatically no lost buttings and tored sheets and ragged collars i'd wash ag'in the queen 'erself tho' i ses it as shouldn't give me a tub and you'll see if the money don't come in well then deborah as i am too poor to marry sylvia now i want her to stop with you till i can make a home for her an' where else should she stop but with her own silly foolish debby i'd like to know my flower you come an' be queen of the laundry i'll keep the accounts debby said sylvia now all smiling you'll keep nothin' but your color an' your dear 'eart up retorted debby sniffing me an' bart 'ull do all an' this blessed day we'll go to jubileetown with our belongings and you mr beecot i'll come and see you settled deborah and then i return to earn an income for sylvia i won't let you keep her long she'll stop as long as she have the will shouted debby hugging sylvia as to that krill cat she can take possession as soon as she likes and deborah added paul significantly for all that has happened i don't intend to drop the search for your late master's murderer it's the krill cat as done it said debby though i ain't got no reason for a sayin' of such a think chapter xiii the detective's views as paul expected the next letter from his father contained a revocation of all that had pleased him in the former one beecot senior wrote many pages of abuse he always did babble like a complaining woman when angered he declined to sanction the marriage and ordered his son at once underlined to give up all thought of making sylvia norman his wife it would have been hard enough wrote beecot to have received her as a daughter in law even with money seeing that she had no position and was the daughter of a murdered tradesman but seeing also that she was a pauper and worse a girl without a cognomen he forbade paul to bestow on her the worthy name of beecot so nobly worn by himself there was much more to the same effect which paul did not read and the letter ended grandiloquently in a command that paul was to repair at once to the manor and there grovel at the feet of his injured father to this despotic epistle the young man answered in a few lines he said that he intended to marry sylvia and that nothing would make him give her up and that he would not meet his father again until that father remembered that his son was an englishman and not a slave paul signed his letter without the usual your affectionate son for he felt that he had small love for this imperious old man who declined to control his passions so he now knew the worst the breach between himself and his father was wider than ever and he had only his youth and his brains to depend upon in making a living for himself and a home for sylvia strange to say paul's spirits rose and he braced himself bravely to do battle with fortune for his beloved sylvia under the charge of deborah and escorted by bart tawsey had duly left gwynne street bag and baggage and she was now established in rose cottage jubileetown the house was a small one and there was not a single rose in the garden around it indeed as the cottage had been newly erected there was not even a garden and it stood amidst a bare acre with a large drying ground at the back but the cottage on the outskirts of the new suburb was to all intents and purposes in the country and sylvia's weary eyes were so gladdened by green fields and glorious trees that she forgot the nakedness of her immediate surroundings she was assigned the best room in the small abode and one of the first things she did was to write a letter to paul asking him to repair to rose cottage to witness the marriage of deborah and bart the handmaiden thought this was necessary so that she could make full use of her intended husband if he wasn't here allays said the bride elect he'd be gadding about idling i know him an' me getting a business together won't be easy unless i've got him at 'and as you may say to take round the bills let alone that he ought to sleep in the 'ouse in case burgulars gits in and sleep in the 'ouse without the blessin' of matrimony he can't my pretty so that's all about it deborah as an american would say was a hustler and having made up her mind she did not let grass grow under her feet she called on the vicar of the parish and explained herself at great length but suppressed the fact that she had formerly lived in gwynne street she did not want the shadow of the murder to cast a gloom over her new home and therefore said nothing about the matter all the vicar good easy soul knew was that deborah had been a servant in a respectable family whereabouts not mentioned that the father and mother had died and that she had brought the only daughter of the house to live with her and be treated like a lady then deborah demanded that the banns should be put up and arranged that bart should take up his abode in the parish for the necessary time this was done and for three sundays deborah had the pleasure of hearing the banns announced which foretold that bart tawsey and herself would soon be man and wife then the marriage took place the future mrs tawsey had no relatives but bart produced a snuffy old grandmother from some london slum who drank gin during the wedding feast much to the scandal of the bride paul acted as best man to bart and sylvia in her plain black dress was bridesmaid mrs purr the grandmother objected to the presence of black at a wedding saying it was unlucky and told of many fearful incidents which had afterwards occurred to those who had tolerated such a funeral garb but deborah swept away all opposition what she shouted in her usual style not 'ave my own sweet pretty to arsk a blessing on my marriage and she not able to git out of 'er blacks i'm astonished at you mrs purr and you an old woman as oughter know better i doubt if you're bart's granny i've married into an ijit race don't talk to me mrs purr if you please live clean an' work 'ard and there's no trouble with them 'usbands as 'as to love honor and obey you and she sniffed them words you 'ave t' saiy mumbled mrs purr ho said deborah scornfully i'd like to see me say 'em to sich a scrub as bart but say them she did at the altar being compelled to do so by the vicar but when the ceremony was over the newly made mrs tawsey took bart by the arm and shook him he was small and lean and of a nervous nature so he quivered like a jelly in his wife's tremendous grip deborah was really ignorant of her own strength you 'ark to me bart said she while the best man and bridesmaid walked on ahead talking lovingly i said them words which you oughter 'ave said 'cause you ain't got no memory t' speak of but they ain't my beliefs but yours or i'll know the reason why jes' you say them now swear without billingsgate as you'll allays love honor an' obey your lovin' wife bart still being shaken gasped out the words and then gave his arm to the lady who was to rule his life deborah kissed him in a loud hearty way and led him in triumph to the cottage here mrs purr had prepared a simple meal and the health of the happy pair was proposed by paul mrs purr toasted them in gin and wept as she did so a dismal tearful old woman was mrs purr and she was about to open her mouth in order to explain what she thought would come of the marriage when mrs tawsey stopped her none of them groans cried deborah with vigor i won't have my weddings made funerals 'old your tongue mrs purr and you bart jes' swear to love honor an' obey my pretty as you would your own lawful wife and the ceremonies is hoff bart performed the request and then paul laughing at the oddity of it all took his leave on walking to the gate he was overtaken by mrs purr who winked mysteriously whatever you do sir said the lean old creature with many contortions of her withered face don't have nothin' to do with tray tray echoed paul in surprise mr pash's office boy him and none other i knows his grandmother as 'as bin up for drunk two hundred times and is proud of it stretchers is as common to her sir as kissings is to a handsome young gent like you an' the boy takes arter her a deep young cuss whispered granny purr significantly but why should i beware of him asked beecot puzzled a nod's a wink to a blind 'un croaked mrs purr condensing the proverb and turning away jus' leave that brat tray to his own wickedness they'll bring him to the gallers some day but i want to know ah well then you won't sir i ses what i ses and i ses no more nor i oughter say so good night sir and mrs purr toddled up the newly gravelled path and entered the cottage leaving an odor of gin behind her beecot had half a mind to follow so strange was the hint she had given him apparently she knew something which connected him with tray and paul wondered for the fiftieth time if the boy had picked up the opal brooch however he decided to leave the matter alone for the present mrs purr whom deborah had engaged to iron was always available and paul decided that should anything point to tray's being implicated in the finding of the opal serpent that he would hand him over to hurd who would be better able to deal with such a keen young imp of the gutter thus making up his mind paul dismissed all thought of mrs purr's mysterious utterance and walked briskly to the nearest bus stand where he took a blue vehicle to the bloomsbury district all the way to his garret he dreamed of sylvia and poor though was the home he had left her in he was thankful that she was there in the safe shelter of mrs deborah tawsey's arms it was five o'clock when paul arrived at the door of the stairs leading to his attic and here he was touched on the shoulder by no less a person than mr billy hurd only when he spoke did paul recognize him by his voice for the gentleman who stood before him was not the brown individual he knew as the detective mr hurd was in evening dress with the neatest of patent boots and the tightest of white gloves he wore a brilliantly polished silk hat and twirled a gold headed cane also he had donned a smart blue cloth overcoat with a velvet collar and cuffs but though his voice was the voice of hurd his face was that of quite a different person his hair was dark and worn rather long his moustache black and large and brushed out a la kaiser and he affected an eye glass as immovable as that of hay's altogether a wonderfully changed individual hurd said paul starting with surprise it's my voice told you but now he spoke a tone higher in a shrill sort of way and with a foreign accent vould you me discover mon ami he inquired with a genuine parisian shrug no why are you masquerading as a frenchman hurd not hurd in this skin mr beecot comte de la tour a votre service and he presented a thin glazed card with a coronet engraved on it well count said beecot laughing what can i do for you come up to your room said the pseudo count mounting the stairs there's something to be talked over between us no bad news i hope ah my poor friend said the detective in his usual genial voice you have had enough bad news i am aware to lose a lovely wife and a fine fortune at once eh what a pity i have lost the money certainly said beecot lighting his lamp but the wife will be mine as soon as i can save sufficient to give her a better home than this monsieur le comte de la tour sat down and gracefully flung open his overcoat so as to expose a spotless shirt front what he asked lifting his darkened eyebrows so you mean to marry that girl of course said paul angrily do you think i'm a brute but the money what does that matter i love her not the money and the name her birth i'll give her my own name and then we'll see who will dare to say a word against my wife hurd stretched out his hand and grasping that of beecot's shook it warmly upon my word you are a man and that's almost better than being a gentleman he said heartily i've heard everything from mr pash and i honor you mr beecot i honor you paul stared you must have been brought up in a queer way hurd he said drily to express this surprise because a man acts as a man and not as a blackguard ah but you see in my profession i have mixed with blackguards and that has lowered my moral tone it's refreshing to meet a straight honorable man such as you are mr beecot i liked you when first i set eyes on you and determined to help you to discover the assassin of aaron norman lemuel krill you mean i prefer to call him by the name we both know best said hurd but as i was saying i promised to help you to find out who killed the man now i'll help you to get back the money paul sat down and stared what do you mean he asked the money can't be got back i asked a legal friend of mine and put the case to him since that monkey of a pash has thrown us over my friend said that as no name was mentioned in the will maud krill would undoubtedly inherit the money besides i learn that the certificate of marriage is all right mrs krill undoubtedly married aaron norman under his rightful name thirty years ago oh yes that's all right said hurd producing a dainty silver cigarette case which was part of his get up mrs krill is the widow of the murdered man and the silly way in which the will has been made gives the five thousand a year to her daughter whom mrs krill has under her thumb it's all right as i say but i shouldn't be surprised to learn that there were circumstances in aaron norman's past life which led him to leave his wife and which may lead mrs krill into buying silence by giving miss norman half the income you could live on two thousand odd a year eh not obtained in that way said beecot filling his pipe and passing a match to hurd if the money comes legally to sylvia well and good otherwise she will have nothing to do with it hurd looked round the bleak garret expressively and shrugged his shoulders again i think you are wrong mr beecot you can't bring her here no but i may make enough money to give her a better home can i help you i don't see how you can i want to be an author well said hurd whose british speech was in strange contrast to his foreign appearance it's not a bad game to be an author if you get a good serial connection oh don't look surprised i know about newspapers and publishers as i know about most things see here mr beecot have you ever tried your hand at a detective story no i write on a higher level you won't write on a more paying level replied hurd coolly i know a newspaper which will give you if i recommend you mind one hundred pounds for a good detective yarn you apply for it but i couldn't make up one of those plots so intricate pooh it's a trick you set your puppets in such and such a way and then mix them up i'll give you the benefit of my experience as a 'tec and with my plot and your own writing we'll be able to knock up a story for the paper i talk of then with one hundred pounds you'll have a nest egg to start with i accept with gratitude said beecot moved but i really don't know why you should trouble about me because you're a white man and an honorable gentleman said the detective emphatically i've got a dear little wife of my own and she's something like this poor miss norman then again though you mightn't think so i'm something of a christian and believe we should help others i had a hard life mr beecot before i became a detective and many a time have i learned that prayers can be answered but this is all beside the question went on hurd quickly and with that nervous shame with which an englishman masks the better part of himself i'll see about the story for you meanwhile i am going to a card party to meet incidentally mr grexon hay ah you still suspect him i do and with good reason he's got another mug in tow lord george sandal the son of lord well i needn't mention names but hay's trying to clear the young ass out and i'm on the watch hay will never know me as the count de la tour not he smart as he is i'm fly do you speak french well moderately but i play a silent part and say little i shut my mouth and open my eyes but what i came here to say is that i intend to find out the assassin of aaron norman i can't offer you a reward hurd said paul with a sigh oh that's all right the widow by the advice of pash has doubled the reward one thousand pounds it is now worth winning eh humph said paul moodily i shouldn't think she loved her husband so much as that hurd's brown eyes shot a red flame which showed that he was excited though he was cool enough externally yes he admitted in a careless manner she certainly does act the weeping widow in rather an exaggerated fashion however she's got the cash now or at least her daughter has which is the same thing the two have taken up their quarters in a fashionable hotel in the west end and are looking for a house the old woman manages everything and she will be one too many for mr hay what does he know mrs krill he said he didn't quite right he didn't when the ladies went first to pash's office but hay on the look out for a rich wife got pash to introduce him to the ladies who were charmed with him he's making up to the daughter even in the few weeks that have elapsed and now is assisting them to find a house the daughter loves him i fancy but whether the mother will allow the marriage to take place i can't say surely not on such a short acquaintance hurd bent forward as about to say something then changed his mind really i don't know hay is fascinating and handsome have you been to see him yet no he asked me but all these troubles have put him out of my head why do you ask because next time he invites you go you warned me against him and i warn you again said the detective dryly don't ask me to explain for i can't but you go to see hay when he invites you and make yourself agreeable especially to mrs krill am i likely to meet her asked paul with repugnance yes i fancy so after all you are engaged to the daughter of the dead man and mrs krill i don't count maud who is a tool is a deucedly clever woman she will keep her eye on you and miss norman why she has the money and need take no further notice hurd closed one eye in a suggestive manner mrs krill may not be so sure of the money even though possession is nine points of the law you remember that scrap of paper found by the maid in which norman warned sylvia against allowing his real name to become known yes well the letter wasn't finished the old man was interrupted i suppose but in the few lines of writing norman says here hurd took a scrap of paper a copy out of his book and read 'if the name of krill gets into the papers there will be great trouble keep it from the public i can tell you where to find the reasons for this as i have written' and then said hurd refolding the paper the writing ends but you can see that aaron norman wrote out an account of his reasons which could not be pleasant for mrs krill to hear i still don't understand said paul hopelessly puzzled well said the detective rising and putting on his smart hat it's rather a muddle i confess i have no reason to suspect mrs krill good heavens hurd you don't think she killed her husband no i said that i have no reason to suspect her but i don't like the woman at all norman left his wife for some unpleasant reason and that reason as i verily believe has something to do with his death i don't say that mrs krill killed him but i do believe that she knows of circumstances which may lead to the detection of the criminal in that case she would save her thousand pounds that's just where it is if she does know why does she double the reward a straightforward woman would speak out but she's a crooked sort of creature i shouldn't like to have her for my enemy it seems to me that you do suspect her said paul dryly but puzzled hurd shrugged his shoulders no but i'm in a fix that's a truth said he and sauntered towards the door i can't see my way there's the clue of mrs krill's past to be followed up and the hint contained in this scrap of paper the old man may have left a document behind likely to solve the whole business he hints as much here true enough but nothing was found then again went on hurd the request for the jewels to be delivered to that sailor chap was in norman's handwriting and signed with his name a forgery no pash who knows his writing better than any other man says the document is genuine now then mr beecot what made aaron norman write and sign those lines giving up his property or a part of it just before his death it may have been done in good faith no if so the messenger would not have cleared out when pash started for gwynne street that nautical gent knew what the lawyer would find at the house and so made himself scarce after trying to get the jewels this scrap of paper hurd touched his breast and that request for the jewels in pash's possession those are my clues and the opal serpent asked paul hurd shook his head gloomily it's connection with the matter is beyond me he confessed chapter xiv mr hay's little dinner the detective was as good as his word in a few days paul was introduced to the editor of a weekly publication and obtained a commission for a story to be written in collaboration with mr hurd it seemed that the editor was an old acquaintance of hurd's and had been extricated by him from some trouble connected with cards the editor to show his gratitude and because that hurd's experiences thrown into the form of a story could not fail to interest the public was only too willing to make a liberal arrangement also paul was permanently engaged to supply short stories to read those that were submitted to the editor and in fact he permanently became that gentleman's right hand he was a kind beery bohemian of an editor scott by name and took quite a fancy to paul i'll give you three pounds a week said scott beaming through his large spectacles and raking his long gray beard with tobacco stained fingers you can live on that and to earn it you can give me your opinion on the stories then between whiles you can talk to hurd and write this yarn which i am sure will be interesting hurd has had some queer experiences this was quite true hurd had ventured on strange waters but the strangest he ever sailed on were those connected with the gwynne street case these latter experiences he did not tell to scott who was incapable of holding his tongue and secrecy as the detective impressed on paul was absolutely necessary to the conduct of the case if we keep matters quiet argued hurd and let those concerned in the matter fancy the case has been dropped we'll be able to throw them off their guard and then they may betray themselves i wish you would say if you think there is one person or two said paul irritably for his nerves were wearing thin under the strain you first talk of the assassin and then of the assassins well drawled hurd smiling i'm in the dark you see and being only a flesh and blood human being instead of a creation of one of you authors i can only grope in the dark and look in every direction for the light one person two persons three even four may be engaged in this affair for all i know don't you be in a hurry mr beecot i believe in that foreign chap's saying 'without haste without rest' goethe said that then goethe is a sensible man and must have read his bible 'make no haste in time of trouble' says the scriptures very good assented beecot take your own time i intend to said hurd coolly bless you slow and sure is my motto there's no hurry you are fixed up with enough to live on and a prospect of making more your young lady is happy enough with that grenadier of a woman in spite of the humbleness of the home mrs krill and her daughter are enjoying the five thousand a year and mr grexon hay is fleecing that young ass lord george sandal as easily as possible i stand by and watch everything when the time comes i'll pounce down on ah said paul that's the question on whom on one or two or a baker's dozen rejoined hurd calmly my chickens ain't hatched yet so i don't count 'em by the way is your old school fellow as friendly as ever yes why i can't understand as he certainly will make no money out of me he's giving a small dinner to morrow night at his rooms and has asked me you go said the detective emphatically and don't let on you have anything to do with me see here hurd i won't play the spy if you mean that i don't mean anything of the sort replied hurd earnestly but if you do chance to meet mrs krill at this dinner and if she does chance to drop a few words about her past you might let me know oh i don't mind doing that said beecot with relief i am as anxious to find out the truth about this murder as you are if not more so the truth i take it is to be found in krill's past before he took the name of norman mrs krill will know of that past and i'll try and learn all i can from her but hay has nothing to do with the crime and i won't spy on him very good do what you like but as to hay having nothing to do with the matter i still think hay stole that opal brooch from you when you were knocked down in that case hay must know who killed norman cried paul excited he just does rejoined hurd calmly and now you can understand another reason why i take such an interest in that gentleman but you can't be certain quite so i am in the dark as i said before but hay is a dangerous man and would do anything to rake in the dollars he has something to do with the disappearance of that brooch i am sure and if so he knows more than he says besides here hurd hesitated no i'll tell you that later tell me what something about hay that will astonish you and make you think he has something to do with the crime meanwhile learn all you can from mrs krill if i meet her said paul with a shrug undoubtedly hurd knew more than he was prepared to admit and not even to paul staunch as he knew him to be would he speak confidentially when the time came the detective would speak out at present he held his tongue and moved in clouds like a homeric deity but his eyes were on all those connected with the late aaron norman indirectly or directly although each and every one of them were unaware of the scrutiny paul had no scruples in learning all he could from mrs krill he did not think that she had killed her husband and probably might be ignorant of the person or persons who had slain the poor wretch in so cruel a manner but the motive of the crime was to be found in norman's past and mrs krill knew all about this therefore paul was very pleased when he found that mrs krill and her daughter were the guests at the little dinner hay's rooms were large and luxuriously furnished in effect he occupied a small flat in the house of an ex butler and had furnished the place himself in a sybarite fashion the ex butler and his wife and servants looked after hay and in addition that languid gentleman possessed a slim valet with a sly face who looked as though he knew more than was good for him indeed the whole atmosphere of the rooms was shady and fast and paul simple young fellow as he was felt the bad influence the moment he stepped into the tiny drawing room this was furnished daintily and with great taste in color and furnishing it was more like a woman's room and mr hay had spared no cost in making it pleasing to the eye and comfortable to the body the prevailing tone was pale yellow and the electric light suffused itself through lemon shaded globes the louis quinze furniture was upholstered in primrose and there were many persian praying mats and eastern draperies about the place water color pictures decked the walls and numerous mirrors reflected the dainty pretty apartment a brisk fire was burning although the evening was not cold and everything looked delightfully pleasant paul could not help contrasting all this luxury and taste with his bare garret but with sylvia's love to warm his heart he would not have changed places with grexon hay for all his splendor two ladies were seated by the fire mrs krill in black majestic and calm as usual she wore diamonds on her breast and jewelled stars in her gray hair although not young she was a wonderfully well preserved woman and her arms and neck were white gleaming and beautifully shaped from the top of her head to the sole of her rather large but well shod foot she was dressed to perfection and waved a languid fan as she welcomed paul who was presented to her by the host i am glad to see you mr beecot she said in her deep voice we had rather an unhappy interview when last we met how is miss norman she is quite well replied paul in as cordial a tone as he could command for the sake of learning what he could he wished to be amiable but it was difficult when he reflected that this large suave smiling woman had robbed sylvia of a fortune and had spoken of her in a contemptuous way but beecot swallowing down his pride held his little candle to the devil without revealing his repugnance too openly and apparently mrs krill believed that his composure was genuine enough for she was quite at her ease in his presence the daughter was dressed like the mother save that she wore pearls in place of diamonds she talked but little as usual and sat smiling the young image of the older woman hay also introduced paul to a handsome young fellow of twenty one with rather a feeble face this was lord george sandal the pigeon hay was plucking and although he had charming manners and an assumption of worldly wisdom he was evidently one of those who had come into the world saddled and bridled for other folk's riding a third lady was also present who called herself aurora qian and hay informed his friend in a whisper that she was an actress paul then remembered that he had seen her name in the papers as famous in light comedy she was pretty and kittenish with fluffy hair and an eternal smile it was impossible to imagine a greater contrast to the massive firmness of mrs krill than the lively girlish demeanor of the little woman yet paul had an instinct that miss qian in spite of her profession and odd name and childish giggle was a more shrewd person than she looked everyone was bright and merry and chatty all save maud krill who smiled and fanned herself in a statuesque way hay paid her great attention and paul knew very well that he intended to marry the silent woman for her money it would be hardly earned he thought with such a firm looking mother in law as mrs krill would certainly prove to be the dinner was delightful well cooked daintily served and leisurely eaten a red shaded lamp threw a rosy light on the white cloth the glittering crystal and bright silver the number of diners was less than the muses and more than the graces and everyone laid himself or herself out to make things bright and again maud krill may be mentioned as an exception she ate well and held her tongue merely smiling heavily when addressed paul glancing at her serene face across the rosy hued table wondered if she really was as calm as she looked and if she really lacked the brain power her mother seemed to possess i am glad to see you here beecot said hay smiling i am very glad to be here said paul adapting himself to circumstances especially in such pleasant company you don't go out much said lord george no i am a poor author who has yet to win his spurs i thought of being an author myself said the young man but it was such a fag to think about things you want your material supplied to you perhaps put in mrs krill in a calm contemptuous way oh no if i wrote stories like the author johnnies i'd rake up my family history there's lots of fun there your family mightn't like it giggled miss qian i know lots of things about my own people which would read delightfully if mr beecot set them down but then she shrugged her dainty shoulders oh dear me what a row there would be i suppose there is a skeleton in every cupboard said hay suavely and quite ignoring the shady tenant in his own there's a whole dozen cupboards with skeletons to match in my family said the young lord why i had an aunt lady rachel sandal who was murdered over twenty years ago now he said looking triumphantly round the table which of you can say there's a murder in your family eh ladies and gentlemen paul glanced sideways at mrs krill wondering what she would say and wondering also how it was that lord george did not know she was the widow of the murdered lemuel krill whose name had been so widely advertised but hay spoke before anyone could make a remark what an unpleasant subject he said with a pretended shudder let us talk of less melodramatic things oh why said mrs krill using her fan i rather like to hear about murders lord george looked oddly at her and seemed about to speak paul thought for the moment that he did know about the gwynne street crime and intended to remark thereon but if so his good taste told him that he would be ill advised to speak and he turned to ask for another glass of wine miss aurora qian looked in her pretty shrewd way from one to the other i just love the newgate calendar she said clasping her hands there's lovely plots for dramas to be found there don't you think so mr beecot i don't read that sort of literature miss qian ah then you don't know what people are capable of in the way of cruelty mr beecot i don't want to know retorted paul finding the subject distasteful and wondering why the actress pressed it as she undoubtedly did i prefer to write stories to elevate the mind miss qian made a grimace and shot a meaning look at him it doesn't pay she said tittering and money is what we all want i fear i don't care for money overmuch no said mrs krill to him in an undertone i know that from the way you spoke in mr pash's office i was standing up for the rights of another you will be rewarded she replied meaningly but what she did mean paul could not understand the rest of the dinner passed off well enough as the subject was changed lord george began to talk of racing and hay responded mrs krill alone seemed shocked i don't believe in gambling she said icily i hope you are not very down on it said hay lord george and i propose to play bridge with you ladies in the next room maud can play and miss qian said the widow i'll talk to mr beecot unless he prefers the fascination of the green cloth i would rather talk to you replied paul bowing mrs krill nodded and then went out of the room with the younger ladies the three gentlemen filled their glasses with port and hay passed round a box of cigars soon they were smoking and chatting in a most amicable fashion lord george talked a great deal about racing and cards and his bad luck with both hay said very little and every now and then cast a glance at paul to see how he was taking the conversation at length when sandal became a trifle vehement on the subject of his losses hay abruptly changed the subject by refilling his glass and those of his companions i want you to drink to the health of my future bride he said what cried paul staring miss krill the same responded hay coldly you see i have taken your advice and intend to settle pash presented me to the ladies when next they came to his office and since then i have been almost constantly with them miss krill's affections were disengaged and she therefore with her mother's consent became my promised wife i wish you joy said lord george draining his glass and filling another and by jove for your sake i hope she's got money oh yes she's well off said hay calmly and you paul i congratulate you of course stammered beecot dazed but it's so sudden you haven't known her above a month five weeks or so said hay smiling and sinking his voice lower he added i can't afford to let grass grow under my feet this young ass here might snap her up and mrs krill would only be too glad to secure a title for maud i say said lord george suddenly and waking from a brown study who is mrs krill i've heard the name it's not an uncommon name said hay untruthfully and quickly she is a rich widow who has lately come to london where did she come from i can't tell you that from the wilds of yorkshire i believe you had better ask her oh by jove no i wouldn't be so rude but i seem to know the name paul privately thought that if he read the papers he ought certainly to know the name and he was on the point of making perhaps an injudicious remark but hay pointedly looked at him in such a meaning way that he held his tongue more when they left their wine for the society of the ladies hay squeezed his friend's arm in the passage don't mention the death he said using a politer word by preference sandal doesn't connect mrs krill with the dead man she wants to live the matter down in that case she ought to leave london for a time she intends to when i make maud my wife we will travel with her mother for a year or two until the scandal of the murder blows over luckily the name of lemuel krill was not mentioned often in the papers and sandal hasn't seen a hand bill that i know of i suppose you agree with me that silence is judicious yes assented paul i think it is and you congratulate me on my approaching marriage certainly now perhaps you will live like falstaff when he was made a knight hay did not understand the allusion and looked puzzled however he had no time to say more as they entered the drawing room almost as soon as they did mrs krill summoned paul to her side and now she said let us talk of miss norman chapter xv a new clue i don't wish to talk of miss norman said paul bluntly then you can be no true lover retorted the widow i disagree with you a true lover does not talk to all and sundry concerning the most sacred feelings of his heart moreover your remarks at our last meeting were not to my taste i apologize said mrs krill promptly and will not offend in that way again i did not know you then but since mr hay has spoken about you to me i know and appreciate you mr beecot but paul was not to be cajoled in this manner the more suave the woman was the more he felt inclined to be on his guard and he very wisely obeyed the prompting of his instinct i fear you do not know me mrs krill said he as coldly as hay could have spoken else you would hardly ask me to discuss with you of all people the lady whom i intend to make my wife you are rather a difficult man to deal with she replied drawing her thick white eyebrows together but i like difficult men that is why i admire mr hay he is not a silly useless butterfly like that young lord there silly he is not but i doubt his being useful so far as i can see hay looks after himself and nobody else he proposes to look after my daughter so i understand replied beecot politely but that is a matter entirely for your own consideration mrs krill still continued to smile in her placid way but she was rather nonplussed all the same from the appearance of beecot she had argued that he was one of those many men she could twist round her finger but he seemed to be less easily guided than she expected and for the moment she was silent letting her hard eyes wander towards the card table round which sat the four playing an eager and engrossing game of bridge you don't approve of that perhaps no said paul calmly i certainly do not are you a puritan may i ask beecot shook his head and laughed i am a simple man who tries to do his duty in this world said he and who very often finds it difficult to do that same duty how do you define duty mr beecot we are becoming ethical said paul with a smile i don't know that i am prepared with an answer at present then the next time we meet for i hope said mrs krill smoothing her face to a smile it had grown rather sombre that we shall often meet again you must come and see us we have taken a house in kensington chosen by mr hay yes he is our mentor in london society i don't think added mrs krill studying his face that you like mr hay as i am mr hay's guest said paul dryly that is rather an unkind question to ask i asked no question i simply make a statement beecot found the conversation rather embarrassing in place of his pumping mrs krill she was trying to pump him which reversal of his design he by no means approved of he changed the subject of conversation by drawing a powerfully attractive red herring across the trail you wish to speak to me about miss norman he remarked i do answered mrs krill who saw through his design but apparently that subject is as distasteful as a discussion about mr hay both subjects are rather personal i admit mrs krill however if you have anything to tell me which you would like miss norman to hear i am willing to listen ah now you are more reasonable she answered in a pleased tone it is simply this mr beecot i am very sorry for the girl through no fault of her own she is placed in a difficult position i cannot give her a name since her father sinned against her as he sinned in another way against me but i can through my daughter who is guided by me give her an income it does not seem right that i should have all this money that your daughter should have all this money interpolated beecot my daughter and i are one replied mrs krill calmly when i speak for myself i speak for her but as i say it doesn't seem right we should be in affluence and miss norman in poverty so i propose to allow her five hundred a year on conditions will she accept do you think mr beecot i should think her acceptance would depend upon the conditions they are very simple said mrs krill in her deep tones and looking very straightly at paul she is to marry you and go to america beecot's face did not change since her hard eyes were on it but he was puzzled under his mask of indifference why did this woman want sylvia to marry him and go into exile he temporized with regard to your wish that miss norman should marry me said he quietly it is of course very good of you to interest yourself in the matter i fail to understand your reason however yet the reason is patent rejoined mrs krill just as quietly and quite as watchful as before sylvia norman is a young girl without much character in that i disagree with you well let us admit she has character but she certainly has no experience in the world she is exposed to much trouble and perhaps may be to temptation since her position is the fault of her father and she is entirely innocent i want her to have a happy life for that reason i wish her to marry you paul bowed not believing a word of this philanthropic speech again i say it is good of you said he with some irony but even were i out of the way her nurse deborah tawsey would look after her as matters stand however she will certainly become my wife as soon as we can afford a home you can afford it to morrow said mrs krill eagerly if you will accept my offer a home in america said paul and why i should think both of you would like to be away from a place where you have seen such a tragedy indeed paul committed himself to no opinion and supposing we accept your offer which i admit is a generous one you suggest we should go to the states or to canada or australia or in fact you can go anywhere so long as you leave england i tell you mr beecot even at the risk of hurting your feelings that i want that girl away from london my husband treated me very badly he was a brute always and i hate to have that girl before my eyes yet she is innocent have i not said that a dozen times rejoined mrs krill impatiently what is the use of further discussion do you accept my offer i will convey it to miss norman it is for her to decide but you have the right since you are to be her husband pardon me no i would never take such a responsibility on me i shall tell miss norman what you say and convey her answer to you thank you said mrs krill graciously but she was annoyed that her golden bait had not been taken immediately and in spite of her suavity paul could see that she was annoyed the more so when she began to explain of course you understand my feelings i confess i don't quite naturally the fact that you are connected with the murder in the public eyes pardon me said the woman swiftly but i am not the name of krill has hardly been noticed the public know that aaron norman was murdered no one talks of lemuel krill or thinks that i am the widow of the murdered man possibly i may come across some people who will connect the two names and look askance at me but the majority of people such as lord george there she pointed with her fan do not think of me in the way you say as he did they will think they remember the name lord george did not say that to you said paul swiftly no but he did to mr hay who told me rejoined mrs krill quite as swiftly to night asked beecot remembering that hay had not spoken privately to mrs krill since they came in from the dining room oh no on another occasion lord george has several times said that he has a faint recollection of my name possibly the connection between me and the murder may occur to his mind but he is really so very stupid that i hope he will forget all about the matter i wonder you don't change your name said paul looking at her certainly not unless public opinion forces me to change it she said defiantly my life has always been perfectly open and above board not like that of my husband why did he change his name asked beecot eagerly too eagerly in fact for she drew back why do you ask she inquired coldly paul shrugged his shoulders an idle question mrs krill i have no wish to force your confidence there is no forcing in the matter responded the woman i have taken quite a fancy to you mr beecot and you shall know what i do pray do not tell me if you would rather not but i would rather said mrs krill bluntly it will prevent your misconception of anything you may hear about us my husband's real name was lemuel krill and he married me thirty years ago i will be frank with you and admit that neither of us were gentlefolks we kept a public house on the outskirts of christchurch in hants called 'the red pig' she looked anxiously at him as she spoke a strange name have you never heard of it before no had i heard the name it would have remained in my memory from its oddity paul might have been mistaken but mrs krill certainly seemed relieved yet if she had anything to conceal in connection with the red pig why should she have mentioned the name it is not a first class hotel she went on smoothly and again with her false smile we had only farm laborers and such like as customers but the custom was good and we did very well then my husband took to drink in that respect he must have changed said paul quickly for all the time i knew him six months it was i never saw him the worse for drink and i certainly never heard from those who would be likely to know that he indulged in alcohol to excess all the same added paul with an after thought of his conversation with sylvia in the embankment garden i fancied from his pale face and shaking hands and a tightness of the skin that he might drink exactly he did he drank brandy in large quantities and strange to say he never got drunk what do you mean exactly asked beecot curiously well said mrs krill biting the top of her fan and looking over it lemuel i'll call him by the old name never grew red in the face and even after years of drinking he never showed any signs of intemperance certainly his hands would shake at times but i never noticed particularly the tightness of the skin you talk of a certain shiny look explained paul quite so i never noticed it but he never got drunk so as to lose his head or his balance went on mrs krill but he became a demon a demon yes said the woman emphatically as a rule he was a timid nervous little man like a frightened rabbit and would not harm a fly but drink as you know changes a nature to the contrary of what it actually is i have heard that you would have seen an example in lemuel she retorted when he drank brandy he became a king a sultan from being timid he became bold from not harming anyone he was capable of murder often in his fits did he lay violent hands on me but i managed to escape when sober he would moan and apologize in a provokingly tearful manner i hated and despised him she went on with flashing eyes but careful to keep her voice from reaching the gamblers i was a fool to marry him my father was a farmer and i had a good education i was attracted by the good looks of lemuel and ran away with him from my father's farm in buckinghamshire that's where stowley is murmured paul stowley echoed mrs krill whose ears were very sharp yes i know that town why do you mention it the opal serpent brooch with which your husband's lips were fastened was pawned there i remember said mrs krill calmly mr pash told me it has never been found out how the brooch came to fasten the lips so horrible it was she shuddered no my father bought the brooch from the stowley pawnbroker and gave it to my mother who sent it to me when i had an accident i lost it but who picked it up i can't say the assassin must have picked it up declared mrs krill decisively else it would not have been used in that cruel way though why such a brooch should have been used at all i can't understand i suppose my husband did not tell you why he wanted to buy the brooch who told you that he did asked paul quickly mr pash he told me all about the matter but not the reason why my husband wanted the brooch pash doesn't know said beecot nor do i your husband fainted when i first showed him the brooch but i don't know why he said nothing again mrs krill's face in spite of her care showed a sense of relief at his ignorance but i must get back to my story she said in a hard tone we have to leave soon i ran away with lemuel who was then travelling with jewellery he knew a good deal about jewellery you know which he turned to account in his pawnbroking yes and amassed a fortune thereby i should never have credited him with so much sense said mrs krill contemptuously while at christchurch he was nothing but a drunkard whining when sober and a furious beast when drunk i managed all the house and looked after my little daughter lemuel led me a dog's life and we quarrelled incessantly at length when maud was old enough to be my companion lemuel ran away i kept on 'the red pig' and waited for him to return but he never came back and for over twenty years i heard nothing of him till i saw the hand bills and his portrait and heard of his death then i came to see mr pash and the rest you know but why did he run away asked paul i suppose he grew weary of the life and the way i detested him was her reply i don't wonder he ran away but there i have told you all so make what you can of it tell miss norman of my offer and make her see the wisdom of accepting it and now she rose and held out her hand i must run away you will call and see us mr hay will give you the address what's that said hay leaving the card table does beecot want your address certainly he went to a table and scribbled on a card there you are hunter street kensington no a do come beecot i hope soon to call on your services to be my best man and he cast a coldly loving look on maud who simply smiled as usual by this time the card party had broken up maud had lost a few pounds and lord george a great deal but miss qian and hay had won what luck groaned the young lord everything seems to go wrong with me stop and we'll try another game when the ladies have gone suggested hay his impassive face lighting up then beecot i must go said the young gentleman who did not wish to be called upon as a witness in a possible card scandal and i'll go too said lord george whenever i play with you hay i always seem to lose what do you mean by that asked grexon fiercely oh he doesn't mean anything said miss qian sweetly and putting her cloak round her mr beecot just take me to my cab i'll take you to your carriage said hay offering an arm to mrs krill which she accepted graciously lord george followed grumbling with the ever smiling maud miss qian skipped into a hansom and offered paul a drive back to town which he refused as the cab was driving off she bent down and whispered be careful with a side glance at hay paul laughed everyone seemed to doubt hay but that gentleman handed mrs krill and her daughter into their carriage and looked towards lord george you don't want your revenge to night he asked no confound you said the young man sulkily in that case i'll drive into kensington with mrs krill and borrow her carriage for a trip to piccadilly good night sandal good night beecot he waved his hand and the ladies waved theirs and then the three drove away lord george lighted a cigar and putting his arm within that of beecot strolled down the road come to my club he said no thank you answered paul politely i must get home but i wish you'd come i hate being by myself and you seem such a good sort of chap well said beecot thinking he might say a word in season to this young fool i don't gamble oh you cry down that do you well i think it's foolish it is assented lord george frankly infernally foolish and hay has all the luck i wonder if he plays square this was dangerous ground and paul shied i really can't say he said coldly i don't play cards but what do you know of hay asked sandal only that he was at school with me at torrington we met by accident the other day and he asked me to dinner torrington yes i had a brother at that school once said lord george but you and hay wouldn't get on well together i should think you're straight and he's you forget we have been dining with him said paul quickly what of that i've dined often and have paid pretty dearly for the privilege i must have lost at least five thousand to him within the last few months in that case i should advise you to play cards no more the remedy is easy said paul dryly it isn't so easy to leave off cards rejoined sandal gloomily i'm that fond of gambling that i only seem to live when i've got the cards or dice in my hand i suppose it's like dram drinking if you take my advice lord george you'll give up card playing with hay do you mean asked the other shrewdly with anyone i know nothing about hay beyond what i have told you humph said sandal i don't think you're a chap like him at all i may look a fool but i ain't and can see through a brick wall same as most johnnies who can't see at all interpolated paul dryly ha ha that's good but i say about this hay what a queer lot he had there to night i can't discuss that said paul stiffly he was not one to eat a man's bread and salt and then betray him sandal went on as though he hadn't heard him that actress is a jolly little woman said he i've seen her at the frivolity a ripping fine singer and dancer she is but those other ladies mrs and miss krill the young lord stopped short in the high street where have i heard that name he said looking up to the stars somewhere in the country maybe i go down sometimes to the hall my father's place i don't suppose you'd know it it's three miles from christchurch in hants said paul feeling he was on the verge of a discovery yes have you been there no but i have heard of the place there's an hotel there called 'the red pig' which i thought ha cried young sandal stopping again and with such a shout that passers by thought he was drunk i remember the name 'the red pig' a woman called krill kept that she can hardly be the same said paul not wishing to betray the lady no i guess not she'd hardly have the cheek to sit down with me if she did but krill yes i remember my aunt you know your aunt yes said sandal impatiently she was murdered or committed suicide in that 'red pig' place rachel sandal with her unlucky opals her unlucky opals what do you mean why she had a serpent set with opals she wore as a brooch and it brought her bad luck chapter xvi sylvia's theory it was close upon midnight when paul reached his garret sandal drove him in a hansom as far as piccadilly circus and from that place beecot walked through oxford street to bloomsbury he had not been able to extract further information of any importance from the young lord it appeared that lady rachel sandal in love with an inferior had quarrelled with her father and had walked to christchurch one night with the intention of joining the man she wished to marry in london but the night was stormy and lady rachel was a frail woman she took refuge in the red pig intending to go the next morning but during the night she was found strangled in the bedroom she had hired sandal could give no details as the events happened before he was born and he had only heard scraps of the dreadful story some people say lady rachel was murdered explained sandal and others that she killed herself but the opal brooch which she wore certainly disappeared but there was such a scandal over the affair that my grandfather hushed it up i can't say exactly what took place but i know it happened at a small pub kept by a woman called krill do you think this woman is the same it's hardly likely said paul mendaciously how could a woman who kept a small public house become suddenly rich true answered lord george as they stopped in the circus and she'd have let on she knew about my name had she anything to do with the matter all the same i'll ask her do so said paul stepping out of the cab he was perfectly satisfied that mrs krill was quite equal to deceiving sandal the wonder was that she had not held her peace to him about the red pig you won't come on to my club asked sandal leaning out of the cab no thank you replied paul good night and he walked away the fact is beecot wished to put on paper all that he had heard that night and send it to hurd as soon as he reached his attic he set to work and wrote out a detailed account of the evening you might find out if lady rachel committed suicide or whether she was strangled by someone else ended beecot certainly the mention of the serpent brooch is curious this may be the event in norman's past life which led him to change his name paul wrote much more and then went out to post the letter it was after midnight when he did so there was not much chance of hurd getting the letter before the second or third post the next day but paul felt that he had done his duty and had supplied the information as speedily as possible so he went to sleep with a quiet mind in spite of the excitement of the evening but next morning he was unable to sit down to his desk as usual and felt disinclined to go to the newspaper office so he walked to jubileetown to see how sylvia was getting along deborah met him at the gate well i never mr beecot said mrs tawsey with her red arms akimbo in her usual attitude this is a sight for sore eyes won't my pretty be 'appy this day say what you may she's a makin' out bills fur them as 'ad washin' done bless her 'eart for a clever beauty how is business asked paul entering the gate which deborah opened bless you mr beecot i'll be a lady of forting soon answered the proprietress of the laundry the way washing 'ave come in is jest amazin' one 'ud think folk never 'ad no linen done up afore and that they never did 'ave said deborah rubbing her nose hard in my way which is a way if you'd only send along your shirts mr beecot i'd be proud to show you what can be done with fronts an' no thumbnails down them to spile their loveliness paul did not reply to this but laughed absently he was wondering if deborah had ever heard her master drop any hint as to his having come from the place where mrs krill resided and asked the question on the spur of the moment do you know christchurch in hants deborah rubbed her nose harder and looked at him doubtfully me as said as i'd no relatives must tell the truth now as i 'ave said she rather incoherently for my sister tilly junk worked for someone in that there place for years but we never got on well she being upsettin' and masterful so arsk her to my weddin' i didn't and denied relatives existing which they do she bein' alive ten years ago when she larst wrote you have not heard from her since asked paul inquisitively sir you may burn me or prison me or put me in pillaries said mrs tawsey but deceive you i won't me an' tilly not bein' of 'appy matchin' don't correspond we're londing both exclaimed deborah father 'avin' bin a 'awker but why she went to the country or why i stopped in gwynne street no one knows and may i arsk mr beecot why you arsk of that place your late master came from christchurch mrs tawsey did you never hear him mention it that i never did for close he was mr beecot say what you like i never knowed but what he'd pawned and sold them bookses all his blessed life for all the talkin' he did if i'd ha' knowd added deborah lifting her red finger as he'd bin maried afore and intended to cast out my lovely queen i'd ha' strangled him myself he had no intention of casting out sylvia said paul musingly he certainly left the money to her then why 'ave that other got it sylvia's name wasn't mentioned and miss krill is legally entitled as the legitimate daughter call her what you like she's a cat as her mother is afore her said mrs tawsey indignantly and not young at that thirty and over as i'm a livin' woman oh i don't think miss krill is as old as that being a man you wouldn't sir men bein' blind to wrinklings and paint but paint she do the hussey and young she ain't over thirty if i die for the sayin' of it but mrs krill was married to your master only thirty years ago then more shame to 'er snapped deborah masterfully for she ain't an honest woman if the signs of age is believing will i write to my sister tilly as i don't love mr beecot and arsk if she knowed master when he wos in that there place which she can't 'ave seeing she's bin there but ten year and he away twenty no deborah you'd better say nothing the case is in hurd's hands i'll tell him what you say and leave the matter to him but you must be deceived about miss krill's age i've got two eyes an' a nose retorted mrs tawsey so don't talk of deceivin's thirty and more she is the hussey let her jezebel of a mar lie as she like an' can say what you will mr beecot but there's my pretty smilin' from the winder and the tub's a waitin' so you go in and smooth 'er to affections while i see that mrs purr irons the shirts which she do lovely there's no denyin' hoh and deborah plunged round the corner of the house rampant and full of corn paul walked through the newly created garden in which he saw many proofs of sylvia's love for flowers and reached the door in time to take the girl in his arms she was flushed and joyful and her eyes were as bright as stars paul darling she said as they entered the sitting room where she was struggling with the accounts i'm so glad you are here what's nine times nine eighty one said paul looking at the long list of figures sylvia had been trying to add up why do you make your head ache with these accounts darling i must help debby paul and i get on very well with the aid of an arithmetic and she pointed to a small school book which she had evidently been studying let me take the burden from your shoulders said her lover smiling and sat down at the table which was strewn with bills in about an hour he had arranged all these and had made them out neatly to deborah's various customers then he directed the envelopes and sylvia sealed them up all the time they laughed and chatted and despite the dull toil thoroughly enjoyed themselves but i am glad to see sylvia said beecot pointing to three library volumes lying on the sofa that you enjoy yourself occasionally oh said sylvia pouncing on these i'm so glad you spoke paul i wanted to say something to you the confessions of a thug she read out and looked at paul have you read it beecot nodded by colonel meadows taylor a very interesting book but rather a bloodthirsty one for you dearest debby got it confessed miss norman along with some other books from a literary customer who could not pay his bill it is very strange paul that the confessions of a thug should be amongst the books really i don't see why smiled beecot fingering the old fashioned volumes it's the finger of fate paul said sylvia solemnly then seeing her lover look puzzled i mean that i should find out what goor is goor paul looked more puzzled than ever it's an indian word explained sylvia and means coarse sugar the thugs eat it before they strangle anyone oh laughed beecot and you think your father was strangled by a thug my dear child the thugs were stamped out years ago you'll read all about it in the preface of that book if i remember but it's long since i read the work besides darling he added drawing her to him caressingly the thugs never came to england paul said sylvia still more solemnly and resenting the laugh do you remember the thug that came into the shop oh you mean the street hawker that bart spoke of yes i remember that such an indian entered according to bart's tale and wanted to sell boot laces while that young imp tray was dancing on poor bart's body but the indian wasn't a thug sylvia yes he was she exclaimed excitedly hokar he said he was and hokar was a thug remember the handful of coarse brown sugar he left on the counter didn't bart tell you of that paul started yes by jove he did was his reply well then said sylvia triumphantly that sugar was goor and the thugs eat it before strangling anyone and father was strangled beecot could not but be impressed it is certainly very strange he said looking at the book and it was queer your father should have been strangled on the very night when this indian hokar left the sugar on the counter a coincidence sylvia darling no why should hokar leave the sugar at all well he didn't eat it and therefore if he was a thug he would have done so had he intended to strangle your father i don't know said sylvia with a look of obstinacy on her pretty face but remember the cruel way in which my father was killed paul it's just what an indian would do and then the sugar oh i'm quite sure this hawker committed the crime beecot shook his head and strove to dissuade her from entertaining this idea but sylvia usually so amenable to reason refused to discard her theory and indeed paul himself thought that the incident of the sugar was queer he determined to tell hurd about the matter and then the hawker might be found and made to explain why he had left the goor on the counter but the sect of the thugs is extinct argued paul quickly it can't be sylvia but it is she insisted i'm sure and from this firm opinion he could not move her finally when he departed he took the books with him and promised to read the novel again perhaps something might come of sylvia's fancy the lovers spent the rest of the time in talking over their future and beecot looked hopefully towards making sufficient money to offer sylvia a home he also described to her how he had met mrs krill and related what she was prepared to do do you think we should accept the five hundred a year paul said sylvia doubtfully it would put everything right and so long as i am with you i don't care where we live if you leave the decision to me darling said paul i think it will be best to refuse this offer something is wrong or mrs krill would not be so anxious to get you out of the country oh paul do you think she knows anything about the murder no dear i don't think that mrs krill is far too clever a woman to put her neck in danger but there may be a chance of her daughter losing the money sylvia he asked you saw maud krill how old would you take her to be oh quite old paul said sylvia decisively she dresses well and paints her face but she's forty oh sylvia not so much as that well then thirty and over insisted sylvia debby thinks the same as i do don't you think debby's zeal may lead her to exaggerate it doesn't lead me to exaggerate said sylvia slightly offended and i have eyes in my head as well as debby that girl or that woman i should say is over thirty paul in that case said beecot his color rising i fancy i see the reason of mrs krill's desire to get you out of the country maud he added deliberately may not be your father's daughter after all what makes you think that well according to the marriage certificate and to mrs krill's admission she was married to your father thirty years ago if maud is over thirty can't you see sylvia yes sylvia colored you mean she may be the same as i am not exactly dear replied paul soothing her i mean that mrs krill may have been a widow and have had her little girl with her when she married your father in that case maud certainly could not get the money and so mrs krill wants you to leave england in case i would get it said sylvia excited paul looked puzzled and rather sad i can't say dear he replied doubtfully certainly the money is left to 'my daughter' but as the marriage with your mother unfortunately is void i fear you would not inherit however he said grimly there would be a certain pleasure in taking the money from that woman maud is a mere puppet in her hands he laughed and then hay would marry a poor bride he ended maliciously sylvia could not quite understand all this and gave up trying to solve the problem with a pretty gesture of indifference what will you do paul she asked i'll see hurd and tell him what you and deborah say about the age of maud krill why not see mr pash because he is a traitor replied beecot darkly and knowing he has lost your confidence he will certainly try and give maud krill possession of the money no i'll speak to hurd who is my friend and yours he is clever and will be able to unravel this tangle tell him about the goor also paul yes i'll explain everything i can and then i'll get him to go down to christchurch and see what happened there when your father lived with maud's mother what did happen paul asked sylvia anxiously nothing he replied with an assumption of carelessness for he did not want to tell the girl about the fate of lady rachel sandal but we may find in your father's past life what led to his murder do you think mrs krill had anything to do with it my own you asked that question before no i don't still one never knows i should think mrs krill is a dangerous woman although i fancy too clever to risk being hanged however hurd can find out if she was in town on the night your father was killed that was on the sixth of july said sylvia yes and he was murdered at twelve after twelve said sylvia i heard the policeman on his beat at a quarter past and then i came down poor father was strangled before our very eyes she said shuddering hush dear don't speak of it said paul rising let us talk of more interesting subjects paul i can think of nothing till i learn who killed my poor father and why he was killed so cruelly then we must wait patiently sylvia hurd is looking after the matter and i have every confidence in hurd and by jove added beecot with an after thought mrs krill doubled the reward were she concerned in the matter she would not risk sharpening the wits of so clever a man as hurd no sylvia whosoever strangled your father it was not mrs krill it was this indian insisted sylvia and he's a thug paul laughed although he was far from thinking she might be wrong of course it seemed ridiculous that a thug should strangle the old man in the first place the thugs have been blotted out in the second if any survived they certainly would not exercise their devilish religion in england and in the third hokar putting aside his offering strangled victims to bhowanee the goddess of the sect had no reason for slaying an unoffending man finally there was the sailor to be accounted for the sailor who had tried to get the jewels from pash paul wondered if hurd had found out anything about this individual it's all very difficult sighed beecot and the more we go into the matter the more difficult does it get but we'll see light some day hurd if anyone will unravel the mystery and sylvia agreed with him chapter xvii hurd's information for the next day or two paul was kept closely to work in the office reading a number of tales which were awaiting his judgment after hours he several times tried to see billy hurd but was unable to meet him he left a note at the scotland yard office asking if hurd had received his communication regarding mrs krill and if so what he proposed to do concerning it hurd did not reply to this note and paul was growing puzzled over the silence of the detective at length the answer came not in writing but in the person of hurd himself who called on beecot the young man had just finished his frugal meal and was settling down to an evening's work when there came a knock to the door hurd dressed in his usual brown suit presented himself looking cool and composed but he was more excited than one would imagine as paul saw from the expression of his eyes the detective accepted a cup of coffee and lighted his pipe then he sat down in the arm chair on the opposite side of the fireplace and prepared to talk paul heaped on coals with a lavish hand little as he could afford this extravagance as the night was cold and he guessed that hurd had much to say so on the whole they had a very comfortable and interesting conversation i suppose you are pleased to see me asked hurd puffing meditatively at his briar paul nodded very glad he answered that is if you have done anything about mrs krill well drawled the detective smiling i have been investigating that murder case lady rachel sandal's said beecot eagerly is it really murder i think so though some folks think it suicide curious you should have stumbled across that young lord went on hurd musingly and more curious still that he should have been in the room with mrs krill without recollecting the name there was a great fuss made about it at the time oh i can understand lord george said beecot promptly the murder if it is one took place before he was born and as there seems to have been some scandal in the matter the family hushed it up this young fellow probably gathered scraps of information from old servants but from what he said to me in the cab i think he knows very little quite enough to put me on the track of lemuel krill's reason for leaving christchurch is that the reason yes twenty three years ago he left christchurch at the very time lady rachel was murdered in his public house then he disappeared for a time and turned up a year later in gwynne street with a young wife whom he had married in the meantime sylvia's mother exactly and miss norman was born a year later she's nearly twenty one isn't she yes she will be twenty one in three months hurd nodded gravely the time corresponds said he as the crime was committed twenty three years back and lord george is only twenty i can understand how he knows so little about it but didn't he connect mrs krill with the man who died in gwynne street no she explained that the name of krill appeared only a few times in the papers and was principally set forth with the portrait in the hand bills i shouldn't think lord george was the kind of young man to bother about hand bills all the same he might have heard talk at his club everyone isn't so stupid no but at all events he did not seem to connect mrs krill with the dead man and even with regard to the death of his aunt he fancied she might not be the same woman what an ass he must be said hurd contemptuously i don't think he has much brain confessed paul shrugging his shoulders but he asked me if i thought mrs krill was the same as the landlady of 'the red pig' and i denied that she was i don't like telling lies but in this case i hope the departure from truth will be pardoned you did very right said the detective the fewer people know about these matters the better especially a chatterbox like this young fool do you know him yes under the name of the count de la tour but i know of him in another way which i'll reveal later hay is still fleecing him he is but lord george seems to be growing suspicious of hay and paul related the conversation he had with the young man hurd grunted i'm sorry he said i want to catch hay red handed and if lord george grows too clever i may not be able to do so well said paul rather impatiently never mind about that fellow just now but tell me what you have discovered oh a lot of interesting things when i got your letter of course i at once connected the opal serpent with aaron norman and his change of name with the murder i knew that norman came to gwynne street over twenty years ago that came out in the evidence connected with his death therefore putting two and two together i searched in the newspapers of that period and found what i wanted a report of the case precisely and after that i hunted up the records at scotland yard for further details that were not made public so i got the whole story together and i am pretty certain that aaron norman or as he then was lemuel krill murdered lady rachel for the sake of that precious brooch ah said paul drawing a breath now i understand why he fainted when he saw it again no wonder considering it was connected in his mind with the death of lady rachel quite so and no wonder the man kept looking over his shoulder in the expectation of being tapped on the shoulder by a policeman i don't wonder also that he locked up the house and kept his one eye on the ground and went to church secretly to pray what a life he must have led upon my soul bad as the man was i'm sorry for him so am i said paul and after all he is sylvia's father poor girl to have a murderer for a father beecot turned pale i love sylvia for herself he said with an effort and if her father had committed twenty murders i would not let her go but she must never know no said hurd stretching his hand across and giving paul a friendly grip and i knew you'd stick to her it wouldn't be fair to blame the girl for what her father did before she was born we must keep everything from her hurd i'll marry her and take her abroad sooner than she should learn of this previous murder but how did it happen i'll tell you in a few minutes hurd rose and began to pace the narrow limits of the attic by the way do you know that norman was a secret drinker of brandy paul nodded and told the detective what he had learned from mrs krill hurd was much struck with the intelligence i see said he what mrs krill says is quite true drink does change the ordinary nature into the opposite krill sober was a timid rabbit krill drunk was a murderer and a thief good lord and how he drank how do you know well confessed hurd nursing his chin pash and i went to search the gwynne street house to find if possible the story alluded to in the scrap of paper deborah junk found we couldn't drop across anything of that sort but in norman's bedroom which nobody ever entered we found brandy bottles by the score under the bed ranged along the walls filling cupboards stowed away in boxes i had the curiosity to count them those we found ran up to five hundred and lord knows how many more he must have got rid of when he found the bottles crowding him inconveniently i expect he got drunk every night said paul thinking when he locked up sylvia and deborah in the upper room i can understand now why he did so he could go to the cellar and take possession of the shop key left on the nail by bart then free from all intrusion he could drink till reeling not that i think he ever did reel went on beecot mindful of what mrs krill had said he could stand a lot and i expect the brandy only converted him into a demon and a clever business man said hurd you know aaron norman was not clever over the books bart sold those but from all accounts he was a shylock when dealing after seven o'clock in the pawnbroking way i understand now sober he was a timid fool drunk he was a bold clever villain my poor sylvia what a father sighed paul but this crime i'll tell you about it lemuel krill and his wife kept 'the red pig' at christchurch a little public house it is on the outskirts of the town frequented by farm laborers and such like the business was pretty good but the couple didn't look to making their fortune mrs krill was a farmer's daughter a buckinghamshire farmer said paul how do you know oh on receiving information mrs krill told you so well considering the murder of lady rachel she would have done better to hold her tongue and have commenced life with her dead husband's money under a new name she's a clever woman too mused hurd i can't understand her being so unnecessarily frank never mind go on said paul impatiently hurd returned to his seat and re filled his pipe well then he continued krill got drunk and gave his wife great trouble sometimes he thrashed her and blacked her eyes and he treated their daughter badly too how old was the daughter i can't say why do you ask i'll tell you later go on please well then mrs krill always revenged herself on her husband when he was sober and timid so the couple were evenly matched krill was master when drunk and his wife mistress when he was sober a kind of see saw sort of life they must have led where does lady rachel come in what an impatient chap you are remonstrated hurd in a friendly tone i'm coming to that now lady rachel quarrelled with her father over some young artist she wanted to marry he would not allow the lover to come to the hall so lady rachel said she would kill herself rather than give him up and she did said paul thinking of the suicide theory there you go again how am i to tell you all when you interrupt i beg your pardon i won't do so again hurd nodded smilingly and continued one night it was dark and stormy lady rachel had a row royal with her father then she ran out of the hall saying her father would never see her alive again she may have intended to commit suicide certainly or she may have intended to join her lover in london but whatever she intended to do the rain cooled her she staggered into christchurch and fell down insensible at the door of 'the red pig' mrs krill brought her indoors and laid her on a bed did she know who the lady was hurd shook his head she said in her evidence that she did not but living in the neighborhood she certainly must have seen lady rachel sometimes krill was drunk as usual he had been boozing all the day with a skipper of some craft at southampton he was good for nothing so mrs krill did everything she declares that she went to bed at eleven leaving lady rachel sleeping did lady rachel recover her senses yes according to mrs krill but she refused to say who she was and merely stated that she would sleep at 'the red pig' that night and would go on to london next morning mrs krill swore that lady rachel had no idea of committing suicide well about midnight mrs krill who slept in one room with her daughter was awakened by loud shouts she sprang to her feet and hurried out her daughter came also as she had been awakened and was terrified mrs krill found that her husband was raving mad with drink and smashing the furniture in the room below the skipper what was the skipper's name jessop jarvey jessop well he also rather drunk was retiring to bed and stumbled by chance into lady rachel's room he found her quite dead and shouted for assistance the poor lady had a silk handkerchief she wore tied tightly round her throat and fastened to the bedpost when jessop saw this he ran out of the inn in dismay mrs krill descended to give the alarm to her neighbors but krill struck her down and struck his daughter also making her mouth bleed an opal brooch that lady rachel wore was missing but mrs krill only knew of that the next day she was insensible from the blow given by krill and the daughter ran out to get assistance when the neighbors entered krill was gone and notwithstanding all the search made for him he could not be found and jessop he turned up and explained that he had been frightened on finding the woman dead but the police found him on his craft at southampton and he gave evidence he said that krill when drunk and like a demon as mrs krill told you had left the room several times the last time he came back he and the skipper had a final drink and then jessop retired to find the body it was supposed by the police that krill had killed lady rachel for the sake of the brooch which could not be discovered but the brooch hold on i know what you are about to say we'll come to that shortly let me finish this yarn first it was also argued that from lady rachel's last words to her father and from the position of the body tied by the neck to the bedpost that she had committed suicide mrs krill as i said declared the deceased lady never mentioned the idea of making away with herself however krill's flight and the chance that being drunk he might have strangled the lady for the sake of the brooch while out of the room made many think he was the culprit especially as jessop said that krill had noticed the brooch and commented on the opals he was a traveller in jewels once according to his wife yes and left that to turn innkeeper afterwards he vanished as i say and became a pawnbroker in gwynne street well the jury at the inquest could not agree some thought lady rachel had committed suicide and others that krill had murdered her then the family didn't want a scandal so in one way and another the matter was hushed up the jury brought in a verdict of suicide by a majority of one so you can see how equally they were divided lady rachel's body was laid in the family vault and nothing more was heard of lemuel krill what did mrs krill do she stopped on at the inn as she told you people were sorry for her and helped her so she did very well mother and daughter have lived at 'the red pig' all these years highly respected until they saw the hand bills about krill then the money was claimed but as the circumstance of lady rachel's fate was so old nobody thought of mentioning it till this young lord did so to you and i as you see have hunted out the details what is your opinion hurd asked paul deeply interested oh i think krill murdered the woman and then cut to london that accounts for his looking over his shoulder etc about which we talked but how did he get money to start as a bookseller premises are not leased in gwynne street for nothing well he might have got money on the brooch no the brooch was pawned by a nautical gentleman paul started up captain jessop perhaps you remember he said excitedly ah said hurd puffing his pipe with satisfaction i see you understand i mentioned that about the brooch to hear what you would say yes jessop must have pawned the brooch at stowley and it must have been jessop who came with the note for the jewels to pash ha said paul walking excitedly about the room then it would seem that jessop and krill were in league i think so said hurd staring at the fire and yet i am not sure jessop may have found that krill had killed the woman and then have made him give up the brooch which he afterwards pawned at stowley though why he should go near mrs krill's old home i can't understand is stowley near her old home yes in buckinghamshire however after pawning the brooch i expect jessop lost sight of krill till he must have come across him a few days before the crime then he must have made krill sign the paper ordering the jewels to be given up by pash so that he might get money a kind of blackmail in fact well said hurd doubtfully after all jessop might have killed krill himself but how did jessop get the brooch ah that i can't tell you unless norman himself picked it up in the street we must find these things out i'm going to christchurch to make inquiries i'll let you know what i discover and hurd rose one minute said paul hastily do you think miss krill is the dead man's child of course she's as like her mother as two peas why do you ask paul detailed what sylvia and deborah had said so if she is over thirty said beecot she can't be krill's child or else she must have been born before krill married his wife in either case she has no right to the money it's strange said hurd musingly i'll have to look into that meanwhile i've got plenty to do there's another thing i have to say you'll confuse me beecot what is it the sugar and that hawker and paul related what sylvia had said about thuggism hurd sat down and stared that must be bosh he said looking at the novel and yet it's mighty queer i say he took the three volumes will you lend me these yes be careful they are not mine i'll be careful but i can't dip into them just yet nor can i go into the hindoo business let alone this age of miss krill the first thing i have to do is to go to christchurch and see and see if mrs krill was at home on the night of the sixth of july hurd started oh said he dryly the night the crime was committed you mean well i didn't intend to look up that point as i do not see how mrs krill can be implicated however i'll take a note of that and this he did and then continued but i'm anxious to find jessop i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that he committed the double crime the double crime yes he might have strangled lady rachel and twenty years later have killed krill i can't be sure but i think he is the guilty person chapter xviii at christchurch hants the next afternoon hurd was on his way to the former abode of mrs krill during the journey he glanced at his notes and arranged what inquiries he should make it struck him as strange that mrs krill should have told paul of her association with the red pig considering the reputation of the place in connection with lady rachel sandal's murder or suicide it would have been better had mrs krill changed her name by letters patent and have started a new life on her dead husband's money the detective could not understand the reason for this unnecessary frankness before leaving town he took the precaution to call on pash and note down a description of the sailor presumably jessop who had tried to obtain possession of the jewels on the morning after the crime had been committed in gwynne street he learned that the man who had given no name was tall and stout with the flushed skin of a habitual drinker of strong waters and reddish hair mixed with grey he also had a scar running from his right temple to his mouth and although this was partly concealed by a beard yet it was distinctly visible the man was dressed in blue serge carried his large hands slightly clenched and rolled in his gait hurd noted these things down and had little doubt but what he would recognize the man if he came across him connecting him with the individual who had pawned the brooch at stowley hurd fancied he might be jessop he resolved to look for him in southampton as judging from the evidence given at the inquest on lady rachel's remains that was the port of call for the mariner at the station immediately before that of christchurch hurd glanced at a telegram which he produced out of his pocket book and then leaned out of the carriage window a pretty daintily dressed little woman saw him and at once entered the carriage with a gay laugh she was miss aurora qian and paul would have been considerably astonished had he overheard her conversation with mr hurd but the detective and the actress had the compartment to themselves and talked freely it's the safest place to talk in explained miss qian producing a bag of chocolate and eating during the conversation of course i told the landlady at 'the red pig' that my brother was coming down so we can go there right enough but walls have ears i don't think railway carriages have though and we have much to say billy have you found out anything aurora asked hurd miss qian nodded a great deal considering i have been in the place only twenty four hours it's a good thing i'm out of an engagement billy or i shouldn't have time to leave london or to look after that man hay i am a good sister well you are but there's money in the business also if i can get that thousand pounds you'll have your share i know you'll treat me straight billy said the actress with much satisfaction i always say that my brother is as square a man as i know the deuce you do said hurd rather vexed i hope you don't go telling everyone that i am your brother aurora only one or two special friends not hay you may be sure nor does that nice mr beecot know that we are brother and sister you'd best keep it dark and say nothing aurora it's just as well you left the private detective business and went on the stage you talk too much oh no i don't retorted miss qian eating a sweet don't be nasty billy or i'll tell you nothing her brother shrugged his shoulders he was very fond of aurora but he saw her many faults and she certainly had too long a tongue for one engaged in private matters what about hay he asked aurora raised her eyes i thought you wanted to know of my discoveries at christchurch she said pouting well i do but hay oh he's all right he's going to marry miss krill and her money and is getting cash together by fleecing young sandal that fool will play and keeps losing his money although i've warned him then don't warn him i wish to catch hay red handed ah miss qian nodded you may catch him red handed in a worse matter than gambling aurora you don't mean to say he has anything to do with the murder of aaron norman well i don't go so far as to say that billy but when i got settled in the private sitting room of 'the red pig' on the plea that i had come down for a change of air and expected my brother which you do without any lies yes that's all right billy she said impatiently well the first thing i clapped eyes on was a portrait of grexon hay in a silver frame on the mantelpiece hum said hurd nursing his chin in his hand he may have given that to miss krill during the engagement i daresay rejoined the actress tartly for he has been engaged for many a long day say two years i thought so said hurd triumphantly i always fancied the meeting at pash's office was a got up thing what made you think so because when disguised as the count de la tour i overheard hay address miss krill as maud and it was the first time she and her mother came to his rooms sandal was there and gambling went on as usual i lost money myself said hurd with a grimace in order to make hay think i was another pigeon to pluck but the mention of the christian name on so short an acquaintance showed me that hay and miss krill had met before i expect the meeting at pash's office was a got up game you said that before billy how you repeat yourself yes there's an inscription on the portrait 'from grexon to maud with much love' sweet isn't it when you think what an icicle the man is there is also a date two years ago the photograph was given i admired the photograph and asked the landlady who was the swell what's the landlady's name matilda junk hurd almost jumped from his seat that's queer he said the woman who is devoted to miss norman and who nursed her since she was a baby is called deborah junk i know that said aurora i'm not quite a fool billy i mentioned deborah junk whom i saw at the inquest on norman's body the landlady said she was her sister but she had not heard of her for ages and this matilda is just like deborah in looks a large dutch doll with beady eyes and a badly painted face well that's a point said hurd making a note what did she say about the photograph oh that it was one of mr hay who was miss krill's young man and that they had been engaged for two years matilda seems to be a chatterbox she is i got a lot out of her then there can be nothing to conceal on the part of mrs krill well said aurora throwing the empty sweetmeat bag out of the window and brushing her lap so far as i can discover mrs krill is a perfectly respectable person and has lived for thirty years as the landlady of 'the red pig' matilda acknowledged that her mistress had inherited the money of lemuel krill and matilda knows all about the murder matilda is wrong said the detective dryly miss krill gets the money aurora smiled from what i heard miss krill has to do what her mother tells her she's nobody and her mother is all the world matilda confessed that her mistress had behaved very well to her when the money came she gave up 'the red pig' to matilda junk who is now the landlady with a proviso she should hold her tongue no mrs krill so far as i can learn has nothing to conceal even if it becomes known in london that she was the landlady of a small pub i don't think it will matter did you ask questions about lady rachel's murder no you gave me only a hint when you sent me down i didn't like to venture on ground i wasn't sure of i'm more cautious than you well i'll tell you everything now said hurd and gave a rapid sketch of what he had learned from the newspapers and the scotland yard papers relative to the sandal affair aurora nodded but matilda junk said nothing of that she merely stated that mr lemuel krill had gone to london over twenty years ago and that his wife knew nothing of him until she saw the hand bills hum said hurd again as the train slowed down to the christchurch station it seems all fair and above board what about jessop knowing so little of the lady rachel case i didn't inquire about him said aurora i've told you everything anyone else stopping at the inn no and it's not a bad little place after all the rooms are clean and the food good and the charges low i'd rather stop at 'the red pig' small as it is than at the big hotel the curries oh they are delightfully hot miss qian screwed her small face into a smile of ecstasy but then a native makes them hurd started curries a native yes a man called hokar aurora that's the man who left the sugar on the counter of norman's shop i forgot you don't know about that and hurd rapidly told her of the episode it's strange said miss qian nodding with a faraway look it would seem that mrs krill knew of the whereabouts of her husband before she saw the hand bills and possibly about the murder also said hurd brother and sister looked at one another the case was becoming more and more interesting mrs krill evidently knew more than she chose to admit but at this moment the train stopped and they got out hurd took his handbag and walked into the town with his pretty sister tripping beside him she gave him an additional piece of information before they arrived at the red pig this hokar is not at all popular she said they say he eats cats and dogs yes i've talked to several old women and they say they lost their animals one cat was found strangled in the yard and strangled interrupted the detective hum and the man's an indian possibly a thug what's a thug asked aurora staring hurd explained i ran through the book lent by beecot last night he added and was so interested i sat up till dawn you do look chippy said his sister candidly but from what you say there are no thugs living no the author says so still it's queer this strangling and then the cruel way in which the man was murdered just what a hindoo would do the sugar too oh nonsense hokar left the sugar by mistake if he had intended to murder norman he wouldn't have given himself away i expect he never thought anyone would guess he was a thug the novel is not one usually read nowadays it was the merest chance that miss norman came across it and told beecot i don't believe in such coincidences said aurora dryly for in spite of her fluffy kittenish looks she was a very practical person but here we are at 'the red pig' nice and comfy isn't it the inn was certainly very pretty it stood on the very verge of the town and beyond stretched fields and hedgerows the house itself was a white washed thatched rustic cottage with a badly painted sign of a large red sow outside were benches where topers sat and the windows were delightfully old fashioned diamond paned casements quite a dickens inn of the old coaching days was the red pig but hurd gave the pretty quaint hostel only a passing glance he was staring at a woman who stood in the doorway shading her eyes with the palm of her hand from the setting sun in her the detective saw the image of deborah junk now tawsey she was of the same gigantic build with the same ruddy face sharp black eyes and boisterous manner but she had not the kindly look of deborah and of the two sisters hurd preferred the one he already knew this is my brother miss junk said aurora marching up to the door he will only stay until to morrow you're welcome sir said matilda in a loud and hearty voice which reminded the detective more than ever of her sister will you please walk in and 'ave some tea hurd nodded and repaired to the tiny sitting room where he saw the photograph of hay on the mantelpiece aurora at a hint from her brother went to her bedroom to change her dress and hurd spoke to matilda when she brought in the tray i know your sister said he miss junk nearly dropped the tray lor' now only think why we ain't wrote to one another for ten years and i left london eleven years back and how is she sir and where is she she is well she has a laundry in jubileetown near london and she is married to a fellow called bart tawsey married cried matilda setting down the tray and putting her arms akimbo just like deborah lor' and me still single but now i've got this 'ouse and a bit put by i'll think of gittin' a 'usband i ain't a goin' to let debby crow over me your sister was in the service of mr norman before she took up the laundry observed hurd pouring out a cup of tea was she now and why did she leave the name of norman apparently was unknown to matilda so hurd tried the effect of another bombshell her master was murdered under the name of lemuel krill mercy matilda dropped into a chair with a thud which shook the room why that's my ladies' husband and father what ladies asked hurd pretending ignorance my ladies mrs krill and miss maud they had this 'ouse and kep' it for years respectable i worked for 'em ten and when my ladies comes in for a forting for a forting there is they gave me the goodwill of 'the red pig' to think of debby being the servant of poor mr krill as was killed who killed 'im doesn't your mistress know she cried matilda indignantly and bouncing up why she was always a lookin' for him not as she loved him over much and as he is dead sir it's no more as what he oughter be seeing as he killed a poor lady in this very 'ouse you'll sleep in 'er room to night added matilda as if that was a pleasure strangled she was i think i heard of that but lady rachel sandal committed suicide matilda rubbed her nose after the deborah fashion well sir my ladies were never sure which it was and of course it was before my time considerable being more nor twenty year back but the man as did it is dead and lef' my ladies his money as he oughter an' miss maud's a goin' to marry a real gent matilda glanced at the photograph i allays said he wos a gent bein' so 'aughty like and wearing evening dress at meals late was he ever down here this gentleman he's been comin' and goin' fur months and miss maud loves 'im somethin' cruel but they'll marry now an' be 'appy i suppose your ladies sometimes went to see this gent in town meanin' mr hay said matilda artlessly well sir they did one at a time and then together missis would go and miss would foller an' miss an' missus together would take their joy of the towers an' shops and madame tusord's and sich like mr hay allays lookin' after 'em did they ever visit mr hay in july no they didn't snapped matilda with a change of tone which did not escape hurd and i don't know sir why you arsk them questions my good woman i ask no questions if i do you need not reply let us change the subject my sister tells me you make good curries in this hotel hokar do me bein' but a plain cook oh he's an indian yes he is sir a pore indian castaway as missus took up with when he come here drenched with rain and weary ah missus was allays good and kind and christian like privately hurd thought this description did not apply very well to the lady in question but he was careful not to arouse matilda's suspicions again by contradicting her he pretended to joke i wonder you don't marry this indian and keep him here always to make the curries i have heard of me marry a black cried matilda tossing her rough head well sir i never her breath failed her an' him goin' about the country what do you mean by that what i say said miss junk he'll stop here christian like for days and then go orf to sell things as a 'awker my par was a 'awker sir but a white white man of the finest hurd was about to ask another question when a husky voice was heard singing somewhat out of tune what's that asked hurd irritably lor' sir wot nervses you 'ave 'tis only cap'n jessop makin' hisself 'appy like captain jessop hurd laughed he had run down his man at last chapter xix captain jessop apparently matilda junk was quite ignorant of anything being wrong about her ladies although she did shirk the question regarding their possible visit to london in july however hurd had learned that grexon hay not only was an old friend but had been engaged to maud for many months this information made him the more certain that hay had robbed beecot of the opal brooch at the time of the accident and that it had passed from mr hay's hands into those of the assassin i wonder if mrs krill murdered her husband in that cruel way thought the detective sitting over his tea but what could have been her object she could have gone up on learning from hay that aaron norman was her husband as i believe she did and could then have made him give her the money by threatening him with the murder of lady rachel i daresay aaron norman in his krill days did strangle that lady to get the opal brooch and his wife could have used what she knew to govern him there was no need of murder hum i'll see about getting the truth out of hay aurora he cried oh there you are he added as she entered the room i want you to go back to town this night what for billy can you get hay into trouble aurora nodded i have proofs of his cheating lord george and others if that's what you mean she said but you didn't want them used nor do i he's such an eel he may wriggle out of our clutches but can't you give a party and invite lord george and hay and then get them to play cards should hay cheat denounce him to george sandal what good would that do asked miss qian with widely open eyes it will make hay confess about the brooch to save himself from public shame his reputation is his life remember and if he is caught red handed cheating he'll have to clear out of town pooh as if that mattered he's going to marry miss krill if miss krill keeps the money and i doubt if she will but billy never mind don't ask me any more questions but go and pack this captain jessop is in the bar drinking i may probably have to arrest him i got a warrant on the chance of finding him here i can arrest him on suspicion and won't let him go until i get at the truth your business is to bring hay to his knees and get the truth out of him about the opal serpent you know the case yes grumbled aurora i know the case but i don't like this long journey to night every moment is precious if i arrest jessop matilda junk will tell her ladies who will speak to hay and then he may slip away as the brooch evidence is so particular and as i believe he can give it if forced you can see the importance of losing no time miss qian nodded and went away to pack she wanted money and knew billy would give her a goodly share of the reward in a few minutes miss junk of the red pig learned that miss qian was suddenly summoned to town and would leave in an hour quite unsuspectingly she assisted her to pack and shortly aurora was driving in a hired vehicle to the railway station on her way to trap grexon hay when she was safely off the premises hurd walked to the telegraph office and sent a cipher message to the yard asking for a couple of plain clothes policemen to be sent down he wanted to have hokar and miss matilda junk watched also the house in case mrs krill and her daughter should return captain jessop he proposed to look after himself but he was in no hurry to make that gentleman's acquaintance as he intended to arrest him quietly in the sitting room after dinner already he had informed matilda that he would ask a gentleman to join him at the meal and taste hokar's curry the thought of the curry brought the indian to his mind and when he got back to the red pig he strolled round the house inspecting the place but in reality keeping eyes and ears open to talk to the hindoo thinking he might meet the man some time hurd had carefully learned a few phrases relating to thuggism in english of course since he knew nothing of the indian tongues these he proposed to use in the course of conversation with hokar and watch the effect soon he found the man sitting cross legged under a tree in the yard smoking evidently his work for the day was over and he was enjoying himself remembering the description given by bart the detective saw that this was the very man who had entered the shop of aaron norman he wore the same dress and looked dirty and disreputable quite a waif and a stray hullo said hurd casually what are you doing talk english eh yes sir said hokar calmly i spike good englis missionary teach hokar englis i'm glad of that we can have a chat said hurd producing his pipe he also produced something else with which he had provided himself on the way back from the post office in another minute hokar was staring at a small parcel of coarse brown sugar with all his oriental phlegm the man could not keep his countenance his eyes rolled until they threatened to drop out of his head and he looked at hurd with a certain amount of fear goor said that gentleman pointing to the sugar with the stem of his pipe goor hokar turned green under his dark skin and half rose to go away but his legs failed him and he sat still trying to recover himself so you worship bhowanee went on his tormentor the indian's face expressed lively curiosity the great goddess yes kalee you know did you make tupounee after you used your roomal on aaron norman hokar gave a guttural cry and gasped tupounee is the sacrifice made by the thugs after a successful crime and roomal the handkerchief with which they strangled their victims all this was information culled from colonel meadow taylor's book by the accomplished detective well said hurd smoking placidly what have you to say mr hokar i know nozzin' said the man sullenly but in deadly fear yes you do sit still said hurd with sudden sternness if you try to run away i'll have you arrested eyes are on you and you can't take a step without my knowing some of this was greek to the indian owing to his imperfect knowledge of english but he understood that the law would lay hold of him if he did not obey this sahib and so sat still i know not anysing he repeated his teeth chattering yes you do you're a thug zer no thug i agree with you said hurd you are the last of the mohicans i want to know why you offered aaron norman to bhowanee hokar made a strange sign on his forehead at the mention of the sacred name and muttered something perhaps a prayer in his native tongue then he looked up i know nozzing don't repeat that rubbish said hurd calmly you sold boot laces in the shop in gwynne street on the day when its master was killed and he was the husband of the lady who helped you mrs krill you say dat said hokar stolidly yes and i can prove it the boy tray and i can lay my hands on him saw you also bart tawsey the shopman you left a handful of sugar though why you did so instead of eating it i can't understand hokar's face lighted up and he showed his teeth disdainfully oh you sahibs know nozzin' said he spreading out his lean brown hands ze shops ah yis i there yis but i use no roomal not then but you did later hokar shook his head i use no roomal zat sahib one eye bad ver bad bhowanee no have one eye no bhungees no bhats no what are you talking about said hurd angrily his reading had not told him that no maimed persons could be offered to the goddess of the thugs bhungees meant sweepers and bhats bards both of which classes were spared by the stranglers you killed that man now who told you to kill him i know nozzin' i no kill bhowanee no take one eye mans for want of an interpreter hurd found it difficult to carry on the conversation he rose and determined to postpone further examination till he would get someone who understood the hindoo tongue but in the meantime hokar might run away and hurd rather regretted that he had been so precipitate however he nodded to the man and went off pretty sure he would not fly at once then hurd went to the village police office and told a bucolic constable to keep his eye on miss junk's fureiner as he learned hokar was called the policeman a smooth faced individual promised to do so after hurd produced his credentials and sauntered towards the red pig at some distance from the detective's heels a timely question about the curry revealed by the mouth of miss junk that hokar was still in the kitchen but he do seem alarmed like said matilda laying the cloth let's hope he won't spoil the curry remarked hurd then knowing hokar was safe he went into the bar to make the acquaintance of his other victim captain jarvey jessop quite answered to the description given by pash he was large and sailor like with red hair mixed with grey and a red beard that scarcely concealed the scar running from temple to mouth he had drunk enough to make him cheerful and was quite willing to fall into conversation with hurd who explained himself unnecessarily i'm a commercial gent said the detective calling for two rums plain and i like talking me too growled the sailor grasping his glass i'm here on what you'd call a visit but i go back to my home to morrow then it's ho for callao he shouted in a sing song voice hurd knew the fierce old chanty and sized captain jarvey up at once he was of the buccaneer type and there was little he would not do to make money and have a roaring time failing hokar with his deadly handkerchief here was the man who might have killed aaron norman drink up shouted hurd in his turn we'll have some more on no condition is extradition allowed in callao gum said captain jessop you know the chanty hurd winked i've bin round about in my time jessop stretched out a huge hand put it there mate said he with a roar like a fog horn and drink up along o' me my treat hurd nodded and became jovial on condition you join me at dinner they make good curries here i've had curry said captain jessop heavily in colombo and hong kong frequent but hokar's curries are the best ah said hurd in a friendly curious way so you know this shanty jessop looked at him with contempt know this shanty said he with a grin why in coorse i do i've been swinging my hammock here time in and out for the last thirty year you'll be a christchurch man then not me mate i'm buckinghamshire stowley born hurd with difficulty suppressed a start stowley was the place where the all important brooch had been pawned by a nautical man and here was the man in question i should have thought you'd lived near the sea he said cautiously say southampton oh i used t'go there for my ship said the captain draining his glass but i don't go there no more retired eh jessop nodded and looked at his friend as he considered hurd since the invitation to dinner with a blood shot pair of eyes come storm come calm he growled i've sailed the ocean for forty years yes sir you bet i was a slip of a fifteen cabin boy on my first cruise and then i got on to being skipper lord jessop smacked his knee the things i've seen we'll have them to night after dinner said hurd nodding but now i suppose you've made your fortune no said the captain gloomily not what you'd call money i've got a stand by though and he winked ah married to a rich wife not me i've had enough of marriage having been the skipper of a mermaid with a tongue no sir he roared out another line of some song floating in his muzzy head a saucy bachelor am i then changed to gruff talk and i intends being one all my days stand by i have t'ain't a wife but i can draw the money regular and no questions asked again he winked and drank another glass hurd reflected that perhaps jessop had killed aaron norman for mrs krill and she was paying him blood money but he did not dare to press the question as jessop was coming perilously near what the irish call the cross drop he therefore proposed an adjournment to the sitting room jessop agreed quite unsuspectingly not guessing he was being trapped the man was so large and uncouth that hurd felt behind his waist to see that his revolver was loose and could be used should occasion arise miss junk brought in the dinner with her own fair hands and explained that hokar had made the curry but she didn't think it was as good as usual the man's shakin' like a jelly said matilda i don't know why the detective nodded but did not encourage conversation he was quite sure that hokar was being watched by the smooth faced policeman and could not get away besides he wished to talk to captain jessop miss junk seeing that she was not needed retreated after bringing in the curry and left the gentlemen to help themselves so here was hurd in a pleasant room seated before a well spread table and with a roaring fire at his back waiting his opportunity to make captain jarvey jessop confess his share in the dual murders of lady rachel sandal and aaron norman chapter xx part of the truth captain jessop ate as greedily as he drank strong waters and did full justice to the curry which was really excellent hurd did not broach any unpleasant topic immediately as he wished the man to enjoy his meal if jessop was guilty this dainty dinner would be the last of its kind he would have for many a long day moreover hurd wished to learn more of the mariner's character and plied him with questions which the unsuspecting sailor answered amiably enough me an' you might become mates as it were said jessop extending his large hand again and again put it there well we'd want to know something more about one another to become real mates laughed hurd oh you're a commercial traveller as you say and i'm the captain of as fine a barkey as ever sailed under capricorn leastways i was afore i gave up deep sea voyages you must miss the ocean living at stowley inland it is admitted the mariner pulling out a dirty clay pipe at the conclusion of the meal and ocean there ain't round about fur miles but i've got a shanty there and live respectable you are able to with the stand by hinted hurd jessop nodded and crammed black tobacco very strong and rank into the bowl of his pipe with a shaking hand it ain't much he admitted folks being stingy but if i wants more he struck the table hard i can get it d'ye see mister commercial yes i see replied hurd coolly jessop was again growing cross and the detective had to be careful he knew well enough that next morning when sober jessop would not be so disposed to talk but being muzzy he opened his heart freely still it was evident that a trifle more liquor would make him quarrelsome so hurd proposed coffee a proposition to which the sailor graciously assented cawfee he observed lighting his pipe and filling the room with evil smelling smoke clears the 'ead not as mine wants clearing mind you but cawfee ain't bad when rum ain't t' be 'ad you'll have more rum later hinted hurd put it there said jessop and again the detective was forced to wince at the strong grip of a horny hand miss junk appeared in answer to the tinkle of the bell and removed the food afterwards she brought in coffee hot and strong and black and jessop drank two cups with the result that he became quieter then the two men settled down for a pleasant conversation at least jessop thought so for he frequently expressed the friendliest sentiments towards his host then matilda appeared with a bottle of rum a kettle and two glasses when she departed hurd intimated that he would not require her services again that night this he whispered to her at the door while jessop was placing the kettle on the fire and before returning to his seat he quietly turned the key so he had the mariner entirely to himself and got to business at once while the kettle boiled you have known this place for years i believe said hurd taking a chair opposite to that of jessop did you ever drop across a man who used to live here called lemuel krill the other man started whatever makes you arsk that he inquired in a husky voice well you see as a commercial i trade in books and had to do with a second hand bookseller in gwynne street drury lane it seems that he was murdered and he eyed jessop attentively the sailor nodded and composed himself with a violent effort yes said he in his husky voice so i heard but what's he got to do with lemuel krill oh said hurd carelessly it is said aaron norman was krill might ha' bin i don't know myself was the gruff reply ah then you did not know lemuel krill well admitted the captain reluctantly i did he wos the landlord of this here pub and a cuss to drink lor' 'ow he could drink and did too but he run away from his wife as used to keep this shanty and she never heard no more of him until she found he was rich and could leave her five thousand a year said hurd absently so like a woman you seem to know all about it mister said the sailor uneasily yes i read the papers a queer case that of norman's death i expect it was only right he should be strangled seeing he killed lady rachel sandal in the same way jessop resting his hands on the arms of his chair pushed it back and stared with a white face you know of that he gasped why not it was public talk in this place over twenty years ago i understand you have been here abouts for thirty years went on hurd carelessly possibly you may recollect the case jessop wiped his forehead i heard something about it that there lady committed suicide they say i know what they say but i want to know what you say i won't be arsked questions shouted the captain angrily don't raise your voice said the detective smoothly we may as well conduct this conversation pleasantly i don't converse no more said jessop in a shaky voice and staggered to his feet rapidly growing sober under the influence of a deadly fear hurd did not move as the man crossed the room but felt if the key was safe in his pocket the sailor tried to open the door and then realized that it was locked he turned on his host with a volley of bad language and found himself facing a levelled revolver sit down said hurd quietly go back to your chair jessop with staring eyes and outspread hands backed to the wall who are you anyhow he demanded hardly able to speak perhaps that will tell you said hurd and threw the warrant on the table jessop staggered forward and looked at it one glance was sufficient to inform him what it was and he sank back into his chair with a groan leaving the warrant on the table hurd picked it up and slipped it into his pocket he thought jessop might destroy it but there was no fight in the mariner and now that we understand one another said hurd putting away his weapon i want to talk sha'n't talk said jessop savagely oh yes i think so otherwise i can make things unpleasant for you you can't arrest me i've done nothing that may be so but arrest you i can and i have done so now to morrow morning you will go to london in charge of a plain clothes policeman while i go to stowley to my crib no i'm blest if you do i sha'n't go immediately to your crib rejoined hurd dryly though i may do so later my first visit will be to that old pawnbroker i think if i describe you and you are rather a noticeable man captain jessop he will recognize the individual who pawned an opal serpent brooch with him shortly after the death of lady rachel sandal to whom the said brooch belonged it's a lie said jessop hoarsely and sober enough now quite so and perhaps it is also a lie that a man resembling yourself tried to get certain jewellery from a lawyer called pash jessop lost his self control which he was trying desperately to preserve and rose to his feet white faced and haggard who are you he shouted who are you doesn't the warrant tell you replied his companion not at all upset my name is billy hurd i am the detective in charge of the norman murder case and i've been looking for you for a long time mr jessop i know nothing about it yes you do so sit down and talk away i'll break your head cried the captain swinging his huge fists try hurd whipped out his revolver but did not rise at the risk of getting a bullet through you pshaw man don't be a fool i'm making things as easy for you as possible create a disturbance and i'll hand you over to the police a night in the village lock up may cool your blood sit down i tell you the sailor showed his teeth like those of a snarling dog and made as to strike the seated detective but suddenly changing his mind for he saw well enough in what danger he stood he dropped into his chair and covering his face with his hands groaned aloud hurd put away his revolver that's better said he pleasantly take a tot of rum and tell me all you know i'm innocent groaned jessop every man is innocent until convicted by a jury said hurd calmly consider me a jury and i'll size up your case when i hear all are you innocent of both murders lady rachel committed suicide said jessop raising a haggard face yes i stick to that sir as to krill's death in london i didn't touch him i swear i didn't but you saw him on that night how can you prove that very simply norman or krill if you prefer the old name took certain jewellery to pash for safe keeping shortly before his death you presented to pash a paper undeniably written and signed by the old man saying that the jewellery was to be given up to bearer now before taking the jewellery to pash krill could not have written that paper so you must have seen him during the few hours which elapsed between his visit to pash and his death this was clearly argued and jessop could not contradict i left him quite well and hearty in the cellar in gwynne street yes in the cellar admitted jessop at what time about half past eight say between eight and nine well what happened asked hurd smoking quietly the sailor twisted his big hands and groaned then he laid his head on the table and began to sob talking brokenly and huskily i'm done for he gasped i'd know'd it would come no i ain't sorry i've had a nightmare of a time oh since i pawned that brooch ah then you did pawn the brooch at stowley jessop sat up and wiped his eyes yes i did but i pulled my cap down over my eyes and buttoned up my pea jacket i never thought old tinker would ha' knowed me wasn't it rather rash of you to pawn the brooch in a place where you were well known i wasn't well known i only come at times and then i went away old tinker hadn't seen me more nor once or twice and then i pulled down my cap and jessop badly shaken was beginning to tell the episode over again when hurd stopped him see here said the detective you say that you are innocent i swear that i am gasped jessop well then i'll give you the benefit of the doubt my business is not to hang innocent people take a glass of rum and tell me all you know beginning with your first meeting with krill and running down through the death of lady rachel to your last meeting in the gwynne street cellar and when you know all then i'll see what is to be done will you arrest me i have arrested you don't make conditions with me man said hurd with a stern face the night is growing late and i want to get to the bottom of this business before we go to bed take some rum seeing there was nothing for it but to make a clean breast captain jarvey jessop wasted no further time in useless lamentation he could have smashed hurd easily enough even though there was the risk of being shot but the fracas would bring others on the scene and jessop knew he could not deal with the police therefore he took a stiff peg and became quieter in fact when once started on his confession he appeared to be rather relieved it's been a nightmare said he wiping his forehead i'm glad it's come to the lawr that i am i met krill as he wos then some twenty five year back by chance as you may say he cast a strange look at the detective which the latter noted yes by chance mr hurd i found he kep' the pub here and this bein' no distance from southampton i took to runnin' down here when the barkey was at anchor me an' krill became great mates and i'd what you might call free quarters here yes sir it's a frozen fact very generous of mr krill remarked hurd dryly and wondering what the man was keeping back oh he was right enough as a mate when not drunk but the liquor made a howling dorg of him i've seen many drunk in many places said jessop but anyone who held his liquor wuss nor krill i never did see he'd knife you as soon as look at you when drunk but he evidently preferred strangling hold on mate said jessop with another deep pull at the rum i'm comin' to that night we wos both on the bust as y'may say and mrs krill she didn't like it so got to bed with the child how old was the child maud oh you might say she was thirteen or fifteen i can't be sure of her age what's up for hurd seeing in this admission a confirmation that maud was either not krill's child or was illegitimate and could not inherit the money had showed his feelings however he made some trivial excuse not wishing to be too confidential and begged jessop to proceed well mate said the captain filling another glass of rum y'see the lady had come earlier and had been put to bed by the missus i never saw her myself being drinking in this very room along o' krill but he saw her added jessop emphatically and said as she'd a fine opal brooch which he wish he'd had as he wanted money and the missus kept him tight krill was a judge of jewels travelled in jewels once said the captain bless you he could size up a precious stone in no time but he sat drinking with me and every now and then got out of the room when he'd stop away for perhaps a quarter of an hour at the time did he mention the opal brooch again no said jessop after reflection he didn't but he got so drunk that he began to show fight as he always did when boozy though a timid chap when sober i concluded wishing no row to git to my hammock and cut up stairs then i went by mistake into the room of that pore lady carrying a candle and saw her tied to the bedpost stone dead with a silk handkerchief round her neck i shouted out blue murder and mrs krill with the kid came tumbling down i was so feared added jessop wiping his forehead at the recollection that i ran out of doors what good would that do lor' i dunno confessed the man shivering but i wos skeered out of my life it wos rainin' pitchforks as y'might say and i raced on through the rain for an hour or so then i thought as i wos innocent i'd make tracks back and i did i found krill had cut did his wife tell you oh she wos lying on the floor insensible where he'd knocked her down and the kid lor' jessop spat she was lying in the corner with her lips fastened together with the brooch what cried hurd starting to his feet the same as her the same as norman's was jessop nodded and drank some rum made me sick it did i took th' brooch away and slipped it into my pocket then the kid said her father had fastened her lips together and had knocked her mother flat when she interfered i brought mrs krill round and then left her with the kid and walked off to southampton the police found me there and i told them what i tell you did you tell about the brooch well no i didn't confessed jessop coolly an' as the kid and the mother said nothing i didn't see why i shouldn't keep it wantin' money so i went to stowley and pawned it then took a deep sea voyage for a year when i come back all was over do you think krill murdered the woman asked hurd passing over for the moment the fact that jessop had stolen the brooch he said he didn't rejoined the man with emphasis but i truly believe mister as he did one of them times when mad with drink and out of the room he wanted the brooch d'ye see though why he should have lost the loot by sealin' the kid's mouth with it i can't say when did you come across krill again ho said jessop drawing his hand across his mouth 'twas this way d'ye see i come round here lots and a swell come too a cold grexon hay said hurd pointing to the photograph yes that's him said jessop staring and i hated him just with his eye glass and his sneerin' ways he loved the kid now a growed fine gal as you know and come here often in june at the end of it anyhow he comes and i hears him tells mrs krill who was always looking for her husband that a one eyed bookseller in gwynne street drury lane had fainted when he saw the very identical brooch showed him by another cove beecot i know didn't you wonder how the brooch had left the pawnshop asked hurd very attentive no i didn't snarled jessop who was growing cross i knew old tinker's assistant had sold the brooch and he didn't oughter t' have done it as i wanted it back mrs krill asked me about the brooch and wanted it so i said i'd get it back tinker said it was gone but wrote to the gent as bought it mr simon beecot of wargrove in essex that wos him but the gent wouldn't give it back so i 'spose he'd given it to his son well then when mrs krill heard of the one eyed man fainting at sight of the brooch she knew 'twas her husband as he'd one eye she having knocked the other out when he was sober did she go up and see him well said jessop slowly i don't rightly know what she did do but she went up i don't think she saw krill at his shop but she might have seen that pash who was mr hay's lawyer and a dirty little ape o' sorts he is ha said hurd to himself i thought pash knew about the women beforehand no wonder he stuck to them and gave poor miss norman the go bye he rubbed his hands and chuckled well we'll see what will come of the matter go on jessop there ain't much more to tell grumbled the captain i heard of this and i wasn't meant to hear but i thought i'd go up and see if i could get money out of krill by saying i'd tell about the murder of lady rachel you are a scoundrel said hurd coolly i wos 'ard up apologized the captain or i wouldn't not me i'm straight enough when in cash so i went up in july on the sixth of july if that was the day of the murder yes i went up and loafed round until it wos dark and then slipped through that side passage at eight o'clock to see krill how did you know where to find him why that hay knew about the chap and said as he did business in a cellar after eight so krill let me in thinking i 'spose i wos a customer he'd been drinking a little and was bold enough but when i said as i'd say he'd killed lady rachel he swore he was an innercent babe and cried the drink dyin' out of him the same as it died out of you lately said hurd smiling go slow grunted the captain in a surly tone i ain't afraid now as i ain't done nothing i said to krill i'd say nothin' if he'd give me money he wouldn't but said he'd placed a lot of pawned things with pash and i could have them he then gave me a paper saying i was to have the things and i went to pash the next morning and had trouble but i heard by chance again jessop cast a strange look at hurd that krill had been murdered so i didn't wait for the lawyer to come back but cut down to southampton and went on a short voyage then i come here and you nabbed me and jessop finished his rum that's all i know do you swear you left aaron norman alive meaning krill i do he wasn't no use to me dead and i made him give me the jewels pash had d'ye see but who warned you of the death when you were waiting jessop seemed unwilling to speak but when pressed burst out 'twas a measily little kid with ragged clothes and a dirty face tray said hurd hum i wonder how he knew of the murder before it got into the papers chapter xxi miss qian's party hurd's sister was a clever young woman who in her time had played many parts she began her career along with hurd as a private detective but when her brother joined the official service miss hurd thought she would better her position by appearing on the stage and therefore took the rather queer name of aurora qian in her detective capacity she had often disguised herself when employed in obtaining evidence and was remarkably talented in changing her face and figure this art she used with great success in her new profession and speedily made her mark as an impersonator of various characters out of novels as becky sharp as little dorrit she was said to be inimitable and after playing under several managements she started in the phrase of the profession a show of her own and rapidly made money but her great faults amongst others were vanity and extravagance so she was always in need of money and when chance offered through her brother to make any she was not averse to returning to the spy business thus it came about that she watched mr grexon hay for many a long day and night and he never suspected the pretty fluffy kittenish miss qian was in reality an emissary of the law consequently when aurora asked him to a card party at her rooms hay accepted readily enough although he was not in need of money at the time miss qian occupied a tiny flat on the top of a huge pile of buildings in kensington and it was furnished in a gimcrack way with more show than real value and with more color than taste every room was of a different hue with furniture and hangings to match the drawing room was pink the dining room green her bedroom blue the entrance hall yellow and the extra sleeping apartment used by her companion miss stably was draped in purple some wit called the flat the paint box and indeed so varied were its hues that it was not a bad title to give it like the becky sharp whom she impersonated with such success miss qian possessed a sheep dog not because she needed one being very well able to look after herself but because it sounded and looked respectable miss stably who filled this necessary office was a dull old lady who dressed excessively badly and devoted her life to knitting shawls what she did with these when completed no one ever knew but she was always to be found with two large wooden pins rapidly weaving the fabric for some unknown back she talked very little and when she did speak it was to agree with her sharp little mistress to make up for speaking little she ate a great deal and after dinner with her eternal knitting in her bony hands and a novel on her lap was entirely happy she was one of those neutral tinted people who seem not good enough for heaven and not sufficiently bad for the other place aurora often wondered what would become of miss stably when she departed this life and left her knitting behind her the old lady herself never gave the matter a thought but lived a respectable life of knitting and eating and novel reading with a regular visit to church on sunday where she worshipped without much idea of what the service was about this sort of person exactly suited miss qian who wanted a sheep dog who could neither bark nor bite and who could be silent these qualifications were possessed by the old lady and for some years she had trailed through a rather giddy world at aurora's heels in her own dull way she was fond of the young woman but was far from suspecting that aurora was connected in an underhand manner with the law that knowledge would indeed have shaken miss stably to the soul as she had a holy dread of the law and always avoided the police court column when she read the newspapers this was the old lady who sat in the pink drawing room to play propriety for miss qian lord george sandal was present looking rather washed out but as gentlemanly as ever hay with his fixed eye glass and eternally cold smile was there and a third young man who adored miss qian thinking her to be merely an actress simpered across the card table at his goddess the four were playing a game which involved the gaining and losing of much money and they had been engaged for about an hour miss stably having eaten a good dinner and commenced a new shawl was half dosing in the corner and paying absolutely no attention to the players it's a good thing we're hanging on our own hooks in this game said miss qian who smoked a dainty cigarette were i your partner sandal she always addressed her friends in this free and easy fashion i'd be losing money what luck you have i never do seem to win lamented lord george whenever i think i've got a good hand the thing pans out wrong hay has got all the money said the simpering admirer who answered to the name of tempest he and you miss qian are the winners i've made very little she replied hay's raking in the dollars hand over fist lucky in love unlucky at cards said hay who did not like his good fortune to be commented upon for reasons which miss qian knew it's the reverse with me i'm lucky at cards and lucky in love too interrupted aurora with a grimace seeing you're going to marry that krill heiress if she is an heiress what do you mean asked hay who was dealing a new round go on with the game and don't ask questions said miss qian in a saucy manner sandal don't stare round but keep your eye on the cards and she winked stealthily at the young lord while hay was exchanging a word with tempest the young man who had spoken privately to her immediately before the dinner knew well what she meant had hay been likewise in the know he would scarcely have done what he did do and which sandal saw him do in a few minutes hay was rapidly dealing and the cards were flying like leaves a pile of gold stood beside hay's elbow and some silver near tempest the game commenced and soon the players were engrossed heedless of the patent snoring of miss stably who poor old thing had succumbed to the lateness of the hour suddenly lord george who had been very vigilant felt his foot touched under the table by miss qian he rose at once and snatched up the gold standing near hay what's that for demanded hay angrily you're cheating said sandal and i don't play with you any more that's a lie i did not cheat yes you did cried miss qian bending forward and seizing the cards we've been watching you tempest i saw it all right said the other you took up that king and it's marked said aurora i believe hay's got cards up his sleeve examine the cards hay very pale but still keeping his countenance tried to object but the two young men seized and held him while miss qian with a dexterity acquired in detective circles rapidly searched his pockets here's another pack she cried and shook an ace and two kings out of the detected swindler's sleeve and these cards sandal took one and went to the lamp marked by jove he cried but with a stronger oath here's a pin prick you are mistaken began hay quite pale no said tempest coolly we're not miss qian told us you cheated and we laid a trap for you you've been trying this double card and marked card dodge several times this very evening and he's tried it lots of times before said aurora quickly i have been at several places where hay scooped the pool and it was all cheating if it was said hay with quivering lips why didn't you denounce me then and there because i denounce you now she said you're cooked my man these boys will see that the matter is made public by jove yes cried sandal with a look of abhorrence at hay and i'll prosecute you to get back those thousands you won off me i never did you've been rooking this boy for months cried miss qian here tempest get a constable we'll give him in charge for swindling no no cried hay his nerve giving way under the threatened exposure you'll have your money back sandal i swear lord george to you now you blackguard and how can you pay me the money when i know you haven't got a cent he intends to get it from the heiress sniggered aurora oh dear me rose the plaintive voice of the sheep dog what is it aurora anything wrong we've caught hay cheating that's all and the police oh aurora don't bring up the police no don't said hay who was now trembling i'll do whatever you like don't show me up i'm i'm going to be married soon no you sha'n't marry cried tempest sharply i'll see this girl myself and save her from you you can't prove that i cheated said hay desperately yes we can said george i and miss qian and tempest all saw you cheat and miss qian has the marked cards but don't expose me i i hay broke down and turned away with a look of despair on his face he cursed himself inwardly for having ventured to cheat when things by the marriage with maud krill would have soon been all right for him miss qian he cried in a tone of agony give me another chance aurora playing her own game of which the two young men were ignorant appeared to repent she beckoned to miss stably take mr hay into the dining room she said and i'll see what i can do but you try and bolt hay and the news will be all over the west end to morrow i'll stop said hay whose face was colorless and without another word he followed the sheep dog into the dining room in an agony of mind better imagined than described then miss qian turned her attention to her guests see here boys she said frankly this is a dirty business and i don't want to be mixed up with it but hay should be exposed insisted sandal he's been rooking me i do believe for months serve you jolly well right said aurora heartlessly i warned you again and again against him but if there's a row where do i come in it won't hurt you said tempest eagerly oh won't it gambling in my flat and all the rest of it you boys may think me free and easy but i'm straight no one can say a word against me i'm not going to be made out an adventuress and a bad woman for the sake of that swindler hay so you boys will just hold your tongues no said sandal my money oh bother your money one would think you were a jew i'll see that hay pays it back he's going to marry this krill girl and she's able to supply the cash but the girl shouldn't be allowed to marry hay said tempest don't you burn your fingers with other people's fire said aurora sharply this girl's in love with him and will marry him in spite of everything but i don't care a cent for that it's myself i'm thinking of if i get your money back sandal will you hold your tongue lord george thinking of what his noble father would say were he involved in a card scandal connected with an actress thought it just as well to agree yes said he hesitatingly i'll not say a word if you get the money back but don't you let hay speak to me again in public or i'll kick him that's your affair and his said aurora delighted at having gained her point but you hold your tongue and you tempest i'll not say a word either said the young man with a shrug though i don't see why you should save this blackguard's reputation it's my own i'm thinking of so don't you make any mistake and now i have both your promises yes said sandal and tempest thinking it best to hush the matter up but hay i'll see to him you two boys clear out and go home to bed but we can't leave you alone with hay said tempest i'll not be alone with him cried the little woman imperiously my companion is with me what do you mean he might do you some harm oh might he you take me for a considerable idiot i suppose you get along boys and leave me to fix up things both young men protested again but aurora anxious for her conversation with hay bundled them out of the flat and banged the door to when she heard them whistling below for a hansom then she went to the dining room you come along to the drawing room she said to hay miss stably stop here i haven't got my shawl bleated the old lady oh bother aurora ran to the other room snatched up the shawl and saw miss stably sitting down to knit while she led hay back into the drawing room he looked round when he entered where are they he asked sitting down gone but it's all right i've made them promise not to say grexon hay didn't let her finish he fell on his knees and kissed her hand his face was perfectly white but his eyes were full of gratitude as he babbled his thanks no one could have accused him of being cold then but miss qian did not approve of this emotion natural though it was here get up she said snatching her hand away i've got to speak straight to you i've done a heap for you now you've got to do a heap for me anything anything said hay whose face was recovering its normal color you have saved me you have and much of a thing you are to save you'll be cheating again in a week or so no cried hay emphatically i swear i'll not touch a card again i'll marry maud and turn respectable oh what a lesson i've had you are sure those fellows won't speak no that's all right you can go on swindling as before only miss qian raised a finger you'll have to pay sandal back some cash i'll do that maud will lend me the money does he want all oh a couple of thousand will shut his mouth i'll not see you left it's all right so sit up and don't shake there like a jelly you're very kind to me said hay faintly don't you make any mistake so far as i am concerned you might stick in the mud forever i helped you because i want you to help me i'm in want of money i'll give you some picked from that girl's pockets said aurora dryly no thank you it might dirty my fingers listen there's a reward offered for the discovery of the murderer of aaron norman i want to get that thousand pounds and you can help me to hay started to his feet with amazement of all the requests she was likely to make he never thought it would be such a one aaron norman's murder he said what do you know of that very little but you know a lot i don't i swear i don't pish said miss qian imperiously remember i've got the whip hand my boy just you tell me how mrs krill came to strangle the mrs krill hay turned white again and his eye glass fell she had nothing to do with the matter i swear strikes me you swear too much mr hay what about that opal brooch you stole from beecot when he had the smash i didn't steal it i never saw it at the time of the accident then you got that boy tray to steal it i knew nothing about the boy besides why should i steal that opal serpent brooch you wanted to buy it from beecot anyhow hay looked puzzled yes for a lady mrs krill i admit that mrs krill wanted it she had associations connected with that brooch i know interrupted aurora glancing at the clock don't waste time in talking of lady rachel sandal's death how do you know about that stammered hay completely nonplussed i know a mighty lot of things i may as well tell you added miss qian coolly since you daren't split that i've got a lot to do with the secret detective service business i'm helping another to hunt out evidence for this case and i guess you know a lot the man quailed he knew that he did not stand well with the police and dreaded what this little fluffy woman should do aurora read his thoughts yes she said we know a heap about you at the scotland yard office and if you don't tell me all you know i'll make things hot for you this cheating to night is only one thing i know you are 'a man on the market' mr hay what do you wish to hear asked hay collapsing all about mrs krill's connection with this murder she has nothing to do with it really she hasn't aaron norman was her husband right enough and he ran away from her over twenty years ago but who told mrs krill about him i did confessed hay volubly and seeing it was best for him to make a clean breast of it i met the krills three years ago when i was at bournemouth they lived in christchurch you know yes hotel keepers well what then i fell in love with maud and went to christchurch to stop at 'the red pig' she loved me and in a year we became engaged but i had no money to marry her and she had none either then mrs krill told me of her husband and of the death of lady rachel murder or suicide suicide mrs krill said replied hay frankly she told me also about the opal brooch and described it i met beecot by chance and greeted him as an old school fellow he took me to his attic and to my surprise showed me the opal brooch i wanted to buy it for mrs krill but beecot would not sell it when next i met him he told me that aaron norman had fainted when he saw the brooch i thought this odd and informed mrs krill she described the man to me and especially said that he had but one eye i went with beecot to the gwynne street shop and a single glance told me that aaron norman was lemuel krill i told his wife and she wanted to come up at once but i knew that aaron was reported rich which i had heard through pash and as he was my lawyer i suggested that the krills should go and see him which they did before the murder yes pash was astonished and when he heard that mrs krill was the real wife he saw that aaron norman as he called himself had committed bigamy and that sylvia yes you needn't say it said miss qian angrily she's worth a dozen of that girl you are going to marry but why did you pretend to meet mrs krill and her daughter for the first time at pash's to blind beecot we were standing at the door when the two came out and i pretended to see them for the first time then i told beecot that i had been introduced to maud at pash's office he's a clever chap beecot and being engaged to sylvia norman i thought he might find out too much about the murder hay rose and looked solemn i swear i know nothing of that he said decidedly and the krills were as astonished as i when they heard of the death they were going to see him by pash's advice and mrs krill was going to prosecute him for bigamy unless he allowed her a good income death put an end to all that so she made up the story of seeing the hand bills and then of course the will gave the money to maud who was engaged to me the will or what was called a will gave the money to sylvia said aurora emphatically but this brooch you didn't take it no i swear i didn't mrs krill wanted it but i never knew it was of any particular importance certainly i would never have risked robbing beecot and i never told that boy tray to rob either then who took the brooch i can't say i have told you all i know hum said aurora just like her brother that will do to night but if i ask any more questions you'll have to answer so now you can go by the way i suppose the brooch made you stick to beecot yes said hay frankly he was of no use to me but while he had the brooch i stuck to him to get it for mrs krill queer said aurora i wonder why she wanted it so much but this question hay was unable to answer chapter xxii further evidence after all hurd did not send jessop to town as he threatened to do evidently the captain had told him all he knew and appeared to be innocent of krill's death but in spite of his apparent frankness the detective had an idea that something was being kept back and what that something might be he determined to find out however his thoughts were turned in another direction by a note from beecot addressed to him at the red pig asking him to come at once to the jubileetown laundry i believe we have discovered the person who stole the opal brooch from me wrote paul and deborah has made a discovery connected with norman which may prove to be of service wondering what the discovery might be and wondering also who had taken the brooch hurd arranged that jessop and hokar should remain at christchurch under the eyes of two plain clothes officials these managed their duties so dexterously that matilda junk was far from guessing what was going on moreover she informed the detective who she thought was a commercial gent that she intended to pay a visit to her sister mrs tawsey and demanded the address which hurd gave readily enough he thought that if matilda knew anything such as the absence of mrs krill from the hotel during the early part of july deborah might induce her to talk freely hokar had proved a difficult subject whether he was too grateful to mrs krill to speak out or whether he really did not understand what was asked of him he certainly showed a talent for holding his tongue however hurd saw well enough that the man was afraid of the sahib's law and when matters came to a crisis would try and prove his innocence even at the cost of implicating others therefore with an easy mind the detective left these two witnesses being watched at christchurch and repaired to town where aurora informed him of the interview with hay billy approved of the way in which his sister had managed matters i guessed that hay was the man who put mrs krill on the track of her husband he said with satisfaction but i wasn't quite sure how he spotted the man oh the one eye identified him said aurora who was eating chocolate as usual and norman's fainting at the sight of the brooch confirmed hay's belief as to who he was i wonder he didn't make a bargain with norman on his own hurd shook his head it wouldn't have paid so well said he wisely norman would have parted only with a small sum whereas this murder will bring in hay a clear five thousand a year when he marries the girl hay acted cleverly enough but i tell you hay has nothing to do with the murder that may be so though i don't trust him but mrs krill might have strangled her husband so as to get the money what makes you think she did asked aurora doubtfully well you see from what jessop says mrs krill is devotedly attached to maud and she may have been anxious to revenge her daughter on krill he acted like a brute and fastened the child's lips together so mrs krill treated him in the same way hum said miss qian reflectively but can you prove that mrs krill was in town on the night of the murder that's what i'm going to find out said hurd all you have to do is to keep your eyes on hay oh he won't cut if that's what you mean he thinks everything is square now that i've got those boys to stop chattering he'll marry maud and annex the money he may marry maud said hurd emphatically but he certainly won't get the five thousand a year miss norman will hold on cried aurora shrewdly maud may not be lemuel krill's child or she may have been born before krill married the mother but in any case sylvia norman isn't the child of a legal marriage krill certainly committed bigamy so his daughter sylvia can't inherit well said hurd i can't say i'll see pash about the matter after all the will left the money to 'my daughter' and that sylvia is beyond doubt whatever maud may be and i say aurora just you go down to stowley in buckinghamshire i haven't time to look into matters there myself what do you want me to do there find out all about the life of mrs krill before she married krill and came to christchurch she's the daughter of a farmer you'll find the name in this hurd passed along a copy of the marriage certificate which mrs krill had given to pash anne tyler is her maiden name find out what you can she was married to krill at beechill bucks miss qian took the copy of the certificate and departed grumbling at the amount of work she had to do to earn her share of the reward hurd on his part took the underground train to liverpool street station and then travelled to jubileetown he arrived there at twelve o'clock and was greeted by paul i've been watching for you all the morning said beecot who looked flushed and eager sylvia and i have made such a discovery hurd nodded good humoredly as he entered the house and shook hands with the girl miss norman has been doing some detective business on her own account he said smiling hullo who is this he made this remark because mrs purr sitting in a corner of the room with red eyes rose and dropped a curtsey i'm called to tell you what i do tell on my bible oath said mrs purr with fervor mrs purr can give some valuable evidence said paul quickly oh can she then i'll hear what she has to say later first i must clear the ground by telling you and miss norman what i have discovered at christchurch so mrs purr rather unwillingly for she felt the importance of her position was bundled out of the room and hurd sat down to relate his late adventures this he did clearly and slowly and was interrupted frequently by exclamations of astonishment from his two hearers so there said the detective when finishing you have the beginning of the end then you think that mrs krill killed her husband asked paul dubiously i can't say for certain was the cautious reply but i think so on the face of the evidence which you have heard what do you say don't say anything said sylvia before paul could reply mr hurd had better read this paper it was found by deborah in an old box belonging to my father which was brought from gwynne street she gave the detective several sheets of blue foolscap pinned together and closely written in the shaky handwriting of aaron norman hurd looked at it rather dubiously what is it he asked the paper referred to in that unfinished scrap of writing which was discovered behind the safe explained paul norman evidently wrote it out and placed it in his pocket where he forgot it deborah found it in an old coat she discovered in a box of clothes brought from gwynne street they were norman's clothes and his box and should have been left behind debby won't hear of that said sylvia laughing she says mrs krill has got quite enough and she took all she could what's all this writing about asked hurd turning over the closely written sheets to save time you had better give me a precis of the matter is it important very i should say responded paul emphatically it contains an account of norman's life from the time he left christchurch hum hurd's eyes brightened i'll read it at my leisure but at the present moment you might say what you can well you know a good deal of it said paul who did the talking at a sign from sylvia it seems that norman we'd better stick to the old name left christchurch because he was afraid of being accused of murdering lady rachel was she really murdered norman doesn't say he swears he knows nothing about the matter the first intimation he had was when jessop came down with the news after blundering into the wrong bedroom but he hints that mrs krill killed her can he prove that no he can't give any proof or at all events he doesn't he declares that when his wife and daughter oh does he call maud his daughter yes we can talk of that later said paul impatiently well then norman says he went fairly mad jessop had bolted but norman knew he would not give the alarm since he might be accused himself of killing lady rachel maud who had seen the body wanted to run out and call the neighbors how old does norman say she was about fifteen quite old enough to make things unpleasant then she can't inherit the money said hurd decisively no cried beecot quickly both sylvia and i think so but to go on with norman's confession he would not let maud go she began to scream and he feared lest she should alarm the neighbors he tied a handkerchief across her lips but she got free and again began to scream then he cruelly fastened her lips together with the opal brooch where did he get that if innocent he declared that he spied it on the floor of the sitting room near his wife's feet and then hints that she strangled lady rachel to get it and turn it into money as she was desperately in need of cash for maud mrs krill idolized the child i know that snapped hurd go on when norman fastened the child's lips together mrs krill threw herself on him in a rage he knocked her insensible and then ran away he walked through the night until at dawn he came to a distant railway station there he took a ticket and went to london he concealed himself until there was no chance of his being discovered and besides saw the verdict of the jury in the newspapers but he was determined he would not go back to his wife because she threatened him in what way ah said paul while sylvia shuddered in a strange way when he fastened the child's lips together mrs krill said that she would do the same to him one day and with the same brooch hurd uttered an exclamation so that was why she wanted the brooch so much he exclaimed eagerly yes and she told hay she wanted it though she did not reveal her reason she said if she got the brooch he would be allowed to marry maud with whom hay was deeply in love hay stumbled across me by accident and i happened to have the brooch the rest you know no said hurd i don't know how the brooch came into the possession of mrs krill again to use in the cruel way she threatened well said sylvia quickly we aren't sure if mrs krill did get the brooch the evidence is against her said hurd remember the threat yes but wait till you hear mrs purr said paul but just a moment hurd you must learn how norman laid the foundations of his fortune ah i forget well and the detective settled himself to listen further he was hard up and almost starving for a long time after he came to london explained paul then he got a post in a second hand bookshop kept by a man called garner in the minories he had a daughter lillian my mother put in sylvia softly yes went on beecot quickly and this girl being lonely fell in love with norman as he now called himself he wasn't an attractive man with his one eye so it is hard to say how miss garner came to love him but she married him in the end you'll find everything explained at length in the paper we gave you then old garner died and lillian inherited a considerable sum of money together with the stock her husband removed the books to gwynne street and started business but with the money he began to trade in jewels and you know how he got on that's all plain enough said hurd putting the confession of norman into his pocket i suppose the man dreaded lest his first wife should turn up yes and that's why he fainted when he saw the brooch not knowing that jessop had removed it from maud's mouth and pawned it i'm not so sure of that said hurd quickly bart overheard him talking of stowley and the pawnbroker there well said paul with a shrug he says nothing about it in the confession perhaps he did trace the brooch to the stowley shop but if so i wonder he did not get it seeing he wanted it but when he saw it in my possession he thought i might know of mrs krill and might put her on the track hence his fainting later he learned how i became possessed of it and tried to buy it then came the accident and i really believed for a time that hay had stolen it aurora says he swore he did not and he didn't said paul going to the door mrs purr you don't mean to say that old woman prigged it asked hurd no but she warned me against that boy tray on the day deborah was married later i asked her what she meant and she then told me that she had learned from tray's grandmother a drunken old thief how the boy brought home the opal brooch and here mrs purr who had entered and was dropping curtseys to the majesty of the law as represented by hurd thought an undue advantage was being taken of her position she wished to talk herself and interrupted paul in a shrill voice granny clump she is said mrs purr folding her hands under her apron tray's gran'mother as 'is name is tray clump i swear on my bible oath a wicked old woman as is famous for drink i've heard of her said the detective remembering she's been up heaps of times and grows no better wailed mrs purr bibulously for she had been strengthening herself for the interview with frequent libations of gin oh what a thing strong drink is sir but granny clump bein' ill with the lungses and me bein' 'elpful in sich cases 'aving bin a nuss when young as i won't deceive you by denying called on me to be a good smart 'un and i wos though she swore awful saying she wanted gin an' jellies an' could 'ave 'ad them if that limb so did she name tray gentlemen both 'ad only 'anded to 'er the rich brooch he brought 'ome just afore he went to earn a decent livin' at the lawr orfice which 'is name is pash ha said hurd thoughtfully i'll see the boy you can see him now said beecot unexpectedly when i learned this from mrs purr and knew you were coming i sent a message to pash's office for the boy he came up quite unsuspectingly but he refused to speak i shut him up in a back room and deborah has been watching him an' the languige of that blessed limb exclaimed mrs purr raising her hands bring him in said hurd miss norman if the boy uses bad language you needn't stay sylvia having heard what tray could do in this way needed no further hint she left the room gladly and told deborah to bring along her prisoner shortly the noise of kicking and strong language was heard coming nearer and deborah with a red face and a firm mouth appeared at the door holding aloft a small boy who was black in the face with rage there said deborah flinging tray in a heap at the detective's feet if me an' bart 'ave sich a brat i 'ope he dies in his cradle instead of growing to a galler's thief in th' use of words which make me shudder let alone my pretty ugh she shook her fist at tray you old bailey viper though young at that here said tray rising much dishevelled but with a white face let me go i'll 'ave the lawr of you i'll attend to that my lad said hurd dryly now then where did you get that brooch sha'n't tell snapped the boy and put his tongue out hurd gave him a smack with an open hand on the side of his face and master clump began to blubber assalting me oh won't you ketch it he raged in his puny wrath my master's a law cove and he'll 'ave y' up before the beak you answer my questions said hurd sternly or you'll get another clout you know who i am well enough make a clean breast of it you imp or i'll lock you up if i make a clean breast will you let me cut asked tray beginning to whimper but with a cunning gleam in his eyes i'll see when i know what you have to say tray looked round the room to see if there was any way of escape but paul guarded the closed window and deborah itching to box his ears stood before the door before him was the stern faced detective with whom tray knew well enough he dare not trifle under these circumstances he made the best of a bad job and told what he knew although he interpolated threats all the time wot d'y want with me he demanded sulkily where did you find that brooch i prigged it from mr beecot's pocket when he wos smashed did mr hay tell you to steal it no he didn't then how did you know the brooch was in my pocket asked paul i was a dodgin' round the shorp snapped tray and i 'eard mr norman an' mr beecot a talkin' of the brooch mr beecot said as he 'ad the brooch in 'is pocket yes i certainly did said paul remembering the conversation well when the smash come i dodged in and prigged it t'wos easy 'nough grinned tray for i felt it in 'is bres' poket and collared it i wanted to guv it t' th' ole man thinkin' he'd pay fur it as he said he would but arter the smash i went 'ome t' m' grann' and hid the brooch w'en i wos a lookin' at it at night i sawr 'er a lookin' at it and she grabbed it i cut away with m'own property not wishin' to be robbed by the ole gal what did you do then tray wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve i 'eard that mr norman wos dead yes and you told jessop so in the office how did you know 'cause i went to the shorp in th' mornin' to sell the brooch to th' ole man he was a goner so i cut to mr pash as wos his lawyer and said i'd sell 'im the brooch what cried hurd rising you gave the brooch to mr pash yuss he said he'd 'ave me up for stealin' and wouldn't guv me even a bob fur it but he said i'd be his noo orfice boy i thought i'd be respectable so i went and now ended master clump in a sullen manner you knows all and i ain't done nothin' so i'm orf deborah caught him by the tail of his jacket as he made a dart at the door and swung him into the middle of the room hurd laid hands on him you come along with me he said i'll confront you with pash tray gave a howl of terror he'll kill me he shouted as he killed the old cove yuss he did it pash did it and he howled again chapter xxiii what pash said in a smoking compartment which the three had to themselves hurd resumed his examination of tray they were now on their way to liverpool street and thence the detective intended to convey the boy to pash's office in chancery lane paul sat in one corner much excited over the turn events had taken he began to think that the assassin of aaron norman would be found after all more he believed that sylvia would yet inherit the five thousand a year she was entitled to morally if not legally hurd in another corner pulled tray roughly towards him and shook his finger in the lad's face the boy was sulky and defiant yet there was a trace of fear in his eyes and the reason of this hurd wished to learn you're a young liar said hurd emphatically and not a clever one either do you think to play the fool with me i've tole you all straight grumbled tray no you haven't anyone can see that you've made a mistake i leave it to mr beecot yonder i was about to draw your attention to the mistake said paul you mean the discrepancy in time master clump started and became more sulky than ever he cast down his cunning eyes and shuffled with his feet while hurd lectured him you know well enough said the detective sharply that the brooch was boned by you on the very evening when the murder took place it was then that mr beecot met with his accident therefore you could not have given the brooch to mr pash the next morning as it had been used on the previous night sha'n't say anythin' more retorted tray defiantly oh won't you cried hurd ironically we'll see about that you told that lie about the time to account for your knowing of the murder before anyone else did no said tray decidedly i did go to the shorp in th' mornin' that you may have done but not to sell the brooch mr pash had taken it from you on the previous night he didn't denied the boy then in that case you've told a lie pash never had the brooch and has nothing to do with the murder he did prig the brooch from me and he did kill the ole cove well we'll see what mr pash will say when you accuse him said hurd but i don't believe one word of it it's my opinion that you gave that brooch to a third party on the same evening as you stole it now then who did you give it to mr pash persisted tray on the same evening there was no reply to this tray set his lips firmly and refused to speak hurd shook an admonitory finger again you can't play fast and loose with me my lad he said grimly if you didn't part with that brooch you must be mixed up in the crime yourself perhaps you pinned the poor wretch's mouth together it's just the sort of cruel thing a young cain like you would do i didn't said master clump doggedly you take me to master and i'll tell him what i tells you he's the one hurd shook the boy to make him talk more but tray simply threw himself on the floor of the carriage and howled the detective therefore picked him up and flung him into a corner you stop there you little ruffian he said seriously annoyed at the boy's recalcitrants we'll speak again when we are in mr pash's office so tray curled up on the cushion looked savagely at the detective and held his tongue what do you think will be the end of all this asked paul when master clump was thus disposed of lord knows replied hurd wiping his face i never had a harder case to deal with i thought hay had a hand in it but it seems he hadn't bad lot as he is asking your pardon mr beecot since you're his friend that i am not disclaimed beecot emphatically there's a young lawyer i know ford is his name i went to see him as to what chances sylvia had of getting the money he was at school with me and remembered hay he said that hay was dismissed from torrington school for stealing didn't you know that yourself no i had left the school i was ill at home with scarlet fever but hay apparently always has been a bad lot he and that krill pair are well matched for i believe the mother is bad even if the daughter maud isn't by the way her age hurd nodded i believe she was fifteen at the time of the death of lady rachel if so she can't be legitimate or may not be the daughter of aaron norman however i've asked my sister to look up mrs krill's past life in stowley where she comes from but she wasn't married to krill at stowley no but she lived there as anne tyler from the certificate she was married to krill at a small parish church twenty miles from stowley so aurora will go there but i want her to stop at stowley first and learn all she can about anne tyler beechill's the name of the parish in which she was married to krill before she came to christchurch said paul musingly so i expect they lived there miss qian might search also for the certificate of maud krill's birth i told her to and failing that she's to search in christchurch we must get the certificate of birth somehow hurd said paul rather diffidently i hope you won't be annoyed but i have already asked my friend ford to give notice to pash to produce the certificate well replied the detective you might have told me but no great harm is done what does pash say i don't know ford has not let me know yet here we are this remark was caused by the stopping of the train at liverpool street station a number of people were returning from their employment in the city to the country and the platforms were crowded hurd grasped master clump by the arm and marched him along but in the confusion of finding his ticket at the barrier he happened to let go almost without thinking in a moment tray had darted through the barrier and was lost in the crowd hurd sprang after him and left paul to explain he hurriedly did so and then went out to see if the detective had caught the boy hurd was nowhere to be seen neither was tray the crowd was increasing thick and beecot was at a loss what to do after waiting for an hour without finding the pair he thought he would go to pash's office it might be that hurd having caught tray would take him there at once leaving beecot to follow so paul got on to the metropolitan railway and alighted at the temple station thence he walked up to the office in chancery lane where's tray asked paul of the one clerk in the outer room who was writing for dear life i don't know sir said the clerk he went out this morning and hasn't been back all day mr pash is very angry with him apparently hurd had not caught the boy yet or if he had did not intend to bring him to the office can i see mr pash asked paul thinking he might as well make some use of his time the clerk inquired if the solicitor would see beecot and presently ushered him into the inner room where pash sat looking more like a monkey than ever he did not appear at all pleased to see the young man and sucked in his cheek with a crabbed air well mr beecot what can i do for you he snarled you might be civil in the first place said paul quietly taking a chair you haven't behaved over well to miss norman and me oh said pash coolly have you come to reproach me with that i never waste time rejoined paul equally coolly i'll leave you to your conscience pash shrugged his shoulders and put his feet on the rungs of his chair i think my conscience can stand that he said it's business mr beecot business by the way i have received a request from mr ford of cheapside to produce the certificate of birth of miss krill what is the meaning of that i think you know very well mr pash i profess my ignorance said pash ironically although he looked uneasy and was apparently lying in that case you had better wait till you hear from mr ford are you employing mr ford may i ask paul nodded on behalf of miss norman said he coldly ah sneered the monkey you think you'll get the money wait till you hear from mr ford retorted paul again and enjoyed the baffled expression on mr pash's wrinkled face by the way sir why did you not tell hurd that tray gave you the opal brooch pash turned all the colors of the rainbow does that brat i took into my office out of charity dare to say that he did he does and what is more mr hurd is bringing him here to make the statement face to face with you i am determined to get to the bottom of this case sir for miss norman's sake and the possession of the brooch forms an important link how so the person who had that brooch on the evening of the sixth of july murdered norman said paul calmly pash jumped up and chattered like a baboon in a rage do you mean to accuse me he demanded take care take care i don't accuse you tray does it's a lie a lie don't excite yourself mr pash you'll need all your wits to convince hurd tray accuses you and hurd suspects you i have nothing to do with the matter you put hurd up to this foamed pash hardly able to speak pardon me hurd is working for the reward offered by your client don't you think it was rather foolish of her to offer such a large reward mr pash even though she did so to avert suspicion the solicitor changed color again i don't understand you paul shrugged his shoulders and rose to go perhaps mr hurd will explain he said and made for the door pash with his monkey face much perplexed sat hunched in his chair biting his fingers as paul laid his hand on the knob he called him back i can explain he said nervously not to me said paul coldly i prefer to do so to you said the lawyer hurriedly why to me particularly because i don't think i have acted very well towards miss norman and as you are to marry her you may be able to arrange to make peace i suppose you mean burst out beecot no mr pash you have acted like a scoundrel you left that poor girl in the lurch as soon as you found that miss krill was as you thought legally entitled to the money what do you mean by hinting she isn't because you know very well what her age is retorted paul this matter will be shifted to the bottom mr pash by my friend ford and if things are as i think they are miss krill won't keep that money you know very well miss norman won't get the money either snarled pash i know that very well leastways he added without my assistance more of your crooked ways said paul indignantly tell what you like to hurd i refuse to listen as he spoke he opened the door and found himself facing hurd who was red and hot the detective stepped into the office and as he passed paul whispered hold your tongue about the boy then he turned to mr pash well sir he puffed i have had a job catching up mr beecot no doubt you know why i have come no said pash dryly i don't see tray tray will keep i've got him safe under lock and key before bringing you face to face with him i thought it best to give you an opportunity of clearing yourself of what asked pash in a brazen manner hurd looked at beecot who spoke mr pash knows very well that tray accuses him of the crime he said i told him so and he professed his readiness to explain to you ah said hurd shut the door mr beecot no need to let all london know the truth i don't know it said pash as paul closed the door and returned to his seat very good rejoined the detective calmly we'll assume for the sake of argument that you did not strangle norman that i certainly did not then you know who did come sir hurd became stern this boy tray says he gave the opal brooch to you and i believe he did you would not have taken him into your office a boy off the streets and with a bad character at that unless you wanted to bribe him to hold his tongue i had no need to bribe said pash gnawing his finger nails and rather cowed by this direct attack the boy did show me the opal brooch and i took it from him to return to norman when did you receive it asked hurd pulling out his book be careful mr pash i'll take down what you say i have nothing to conceal said pash in quite an unnecessarily injured manner i had employed the boy on several errands and he knew i was norman's lawyer on the evening of the sixth of july and the evening of the murder said hurd are you sure i'll take my oath on it the boy told me that mr beecot had met with an accident and that a blue velvet case containing a brooch had fallen out of his pocket it was stolen said beecot hastily tray was not such a fool as to tell me that replied the lawyer dryly he said that he picked the case up out of the mud and took it home to his garret his grandmother who is a notorious thief wanted to get it and pawn it for drink but tray ran away with it and came to me about five o'clock he gave me the brooch and asked me to take charge of it as he expected to get money for it from aaron norman who wanted it tray overheard my conversation with norman said paul angrily and knew the brooch was mine so did you mr pash well said the solicitor coolly what of that norman was my client and wanted the brooch i intended to keep it and then see you so that a sale might be arranged norman spoke to me about the brooch several times and wanted it for reasons you may not know oh yes we know said hurd sardonically we know much more than you give us credit for mr pash well you saw norman about the jewel later that evening i suppose you intend to tell us you gave him the brooch then i intend to tell nothing of the sort retorted pash after a few moments' thought i see that things are coming to a crisis and i would like to see miss norman reinstated in her rights oh said paul indignantly and you did your best to give the money to maud krill because i believed she was legally entitled to it explained pash lamely but since no he broke off i'll say nothing just now i alone can put the matter right and i refuse to do so unless i have miss norman's promise that i shall keep the business paul would have refused then and there but hurd more astute interrupted his angry speech we'll see about that later mr pash he said soothingly meanwhile what did you do with the brooch i laid it on the table there the case was open as i had been looking at it i sent tray out of the room and attended to my usual business several clients came and went and i forgot about the opal serpent then i went to see my clerk outside about a deed i was with him for some minutes when i recollected the brooch before i went home for i intended to take it with me stop interrupted hurd you were here till aaron norman came along with the jewels so you must have missed the brooch before he came or he would have taken it seeing it was exposed on the table my esteemed client did not come till seven said pash annoyed at being detected in trickery he walked about with the bags of jewels for some time not being able to make up his mind to give them to me which he did for safe keeping then he expected a visit from his wife i can't say said the solicitor with an air of fatigue he certainly hinted that he wanted the jewels placed away safely in case someone connected with the opal brooch should come perhaps captain jessop who did come said paul suddenly he didn't mention the name of jessop snapped pash had he hinted at a sailor i would have known who my nautical visitor was we know all about that said hurd waving his hand but if norman came to you at seven how did you manage to prevent him meeting his wife in this office oh she was what do you mean asked pash breaking off and conscious that he was letting slip something he had rather had not been known hurd saw the slip and pash's confusion and at once made every use of the opportunity in fact he played a game of bluff shaking his finger he approached the little lawyer do you think i come here unprepared he asked solemnly do you think i have not been to 'the red pig' at christchurch and learned that mrs krill knew of her husband's whereabouts through hay long before the day she came to you with the lying story about the hand bills hay has confessed his share in the business of a false introduction to throw mr beecot off the scent seeing that he was defending miss norman's interests do you think i don't know that this woman krill came to see you through hay whose lawyer you are she was here on that fatal evening said hurd making a bold shot how did you prevent her seeing norman pash was completely thrown off his balance by this volley of language and presumption of knowledge mrs krill left at six he gasped backing to the wall and carried off the brooch i'm not sure i can't say i did miss the brooch after mrs krill left no when norman came i intended to show him the brooch and found it gone mrs krill left at six between six and seven did any other client come into the office yes no i can't say well pash broke down in despair seeing that his lies were not believed i think mrs krill did steal the brooch quite so and murdered her husband hurd went to the door and took beecot's arm i only hope you won't be brought up as an accessory before the fact mr pash and disregarding the lawyer's exclamations he dragged paul outside in chancery lane he spoke i've bluffed him fine he said that boy is lost can't see him anywhere but we're getting at the truth at last chapter xxiv mrs krill at bay next day hurd did not go to see mrs krill as he had intended but spent his time in hunting for the missing boy tray however was not to be found being a guttersnipe and accustomed to dealing with the police he was thoroughly well able to look after himself and doubtless had concealed himself in some low den where the officers of the law would not think of searching for him however the fact remained that in spite of the detective's search he could not be caught and the authorities were much vexed to unravel the case completely tray was a necessary witness especially as even when examined at jubileetown hurd shrewdly suspected he had not confessed all the truth however what could be done was done and several plain clothes detectives were set to search for the missing boy pash remained quiet for at all events the next four and twenty hours whether he saw mrs krill or not during that time hurd did not know and truth to say he cared very little the lawyer had undoubtedly acted dishonestly and if the matter were made public there would be every chance that he would be struck off the rolls to prevent this pash was quite ready to sell mrs krill and anyone else connected with the mystery also he wished to keep the business of miss norman supposing the money as he hinted might be the case through his assistance came back to her and this might be used as a means to make him speak out hurd was now pretty sure that mrs krill was the guilty person she knew pash through hay argued the detective while thinking over the case and undoubtedly came to see him before norman's death so that pash might suggest ways and means of getting the better of the old man by means of the bigamy business mrs krill was in the chancery lane office when the brooch left by tray was on the table and mrs krill anxious to get it no doubt slipped it into her pocket when pash was talking to his clerk in the outer room then i expect she decided to punish her husband by fastening his lips together as he had done those of her daughter twenty and more years ago i can't exactly see why she strangled him mused hurd as she could have got the money without proceeding to such an extreme measure but the man's dead and she killed him sure enough now i'll get a warrant out and arrest her straight away there's quite enough evidence to justify her being taken in charge hum i wonder if she made use of that young devil of a tray in any way well he rose and stretched himself i may force her to speak now that she is in a corner having made up his mind hurd went to work at once and the next day late in the afternoon he was driving in a cab to no a hunter street kensington with the warrant in his pocket he also had with him a letter which he had received from miss qian and written from beechill in buckinghamshire aurora had made good use of her time and had learned a number of facts connected with mrs krill's early life which hurd thought would prove of interest to the woman in one way and another the case was becoming plain and clear and the detective made sure that he would gain the reward the irony of the thing was that mrs krill with a view to throwing dust in the eyes of the law had offered a bribe of one thousand pounds for the discovery of the assassin she little thought when doing so that she was weaving a rope for her own neck hurd had brought a plain clothes policeman with him and this man remained outside in a hansom while hurd rang the bell in a few minutes the door was opened and the detective sent up his card mrs krill proved to be at home and consented to receive him so shortly the man found himself in an elegantly furnished drawing room bowing before the silent and sedate daughter you wish to see my mother said maud with her eternal smile she will be down in a few minutes i await her convenience said hurd admiring the handsome looks of the young woman although he plainly saw that she was as he phrased it no chicken after a few words miss krill rang the bell i want these things taken away she said pointing to a workbasket and some millinery with which she had been engaged when hurd was announced then i shall leave you to speak to my mother the detective wondered if she was too fine a lady to remove these things herself but his surprise ceased when the door opened and no less a person than matilda junk appeared he guessed at once that the landlady of the red pig had come up to see her sister and had related details about her visitor probably mrs krill guessed that hurd had been asking questions and matilda had been introduced to see if he was the man he became certain of this when miss junk threw up her hands the commercial gent she exclaimed oh no said maud smiling smoothly this is mr hurd the detective who is searching for the assassin of my dear father lor' said matilda growing red and he's the man as came to ask questions at the 'otel i do call it bold of you mister policeman well said hurd swinging his hat lazily and looking from one to the other quite taking in the situation you answered very few of my questions so that is all right why did you go down to christchurch asked miss krill if i have to find out who killed your father said hurd with an accent on the word father it was necessary that i should learn about his past life as lemuel krill my mother could have informed you sir i guessed as much and as miss junk would not speak i have come to question mrs krill ah here she is hurd rose and bowed i am glad to see you madam mrs krill who was as plump and smiling and smooth faced and severe as ever bowed and rubbed her white hands together at a sign from maud matilda gathered up the fancy work and went out of the room with many backward glances these were mostly indignant for she was angry at hurd's deception do you wish my daughter to stay asked mrs krill smoothly that is as she pleases said the detective no thank you mother said maud shuddering i have heard quite enough of my poor father's terrible death and she swept out of the drawing room with a gracious smile the poor child is so sensitive sighed mrs krill taking a seat with her back to the window whether this was done to conceal her age or the expression of her face during a conversation which could not fail to prove trying hurd was unable to determine i trust mr hurd you have come with good news said the widow what would you call good news asked the detective dryly that you had traced the assassin she replied coolly hurd was amazed at this brazen assurance and thought that mrs krill must be quite convinced that she had covered up every trail likely to lead to the discovery of her connection with the murder i'll leave you to judge whether i have been successful he said calmly i shall be pleased to hear was the equally calm reply but as mrs krill spoke she glanced towards a gorgeous tapestry curtain at the end of the room and hurd fancied he saw it shake it suddenly occurred to him that maud was behind why she should choose this secret way of listening when she could have remained it was difficult to say and he half thought he was mistaken however listening openly or secretly did not matter so far as the daughter was concerned so hurd addressed himself to mrs krill in a loud and cheerful voice she composed herself to listen with a bland smile and apparently was quite ignorant that there was anything wrong i was lately down at christchurch madam so my servant matilda junk said it was necessary that i should go there to search out your husband's past life in that past i fancied might be found the motive for the commission of the crime i could have saved you the journey said mrs krill shrugging her plump shoulders i can tell you what you wish to know in that case i will relate all that i have learned and perhaps you will correct me if i am wrong mrs krill bowed but did not commit herself to speech for the sake of effect the detective took out a sheaf of notes but in reality he had the various points of the case at his finger tips you will excuse me if i talk on very private matters he said apologetically but as we are alone again mrs krill glanced at the curtain and thereby confirmed hurd's suspicions of an unseen listener you will not mind my being perhaps personal personal echoed mrs krill a keen look coming into her hard eyes and she stopped rubbing her hands together well yes admitted hurd with affected reluctance i had to look into your past as well as into that of your husband's mrs krill's eyes grew harder than ever she scented danger my past is a most uninteresting one she said coldly i was born at stowley in buckinghamshire and married mr krill at beechill which is a few miles from that town he was a traveller in jewellery but as i did not like his being away from me i induced him to rent 'the red pig' at christchurch to which we removed then he left me on account of lady rachel sandal's murder mrs krill controlled herself excellently although she was startled by this speech as was evident from the expression of her eyes that poor lady committed suicide she said deliberately the jury at the inquest brought in a verdict of suicide by a majority of one added hurd quickly there seemed to be a considerable amount of doubt as to the cause of the death the death was caused by strangulation said mrs krill in hard tones since you know all about the matter you must be aware that i and my daughter had retired after seeing lady rachel safe and sound for the night the death was discovered by a boon companion of my husband's with whom he was drinking at the time i know that also that you came down with your daughter when the alarm was given i also know that krill fastened your daughter's lips together with the opal brooch which was found in the parlor who told you that asked mrs krill agitated jessop the boon companion you speak of yes she said suppressing her agitation with a powerful effort matilda said you had him to dine with you what else did he say she asked with some hesitation much less than i should have liked to know retorted hurd prepared to throw off the mask but he told me a great deal which interested me very much amongst other things that grexon hay had been engaged to your daughter for two years well asked mrs krill coolly what of that nothing particular rejoined hurd just as coolly only i wonder you took the trouble to pretend that you met hay at pash's office for the first time that was some romantic rubbish of my daughter's there was no reason why we should not have acknowledged mr hay as an old acquaintance none in the world that i can see said hurd smoothly he told you that aaron norman was your husband no said mrs krill decidedly i first heard of my husband by seeing a chance hand bill not at all answered hurd just as decidedly hay has confessed there was nothing to confess cried mrs krill loudly and with emphasis oh i think so said the detective noting that she was losing her temper you didn't want it known that you were aware of norman's identity before his death do you deny that i deny everything gasped mrs krill her hands trembling that's a pity as i want you to corroborate certain facts connected with anne tyler do you know the name my maiden name said the widow and a look of fear crept into her hard staring eyes how did you come to know of it from the marriage certificate supplied by pash he had no right to give it to you he didn't i possess only a copy but that copy i sent down in charge of a certain person to beechill this person found that you were married as anne tyler to lemuel krill in the parish church twenty miles from your birthplace mrs krill drew a long breath of relief well she demanded defiantly is there anything wrong about that no but this person also made inquiries at stowley about you you are the daughter of a farmer i mentioned that fact myself yes but you didn't mention that your mother had been hanged for poisoning your father mrs krill turned ghastly pale no she said in a suffocating voice such is the case but can you wonder that i forebore to mention that fact my daughter knows nothing of that nor did my husband which husband do you mean krill or jessop asked hurd mrs krill gasped and rose swaying what do you mean man this said the detective on his feet at once this person hunted out the early life of anne tyler at stowley it was discovered that anne was the daughter of a woman who had been hanged and of a man who had been murdered also this person found that anne tyler married a sailor called jarvey jessop some years before she committed bigamy with lemuel krill in beechill church it's a lie screamed mrs krill losing her self control how dare you come here with these falsehoods they are not falsehoods anne tyler alias anne jessop alias anne krill etc retorted hurd speaking rapidly and emphasizing his remarks with his finger in his usual fashion when in deadly earnest you were married to jessop in stowley church you bore him a daughter who was christened maud jessop in stowley church the person i mentioned sent me copies of the marriage and birth certificates so your marriage with lemuel krill was false and his second marriage with lillian garner is a good one in law which means mrs jessop hurd hurled the word at her and she shrank that sylvia norman or sylvia krill as she rightfully is owns that money which you wrongfully withhold from her the will gave the five thousand a year to 'my daughter' and sylvia is the only daughter and only child the legitimate child mark you of lemuel krill lies lies lies raged mrs krill as she may still be called though rightfully jessop i'll defend the case on my daughter's behalf your daughter certainly said hurd but not krill's i say yes and i say no she was fifteen when lady rachel was murdered as jessop her father admitted i knew the man was keeping something back but i was far from suspecting that it was this early marriage no wonder the man came to you and had free quarters at 'the red pig' he could have prosecuted you for bigamy just as you would have prosecuted krill had you not murdered him mrs krill gave a yell and her eyes blazed you hound she shouted do you accuse me of that i do more than accuse you i arrest you hurd produced the warrant a man is waiting in the cab we'll get a four wheeler and you'll come along with me to gaol mrs jessop you can't prove it you can't prove it she panted and i sha'n't go i sha'n't i sha'n't and her eyes sought the tapestry miss jessop can come out said hurd coolly and as to your not coming a few policemen will soon put that right how dare you insult me and my daughter come come said the detective sternly i've had quite enough of this you offered me one thousand pounds to learn who killed your so called husband krill i have earned the reward not one shilling shall you have oh i think so miss sylvia will pay it to me and you i am innocent i never touched the man a jury will decide that mrs jessop krill my name is krill hurd laughed and turned towards the tapestry what do you say miss jessop he asked seeing that further concealment was at an end maud lifted the tapestry which concealed a small door through which she had silently stolen to listen she advanced calmly i have heard all your conversation with my mother she declared with flashing eyes and not one word of it is true i am the daughter of lemuel krill you'll find that hard to prove in the face of your birth certificate and your mother's marriage to captain jessop your father it will all be put right quite so and miss norman will get the money that girl never cried maud fiercely she looked very like her mother at the moment but the more angry she grew the calmer became mrs krill who kept darting anxious glances at her daughter and you sha'n't take my mother away she cried threateningly i don't want to make a scandal in the neighborhood said hurd taking a small whistle from his pocket but if i blow this my man out there will call the nearest policeman and then there is no need interrupted mrs krill who had recovered her self control maud come over beside me on what grounds mr hurd do you accuse me of the crime i was not in town on oh yes you were mrs jessop pash can prove that you were in his office and took the brooch left by tray from the table i don't know where you stopped on that night at judson's hotel strand cried maud placing herself beside her mother and anyone there can prove that my mother and myself were within doors after we came from terry's theatre where we spent the evening as my father for krill was my father was killed after twelve and we were both in bed in one room before then your accusation falls to the ground my mother was with me and she did not leave the whole evening next day we went to christchurch hurd was rather staggered by the positive way in which the young woman spoke but the facts were too plain for him to hesitate i must trouble you to come along with me he said no don't go to put on my cloak and hat urged mrs krill i'll come quietly enough i don't want a scandal i am sure when the magistrate hears what i have to say he will let me go free i trust so but you must not leave the room matilda will no doubt bring your things mrs krill touched the electric button of the bell while maud walked up and down deathly white and fuming mr hay shall see to this she said in a cold rage mr hay will have quite enough to do to look after himself said the detective coolly you had better let your mother go quietly and i won't say anything to matilda junk yes do maud urged the mother placing an imploring hand on her tall daughter's shoulder it's better so everything will be put right when the magistrate hears my story what will you tell him mother asked maud that i am innocent and that i am as you are ignorant of who killed your unfortunate father matilda entered the room and heard that mrs krill had to go out on business with mr hurd on receiving her orders she departed and presently returned with the cloak and hat mrs krill who was now quite cool put these on hurd could not but admire the brave way in which she faced the terrible situation maud seemed to be far more upset and hurd wondered if the young woman knew the truth mrs krill kept soothing her it will be all right my love don't excite yourself it will be all right she said several times miss junk departed and mrs krill said that she was ready to depart hurd offered her his arm which she rejected and walked to the door with a firm step although her face was rather white at the door she caught her daughter round the neck and kissed her several times after which she whispered earnestly in her ear and then went down the stairs with the detective in attendance maud with white lips and cheeks but with dry eyes followed when her mother was safely in the cab the plain clothes policeman alighted so that hurd might take his place maud came quietly down the steps and seized the detective by the arm you have ruined my mother she said in a cold hard tone you have robbed me of my money and of the chance of marrying the man i love i can't hurt you but that girl sylvia she shall never get one penny so remember hurd shook her off and stepping into the cab drove away mrs krill looked apprehensively at him what did maud say she asked hurd told her and mrs krill closed her lips firmly maud is quite right she said with a strange smile sylvia will never get the money chapter xxv a cruel woman jus' say your meanin' my pretty queen said mrs tawsey as she stood at the sitting room door and watched sylvia reading an ill written letter it's twelve now and i kin be back by five arter a long and enjiable tork with matilder you certainly must go replied sylvia handing back the letter i am sure your sister will be glad to see you debby deborah sniffed and scratched her elbow relatives ain't friends in our family she said shaking her head whatever you may say my deary sweet father knocked mother int' lunatics arter she'd nagged 'im to drunk an' police

an' may i arsk mrs purr ma'am demanded deborah with great politeness wot i pays you fur in the way of ironin' but mrs purr was too excited to reply she brushed past her indignant mistress and faced sylvia waving a dirty piece of paper lor' miss she almost screamed you do say as you want t'know where that limb tray 'ave got to yes yes said sylvia rising he escaped from mr hurd and we want to find him very much it's a letter from 'im said mrs purr thrusting the paper into sylvia's hand tho' 'ow he writes not 'avin' bin to a board school i dunno he's in a ken at lambith and ill at that want's me

sylvia kissing her and pushing her towards the door i'll look after those four women in the wash house and read this new book i have then i must get tea ready for paul who comes at four the afternoon will pass quite quickly i'll be back at five if i can and earlier if matilder ain't what she oughter be said mrs tawsey yielding so make yourself 'appy honey till you sees me smilin' again in another quarter of an hour mrs tawsey dressed in her bridal gown and bonnet so as to crush matilda with the sight of her splendor walked down the garden path attended by mrs purr in a snuffy black shawl and a kind of cobweb on her head which she called a bunnet as deborah was tall and in white and mrs purr small and in black they looked a strange pair sylvia waved her hand out of the window to debby as that faithful creature turned her head for a final look at the young mistress she idolized the large rough woman was dog like in her fidelity sylvia left alone proceeded to arrange matters she went to the wash house which was detached from the cottage and saw that the four women who worked under deborah were busy she found them all chattering and washing in a cheerful way so after a word or two of commendation she returned to the sitting room here she played a game of patience arranged the tea things although it was yet early and finally settled down to one of mrs henry wood's interesting novels she was quite alone and enjoyed the solitude the wash house was so far away at the end of the yard that the loud voices of the workers could not be heard the road before rose cottage was not a popular thoroughfare and it was rarely that anyone passed out of the window sylvia could see a line of raw red brick villas and sometimes a spurt of steam denoting the presence of the railway station also she saw the green fields and the sere hedges with the red berries giving promise of a hard winter the day was sunny but cold and there was a feeling of autumnal dampness in the air deborah had lighted a fire before she went that her mistress might be comfortable so sylvia sat down before this and read for an hour frequently stopping to think of paul and wonder if he would come at the appointed hour of four or earlier what with the warmth and the reading and the dreaming she fell into a kind of doze from which she was awakened by a sharp and peremptory knock wondering if her lover had unexpectedly arrived though she did not think he would rap in so decided a manner sylvia rubbed the sleep out of her pretty eyes and hurried to the door on the step she came face to face with miss maud krill do you know me miss norman asked maud who was smiling and suave though rather white in the face yes you came with your mother to gwynne street replied sylvia wondering why she had been honored with a visit quite so may i have a few minutes' conversation with you certainly sylvia saw no reason to deny this request although she did not like miss krill but it struck her that something might be learned from that young woman relative to the murder and thought she would have something to tell paul about when he arrived will you walk in please and she threw open the sitting room door are you quite alone asked maud entering and seating herself in the chair near the fire quite answered sylvia stiffly and wondering why the question was asked that is the four washerwomen are in the place at the back but mrs tawsey went to your house to see her sister she arrived before i left said maud coolly i saw them quarrelling in a most friendly way where is mr beecot i expect him later and bart tawsey who married your nurse he is absent on his rounds may i ask why you question me in this way miss krill asked sylvia coldly because i have much to say to you which no one else must hear was the calm reply dear me how hot this fire is and she moved her chair so that it blocked sylvia's way to the door also miss krill cast a glance at the window it was not snibbed and she made a movement as if to go to it but restraining herself she turned her calm cold face to the girl i have much to say to you she repeated indeed replied sylvia politely i don't think you have treated me so well that you should trouble to converse with me will you please to be brief mr beecot is coming at four and he will not be at all pleased to see you maud glanced at the clock we have an hour she said coldly it is just a few minutes after three my business will not take long she added with an unpleasant smile what is your business asked sylvia uneasily for she did not like the smile if you will sit down i'll tell you miss norman took a chair near the wall and as far from her visitor as was possible in so small a room maud took from her neck a black silk handkerchief which she wore evidently as a protection against the cold and folding it lengthways laid it across her lap then she looked at sylvia in a cold critical way you are very pretty my dear she said insolently did you come to tell me that asked the girl firing up at the tone no i came to tell you that my mother was arrested last night for the murder of our father oh sylvia gasped and lay back on her chair she killed him that cruel woman she did not cried maud passionately my mother is perfectly innocent that blackguard hurd arrested her wrongfully i overheard all the conversation he had with her and know that he told a pack of lies my mother did not kill our father my father not yours said sylvia firmly how dare you lemuel krill was my father no insisted sylvia i don't know who your father was but from your age i know that you are not leave my age alone cried the other sharply and with an uneasy movement of her hands we won't discuss that or the question of my father we have more interesting things to talk about i won't talk to you at all said sylvia rising sit down and listen you shall hear me i am not going to let my mother suffer for a deed she never committed nor am i going to let you have the money it is mine it is not and you shall not get it paul mr beecot will assert my rights will he indeed said the other with a glance at the clock we'll see about that there's no time to be lost i have much to say nothing that can interest me oh yes i think you will find our conversation very interesting i am going to be open with you for what i tell you will never be told by you to any living soul if i see fit it shall cried sylvia in a rage how dare you dictate to me because i am driven into a corner i wish to save my mother how it is to be done i don't know and i wish to stop you getting the five thousand a year i know how that is to be done ended miss krill with a cruel smile and a flash of her white hungry looking teeth you rat of a girl leave the room when i please not before you listen to me i'm going to tell you about the murder oh said sylvia turning pale what do you mean listen said the other with a taunting laugh you'll be white enough before i've done with you do you see this and she laid her finger on her lips do you see this scar krill did that sylvia noticed that she did not speak of krill as her father this time he pinned my lips together when i was a child with that opal serpent i know replied sylvia shuddering it was cruel i heard about it from the detective and i don't wish for your sympathy i was a girl of fifteen when that was done and i will carry the scar to my grave child as i was then i vowed revenge on your father said sylvia contemptuously krill is not my father said maud changing front all at once he is yours but not mine my father is captain jessop i have known this for years captain jessop told me i was his daughter my mother thought that my father was drowned at sea and so married krill who was a traveller in jewellery he and my mother rented 'the red pig' at christchurch and for years they led an unhappy life oh gasped sylvia you confess i'll tell paul you'll tell no one retorted the other woman sharply do you think i would speak so openly in order that you might tell all the world with your gabbling tongue yes and i'll speak more openly still before i leave lady rachel sandal did not commit suicide as my mother said she was strangled and by me sylvia clapped her hands to her face with a scream by you yes she had a beautiful brooch i wanted it i was put to bed by my mother and kept thinking of the brooch my mother was down the stairs attending to your drunken father i stole to lady rachel's room and found her asleep i tried to take the brooch from her breast she woke and caught at my hand but i tore away the brooch and before lady rachel could scream i twisted the silk handkerchief she wore which was already round her throat tighter i am strong i was always strong even as a girl of fifteen she was weak from exhaustion so she soon died my mother came into the room and saw what i had done she was terrified and made me go back to bed then she tied lady rachel by the silk handkerchief to the bedpost so that it might be thought she had committed suicide my mother then came back to me and took the brooch telling me i might be hanged if it was found on me i was afraid being only a girl and gave up the brooch then captain jessop raised the alarm i and my mother went downstairs and my mother dropped the brooch on the floor so that it might be supposed lady rachel had lost it there captain jessop ran out i wanted to give the alarm and tell the neighbors that krill had done it for i knew then he was not my father and i saw moreover how unhappy he made my mother he caught me said maud with a fierce look and bound a handkerchief across my mouth i got free and screamed then he bound me hand and foot and pinned my lips together with the brooch which he picked off the floor my mother fought for me but he knocked her down then he fled and after a long time jessop came in he removed the brooch from my mouth and unbound me i was put to bed and jessop revived my mother then came the inquest and it was thought that lady rachel had committed suicide but she did not cried maud exultingly and with a cruel light in her eyes i killed her i oh moaned sylvia backing against the wall with widely open eyes don't tell me more what horrors bah you kitten sneered maud contemptuously i have not half done yet you have yet to hear how i killed krill sylvia shrieked and sank back in her chair staring with horrified eyes at the cruel face before her yes cried maud exultingly i killed him my mother suspected me but she never knew for certain listen when hay told me that krill was hiding as norman in gwynne street i determined to punish him for his cruelty to me i did not say this but i made hay promise to get me the brooch from beecot on no other condition would i marry him i wanted the brooch to pin krill's lips together as he had pinned mine when i was a helpless child but your fool of a lover would not part with the brooch tray the boy took it from beecot's pocket when he met with that accident how do you know tray because i met him at pash's office several times when i was up he ran errands for pash before he became regularly employed i saw that tray was a devil of whom i could make use oh i know tray and i know also hokar the indian who placed the sugar on the counter he went to the shop to kill your father at my request i wanted revenge and the money hokar was saved from starvation by my good mother he came of the race of thugs if you know anything about them oh moaned sylvia covering her face again ah you do so much the better it will save my explaining as there is not much time left before your fool arrives hokar saw that i loved to hurt living creatures and he taught me how to strangle cats and dogs and things no one knew but hokar that i killed them and it was thought he ate them but he didn't i strangled them because i loved to see them suffer and because i wished to learn how to strangle in the way the thugs did sylvia was sick with fear and disgust for god's sake don't tell me any more she said imploringly but she might as well have spoken to a granite rock you shall hear everything said maud relentlessly i asked hokar to strangle krill he went to the shop but when he saw that krill had only one eye he could not offer him to the goddess bhowanee he came to me at judson's hotel after he left the sugar on the counter and told me the goddess would not accept the offering of a maimed man i did not know what to do i went with my mother to pash's office when she was arranging to prosecute krill for bigamy i met tray there he told me he had given the brooch to pash and that it was in the inner office my mother was talking to pash within and i chatted to tray outside i told tray i wanted to kill krill and that if he would help me i would give him a lot of money he agreed for he was a boy such as i was when a girl fond of seeing things suffer you can't wonder at it in me went on miss krill coolly my grandmother was hanged for poisoning my grandfather and i expect i inherit the love of murder from her i won't listen cried sylvia shuddering oh yes you will i'll soon be done went on her persecutor cruelly well then when i found tray was like myself i determined to get the brooch and hurt krill hurt him as he hurt me she cried vehemently tray told me of the cellar and of the side passage when my mother and pash came out of the inner office and went to the door i ran in and took the brooch it was hidden under some papers and had escaped my mother's eye but i searched till i got it then i made an appointment with tray for eleven o'clock at the corner of gwynne street i went back to judson's hotel and my mother and i went to the theatre we had supper and retired to bed that is my mother did we had left the theatre early as my mother had a headache and i had plenty of time mother fell asleep almost immediately i went downstairs veiled and in dark clothes i slipped past the night porter and met tray we went by the side passage to the cellar thinking we were customers krill let us in tray locked the door and i threw myself on krill he had not been drinking much or i might not have mastered him as it was he was too terrified when he recognized me to struggle in fact he fainted with tray's assistance i bound his hands behind his back and then we enjoyed ourselves she rubbed her hands together looking more like a fiend than a woman sylvia rose and staggered to the door no more no more maud pushed her back into her chair stop where you are you whimpering fool she snarled exultingly i have you safe then she continued quickly and with another glance at the clock the long hand of which now pointed to a quarter to four with tray's assistance i carried krill up to the shop tray found an auger and bored a hole in the floor then i picked up a coil of copper wire which was being used in packing things for krill to make his escape i took it up we laid krill's neck over the hole and passed the wire round his neck and through the hole tray went down and tied a cross stick on the end of the wire so that he could put his weight on it when we strangled oh great heaven moaned sylvia stopping her ears maud bent over her and pulled her hands away you shall hear you little beast she snarled all the time krill was sensible he recovered his senses after he was bound i prolonged his agony as much as possible when tray went down to see after the wire i knelt beside krill and told him that i knew i was not his daughter that i intended to strangle him as i had strangled lady rachel he shrieked with horror that was the cry you heard you cat and which brought you downstairs i never expected that cried maud clapping her hands that was a treat for krill i never intended i stopped his crying any more for assistance by pinning his mouth together as he had done mine over twenty years before then i sat beside him and taunted him i heard the policeman pass and the church clock strike the quarter then i heard footsteps and guessed you were coming it occurred to me to give you a treat by strangling the man before your eyes and punish him more severely since the brooch stopped him calling out as it stopped me me she cried striking her breast oh how could you how could you feeble thing said maud contemptuously and patting the girl's cheek you would not have done it i know but i loved it i loved it that was living indeed i went down to the cellar and fastened the door behind me tray was already pressing on the cross stick at the end of the wire and laughed as he pressed but i stopped him i heard you and that woman enter the shop and heard what you said i prolonged krill's agony and then i pressed the wire down myself for such a time as i thought it would take to squeeze the life out of the beast then with tray i locked the cellar door and left by the side passage we dodged all the police and got into the strand i did not return to the hotel but walked about with tray all the night talking with joy cried maud clapping her hands with joy do you hear when it was eight i went to judson's the porter thought i had been out for an early walk my mother here maud broke off for sylvia who was staring over her shoulder out of the window saw a form she knew well at the gate paul paul she shrieked come come maud whipped the black silk handkerchief round the girl's neck you shall never get that money she whispered cruelly you shall never tell anyone what i have told you now i'll show you how hokar taught me she jerked the handkerchief tight but sylvia got her hand under the cruel bandage and shrieked aloud in despair at once she heard an answering shriek it was the voice of deborah maud darted to the door and locked it then she returned and flinging sylvia down tried again to tighten the handkerchief her face white and fierce and her eyes glittering like a demon's help help cried sylvia and her voice grew weaker but she struggled and kept her hands between the handkerchief and her throat maud tried to drag them away fiercely deborah was battering frantically at the door paul ran round to the window it was not locked and maud struggling with sylvia had no time to close it with a cry of alarm paul threw up the window and jumped into the room at the same moment deborah putting her sturdy shoulder to the frail door burst it open beecot flung himself on the woman and dragged her back but she clung like a leech to sylvia with the black handkerchief in her grip deborah silent and fierce grabbed at the handkerchief and tore it from maud's grasp sylvia half strangled fell back in a faint white as a corpse while paul struggled with the savage and baffled woman you've killed her shouted deborah and laid her strong hands on maud you devil she shook her fiercely i'll kill you and she shook her again paul threw himself on his knees beside the insensible form of sylvia and left deborah to deal with maud that creature was gasping as mrs tawsey swung her to and fro then she began to fight and the two women crashed round the little room upsetting the furniture paul took sylvia in his arms and shrank against the wall to protect her a new person suddenly appeared no less a woman than matilda when she saw maud in deborah's grip she flew at her sister like a tigress and dragged her off maud was free for a moment seeing her chance she scrambled out of the window and ran through the garden down the road towards the station perhaps she had a vague idea of escape deborah exerting her great strength threw matilda aside and without a cry ran out of the house and after the assassin who had tried to strangle sylvia matilda true to her salt ran also to help maud krill and the two women sped in the wake of the insane creature who was swiftly running in the direction of the station people began to look round a crowd gathered like magic and in a few moments maud was being chased by quite a mob of people she ran like a hare heaven only knows if she hoped to escape after her failure to kill sylvia but she ran on blindly into the new street of jubileetown she sped with the roaring mob at her heels she darted down a side thoroughfare but deborah gained on her silently and with a savage look in her eyes several policemen joined in the chase though no one knew what the flying woman had done maud turned suddenly up the slope that led to the station she gained the door darted through it upset the man at the barrier and with clenched fists stood at bay her back to the rails deborah darted forward maud gave a wild scream and sprang aside then she reeled and fell over the platform the next moment a train came slowing into the station and immediately the wretched woman was under the cruel wheels when she was picked up she was dead and almost cut to pieces lady rachel and lemuel krill were revenged chapter xxvi a final explanation sylvia was ill for a long time after that terrible hour although maud had not succeeded in strangling her yet the black silk handkerchief left marks on her neck then the struggle the shock and the remembrance of the horrors related by the miserable woman threw her into a nervous fever and it was many weeks before she recovered sufficiently to enjoy life deborah never forgave herself for having left sylvia alone and nursed her with a fierce tenderness which was the result of remorse if that wretch 'ad killed my pretty she said to paul i'd ha' killed her if i wos hanged fur it five times over god has punished the woman said paul solemnly and a terrible death she met with being mutilated by the wheels of the train serve 'er right rejoined deborah heartlessly what kin you expect fur good folk if wicked ones as go strangulating people don't git the lord down on 'em oh mr beecot deborah broke down into noisy tears the 'orrors that my lovely one 'ave tole me i tried to stop her but she would tork and was what you might call delirous like sich murders and gory assassins as wos never 'eard of i gathered something of this from what sylvia let drop when we came back from the station said beecot anxiously tell me exactly what she said deborah why that thing as is dead an' may she rest in a peace she don't deserve tole 'ow she murdered lady rachel sandal an' my ole master deborah cried beecot amazed you must be mistaken no i ain't sir that thing guv my lily queen the 'orrors jes you 'ear mr beecot and creeps will go up your back lor' 'ave mercy on us as don't know the wickedness of the world i think we have learned something of it lately mrs tawsey was paul's grim reply but tell me wot my pore angel sunbeam said i will and if it gives you nightmares don't blame me and mrs tawsey in her own vigorous ungrammatical way related what she had heard from sylvia paul was struck with horror and wanted to see sylvia but this deborah would not allow she's sleepin' like a pretty daisy said mrs tawsey so don't you go a disturbin' of her nohow though acrost my corp you may make a try say what you like but paul thought better of it thinking sylvia had best be left in the rough kindly hands of her old nurse he went off to find hurd and related all that had taken place the detective was equally horrified along with beecot when he heard of sylvia's danger and set to work to prove the truth of what maud had told the girl he succeeded so well that within a comparatively short space of time the whole matter was made clear mrs jessop alias mrs krill was examined tray was found and questioned matilda was made to speak out and both jessop and hokar had to make clean breasts of it the evidence thus procured proved the truth of the terrible confession made by maud jessop to the girl she thought to strangle hurd was amazed at the revelation never call me a detective again he said to paul for i am an ass i thought jessop might be guilty or that hokar might have done it i could have taken my bible oath that mrs krill strangled the man but i never for one moment suspected that smiling young woman oh paul shrugged his shoulders she was mad she must have been ruminated the detective else she wouldn't have given herself away so completely whatever made her tell miss norman what she had done because she never thought that sylvia would live to tell anyone else that was why she spoke and thought to torture sylvia as she did in the same way as she tortured that wretched man lemuel if i hadn't come earlier to rose cottage than usual and if deborah had not met me unexpectedly at the station sylvia would certainly have been killed and then maud might have escaped she laid her plans well it was she who induced matilda to get her sister to come to kensington for a chat but matilda didn't know what maud was up to no matilda never guessed that maud was guilty of two murders or designed to strangle sylvia but maud made use of her to get deborah out of the house and it was maud who made tray send the letter asking mrs purr to come to him so that she also might be out of the way in fact maud arranged so that everyone should be away and sylvia alone if she hadn't wasted time in telling her fearful story she might have killed my poor love sylvia was quite exhausted with the struggle well said hurd i went with the old woman to the address given in that letter which tray got written for him he wasn't there however so i might have guessed it was a do but you have caught him yes in hunter street he was loafing about there at night waiting for maud and quite ignorant of her death i made him tell me everything of his connection with the matter he's as bad a lot as that girl but she had some excuse seeing her grandmother was a murderess tray is nothing but a wicked little imp will he be hanged no i think not his youth will be in his favor though i'd hang him myself had i the chance and so put him beyond the reach of hurting anyone but i expect he'll get a long sentence and mrs krill mrs jessop you mean hum i don't know she apparently was ignorant that maud killed krill though she might have guessed it after the way in which lady rachel was murdered i daresay she'll get off i'm going to see her shortly and tell her of the terrible death of her daughter paul did not pursue the conversation he was sick with the horror of the business and moreover was too anxious about sylvia's health to take much interest in the winding up of the case that he left in the hands of hurd and assured him that the thousand pounds reward which mrs krill had offered would be paid to him by miss norman of course pash had known for some time that maud was too old to have been born of mrs jessop's second marriage with krill but he never knew that the widow had committed bigamy he counted on keeping her under his thumb by threatening to prove that maud was not legally entitled to the money but when the discovery was made at beechill and stowley churches by miss qian the monkey faced lawyer could do nothing beecot could have exposed him and for his malpractices have got him struck off the rolls but he simply punished him by taking away sylvia's business and giving it to ford that enterprising young solicitor speedily placed the monetary affairs on a proper basis and saw that sylvia was properly reinstated in her rights seeing that she was the only child and legal heiress of krill this was not difficult the two women who had illegally secured possession of the money had spent a great deal in a very wasteful manner but the dead man's investments were so excellent and judicious that sylvia lost comparatively little and became possessed of nearly five thousand a year with a prospect of her income increasing but she was too ill to appreciate this good fortune the case got into the papers and everyone was astonished at the strange sequel to the gwynne street mystery beecot senior reading the papers learned that sylvia was once more an heiress and forthwith held out an olive branch to paul moreover the frantic old gentleman as deborah called him really began to feel his years and to feel also that he had treated his only son rather harshly so he magnanimously offered to forgive paul on no conditions whatsoever for the sake of his mother the young man buried the past and went down to be received in a stately manner by his father and with joyful tears by his mother also he was most anxious to hear details of the case which had not been made public paul told him everything and beecot senior snorted with rage the recital proved too much for mrs beecot who retired as usual to bed and fortified herself with sal volatile but paul and his respected parent sat up till late discussing the matter and now sir said beecot senior grasping the stem of his wine glass as though he intended to hurl it at his son let us gather up the threads of this infamous case this atrocious woman who tried to strangle your future wife she has been buried quietly her mother was at the funeral and so was the father a pretty pair gobbled the turkey cock growing red i suppose the government will hang the pair no captain jessop can't be touched as he had nothing to do with the murder and sylvia and myself are not going to prosecute him for his attempt to get the jewels from pash then you ought to it's a duty you owe to society paul shook his head i think it best to leave things as they are father he said mildly especially as mrs jessop much broken in health because of her daughter's terrible end has gone back with her husband to live at his house in stowley what shouted beecot senior is that she devil to go free too i don't think she was so bad as we thought said paul i fancied she was a thoroughly bad woman but she really was not she certainly committed bigamy but then she thought jessop was drowned when he came to life she preferred to live with krill as he had more money than jessop and therefore jessop as you say had free quarters at 'the red pig' a most immoral woman sir most immoral she ought to be ducked poor wretch said paul her mind has nearly given way under the shock of her daughter's death she loved that child and shielded her from the consequences of killing lady rachel the sandal family don't want the case revived especially as maud is dead so mrs jessop as she is now can end her days in peace the government decided to let her go under the circumstances tush said beecot senior sugar coated pills and idiocy nothing will ever be done properly until this government goes out and it will striking the table with his fist if i have anything to do with the matter so mrs krill or jessop is free to murder and she murdered no one interposed paul quickly she knew that her daughter had killed lady rachel and shielded her but she was never sure if maud had strangled krill as she feared to ask her but as the girl was out all night at the time of the murder mrs jessop i think knows more than she choses to admit however the treasury won't prosecute her and her mind is now weak let the poor creature end her days with jessop father is there anything else you wish to know that boy tray he was tried for being an accessory before the crime but his counsel put forward the plea of his age and that he had been under the influence of maud he has been sent to a reformatory for a good number of years he may improve huh grunted the old gentleman and silk purses may be made out of sow's ears but not in our time my boy we'll hear more of that juvenile scoundrel yet now that that blackguard hay he has gone abroad and is likely to remain abroad sandal and tempest kept their word but i think hurd put it about that hay was a cheat and a scoundrel poor hay sighed paul he has ruined his career bah he never had one if you pity scoundrels paul what are you to think of good people such as deborah who is nursing my darling i think she's the best woman in the world except your mother paul nearly fell from his seat on hearing this remark beecot senior certainly might have been in earnest but his good opinion did not prevent him still continuing to worry mrs beecot which he did to the end of her life i suppose that matilda junk creature had nothing to do with the murder asked beecot after an embarrassing pause on his son's part no she knew absolutely nothing and only attacked deborah because she fancied deborah was attacking maud however the two sisters have made it up and matilda has gone back to 'the red pig' she's as decent a creature as deborah in another way and was absolutely ignorant of maud's wickedness hurd guessed that when she spoke to him so freely at christchurch and the thug hokar oh he is not really a thug but the descendant of one however they can't prove that he strangled anything beyond a few cats and dogs when he showed maud how to use the roomal that's the handkerchief with which the thugs strangled their victims i'm not absolutely ignorant growled his father i know that so this hokar goes free yes he would not strangle aaron norman because he had but one eye and bhowanee won't accept maimed persons failing him maud had to attend to the job herself with the assistance of tray and this detective oh ford with sylvia's sanction has paid him the thousand pounds which he shares with his sister aurora qian but for her searching at stowley and beechill we should never have known about the marriage you know no i don't know they're far too highly paid the marriage would have come to light in another way however waste your own money if you like it isn't mine nor mine either father said paul sharply sylvia will keep her own fortune i am not a man to live on my wife i intend to take a house in town when we are married and then i'll still continue to write without the spur of poverty you'll never make a hit grinned the old gentleman however you can live where you please it's no business of mine but i demand as your indulgent father that you'll bring sylvia down here at least three times a year whenever she is well i want to see her i'll bring her next week said paul thinking of his mother but deborah must come too she won't leave sylvia the house is big enough bring mrs tawsey also i'm rather anxious to see her and sylvia will be a good companion for your mother so matters were arranged in this way and when paul returned to town he went at once to tell sylvia of the reconciliation he found her propped up with pillows seated by the fire looking much better although she was still thin and rather haggard deborah hovered round her and spoke in a cautious whisper which was more annoying than a loud voice would have been sylvia flushed with joy when she saw paul and flushed still more when she heard the good news i am so glad darling she said holding paul's hand in her thin ones i should not have liked our marriage to have kept you from your father mrs tawsey snorted his frantic par she said ah well when i meet 'im if he dares to say a word agin my pretty my father is quite ready to welcome her as a daughter said paul quickly an' no poor one either cried deborah triumphantly five thousand a year as that nice young man mr ford have told us is right lor' my lovely queen you'll drive in your chariot and forget debby you foolish old thing said the girl fondly you held to me in my troubles and you shall share in my joy allays purvidin' i don't 'ave to leave the laundry in charge of bart an' mrs purr both bein' infants of silliness one with gin and t'other with weakness of brain it's well i made bart promise to love honor and obey me mr beecot the same as you must do to my own lily flower there no i am to love honor and obey paul cried sylvia when he asked taking her in his arms as soon as i can stand at the altar she replied blushing whereat deborah clapped her hands weddin's an' weddin's an' weddin's agin cried mrs tawsey which my sister matilder being weary of 'er spinstering 'ome 'ave made up 'er mind to marry the fust as offers an' won't she lead 'im a dance neither oh no not at all well deborah said beecot we have much to be thankful for all of us let us try and show our gratitude in our lives ah well you may say that sighed mrs tawsey in a devout manner who'd ha' thought things would have turned out so 'appy like indeed but you go on with your billin' my lovely ones and i'll git th' mutting broth to put color int' my pretty's cheeks and she bustled out sylvia's heart was too full to say anything she lay in paul's strong arms her cheek against his there she would remain for the rest of her life protected from storm and tempest and as they sat in silence the chimes of an ancient grandfather's clock deborah's chief treasure rang out twice thrice and again paul laughed softly it's like wedding bells he whispered and his future wife sighed a sigh of heart felt joy the end the best novels by fergus

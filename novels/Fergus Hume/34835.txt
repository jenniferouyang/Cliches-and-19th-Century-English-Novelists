certain portions of england yet remain undiscovered by americans and uncivilised by railways colester village above king's meadows in a county which need not be named is one of these unknown spots no doubt before long the bicycle and the motor car will enliven its somnolent neighbourhood but at present it is free from the summer jaunts of tourists with this neglect the colester folk profess themselves satisfied they have no wish to come into contact with the busy world this prejudice against intrusion dates from mediaeval times when strangers rarely came to the village with peaceful intentions even now a chance comer is looked upon with suspicion mr richard pratt said something of this sort to the vicar during a morning ramble some six weeks after he had taken up his residence in the nun's house with the parson and the gentry of the parish mr pratt agreed very well his respectability having been vouched for by mrs gabriel the lady of the manor but the villagers still held aloof although the newcomer did his best to overcome their churlish doubts they did not credit his story that he had settled in colester to pass his remaining years in peace and even the money he scattered so freely could not buy their loyalty pratt had never met with such people before in most countries an open purse invites an open heart but the colester villagers were above mammon worship such an experience was refreshing to pratt and introduced him to a new type of humanity the first place i ever struck in which the dollar is not all powerful he said with his yankee twang and pleasant laugh we are not sufficiently educated in that respect replied mr tempest in his simple way for my part i am not ill pleased that my parishioners should refuse to worship the golden calf there is no calf about me i guess said pratt grimly and very little gold i don't say i haven't a decent income but as to being a millionaire no sir in the kingdom of the blind the one eyed is king mr pratt you are a millionaire in this poor place but i fear you find it dull why no vicar i'm glad to be out of the buzz the world's made up of nerves and machinery nowadays at fifty two years of age i can't stand the racket this sleepy hollow's good enough for me to stay in until i peg out guess i'll buy an allotment in that graveyard of yours hollow said the vicar smiling and our earthly dwelling place is set upon a hill mr pratt i suspect you have irish blood in your veins pratt laughed and being to a large extent devoid of humour explained earnestly that he had used the word figuratively washington irving rip van winkle he explained nodding whereat the vicar smiled again the situation of colester was striking and strange a green clothed promontory extended abruptly from the high table land into king's meadow to right and left chalky cliffs of considerable height flared away for miles forming a buttress to the moors above and walls to the plains below in pre historic ages the ocean waves had beaten against these cliffs but gradually receding had left dry the miles upon miles of fertile lands now called king's meadows an appanage of the crown they had been called so from the days of william the conqueror from where they stood the vicar and his friend had a bird's eye view of this desirable land unrolled like a map under the bright june sky league after league of corn fields stretched away to the clear shining line of ocean and amidst the ripening grain appeared red roofed villages clumps of trees the straight lines of dusty white roads and the winding glittering serpent of the river and as a background to this smiling plenty if so irish an expression be permitted was the blue expanse of the channel dotted with the white sails of merchantmen a small wood of ancient oaks shut off the purple clad moor from the spur upon which colester was built on the verge of this yet encircled by trees stood the village church a crusading chapel dedicated to st gabriel the messenger thence the ground fell away gradually and spread out into a broad neck of land down the centre of which ran a road leading from chapel to village on either side of this amidst oaks and elms and sycamores were the houses of the gentry from where they ended the promontory rose into two rounded hills with a slight depression between on the one to the left the village was built its houses cramped within a tumble down wall dating from the days when it was needed as a defence the other hill was surmounted by a well preserved castle the keep of which with its flag could be seen above the oak woods this was inhabited by mrs gabriel the sole representative of the feudal lords of colester yet she was only the childless widow of the last baron and had none of the fierce gabriel blood in her veins the once powerful and prolific family was extinct from castle and village steps led down into the depression between the two hills down this continued the chapel road sloping gradually with many windings to the plains below the whole place had the look of some rhenish robber hold and if tradition was to be trusted the gabriel lords had dwelt like eagles in their eyrie swooping down at intervals to harry and plunder burn and slay the peaceful folk of the plains a turbulent and aggressive race the gabriels it had defied king and priest and parliament and people time alone had ever conquered it a survival of the middle ages said mr tempest pointing out these things to his companion it was needful that the gabriel barons should build strong defences they were fierce and blood thirsty defiant of law and order for many centuries they were a scourge to the inhabitants of the plains these often complained to the king and several times the place was besieged but without result the gabriels kept their hold of it the only thing they ever lost was their title a bill of attainder was passed against them in the time of the second george after that they became less lions than foxes just so said mr pratt this place couldn't do much against artillery i guess and even in the bow and arrow days a strong force coming over the moor and down the spur that was often tried interrupted tempest quickly but the attempt always failed in the days of henry ii aylmer gabriel beat back an overwhelming force and then erected the chapel as a thanksgiving the archangel gabriel was the patron saint of the family and the chapel is dedicated to him he couldn't keep the family from dying out however said pratt as they moved towards the village no with the late john gabriel the family became extinct but i daresay mrs gabriel will arrange that her adopted son succeeds he can take the name and the coat of arms i should be very pleased to see that added the vicar half to himself leo is a good fellow and would make an excellent landlord the eyes of the american flashed when the name was mentioned but he made only a careless comment leo haverleigh he said after a pause he's a right smart young chap sure who is he the son of mrs gabriel's brother she was a miss haverleigh you know i believe her brother was somewhat dissipated and died abroad the boy arrived here when he was three years of age and mrs gabriel adopted him he will be her heir is there anyone to object asked pratt eagerly the vicar shook his head the gabriels are absolutely extinct failing leo the estates would lapse to the crown in the old days they would have been seized by the king in any case as the sovereigns were always anxious to hold this point of vantage which dominated their lands below but we live in such law abiding times that mrs gabriel although not of the blood of the family can leave the estates to whomsoever she will i understand that she has quite decided leo shall inherit and take the name also the coat of arms she doesn't strike me as over fond of the boy said pratt as they climbed the crooked street rather a hard woman i should say mrs gabriel has a particularly high moral standard replied the vicar evasively and she wishes all to attain to it leo he hesitated he's no worse than a boy ought to be said the american cheerily your young saint makes an old sinner that's so vicar mr tempest laughed outright i fear there is small chance of leo becoming a saint either young or old he said though he is a good lad in many ways wild i admit but his heart is in the right place pratt smiled to himself he knew that leo was in love with sybil the daughter of this prosy old archaeologist simple as mr tempest was he could not be blind to the possibility of his daughter making such an excellent match oh yes laughed pratt knowingly i'm sure his heart is in the right place but by this time the vicar was on his hobby horse and did not gauge the significance of the speech here he said waving his hand towards the four sides of the square in which they stood the romans built a camp it crowned this hill and was garrisoned by the tenth legion to overawe the turbulent tribes swarming on the plains below in fact this town is built within the camp as the name shows how does it show that asked pratt more to keep the vicar talking than because he cared the name man the name it is properly colncester but by usage has been shortened to colester coln comes from the latin colonia a colony and caster or cester is derived from castra a camp colncester therefore means the camp colony which proves that the original builders of this town erected their dwellings within the circumvallation of the original castra of claudian if you will come with me mr pratt i will show you the remains of this great work i have seen it several times before replied pratt rather bored by this archaeological disquisition i know every inch of this place it doesn't take an american centuries to get round and six weeks of walking have fixed me up in your local geography but there's the chapel vicar we might walk up there i'd like to hear a few remarks on the subject of the chapel interesting oh i guess so certainly certainly said tempest absently let us walk walk and he strolled away with his hands in his tail coat pockets looking something like an elderly jackdaw indeed the churchman with his lean oval face his large spectacles and the fluttering black garments on his thin figure very much resembled a bird he was scholarly well bred and gentle but wholly unworldly since his wife had died seven years before sybil had taken charge of the house harold raston the energetic curate looked after the parish but for these two both clerical and domestic affairs would have been neglected so immersed was mr tempest in his dry as dust explorations many people said openly that the vicar was past his work and should be pensioned off mrs gabriel a capable and managing woman had once hinted as much to him but the usually placid parson had flown into such a rage that she had hastily withdrawn herself and her suggestion there is nothing more terrible than the rebellion of a sheep mrs gabriel recalled this remark of balzac's when tempest proving himself worthy of his name swept her in wrath from his study pratt was quite another specimen of humanity a neat dapper suave little man undersized yet perfectly proportioned he had black hair black eyes and a clean shaven face which constantly wore an expression of imperturbable good humour his dress was too neat for the country a blue serge suit white spats on brown boots a panama hat gloves and what he was never without a smoothly rolled umbrella spick and span he might have stepped out of a glass case and this was his invariable appearance no one ever saw pratt unshaven or untidy he had been everywhere had seen everything and was a most engaging companion never out of temper and never bored but for all his smiling ways the villagers held aloof from him wishing to break down their barrier of prejudice the sharp little american had attached himself to the vicar during the good man's usual morning walk he thought that such a sight might dispose the villagers to relent i shall not vary my usual walk remarked mr tempest positively we will stroll through the village return to the chapel and then mr pratt i hope you will lunch with me delighted if it will not put miss sybil out no no my wife is always prepared for chance visitors answered the vicar quite oblivious to the fact that the late mrs tempest was resting in the churchyard ha this is mrs jeal how do you do mrs jeal mrs jeal was in excellent health and said so with a curtsey a dumpy rosy faced woman was mrs jeal with a pair of extremely wicked black eyes which snapped fire when she was angered she had a temper but rarely displayed it for it suited her better to gain her ends by craft rather than force fifteen years ago she had appeared from nowhere to settle as a midwife in colester contrary to their usual fashion the villagers had taken her to their bosoms this was owing to the clever way mrs jeal had of managing them and to her knowledge of herbs she had cured many sick people whom the doctor had given up and consequently was not looked upon with favour by dr james who had succeeded to the family practice but even he could not be angry at rosy laughing mrs jeal though i don't like her confessed dr james the devil looks out of her eyes dangerous woman very dangerous pratt had no chance of proving this remark of the doctor's to be true for mrs jeal never looked at him she kept her wicked eyes on the kindly vicar and smiled constantly punctuating such smiles with an occasional curtsey pearl is not with you said mr tempest no bless her poor heart cried mrs jeal she is up at the chapel her favourite place is the chapel as your reverence knows she might have a worse place to haunt mrs jeal poor soul poor mad innocent child do you call eighteen years of age childish mr tempest asked the woman no no i speak of her mind her poor weak mind she is still a child i beg of you to look after her mrs jeal we must make her path as pleasant as we may then i beg your reverence will tell that barker to leave her alone barker barker ah yes the sexton of course worthy man mrs jeal sniffed he won't let her stay in the chapel she said tut tut this must be seen to poor pearl is god's child mrs jeal so she has a right to rest in his house yes yes i'll see to it good day mrs jeal the woman dropped a curtsey and for the first time shot a glance at pratt who was smiling blandly a nervous expression crossed her face as she caught his eye the next moment she drew herself up and passed on crossing herself pratt looked after her still smiling then hurried to rejoin the vicar who began to explain in his usual wandering way a good woman mrs jeal a good woman he said for some years she has had charge of pearl darry whom she rescued from her cruel father is that the insane girl said pratt idly do not talk of one so afflicted in that way mr pratt pearl may not be quite right in her head but she is sane enough to conduct herself properly if the fact that she is not all herself reached portfront the principal town of the county it is possible that the authorities might wish to shut her up and that would be the death of pearl no no said the good vicar let her have a fair share of god's beautiful earth and live to a happy old age in this quiet place we can afford one natural like the village idiot we read about in scotch tales said pratt just so mr pratt in waverley there is such a one pearl darry is quite harmless and really has a very beautiful nature mrs jeal is much to be commended for her charity she looks a charitable woman said the american but whether he meant this ironically or not it is hard to say the women of colester were mostly lace workers and toiled at this fairylike craft while their husbands worked in the fields below during three seasons the mountain men as they might be called ploughed the meadow land sowed the corn and helped to reap and harvest it in the winter they returned to live on their earnings and take a holiday but the women worked all the year through and colester lace was famous as the vicar and pratt walked down the street at the door of every house sat a woman with her pillow and pins dexterously making the filmy fabric which was destined to adorn the dress of many a london beauty they were mostly serious looking and some even grim but all had a smile for the vicar although they pursed up their lips when they saw the good natured face of pratt most unaccountable this dislike they had for the american he was rather annoyed by his pronounced unpopularity i must really do something to make them like me he said much vexed tut tut replied the vicar liking will come in good time mr pratt it takes some years for them to fancy a stranger i was an object of distrust to them for quite three now they are devoted to me and have you been here long about forty years said tempest i have buried many and christened most we have no methodists in colester mr pratt everyone comes to church and worships according to the rites of the anglican communion as is fit and proper i suppose you are a prosperous community on the whole so so nothing to complain of the lace made here by those clever fingers sells well in london and even abroad then the men earn a fair wage in king's meadows mrs gabriel looks after the few poor we have amongst us on the whole we have much to be thankful for mr pratt thus talking the good vicar led his companion round by the mouldering walls where they could look down on to the plains after a glance they re entered the town and walked through the cobbled stoned streets between the quaint high roofed houses everywhere the vicar was greeted and pratt frowned upon he was quite glad when they descended from the village through the old gate and after walking along the neck which was the fashionable part of colester began to climb up towards the chapel a most delightful spot said pratt politely but i guess the folk don't cotton to me i must make them freeze on somehow chapter ii the crusaders' chapel the church dedicated to st gabriel the messenger was enshrined in a leafy glade no churlish wall marked the limits of the sacred ground and from the ancient building a soft green sward stretched on all sides to the circle of oaks which sheltered it from the rude winds in this circle were two openings counter to each other the lower one admitted those who came from colester into the precincts the upper gave entrance to a larger glade in which the dead had been buried for centuries this also was without a wall and it was strange beyond words to come suddenly upon an assemblage of tombstones in the heart of a wood from this sylvan god's acre a path climbed upward to the moor and passed onward for some little distance until it was obliterated by the purple heather then for leagues stretched the trackless treeless waste to the foot of distant hills of no great size the chapel was an architectural gem built in the form of a cross a square tower rose where the four arms met and this contained a famous peal of bells the grey stone walls were carved with strange and holy devices lettered with sacred texts in mediaeval latin and here and there were draped in darkly green ivy the sharp angles of the building had been rounded by the weather the stones were mellowed by time and nestling under the great boughs of the oaks it had a holy restful look like a prayer made visible said mr tempest with his companion he had paused at the entrance to the glade so as to enjoy the beauty of the scene round the chapel swept the swallows pigeons whirled aloft in the cloudless blue sky from the leafy trees came the cooing of doves and the cawing of rooks could be heard all the wild life of the wood haunted the chapel and the place was musical with forest minstrelsy as the beauty of scene and sound crept into their hearts the vicar quoted spenser's lovely lines a little lowly hermitage it was downe in a dale hard by a forest side just so said pratt in the hard unromantic way of the twentieth century it's the kind of church you see in pictures the church in which sir percival met sir galahad replied tempest the american felt the influence of the place despite the material faith which he held there was a vein of romance in his nature which had been buried beneath the common place and selfish but in this holy solitude at the door of the shrine his spiritual self came uppermost and when he stood bare headed in the nave his talkative tongue was silent the influence of the unseen surrounded him and like moses he was inclined to put off his shoes for this is holy ground murmured his heart glancing at his companion tempest was surprised to see his usually pale and calm face working with emotion and covered with blushes you are unwell mr pratt he asked in a low tone befitting the place the man stammered no that is i feel that well no matter he controlled himself by a powerful effort and laughed tempest was not shocked he was shrewd enough to see that the merriment was artificial and designed to cloak a deeper feeling but the laughter was reproved in a most unexpected fashion the joy of the profane is as the passing smoke said a high sweet voice pratt started in surprise and looked around he saw the jewelled windows shining through the dim twilight of the church the white cloth on the altar and the glimmer of a silver crucifix in the faint light of tall candles but who had spoken he could not guess as no one was in sight mr tempest however had recognised the voice is that you pearl he called out softly from behind the altar emerged a girl of eighteen though in looks and stature she was a child she was small and delicately formed and on her thin white face there was a vacant look as of one whose wits were astray no intelligence shone through her dark eyes but a mystical light burned in their depths like kilmeny she had been to fairyland and had seen things which had lifted her above the common lot of mortals therefore upon her face there shone the light that never was on sea or land and curiously enough she was dressed in a green gown the fairy's colour round her straw hat was twisted a wreath of oak leaves when she appeared her arms were full of flowers you are decorating the altar pearl said the vicar kindly i am making ready the house for the master's coming replied the girl in her silvery voice but he will abide here but a little time she pointed to the groined roof of black oak that shuts out his home said pearl reverently and he loves not to dwell in darkness darkness and light are the same to him pearl but go on with your work my child you have beautiful flowers i see i gathered them in the woods before dawn when the dew was yet on them and see i have got these mosses to put into the pots the flowers will be quite fresh to morrow for morning service then they will die added the girl heaving a sigh die as we all must to rise again in the light of heaven child pearl shook her black locks and turning back to the altar began dexterously to arrange the flowers when passing and re passing she never forgot to bend the knee pratt observed this is she a roman catholic mr tempest smiled she does only what i have taught her he said i am what is called high church mr pratt and believe in a beautiful ritual to the service of god we should bring all lovely things and perform all solemn acts of humility and reverence that said tempest pointing to the white covered altar is a symbol of the unseen power and so those who approach it should acknowledge its solemn meaning pratt shrugged his shoulders the vicar was talking of things too high for his comprehension he looked at the mad girl decorating the altar i suppose the villagers think a great deal of this church he said it is the most precious possession we have replied tempest reverently and it is all that remains to us of the beautiful and sacred things created by the faith of our forefathers there were many vessels for the altar mr pratt but these were melted down by the gabriel who fought for the first charles in order to help his king i would we had a communion service as beautiful as this shrine and mr tempest sighed the remark gave pratt an idea he wanted to obtain the goodwill of the villagers seeing he had come amongst them to pass his days in peace if they loved their church so much they would approve of anyone who helped to decorate it i am not rich he said slowly and i can't give you a whole service such as you want but i should like to present this chapel with a communion cup i have in my travels collected many beautiful things mr tempest amongst others a golden cup of roman workmanship which i obtained in italy it is a splendid example of the jeweller's art and would look well on that table on the altar corrected tempest wincing at the sound of the word which he connected with the low church party it is more than good of you mr pratt we must talk the matter over i do not accept gifts lightly especially for the service of the church but come let us look at the tombs then we can go to luncheon pratt said no more but fully made up his mind that the cup of which he spoke should figure on the altar he had a vague kind of idea that he could buy repentance if he gave so splendid a present if the vicar proved difficult to deal with he resolved to ask for mrs gabriel's help as the lady of the manor she could insist upon the acceptance of the offering there was no reason why tempest should refuse it but pratt knew that the old man was as he phrased it queer and one never knew what objection he might make if he thought that the cup was given only to secure the goodwill of the parish he would certainly refuse it a gift made in such a spirit could not be accepted by the church meanwhile he examined the tombs of the crusading gabriels which he had seen often before but the vicar made the present visit more acceptable by recounting the legends connected with each recumbent figure the tombs were three in number and occupied what was called the ladye's chapel their sides were richly blazoned with the gabriel crest and with decorations of scallop shells to denote that those who rested below had been to the holy land the figures of the brave knights were cross legged and their hands rested on the pommels of their huge swords considering the lapse of time they were in a wonderful state of preservation pratt looked upon them with a sigh and the vicar inquired the reason of his sadness i was thinking of the glory of having such ancestors said pratt and mr tempest noticed that his yankee twang and mode of expressing himself had quite disappeared i would give anything to come of such a line to have a dwelling that had been in the possession of my race for centuries and to have traditions which i could live up to i am a lonely man mr tempest he added with some pathos no one cares for me i never had a home or a family or a position in the world all my life i have had to fight for my own hand and for years i have been a rolling stone money yes i have made money but i would give it all and he pointed to the crusaders if i could call those my ancestors mr tempest looked surprised i did not expect to hear such views from the mouth of a republican he said for as you are an american i presume you hold by the political faith of washington i don't hold by anything in particular replied pratt recovering himself as they left the chapel i am unfettered by sectarian prejudices you can call me a cosmopolitan mr tempest but we can talk of these things on some other occasion you must come to see me i have furnished the nun's house and have got out my collection of rare and curious things will you and miss tempest dine with me next week i rarely go out replied the vicar however i will see what sybil says if she is willing i will come with pleasure oh miss tempest will be willing said pratt significantly leo haverleigh is coming to dine also they are very good friends said the vicar simply no thought of what pratt meant entered his mind at the vicarage they were met by sybil and the curate who had been talking to her about parish affairs for the greater part of the morning at once raston drew aside his ecclesiastical superior and the two went into the library leaving sybil to entertain the american she was not averse to doing this as she liked mr pratt and his merry conversation having recovered from the emotion caused by the atmosphere of the chapel the man was more pronouncedly yankee than ever he described his walk with the vicar and repeated his invitation to dinner mrs gabriel and mr haverleigh are coming he said and i shall also ask sir frank hale and his sister sybil smiled on hearing that leo was to be present but her brow clouded over when she heard about the baronet and miss hale she did not like that young woman and pratt knew the cause it was not unconnected with leo he was the prize for which these young ladies strove miss hale was very much in love with the young man and so was sibyl but he cared more for the vicar's daughter than for miss hale the two girls guessed each other's feelings and disliked one another accordingly this might not have been proper but it was eminently human however sibyl was too much a woman of the world to show pratt what she felt and she accepted his invitation calmly enough i shall be delighted to come she said but i can't answer for my father oh i have something to lure him said pratt easily and i think you will be pleased also miss tempest and thereupon he told the girl of his proposed gift the cup is over a thousand years old he explained it belongs to the time of the caesars from all i have heard of them said sybil bluntly i don't think a vessel of their manufacture ought to serve for a christian ceremony on the contrary the cup will be sanctified by being put to such a good use said pratt and you can set your mind at rest miss tempest i got the cup from the church of a little italian town where it served for a chalice it has been used in the service of the romish church for ages in that case i am sure my father will be delighted to accept it he is anxious to get some vessels for the chapel altar it is very good of you to give the cup mr pratt not at all it is better put to such use than in my collection however you will see all my curios when you come mr haverleigh has already seen them he told me about them yesterday i only hope mr haverleigh will be here next week he said something about going away why is he going away pratt fixed his keen eyes on the girl i think he is in trouble that is added sybil hastily i gathered as much but don't say i told you anything mr pratt ah she broke off suddenly here are my father and mr raston pratt cast another sharp glance at her he guessed that something was wrong with leo and that the young man had told her of his trouble he wondered if the two were engaged when they were thus confidential pratt took an interest in leo as he had known him for some years and rather sympathised with his outbursts of youthful folly he thought that marriage would steady the lad's somewhat volatile nature but he could not make up his mind as to whether miss hale or miss tempest was the best wife for him however it was useless for pratt to worry over this as he recognised very clearly in the first place it was none of his business and in the second leo would certainly choose for himself i am giving a house warming mr raston said pratt during luncheon and i should like you to come to dinner next thursday i suppose in this arcadian spot it is not necessary to give written invitations i accept with pleasure replied raston quite ignorant that pratt wished to enlist him on his side in getting the vicar to accept the cup but as to written invitations what do you say miss tempest oh those are most necessary laughed sybil we are very particular in this part of the world i am an american you see miss tempest and i don't know your english way of doing things but the invitations shall be written in due form i guess it is as well to humour the prejudice of folks if you wish to be popular said the vicar you must do so here as i intend to die in this part of the world i must get on with the crowd somehow i am not accustomed to be shunned and that is what your people here are doing oh no cried sybil much distressed they are only waiting to know you better mr pratt in a year you will be quite friendly with them i'm friendly with them now said pratt dryly it is they who hold off we are slow to make friendships here said raston but when we do accept a friend we stick to him always you are a native of these parts mr raston i was born and bred here it is i who am the stranger put in mr tempest and it was a long time before my parishioners took to me you are adored now papa said sybil with a bright glance and someone else is adored also put in pratt sybil flushed at the compliment she thought it was in bad taste after a time the conversation turned on pearl darry and raston who was deeply interested in her gave them some insight into the girl's mind she does not care for churches built by hands he said if she had her way she would take the altar into the middle of the moor and worship there i think she feels stifled under a roof ha said pratt with a swift glance remembering mrs jeal is she of gipsy blood she looks like it no her dark complexion comes from highland blood explained sybil her father peter darry was a stone mason he is dead now died through drink while working in perth he married a farmer's daughter they came back here and pearl was born then her mother died and her father treated her badly mrs jeal rescued her and peter fell over a cliff while drunk mrs jeal is a good woman said tempest mechanically do you endorse that statement miss tempest sybil looked at pratt who had spoken i think mrs jeal was very good to take charge of pearl she said evasively whereat pratt smiled to himself he saw that sybil did not like the woman and privately admired her insight mr pratt was destined to deliver all his invitations verbally on his way home after the vicar's luncheon he met with a rider on a roan horse this was a fair handsome young man with a clear skin a pair of bright blue eyes and a sunny look on his face he had a remarkably good figure and rode admirably horse and man made a picture as they came up the road pratt waved his hands and the rider pulled up how are you this morning haverleigh leo laughed he did not wear his heart on his sleeve and if he was worried as sybil averred he did not show his vexation i am all right he replied with a smile who could help being all right in this jolly weather and how are you mr pratt i am busy responded the american gravely i have been lunching with the vicar and now i am going home to write out invitations for a dinner at my new house will you ask me mr pratt i have asked miss tempest and i want you to come leo laughed also he flushed a trifle it is very good of you he said and who else will be at your house warming mrs gabriel mr raston miss hale and her brother oh leo looked annoyed at the mention of miss hale i am not sure if i shall be able to come he said after a pause no pratt's tone was quite easy miss tempest said something about your going away but i hope you will put that off my dear fellow pratt smiled meaningly you can depend upon me it is not the first time i have helped you haverleigh made no direct response but sat on his saddle in deep thought i'll come he said at length and rode off abruptly i thought you would murmured pratt with a bland smile he knew more about leo haverleigh than most people in colester chapter iii the lady of the manor haverleigh's face did not continue to wear its sunny expression after he left the american he frowned and bit his moustache and in the annoyance of the moment spurred his horse full speed up the castle road only when he was within the avenue and nearing the porch did he slacken speed for his mother so he called her might be looking out of some window if so she would assuredly accuse him of ill using his horse mrs gabriel rarely minced matters in her dealings with leo he was never perfectly sure whether she loved or hated him mindful of this he rode gently round to the stables and after throwing his reins to a groom walked into the castle by a side door as he had been absent all the morning he was not very sure of his reception and moreover he had eaten no luncheon the butler informed him that mrs gabriel had asked that he should be sent to her the moment he returned at once leo sought her on the south terrace where she was walking in the hot june sunshine he augured ill from her anxiety to see him a memory of his debts and other follies pardonable enough burdened his conscience here i am mother he said as he walked on to the terrace looking a son of whom any woman would have been proud perhaps if he had really been her son instead of her nephew mrs gabriel might have been more lenient towards him as it was she treated him almost as harshly as roger ascham did lady jane grey of unhappy memory it is about time you were here she said in her strong stern voice as you are so much in london i think you might give me a few hours of your time when you condescend to stay at the castle leo threw himself wearily into a stone seat and played with his whip this was his usual greeting and he knew that mrs gabriel would go on finding fault and blaming him until she felt inclined to stop his only defence was to keep silent he therefore stared gloomily on the pavement and listened stolidly to her stormy speech no reverence for women after all i have done for you clownish behaviour etc some wit had once compared mrs gabriel to agnes de montfort that unpleasant heroine of the middle ages the comparison was a happy one for mrs gabriel was just such another tall black haired iron faced amazon she could well have played the role of heroine in holding the castle against foes and without doubt would have been delighted to sustain a siege the present days were too tame for her she yearned for the time when ladies were left in charge of the donjon keep while their husbands went out to war more than once she fancied that if she had lived in those stirring times she would have armed herself like britomart and have gone a disguised knight errant for the pleasure and danger of the thing as it was she found a certain relief in the power she exercised in colester her will was law in the town and her rule quite feudal in its demand for absolute obedience report said that the late john gabriel had not been altogether sorry when he departed this life undoubtedly he was more at rest in the quiet graveyard near the chapel than he had ever been before mrs gabriel mourned him just as much as she thought proper she had never professed to love him and had married him as she calmly admitted in order to become mistress of the grand old castle besides gabriel had always hampered her desire to rule as he had sufficient of the old blood in him to dislike being a cypher in his ancestral home consequently husband and wife quarrelled bitterly finally he died gladly enough and the amazon had it all her own way it was about two years after his death that leo came to live with her and everyone was amazed that she should behave so kindly towards the child of her dead brother whom as it was well known she hated thoroughly however leo came and from the moment he entered the house she bullied him spirited as the boy was he could not hold his own against her stern will and powers of wrathful speech when he went to school and college he felt as though he had escaped from gaol and always returned unwillingly to colester mrs gabriel called this ingratitude and on every occasion brought it to his mind she did so now but even this could not induce leo to speak he declined to furnish fuel to her wrath by argument or contradiction this also was a fault and mrs gabriel mentioned it furiously can't you say something she cried with a stamp is it any use your sitting there like a fool what explanation have you for me to what asked leo wearily the question had been asked so often you have accused me of so many things then why do you do wrong i am talking of those debts you have incurred in london you gave the list to me before you went out riding i know mother i thought it best to avoid a scene but it seems there is no escape when you have quite done perhaps you will let me speak you shall speak when i choose rejoined mrs gabriel fiercely all i ask you now is how comes it that your debts run up to three hundred pounds i allow you that income you should make it do perhaps i have been a little foolish began leo but she cut him short a little foolish indeed you have behaved like a fool as you always do what right have you to be extravagant are you in a position to be so have i not fed and clothed and educated you you have done everything that a charitable woman could have done you mean that a mother could have done had you been my own child you might have been kinder to me finished the young man mrs gabriel stared aghast at this speech and at last broke out furiously had you been my own child you would have been a stronger man not a weak fool squandering money and defying your benefactress you ought to be ashamed of yourself i am replied leo bitterly ashamed that i have endured this humiliating position for so long i was only a child when you brought me here and had no voice in the matter yet out of gratitude i have borne with your injustice and injustice broke in mrs gabriel what do you mean my meaning is not hard to gather mother you have never been just to me and the bread with which you have fed me has been bitter enough to swallow do you think that i can go on listening to your angry words without a protest i cannot my position is not of my own making and since you find me a burden and an ungrateful creature the best thing will be to put an end to the position indeed sneered the woman and how do you propose to do that you are quite unable to earn your own living oh there is one way of doing that replied leo grimly it does not need much education to be a soldier a soldier screamed mrs gabriel yes i made inquiries while i was in london as i knew very well what welcome you would give me it is my intention to volunteer for the war you'll do nothing of the sort i beg your pardon i have made up my mind then i shall have nothing more to do with you that is as you please mrs gabriel you are my aunt and i suppose you have the right to support me out of charity at any rate you have no right to keep me here and taunt me all the time with my inability to keep myself again i say that the position is none of my making however i intend to relieve you of the burden of a useless man next week i shall enlist then you will be well rid of me mrs gabriel gasped i forbid you she cried with a stamp i am afraid i must decline to accept the command said haverleigh with great coolness you have told me often enough that i am a beggar and a loafer you shall do so no longer as to my debts i shall see to them myself you need not pay them nor need you continue my allowance i earn my own bread from this moment how dare you leo do you not owe me something no you have cancelled all obligation by the way in which you have treated me everything you have done has been done grudgingly if you did not intend to behave as a woman should why in heaven's name did you not leave me to be dependent on strangers they could scarcely have been more harsh to me than you have been but this is the end of it i relieve you from this hour of the burden you complain of take care i intended you to be my heir and i decline to accept further favours at your hands said leo proudly for what you have done i thank you but i do not care to accept an inheritance as a favour now you know my intentions and i shall not change them mrs gabriel raged for twenty minutes without making the least impression on the young man he was determined to put an end to the position and she found that she could not longer dominate him by her wrath then mrs gabriel became aware that she had driven him like a rat into a corner and that like a rat he had turned to fight for reasons best known to herself she did not wish him to leave her forthwith she abandoned her tyrannical attitude and took refuge in the weakness of her sex considering her boasting this was ironical it is cruel of you leo to behave thus to a woman who loves you leo leaning over the parapet shrugged his shoulders and replied without looking round that is just the point he said you really do not love me no not one little bit i do see how i have looked after you all these years and made me feel that i was a pauper all the time he retorted but is it necessary to go over all the old ground i have made up my mind you shall not enlist i tell you i shall the two faced one another both pale and both defiant it was a contest of will and the weaker would be sure to yield in the long run mrs gabriel quite expected that her adopted son would give in as he had often done before but this time she found to her surprise that he declined to move from his attitude of defiance seeing that she was beaten she suddenly calmed and proceeded to win the necessary victory in another and more crafty way sit down leo she said quietly it is time we had an explanation you are behaving very badly and i must request you at least to listen to me haverleigh had been doing nothing else for nearly an hour so this speech was a trifle inconsistent however he could not be brutal so with another shrug he resumed his seat all the same he was resolved in his own mind that no argument she could use should make him alter the course he had determined upon leo could be obstinate on occasions i do everything i can for your good said mrs gabriel in a complaining tone yet you thwart me at every turn then she proceeded to recount how she had sent him to eton to oxford how she had permitted him to go to london and allowed him money and how he had behaved foolishly it was at this point the young man interrupted her i admit that i have been foolish but that comes from want of experience you can't expect me to have an old head on young shoulders don't interrupt me please said mrs gabriel sharply now that you have sown your wild oats i want you to come here and take your position as my heir i am no longer so young as i was and i need someone to help me in administering the estate besides i want you to marry leo rose from his seat you wish me to marry said he then after a pause he proceeded sarcastically and i suppose you have chosen me a wife just so said mrs gabriel coolly i want you to marry miss hale not if there was not another woman in the world that's all nonsense leo she has a good dowry and she is an agreeable girl you shall marry her i don't love her protested leo no matter she loves you her brother told me so and i am woman enough to see that she is deeply attached to you i won't marry her said leo doggedly i have a right to choose a wife for myself and miss hale is not my choice ah then what i have heard is true what have you heard he demanded with a dangerous look in his blue eyes mrs gabriel was going too far that you are in love with sibyl tempest that is true she is a beautiful and charming girl and a beggar burst out mrs gabriel savagely her father has nothing beyond his stipend and that he spends on books when he dies she will be a beggar if you married her she would bring you no dowry she will bring me herself replied haverleigh and that is good enough for me i love sybil with my whole soul and how do you propose to keep her sneered mrs gabriel not as the heir to your property said leo wrathfully in some way or another i shall make my way in the world sybil is quite willing to wait for me we are engaged ha you seem to have settled the whole matter we have and it will not be unsettled by anyone the young man looked so determined there was such fire in his eye such a firmness about his closed mouth that mrs gabriel felt that she was beaten for the moment she retreated gracefully but by no means gave up her point by nagging at leo she might be enabled to bring about things as she wished well have it your own way she said rising i have said my say and you are behaving abominably i am sorry you should think so but i really cannot submit to this life any longer you quite understand that next week i go to london as you please mrs gabriel was outwardly calm but inwardly furious i hope you have well considered what you are doing i have my mind has been made up for some time in that case leo we may as well part good friends i shall pay your debts and fit you out now do not contradict me if you have any feeling of gratitude you will at least let me do this much haverleigh did not like the proposition as he felt that mrs gabriel was preparing some snare into which he might blindly fall however as he could not see his way to a refusal and moreover was weary of this bickering he merely bowed mrs gabriel had thus gained time and in some measure had secured the victory it remained to her to make the best use of it she was determined that leo should marry edith hale have you had luncheon leo she asked changing the subject no but i am not hungry now nonsense a big man like you come in and have something to eat at once as a refusal would only have meant another outburst leo accepted the inevitable and moved towards the door with his mother by the way he said i met mr pratt down below he intends to ask us to a house warming it might have been leo's fancy but he thought that mrs gabriel started at the mention of the name however there was an emotion in her hard voice as she replied i shall be rather glad to see the interior of his house leo it is said that he has the most beautiful things will he ask us to dinner yes hale and his sister are coming ah said mrs gabriel in gratified tones and the vicar and his daughter also raston the curate the church party said mrs gabriel disdainfully she had no love for tempest whom she regarded as half insane nor for sibyl who was too beautiful for womanly taste nor for raston who had frequently fought her on questions connected with parish affairs by the way said leo who had been meditating why has mr pratt settled in these parts i should think he found it dull mrs gabriel smiled contemptuously mr pratt is not a foolish young man like someone i know she said he does not find pleasure in the follies of the town for my part i think he is wise to settle here in his old age he is a delightful neighbour and a pleasant companion he is all that assented leo heartily he liked pratt you have known him for many years mother for ten or twelve replied mrs gabriel carelessly i met him in vienna i think and he called on me when i returned to london afterwards he came down here and fell in love with the place for years he has been a rolling stone but always said that when he settled down he would come to colester he is liked is he not leo he is more than liked he is immensely popular with our friends if not with the villagers you have done a good deed in introducing him to our dull parish i don't think mr pratt who has so many resources in himself finds it dull my dear however i shall be glad to accept the invitation to his dinner i should like to see him married indeed have you chosen him a wife also mrs gabriel laughed i thought he might take a fancy to sibyl tempest why he's old enough to be her father besides besides you love her finished mrs gabriel with a shrug well do not get angry leo i should like to see mr pratt marry sybil and you the husband of edith hale then everything would be right i don't think so at all commenced haverleigh in vexed tones but don't let us quarrel any more i have the greatest regard for pratt but i do not care to go the length of letting him marry the girl i love you know very little of mr pratt said mrs gabriel looking suddenly at the young man how then can you regard him so oh i have seen him often in town broke in leo sometimes when i was in difficulties and did not want to tell you pratt helped me with money asked mrs gabriel sharply of course with money but i paid him back mrs gabriel made no answer but rising suddenly passed out of the room and left leo eating his luncheon alone her usually calm face looked disturbed and her hands were restless leo's information had annoyed her what does pratt mean she asked herself can't he leave the boy alone after all these years i wonder she broke off and pressed her hand to her heart as though she there felt a cruel pain perhaps she did but mrs gabriel was not the woman to show it chapter iv the dinner party built on the lower slopes of the castle hill mr pratt's residence commonly known as the nun's house stood a little distance back from the highway which led down to king's meadows it was a plain rough stone building of great strength two storeys in height and with a high roof of slate gloomy in the extreme it was rendered still more so from its being encircled by a grove of yew trees which gave it a churchyard air not the kind of residence one would have thought attractive to a cheerful and dapper man like richard pratt but he had so he declared fallen in love with it at first sight and mrs gabriel always having an eye to business had only too readily granted him a seven years' lease she was delighted at the chance of securing a tenant as the house had been empty for a long time owing to its uncomfortable reputation there was not a man woman or child in colester that did not know it was haunted the name came from a tradition probably a true one that when the colester convent had been suppressed by henry viii the evicted nuns had found refuge in this dismal house a dozen of them in time they died and the mansion was inhabited by other people but queer sounds were heard strange sights were seen and it became known that the twelve nuns re visited the scene of their exile there never was a house so populated with ghosts and the tenants promptly departed others lured by a low rent came and after a month's trial departed also finally no one would stop in the ill omened mansion until mr pratt arrived he liked the place laughed at the gruesome reputation of the dwelling and announced his intention of making it his home ghosts laughed pratt with his cheery smile nonsense ghosts went out with gas besides i should rather like to see a ghost particularly of a nun i am partial to the fair sex i wonder then you never married said the person who had warned him against the house with the best intentions of course pratt looked at her she was mrs bathurst the gossip of the neighbourhood under half closed eye lids and smiled ah said he rubbing his plump white hands i have admired so many beautiful women dear lady that i could not remain constant to one which reason although plausible did not satisfy mrs bathurst but then she was one of those amiable persons always willing to believe the worst of people however pratt took up his abode in the chief colester inn and sent for cartloads of furniture while the house was being re decorated he took a deal of trouble to make it comfortable and as he was a man of excellent taste with an eye for colour he succeeded in making it pretty as well in six weeks the place was ready to receive him and up to the period of his walk with the vicar pratt had occupied it for another six without being disturbed by the numerous ghosts the colester folks quite expected to hear that he had been carried off like dr faust and were rather disappointed that he met with no ghostly adventure but then mr pratt as he said himself was not imaginative enough for spectres failing his leaving the house the gentry expected that he would entertain them and show his treasures for it was reported that he had many beautiful things but pratt was in no hurry he wanted first to study his neighbours in order to see who were the most pleasant in a surprisingly short time he got to know something about everyone and on the knowledge thus acquired he selected his guests in addition to those already mentioned he invited mrs bathurst and her daughter peggy the girl was pretty and the mother talkative so in pratt's opinion it paid to ask them there is no chance of an entertainment being dull if mrs bathurst has her legs under the table he said and this being reported to the lady she accused pratt of coarseness nevertheless she accepted the invitation not for worlds would mrs bathurst have missed a sight of re decorated nun's house besides it was her duty to go she supplied all the gossip of the neighbourhood anxious to see as much as possible of the house mrs bathurst was the first to arrive pratt in a particularly neat evening dress advanced to meet her and peggy with a smile he knew very well that her ungovernable curiosity had led her to be thus early i am glad to see you mrs bathurst he said genially pray sit down you are the first to arrive i always like to be punctual responded the lady nodding to her daughter that she also should be seated dear me how well this room looks i can see you have spared no expense i like to make myself comfortable mrs bathurst we only have one life i wonder you care to spend it in such a dull place as colester if mr bathurst were rich i should make him take me to london you would soon get tired of the roar of that city here peggy who was fair and pretty and fond of gaiety shook her blonde head vigorously i should never get tired of fun she said i could go to a dance every night and still want more ah miss peggy you are young and active well dear mr pratt you are not old said mrs bathurst flatteringly we must make you happy here i am sure you are quite an acquisition we must find you a wife i shall apply to you when i want one he said with a laugh but i guess i'm not made to run in double harness what odd expressions you use i daresay that comes from your being an american never mind you'll soon lose all americanisms here i look upon you as quite one of ourselves dear mr pratt the fact is that mrs bathurst wished to bring about a marriage between her daughter peggy and the newcomer he had been introduced by mrs gabriel so his social position was secure and if one could judge from the magnificent furnishing of the house he was a wealthy man that peggy herself should be consulted never entered her mother's head pratt guessed what mrs bathurst was after and chuckled he had no intention of having the good lady for a mother in law moreover he knew that peggy was in love with raston the curate nevertheless having a love of tormenting people and wishing to punish mrs bathurst he sighed cast a languishing look at peggy and allowed the mother to think that he might be guided by her wish seeing this the lady pushed her advantage vigorously and was getting on very well by the time the other guests arrived then after some desultory conversation dealing with the weather and the crops all went in to dinner the table was beautifully set out the linen was snowy white the silver and crystal of the best and the flowers which pratt had personally arranged were skilfully chosen and blended the women present were rather annoyed that a man should be able to manage a house so well for the dinner was one of the best that had ever been eaten in colester and the service was all that could be desired what was the use thought mrs bathurst of suggesting a wife to a man who knew so well how to dispense with one she could not have arranged things better herself and it was vexing that a mere man should be able to beat a woman on her own ground you have certainly made a very pretty place of it mr pratt said mrs gabriel when they returned to the drawing room i suppose you will live here for many a long day i hope to die here he replied smiling but one never knows i may take a fancy to resume my travels you are like ulysses put in the vicar you know men and cities and like ulysses i don't think much of either mr tempest come now cried leo laughing i never heard that ulysses was a cynic he was not modern enough said sybil who was looking particularly charming much to the anger of mrs gabriel who saw in her a man trap for her adopted son i don't think cynicism is altogether a modern disease remarked sir frank hale solomon had not much belief in human nature what could you expect from a man who had so many wives put in pratt in a dry voice the remark annoyed mrs bathurst it augured ill for her scheme to marry peggy a man who talked thus of women could never be brought to respect his mother in law while this conversation was taking place mrs gabriel kept a vigilant eye on leo whenever he tried to edge up to sybil she contrived to get in the way and finally by a dexterous move she placed him 'longside the baronet's sister edith hale was a tall raw boned thin girl with small pretensions to beauty or wit she had a freckled skin and red hair an awkward way of carrying herself and a silent tongue she was so deeply in love with leo that she followed his every movement with her eyes until he found her regard most embarrassing however leo to avert a storm when he returned home was obliged to show her every attention and strolled away with her into mr pratt's new conservatory sybil looked disappointed but controlled herself sufficiently to play an accompaniment for peggy raston turned over the leaves of the music and mrs bathurst with a glance at pratt settled herself to listen as to mr tempest he was moving round the room examining the objects of art in his usual near sighted way seeing everyone thus occupied mrs gabriel drew aside sir frank into a convenient corner the baronet was a pale faced hunchback lame creature with a shrewish expression and a pair of brilliant grey eyes he had been an invalid all his life and his temper had been spoilt thereby the only person in the world for whom he cherished the least affection was his sister in his eyes she was as beautiful as helen and as clever as madame de stael he knew that she was breaking her heart for leo and resented the young man's indifference and as hale had the spite of a cripple his resentment was not to be despised but leo did not know that frank said mrs gabriel addressing him thus familiarly as she had known him from his cradle i want to speak to you about leo it is time he was married nothing but marriage will steady him sybil tempest is ready enough to become his wife mrs gabriel snarled the little man why don't you speak to her because she is not your sister replied mrs gabriel coldly i do not intend that leo shall throw himself away on a penniless girl who has nothing but her face to recommend her edith has both brains and beauty leo does not see that said hale who implicitly believed in his companion he is infatuated with sybil i don't say a word against her he added hastily i want to marry her myself mrs gabriel looked with secret contempt on the deformed man and wondered how he could have the impertinence to think that any woman could take him for her husband however she was pleased to hear of this new complication if sybil could be induced to marry the baronet and from a worldly point of view the match was a good one she would be out of the way in despair leo might marry edith and thus all would be as mrs gabriel wanted she wished to move human beings as puppets to suit her own ends and never thought that she might be thwarted by the individual will of those with whom she played however she had an idea of how to entangle matters so as to carry out her schemes and commenced her intrigue with the baronet she knew he would help her both for his own sake and for the sake of his sister at the same time she moved warily so as not to make a false step it was no easy matter to deal with hale as she knew once or twice he had got the better of her in business i don't mind being candid with you said mrs gabriel softly it is my wish that leo should marry edith and i shall be delighted to help you to become sybil's husband it's easy saying but harder doing said hale snappishly sybil is in love with leo and the woman who admires apollo will not look upon caliban oh i am under no delusions respecting myself he added with a hoarse laugh i am not agreeable to look upon but i have money a title and a good position nine women out of ten would be content with these things i am afraid sybil is the tenth said mrs gabriel coldly however neither she nor leo know what is good for them help me to marry him to your sister and then sybil will fall into your arms do you think so i am certain of it how are we to manage asked hale after a pause you have some scheme it is in order to explain my scheme to you that i have brought about this conversation listen i am not pleased with leo he has been leading a wild life in town and is in debt to the tune of three hundred pounds humph said frank under his breath these apollos know how to waste money i shall see that edith's dowry is settled on herself and i shall tie up the gabriel property so that leo cannot waste it hale looked at her from under his bushy eyebrows you intend that he shall be your heir then assuredly if he does what i want him to do what is that he must marry edith and take up his residence in the castle no more gadding about no more wild living let leo be a respectable country gentleman and his future is secure have you explained that to him asked the baronet sharply no leo is a fool and infatuated with that girl i must force him to do what i want it is for his own good you must help both for the sake of edith and because it is your only chance of marrying sybil i'm quite ready to help you mrs gabriel go on mrs gabriel glanced round bent her head and spoke lower i intend to refuse to pay this three hundred pounds for leo there is no chance of his earning it for himself and he will soon be in serious difficulty now if you come forward as his old friend and i don't like lending money said hale who was something of a miser if you want to gain sybil and make your sister happy you must lend leo three hundred pounds when he is in your debt well the rest is easy hale nodded i see what you mean said he ponderingly the idea is not a bad one but leo humph three hundred pounds a large sum oh i will be your surety for it said mrs gabriel impatiently she did not want her plans upset by this miser but if you want to gain anything you must sacrifice something you love sybil with my whole soul said the cripple and flushed and your sister i would give anything to secure her happiness three hundred pounds will be enough said mrs gabriel coolly make leo your debtor and then you can deal with him he is so honourable that he will keep his word even at the cost of his happiness well hale reflected i will think of it said he cautiously as you please but remember that if i do not have this settled within the week i shall allow leo to marry sybil of course mrs gabriel had no such intention but she determined outwardly on this course to frighten the baronet it had the desired effect i will see to the matter he said hastily to night i will ask leo to come and see me it will all be arranged but three hundred pounds he winced and mrs gabriel smiled i will be your surety she said rising let me know when you have made leo your debtor come we must not talk any more here is mr pratt it was indeed the host who came to disturb them he wished to take the whole party round his house leo and edith returned from the conservatory the former looking bored the latter brilliantly happy sybil did not like this and glanced reproachfully at leo who immediately would have gone to her side but he was anticipated by hale help me to get round the house miss tempest he said pointing to his lame leg you must be my crutch sybil could not but assent and so leo found himself out in the cold peggy who approved of his love for sybil took his arm never mind she said softly i will manage to take sir frank away and leo gave her hand a grateful squeeze come all of you cried pratt cheerily the museum is open he led them through a series of rooms crammed with treasures there were valuable pictures pieces of rich tapestry exquisite examples of goldsmith's work and many other things of value mr pratt had a story for every object this he picked up in the great bazaar at stamboul that was a bargain obtained in an italian town the silver crucifix came from spain the lacquer work from japan apparently he had been all over the world and had made purchases in every part here was the evidence of his travels and his wealth before the longing eyes of mrs bathurst more than ever was she determined that peggy should become mrs pratt while pratt discoursed and the company exclaimed at the treasures displayed to their wondering eyes mrs gabriel maintained her haughty silence she surveyed all the beautiful things in a cold unemotional manner and kept an eye on the movements of leo he felt uncomfortable under her gaze and once or twice looked angrily at her but mrs gabriel met his indignant looks with a calm smile you must have spent a fortune on all this said hale inspecting a tray of antique coins what a collection i have been buying for years explained pratt smiling mine has been a varied life i was born of poor parents and had to make my own way in the world for years i worked in the states in south america and elsewhere to make money finally i secured a fortune in south africa and for the last ten years i have devoted myself to collecting these things they have been stored for years and now that i have a house of my own this is the first time i have been able to arrange them i am glad you are pleased we are more than pleased gushed mrs bathurst it is a most beautiful treat to see these lovely things and hear you talk about them what is this cup dear mr pratt ah said pratt taking it up this is the property of the vicar mine said mr tempest in mild surprise dear me mr pratt what do you mean it would take half my year's stipend to buy this it is the cup of which i spoke to you vicar pratt handed it to tempest and then turned to the group i wish to present this cup to the chapel mr raston he said and i hope that you and mr tempest will accept it on behalf of the town it is an old roman goblet and has been used for centuries as a communion chalice in an italian city i bought it many years ago is it not beautiful the cup was indeed an exquisite object of art of considerable size it was of pure gold the rim and the stem were set round with gems of great value and the outside was embossed with faces peering from out a tangle of flowers it had two handles formed of twisted snakes with ruby eyes and round its broadest part ran an inscription in latin the vicar held the goblet to the light and translated the inscription 'to the great god who maketh the heart joyful' he said then added dubiously does that refer to a pagan god or to the maker of all things if the cup is roman probably it is an inscription to bacchus said the curate a shadow on his face if so we cannot use it as a communion cup pratt laughed and raised his eyebrows at this scrupulous regard you can set your mind at rest he said the priest who sold it to me on account of the poverty of his parish church said that the inscription was inscribed during the middle ages it refers to the god of christendom in that case said the vicar beaming i accept the cup with pleasure and with many thanks it shall be consecrated and placed on the altar by the end of this week while the others were thanking and congratulating mr pratt an expression of relief might have been noticed on his face mrs gabriel who knew his every look wondered to herself why he appeared to be so pleased evidently he was thankful to be rid of the cup however she said nothing as she was a wise woman but added her congratulations to those of the others everyone will be delighted she said coldly such generosity is unusual in colester but her glance hinted unusual as regarded pratt he received the hint smilingly i hope it will make me popular said he i am weak enough to wish to be liked and hitherto i have not secured the goodwill of the people you will have it now said raston and particularly that of pearl darry she loves beautiful things for the altar and as she attends to the decorating of the chapel it will be a constant pleasure to her to keep this cup bright and spotless i hope it will be safe with her cried mrs bathurst these insane people are like magpies and steal anything glittering that attracts their weak fancies are you sure she will not take it away mr raston the curate was indignant pearl would no more do such a thing than take her own life poor soul he said she is devoted to the church religion so far as her own poor brain understands it is her one consolation she ought to be shut up said mrs gabriel there i differ from you said the vicar mildly she is not harmful enough to be placed in durance let her enjoy liberty and sunshine mrs gabriel it is little pleasure she has she seems to me harmless enough said pratt and if this cup will be an additional pleasure to her i am the more glad that mr tempest has accepted it i shall have it wrapped up vicar thank you be very careful mr pratt so beautiful an object must not be carelessly dealt with from which remark it will be seen that now the roman goblet was the property of the church it assumed quite a new value in the eyes of the priest formerly it was merely a beautiful example of the goldsmith's art now it was sacred after this the company repaired to the drawing room where mr pratt told stories until quite a late hour for colester never had there been so agreeable a host in the dull little provincial town and one and all confessed themselves charmed with their evening quite an acquisition repeated mrs bathurst as she departed mind you come and see me mr pratt peggy will never forgive you if you do not a foolish speech which sent poor peggy away covered with blushes but then mrs bathurst's zeal always outran her discretion as mr pratt stood at his door waving a hearty good bye to his guests he saw that hale was beside leo and overheard a remark come and see me in three days leo the baronet was saying i want to speak to you most particularly most particularly echoed pratt thoughtfully humph what's up now chapter v love's young dream the colester folk were certainly pleased that mr pratt had adorned their beloved chapel with so magnificent a gift they unbent so far as to smile when they curtsied or touched their hats but did not take him to their bosoms however pratt saw that he had made a step forward in their affections and professed himself well pleased rome was not built in a day said he philosophically mr tempest installed the cup on the altar where it glittered in front of the crucifix it was an object of wonder and reverence to the simple villagers and the vicar himself was no less pleased its weight the beauty of the workmanship and the splendour of the jewels filled him with joy and he came to regard the pagan vessel as it undoubtedly was as a kind of holy grail having made some such reference to it the sexton baker an inquisitive octogenarian wanted to know what the holy grail was forthwith mr tempest prepared a lecture compounded of mallory's prose work and tennyson's poetical interpretation this he delivered in the village schoolroom and had the sacred cup placed on the table before him so that his hearers might have the significance of the gift borne home to them pearl heard the lecture and so much of it as her poor wits took in led her to look upon the cup as the very vessel itself mentioned in the poem to pearl the pagan cup as frank hale called it was the veritable vessel from which the master had drunk at that last sad feast and no argument could shake this belief when she once got it into her head so ridiculous said mrs jeal sniffing i daresay mr pratt bought it in london he is clever at inventing stories whereupon pearl flew into such a rage that the elder woman never ventured to hint a doubt of the cup in her own queer way and that was none of the most righteous mrs jeal was fond of pearl it is true that she regarded her as a half baked natural but she would never let anyone but herself say so mrs jeal was superstitious and kept pearl in her humble cottage as a kind of talisman against evil probably she felt it necessary for her to have some pure and innocent thing beside her the colester people never thought of this they regarded mrs jeal as a hard working honest woman she was certainly all that and more what the more was mrs jeal never explained she was well able to hold her tongue meanwhile the cup stood on the altar and pearl frequently stared at it on her knees dreaming heaven knows what dreams as its beauty flashed in the sunlight she attended to her duties as usual and the vicar had no reason to complain that the decking of the altar suffered but the insane girl passed hours before the cup drinking in its lovely colour and beauty of form it was to her a kind of fetish and she resented it being touched even when mr tempest used it for the purpose for which it had been presented pratt hearing this laughed and was a little touched he was sorry for the girl and pleased that he had been the means of introducing a new element of beauty into her life one day while pearl was on her knees with clasped hands sybil entered the chapel she had come here to meet leo for owing to the vigilance of mrs gabriel a meeting was not easily arranged whenever leo and sybil were together they would be joined by mrs gabriel by frank hale or by edith it was no use resenting this addition to the company for the inconvenient third would never take the hint consequently leo met sybil by stealth and as those who interfered rarely came to the chapel save on sunday it was the chapel they chose for their meeting place certainly pearl was always haunting the shrine but she gave them no trouble although the day was warm pearl had draped a shawl of white chinese crape over her shoulders this was a present from mrs jeal who had many such beautiful things although she would never say how she came by them the girl still wore her favourite green dress and the straw hat which had a fresh wreath of oak leaves round it every day the wreath was renewed and some significance was attached to it by the wearer which was not understood by her friends with her eyes fixed on the cup and her hands clasped on her knee she knelt on the lower step of the altar with a wrapt expression and moving lips and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones she murmured and went on with the verse enumerating the gems pearl knew much of the bible by heart and frequently recited long passages to herself but like a parrot she could never be got to speak when she was wanted and few knew the extent of her knowledge sybil overheard the words and guessed that the poor creature applied them to the cup a strong ray of sunlight streamed in through a small plain glass window in the chancel it struck with a golden glory on the altar and in its burning light the cup flashed with many hues the gems with which it was adorned shot sparks of rainbow fire the green or the emerald the fiery red of the ruby the amethyst purple in colour as a ripe grape and above all the fierce flash of a diamond that was in front of the vessel immediately above the latin inscription sybil did not wonder that pearl had a passion for the cup it looked a singularly beautiful object glowing in the splendour of the sunlight and might well have been the holy grail as pearl thought it was what is it pearl she asked drawing near but speaking low so as not to disturb the girl for pearl was like a wild animal and shrank away even at the slightest sound and even as she spoke the sunlight passed away it is gone gone cried pearl rising with a wild look the master has withdrawn his presence i would that i could take it out where his sun would ever shine did you see the angels miss sybil what angels pearl in the beam of the master's glory they ascended and descended like the angels of jacob's dream from the holy cup a shining pathway went up to heaven and now it is gone the shining pathway will be there again at this same hour to morrow said sybil comforting the girl but it endures only for a little while sighed pearl oh why doesn't the master take his cup into the bright sunshine where it could grow warm and rejoice in the glory of day and the sun would make it glitter like a thousand fires nor would the moon withhold her light it is better here in this sacred place pearl the roof shuts out the light miss sybil and the girl looked at the great cup now dull and colourless like a dead thing only in the sunshines does the master put out his hand to grasp his cup it is not the real cup pearl said sybil incautiously how dare you say so shrieked the girl tearing herself away from sybil's grasp the vicar said it was the cup of the master i doubt you are one of the evil things its presence makes to fear and with an indignant look pearl moved swiftly down the aisle murmuring as she went at the door she broke into a jubilant chant and sybil gathered that she was recalling some lines of tennyson which the vicar had repeated in his lecture oh yet methought i saw the holy grail all palled in crimson samite and around great angels awful shapes and wings and eyes half singing half reciting she passed out of the door and brushed by leo who entered at the moment like a shadow she faded out of the church and left him staring after her but high and sweet in the distance rose her voice singing like a lark what's the matter with her now asked leo as sybil met him nothing much she has a belief that yonder cup is the veritable holy grail and when i suggested that it was not she grew angry but what a memory she has added sybil linking her arm within that of leo did you hear her recite tennyson's lines well she only heard them once before i daresay but she cannot read and those who can't read have always a marvelous memory but the wonder to me is that her poor cracked brain can hold anything i know she's mad about the grail as she called that cup mrs jeal told me that pearl expects the cup will some day be snatched up to heaven to be used there poor soul it is a sweet belief though murmured sybil then after a pause she drew leo into the side chapel where the crusaders were set stiffly on their tombs we are safe here leo no one will come sit down beside this pillar and let us talk we have much to say to one another and nothing very pleasant sighed leo as he sat down and slipped his arm round the girl's waist oh sybil how foolish i have been getting into debt and quarrelling with mrs gabriel it will end with my going away to the war indeed i intended to have gone this week only i could not leave you and besides here leo hesitated what is it she asked noticing that he looked nervous there is a chance of my debts being paid mrs gabriel no indeed at first she said she would pay now she has changed her mind but hale has offered to lend me the money sybil looked anxious i don't like that she said decidedly it is not like him to be so generous my dear said leo taking her hand you are too hard upon poor frank i have known him now for many years and it is reasonable enough that he should be willing to help an old playfellow it is not like him insisted miss tempest i hope he is not laying a trap for you leo he is spiteful enough to do that and when he has caught me in his trap sybil she shook her head it is easy laughing but i don't like your accepting a favour from that cross grained little man you are uncharitable my dear i don't want to be i am sure i am sorry poor sir frank is so afflicted but i really wish he had a sweeter nature besides her eyes fell and she began to play with a button on leo's coat he is i think too fond of me can anyone be too fond of you asked haverleigh not taking in the real significance of this remark you do not understand leo i mean that i think he intends to ask me to be his wife now don't be angry for i am not sure if he will it is only a kind of instinct i have that such is his intention haverleigh confident in his good looks and virile strength laughed good humouredly i am not angry my dear the idea of that wretched little creature thinking of marriage who is uncharitable now mr haverleigh the young man laughed fairly hit he said but really sybil i don't think you need trouble about hale no man of his build and weakness would insult a woman by asking her hand in marriage he is a queer little creature but for all his cross grained temper his heart is in the right place i am sorry for him and i feel his kindness in offering to help me to be sure he is well off but the kindness is all the same and what about his sister she is in love with you so mrs gabriel says responded leo coolly but that is all nonsense much the same as your suspicions of hale why the girl never opens her mouth to me she only looks and looks with her soul in her eyes it must be a dull soul then for i see no gleam in those eyes of hers you are most unsuspicious leo said sybil at length i have a kind of feeling that we are on the eve of some trouble have you noticed that until we found out this quiet spot mrs gabriel or sir frank and his sister always joined us i noticed that but it meant nothing leo paused and then continued i know that my mother wants me to marry edith but i told her plainly that i would not and she has agreed to let me have my own way that is not like her said sybil after a pause she always wants to have her own way i think she is beginning to find me one too many for her my love it is this way sybil i told her that if she went on treating me so badly i would enlist that frightened her and she has been kinder since i don't trust her no more than i do sir frank are you going to take this money as a loan i am but i hope to pay it back how are you going to manage oh pratt has promised to make it right with my mother he has a wonderful influence with her you know he has been her friend for years and she has great reliance on his judgment i told him all my trouble and he has promised to help me it is not the first time he has done so sybil several times last year he lent me money i know he is a kind man said sybil but leo i do wish you he stopped her mouth with a kiss i know what you are going to say was his half laughing half serious remark and indeed my love i am not worthy of you but now i am a man and i intend to put away all childish things by which i mean the follies of youth i have done nothing very wrong sybil indeed my wickedness has been of the mildest description i understood mrs gabriel to say that i was her heir and so i thought i had a right to spend money i overstepped the mark and i own my fault i should have been more sensible but indeed sybil it is difficult for a man brought up in luxury to know when to stop if my home had only been made more attractive to me i should never have behaved so foolishly but that page of my life is turned down now it will close with the payment of this three hundred pounds and henceforth i shall try and deserve your love that is right darling but don't you think it would be better to get mr pratt to see your mother and induce her to give you the money than take it from sir frank no my dear said leo decidedly if my mother thinks that i am able to pay the money myself she will be afraid lest she will lose me altogether and be more amenable to reason i have arranged it all with pratt hale is to lend me the money next week i pay my debts then i shall get him to speak to mrs gabriel does mr pratt know that sir frank proposes to lend you the money no i did not tell him that at frank's special request i merely said that i would put off paying the matter for a month in the meantime he will speak to my mother it seems all wrong said sybil with a sigh i can't help thinking that you are behaving foolishly i hope not sybil but i must manage mrs gabriel somehow i cannot have her treating me so badly sometimes she really seems to hate me when my debts are paid i shall look about and see what i can do to earn my own living i am half inclined to enlist in the yeomanry leo leo don't do that sybil seized his arm i should lose you my dear it is the only thing i am fit for my mother would not let me have a profession and i am not clever enough to make money i should have gone into the army long ago indeed it was my wish only mrs gabriel would not consent i think my father must have come of a fighting stock sybil as i feel so inclined to be a soldier the haverleighs were always simple country squires leo i have heard my father speak of them often there were no soldiers amongst them then i don't know where my aunt got her fierceness by the way sybil don't you get mixed by the many different ways i refer to that lady i call her my mother my aunt and very often mrs gabriel i think the last name suits her best said sybil she is such a hard woman still she has been kind to you leo i don't quite agree with you there he answered a trifle bitterly if she took me in she has made me feel my position no sybil i hope in some way to make a position for myself then mrs gabriel may be proud of me at present i am only an object of her charity let me go for a soldier my darling you must wait for a time leo entreated sybil if you are really bent upon enlisting i shall not try and dissuade you but oh how unhappy i shall be when you are in south africa come come you will never do for a soldier's wife is it not better for me to be fighting for my country than staying here eating the bread of idleness i am sure you would be prouder of me dead on the battlefield than to see me a hanger on here yes said sybil bravely i should in that case i shall enlist and after taking her in his arms he kissed her tenderly i shall be here for another week let us make the best of our time hand in hand they passed from the chapel but at the door they suddenly separated mrs gabriel was coming up the steps and cast a cold smile at the pair i want to see you leo when you can spare the time she said i will come with you now said haverleigh and you sybil i want to find pearl darry said miss tempest she is offended with me and i must make my peace with her good day mrs gabriel good day said mrs gabriel in her stiffest manner then as leo walked down the road beside her back to the castle she added i understand that you are engaged leo and without my consent i am sorry you should be vexed he said formally but i cannot sacrifice my life's happiness even for you bless the boy i don't want you to do that said mrs gabriel sharply and about this enlisting i intend to enlist mrs gabriel drew a long breath and walked on in silence for a few moments well she said at length i think it is about the best thing you could do your debts i shall see that they are paid said leo calmly oh indeed and where will you get the money from a friend mrs gabriel again became silent i don't think you are treating me altogether fairly leo i am willing to do whatever you think best mother but i am ashamed to live on your charity any longer however i promise you one thing i shall not enlist for at least a month mrs gabriel laughed silently many things might happen in a month chapter vi trouble still anxious to secure mr pratt for a son in law mrs bathurst resolved to make some return to his hospitality her husband had very little money and the lady was unable to give a dinner party on account of the cost also pratt had done things so well so she put it that she was unwilling to provoke comparisons nevertheless some sort of entertainment had to be given and after much reflection and many consultations with peggy it was decided that it should take the form of a picnic the scenery around colester was beautiful the weather was fine and the cost of an open air entertainment would be comparatively small mrs bathurst therefore issued cards we must make mr pratt one of ourselves said the energetic lady and although we cannot hope to vie with his luxury we can at least bestow what we have with liberal hearts what mrs bathurst had in the way of food was principally sandwiches the cheapest form of nourishment she could think of as she had decided that the picnic should take place on the moor where there were no roads it was not necessary to hire vehicles to convey the party to the scene of revelry a good brisk walk will give everyone an appetite said the hostess and the air will do us all good thus it came about that all those who had partaken of pratt's hospitality found themselves the guests of mrs bathurst her husband who characterised the picnic as foolery was not present by a dexterous arrangement the good lady contrived that peggy should find herself in the company of pratt the little man was as neat and dapper as ever and as peggy strolled beside him over the heather she could not but admit that he was a pleasant companion the principal meal of the day had been devoured and mrs bathurst's guests had been sent hungry away tea and a limited quantity of sandwiches were scarcely sufficient for appetites sharpened by the keen moorland air however there was nothing else and now the company split up into small parties wandered here there and everywhere peggy was with pratt he saw how mrs bathurst had manoeuvred to bring this about and resolved to make use of the opportunity in a way of which the schemer would not approve most beautiful place this miss peggy said pratt glancing round but i fear the company is not to your mind oh mr pratt how can you say that said poor peggy divided between a desire to keep him at a distance and to avoid giving offence to her mother i am very pleased to be with you well i don't know miss peggy i am not a parson you know peggy laughed and blushed her secret was everybody's property and it was well known in colester that she and raston were attached to one another even mrs bathurst knew but she was resolved to crush this affection before it grew too strong for her control as a matter of fact it had already passed that stage but mrs bathurst was not aware of that mr raston is quite happy with miss hale said peggy frankly she found pratt sympathetic and did not mind speaking freely to him and i think miss hale would rather be with young haverleigh said her companion but he is with miss tempest and with sir frank hale who is the inconvenient third miss peggy we are all at sixes and sevens i fancy even mrs gabriel and the vicar are badly matched however in a little time i shall ask mr raston to join us not on my account cried miss bathurst hastily i understand your mother would not be pleased mr pratt peggy bit her lip really mr pratt my dear young lady said pratt with a twinkle do you think that i flatter myself that a battered old man like myself is your choice no indeed although your mother would have it so like draws to like and if i can bring it about you shall be mrs raston no chance of that sighed peggy mr raston is too poor oh no he has three hundred a year of his own and it is more than probable that when mr tempest dies mrs gabriel will give him the living then why won't your mother consent she was not opposed to my engagement until until peggy hesitated until i arrived finished pratt set your mind at rest miss peggy i am not a marrying man i have seen too much of the world peggy laughed and looked at him his pleasant face was turned towards her and she saw on his cheek a mark she had never noticed before it was a tattooed star very small and placed just under the jawbone unless looked for very closely it was apt to escape notice but there it was and being so close to the man peggy saw it very plainly perhaps she saw it the more clearly because pratt held his head at a particular angle he noticed the curiosity in her eyes and flushed a trifle he knew what she was looking at i had that done in the south seas said pratt rubbing the star foolish thing to have had done but i was a reckless young sailor then and see here miss peggy he rolled up his sleeve that of the left arm immediately below the elbow there was a beautifully tattooed snake half red and half blue that was done in japan he said you seem to have been everywhere mr pratt i have that is why i have come down here to end my days in peace i want everybody hereabouts to like me you included miss peggy i do like you mr pratt protested peggy not of course like i understand well i shall speak to your mother about mr raston oh do not look so afraid miss peggy i know very well what i am about i have managed much more obstinate people in my time all you have to do is to look pleased as though you were delighted with me that will put your mother on the wrong scent harold will not like it objected peggy as they returned to join the others harold is mr raston i gathered that from your blush said pratt with a chuckle well leave it to me there is harold making signals what is up now mrs bathurst informed them as soon as they came within earshot come here at once peggy she screamed mr pratt come here mr raston is about to take a group with his kodak it will be a memorial of my picnic the american did not seem pleased for the moment his usually active tongue was silent and he seemed unwilling to form part of the group i do not care about having my likeness taken mrs bathurst he said but indeed you must in the group said the lady vigorously dear mr pratt do not spoil the little memorial of my picnic it can be taken without me mrs bathurst that would be the play of hamlet with the prince left out replied the lady gracefully mrs gabriel add your entreaties oh mr pratt will not listen to me said mrs gabriel severely i know him of old he can be obstinate when he chooses pratt laughed but gave her a sly look which made her wince strong woman as she was there was something about this artless good natured little man which made her turn white and draw her breath in quick gasps i consent to be taken said pratt withdrawing his gaze if i am permitted to arrange the group myself certainly said raston brightly he had been exchanging a few words with peggy arrange it as you please leo who had hale at his elbow ranged alongside the american you know where to place me he said softly and pratt nodded it was mainly for that reason that he wished to arrange the group the result of his efforts was that leo and sybil were together much to the wrath of the baronet and mrs gabriel the others pratt scattered anyhow and placed himself at the back raston did not approve of this you can hardly be seen mr pratt he said please come more forward pratt hesitated but catching sight of a cold smile on the face of mrs gabriel he gave her a defiant look and placed himself in the position indicated by mr raston's outstretched finger then the curate adjusted his kodak and took three pictures he also had to take a fourth as mrs bathurst wanted herself to be seen making tea surrounded by her guests to recall a happy happy day she explained you are fond of photography raston said pratt when this was over very i have taken pictures all round the place and the other day he took a picture of the cup you gave put in sybil i guess that's kind of him said pratt gnawing his lip i suppose he was addressing raston that you send copies of these to your friends indeed i do not replied the curate cheerily i take only a few copies and place them in an album certainly i have given a few to miss bathurst natural very natural said pratt gravely you must give me one of the group you took just now and without waiting for an answer he turned away somehow he seemed relieved to hear that the photographs were not likely to be sent round the country and all the time mrs gabriel who had listened to this conversation heard it with a cold smile she seemed rather pleased that pratt should be upset and upset he was a remarkable thing in so calm a man after a time leo and sybil slipped away and were some distance across the moor before their absence was noticed there was no chance of following them save in the most pointed manner so sir frank with a scowl devoted himself to his sister she was seated on the heather staring after leo with a despairing look frank patted her hand kindly he will come back edith he whispered no she replied quietly he will never come back sybil has taken him away for ever don't worry about me frank oh as to that retorted frank savagely i approve of that no more than you do if you want to marry leo i wish to make sybil my wife i am afraid neither of us will get our wishes said edith with a sigh we'll see about that muttered frank at all costs i'll stop that marriage sybil must become my wife mrs gabriel overheard him make your mind easy frank she said i can put an end to this she cast a look at pratt i could have done so long ago but for she stopped but for what mrs gabriel nothing nothing she said hastily a matter which does not concern you frank but it is time to adopt strong measures mr tempest she went to the vicar come for a stroll with me i wish to speak to you about parish matters asked the vicar rather nervously for he knew mrs gabriel's tongue and temper won't you speak to raston it is not about parish matters said mrs gabriel it is concerning your daughter and leo mr tempest looked up sharply indeed he said with quite a new note in his voice nothing wrong i trust i shall leave you to judge of that replied mrs gabriel come vicar and she carried the old man away hale started after them distrustfully what does she intend to do now he muttered i intend to take my own way in this matter and i don't trust her too clever by half meantime leo and sybil not thinking of the envy their happiness caused were walking slowly along every now and then they would turn and look at one another and smile the action seemed childish but those who are deeply in love are often nothing but children then they came to talk of their future when are you going away leo asked sybil i go to town next monday replied leo i start at seven o'clock for portfront and there take the steamer that leaves at ten and the money for your debts that will be all right frank has promised to give it me this week but the queer part is sybil that he will not give me a cheque why not she asked stopping abruptly i don't know some whim on his part he intends that i shall take it in sovereigns yes the whole three hundred pounds there is a treasure to travel with however i shall take it to london and pay it into my bank there then i can settle with my creditors by cheque does he give any reason why he wants you to take it in gold no but he is a queer chap although a kind one i must take the money as he chooses to give it but do you know sybil i believe hale has the instincts of a miser and likes to look at gold i should not be surprised if he had a chest of sovereigns in his house i expect that is why he gives me specie instead of a cheque or notes i don't like it at all said sybil decisively there you go with your distrust said leo good humouredly you will not make allowance for the queerness of poor frank never mind i will take the money as he chooses to give it when my creditors are paid i shall see about enlisting you have made up your mind to that fully mrs gabriel understands as much and i do not think sybil said leo bending down that you will seek to dissuade me sybil paused for a moment no she said at length and her voice was firm it is a good thing for you to take up the burden of life leo even if you die in south africa it will be better than that you should live on the charity of mrs gabriel i admire your spirit leo shook his head sadly don't admire anything about me dear he said long long ago i should have earned my own living i have been a fool too long but now sybil i intend to work my hardest for you i am sure to get my commission as there are plenty knocking about and when i return your father will consent to our marriage and mrs gabriel will forgive me i don't think my father would ever object leo said sybil he would not care if you had little money all he asks from anyone who marries me is that they come of a good stock he has much family pride you know then he will easily be satisfied with the haverleighs they have been established in the place down yonder for centuries i did not know though that he attached much value to pedigree sybil it is his one failing he would not mind if i married a pauper so long as my future husband had good blood in his veins the one thing he would not permit would be that i should marry what he calls a 'base born' man but of course there is no danger of that no i think my pedigree will satisfy mr tempest but it is strange that he should attach such value to race i'm not so sure of that said sybil slowly i have a great opinion of race myself leo but come she broke off there is my father waving to me i wonder what he wants to go home i expect mr tempest did indeed want to go home and moreover he seemed by no means anxious for the company of leo quite different to his usual self he was stiff and cold towards the young man mrs gabriel saw this and smiled not in vain had she adopted the stronger measures of which she had spoken to sir frank however she gave leo no time to talk to the vicar but took possession of him and threw him into the company of miss hale leo was obliged to talk to the girl for although she bored him greatly she was too unoffending a creature to hurt frank saw how dexterously mrs gabriel had managed and came up to her what have you been doing he asked in a low voice talking mr tempest over to my views about this marriage set your mind at rest frank leo will never become the husband of sybil now sure enough matters seemed to be quite in mrs gabriel's favour on arriving home mr tempest had a scene with his daughter and forbade her to think any more of leo had i known of this before it would not have gone so far said the vicar but i have been blind fortunately mrs gabriel has opened my eyes it must stop i am engaged to leo haverleigh said sybil firmly nothing of the sort retorted the vicar i won't have it i tell you i do not consider that leo is a fit husband for you and what is your reason father i decline to give it you later on i may do so but not now please do not argue sybil i won't hear a word you are neither to see leo again nor are you to talk to him i won't have it but father that's quite enough sybil not another word and as the girl knew of the rages into which her father was capable of falling she said nothing more at the time lest she might provoke one but this sudden change of front on the part of her easy going father bewildered her leo was also at his wits' end to understand the new state of things from the day of the picnic he never had a chance of seeing sybil alone nor was he asked as formerly to the vicarage mr tempest was coldness itself when they met and appeared to wish to see as little of him as possible leo asked mrs gabriel what was the meaning of these things but could get no answer she only laughed insultingly and said that mr tempest was of her opinion about this ridiculous marriage leo saw mr pratt and consulted him i guess you'd better leave it to me said pratt who was on the side of the lovers i'll bring mrs gabriel to reason but it is more the vicar that needs bringing to reason argued leo he has changed wholly towards me perhaps he has heard of your debts suggested pratt pondering what if he had he knows that i am not so wild as everyone tries to make out no it is something else i believe my mother has been saying something to him about me pratt looked up suddenly but his face did not change i'll see mrs gabriel he said calmly if she has said anything to the vicar likely to do you harm i'll get her to tell me i have known her for many years leo and she often takes my advice i know she has the very highest opinion of you pratt said the innocent leo whereat pratt chuckled i'll tell you what he said i'll speak to mrs gabriel about your debts at the same time no don't do that cried leo in alarm you will only weaken my position with her i want to settle these debts without her knowledge i can raise the money as i told you later on when she comes round i can get her to give me the sum and settle she will surely do that when she hears that i have enlisted i daresay in fact i'm sure she will said pratt with his queer smile who is going to lend you the money meantime i can't tell you that mr pratt said leo with dignity you might tell it to a worse person said pratt rather offended however keep your secret i'll do what i can don't be offended pratt indeed as soon as possible i'll tell you there there don't make a fuss over it he said testily i know you are not such a fool as people think you are and to tell you the truth leo if you can pay these debts independently of mrs gabriel i fancy she will think all the more of you i don't offer to help you myself because if she asks me i want to be able to say 'no' for reasons which i will explain later but i tell you what leo if when you get these matters settled and enlist mrs gabriel won't come round i'll give you the money myself to repay the loan and fit you out for south africa you are indeed a friend cried leo with emotion and the two men shook hands they understood each other very well but all this time leo was pining to get a sight of sybil it is true that he sometimes saw her in the distance but she was always with her father and he could not come near however it came about that sybil induced pearl to take a note to leo she explained in it that her father had taken a dislike to the marriage and that the only chance of things being arranged lay in leo going away for a time several notes passed between the lovers and then their kindly messenger fell ill but not before it was understood that sybil was to leave a note or so in a certain crack in the chapel wall which they could use as a post office and out of that subterfuge all the subsequent trouble arose pearl was really ill she was in the habit of wandering about at night and as the wet weather was coming she had been caught on the moor in a thunderstorm now she was laid up with a severe cold raston was particularly anxious about her leo met him one day and the curate was red with indignation it seemed he had good cause for it did you ever hear of anything so wicked haverleigh he asked what is the matter now why that poor mad child she is very ill as you know but is getting on all right dr james says she is well on the way to recovery now mrs jeal took it into her head that the girl was dying and has been frightening her with stories of eternal torment you know pearl always believed that she would go to heaven and be at the supper with the master as she calls our lord she never had any doubt now these gruesome stories of mrs jeal's have made her doubt if she will be saved in fact she believes now that unless the master gives her some sign she will be lost how cruel of mrs jeal said leo angrily oh i believe she did it for the best she is fond of pearl and kind to her but you know she came from the north and she holds to that gloomy calvinistic religion that has terrified so many people i gave her a good talking to and she has consented to leave pearl alone all the same she still holds that the child is a lost soul i have been trying to pacify the poor creature she is haunted by terrible fears show her the cup suggested leo she has such a belief in it as the holy grail that it may soothe her a good idea said the curate i will ask mr tempest about it but i cannot take it to her till monday to morrow i preach in the evening i hear you are going up to town on monday morning early when you next hear of me raston i may have enlisted and a good thing too said raston but that i am a clergyman i should have been a soldier good day come to church to morrow and to church leo went to see sybil in her pew he also went to the evening service on monday he departed for london but no one heeded his going the village was excited by a rumour that the cup had been stolen on hearing the report mr tempest went to the church it was true the cup was gone chapter vii a nine days' wonder ill news spreads like circles on water when a stone is thrown in barker the old sexton a white haired crabbed sinner was the first to discover the loss he had gone to the chapel at seven in the morning to make ready the church for early celebration and on going to the altar he had noticed that the cup was missing nothing else had been touched at once the old man had trotted off to see the vicar and in a quavering voice related what had taken place finishing with a hope that he would not be blamed for the loss you locked the chapel up last night asked mr tempest sorely distressed for indeed this was sacrilege and not a common robbery 'deed and i did replied barker sturdily and i took the key home with me my wife saw me place it on its nail just inside the door was the church door locked fast locked sir and all the windows fastened i went round the chapel to see if i could find any sign when did you leave the church last night barker at nine o'clock after i made everything right for the night it was after evening service if you mind mr tempest then i went home and put the key in its place my joan and i went then to a neighbour for a bit of supper we got home again about eleven and the key was still on its nail well sir said barker scratching his white locks i didn't look but it was there this morning so it could not have been taken away besides my joan locked the door of our cottage no one could have got in the cup was on the altar when you left the church last night on the altar where it ought to be but this morning it's nowhere to be seen i hope you don't think it's my fault sir no replied mr tempest i cannot see that you are to blame but this is a very serious matter barker i did not know that there was anyone in colester who would have committed such a crime it's terrible sighed the sexton and what that poor lass pearl will say i don't know she must not hear of it said raston who entered at the moment she thinks so much of the cup that in her present state of health its loss may do her much harm is she very ill raston yes sir much worse than she was last night but mrs jeal is giving her all attention and i have sent dr james but about this loss sir we had better go to the chapel raston and see with our own eyes followed by barker still protesting that it was not his fault the vicar and the curate went up to the church it was surrounded with a crowd of people for the news had spread quickly some looked in at the door but no one had ventured to enter as each one was afraid if he did an accusation might be levelled against him mr tempest told harris the local policeman to keep back the crowd and entered the chapel followed by his curate all was as barker had said there was the altar covered with its white cloth and with the withered flowers still in the vases the gilded crucifix was also there but not a sign of the cup it had vanished entirely tempest sighed a terrible thing for the man who stole it he muttered this is no common robbery raston let us examine the church the two went round it carefully but could find nothing for a long time likely to enlighten them as to the cause of the robbery then in the lepers' window a small opening at the side of the chancel raston discovered that some of the stones had been chipped i believe the church was entered through this window said raston but the vicar was inclined to doubt the window is so small that no grown man could have got through he said they went outside and certainly against the wall and immediately under the window were marks and scratches of boots as though someone might have climbed the wall also the sides of the window were broken as though a way had been found through the lepers' window was so small that no care had been taken to put in glass or iron bars besides no one had ever expected that the chapel would be robbed in all its centuries of history nothing up till now had ever been taken from it and now the most precious thing of all had vanished and during my occupation of the vicarage said mr tempest it is really terrible however in spite of the loss he held the service as usual and as a great number of people attracted by the news of the robbery had come the chapel was quite full service over tempest returned to the vicarage and found mr pratt waiting to see him this is a nice thing said pratt looking annoyed as well he might seeing that his magnificent gift had disappeared i did not know that you had thieves in the parish mr tempest neither did i groaned the vicar sitting down hitherto we have been singularly exempt from crime and now one of the very worst sort has befallen us not a mere robbery mr pratt sacrilege sir sacrilege the american turned rather white as tempest spoke he had not regarded the robbery save as a common one the idea that it was sacrilege placed it in a new light yet mr pratt was sharp enough to have guessed this before the wonder was that he had not done so what are you going to do he asked after a pause raston has sent for the police at portfront i expect the inspector will come over this afternoon pratt shrugged his shoulders i don't think much of the police he said the metropolitan detectives are stupid enough but the provincial police oh lord i beg your pardon mr tempest i forgot myself no matter no matter said tempest wearily i can think of nothing save our great loss and your gift too mr pratt terrible well said the american cheerfully if this cup can't be found i guess i must find you another one the cup shall be found cried the vicar vehemently the culprit must belong to this parish else he would not have known the lepers' window in the chapel we shall find the guilty person yet mr pratt i hope so said pratt with another shrug but he seems to have got away very cleverly i shall see you this afternoon when you interview the inspector mr tempest i should like to have a hand in the discovery certainly certainly who but you the giver of the cup should wish to help come here this afternoon mr pratt as pratt left the vicarage he met sybil who looked sad don't take on so miss tempest he said we'll find the cup yet i was not thinking so much of that explained sybil but this morning my poor dear leo went away when is he coming back towards the end of next week i wonder who can have taken the cup pratt sneered an unusual thing for so good natured a man no doubt the portfront police will tell us he said but i haven't much opinion of law officers myself miss sybil i once lost a lot of gems in london and the thief was never found are you fond of gems come to my house and i'll show you my collection i have several thousand pounds' worth is it not dangerous to keep them in your house after this robbery pratt laughed i don't think a thief would steal them so easily as the cup he laughed i have a good dog and a capital revolver no miss sybil i can look after my property well i assure you when he went away sybil sighed and sought her room the departure of leo had left her very sad she did not know what would become of him he would pay his debts and then enlist for south africa in that case she would not see him again for months perhaps never for it might be that some bullet would lay him low on the veldt however for the sake of her father she strove to assume a light hearted demeanour the vicar felt the loss of the cup keenly and although sybil thought he had treated her hardly in her love affair she laid all thoughts of self aside so as to comfort him in his trouble as for pratt he walked back to his own house at the foot of the castle hill he met mrs gabriel who seemed to be in a great state of indignation as usual her anger was directed against leo he came to me last night and said that he was going up to london to pay his debts this morning he went off at seven without taking leave now mr pratt you have been giving him the money to pay his debts indeed i have not mrs gabriel said pratt quite prepared for this question i have not given him a sixpence then where did he get so large a sum asked the lady anxiously i don't know he told me that someone had lent it to him a likely story as if anyone here would trust him with money without a guarantee mr pratt here mrs gabriel stopped and her face went white a thought had struck her and she was about to speak but she saved herself in time and stared at her companion what is the matter said pratt anxiously he thought she would faint a weakness he had never hitherto associated with mrs gabriel nothing she replied in a strangled voice but leo i must see frank and without another word she hurried away pratt stared after her as he could not conjecture what she meant then he shrugged his shoulders and went back to the nun's house that same afternoon he called again at the vicarage and there found mr tempest in consultation with a grey haired man whom he introduced as inspector german the police officer who had a shrewd face with keen eyes nodded in a friendly manner i understand you gave this cup to the chapel mr pratt he said pity it is lost a great pity replied pratt who was making a thorough examination of the man and now seemed much more at ease than when he had entered i hope the thief has gone away however i have in my house several thousand pounds' worth of gems and i don't want him to come after them how do you know it was a man asked german quietly i don't know responded the american with a stare and a laugh i only speak as others do for my part i believe that there were two people concerned in the robbery a man and a boy certainly a boy replied tempest looking up no one but a small boy could have forced himself through that window then you don't think mr tempest that a woman can have had anything to do with the matter tempest stared the idea seemed ridiculous i do not think a woman would commit so wicked an act he said stiffly oh as to that interposed pratt women are as wicked as men and worse when the fit takes them but i see what mr inspector means he has heard of pearl darry's devotion to the cup it was not pearl cried mr tempest indignantly i am sure of that why the poor child regarded that cup as something too holy to be touched as it was added the vicar reverently well said german after a pause i have been talking to your villagers about her it seems that she was always haunting the chapel and looking at the cup she might have been seized with a desire to have it for her very own she is insane i believe and insane people have very mad ideas also she is small and could easily have forced herself through the lepers' window of which she would know the position pratt looked with contempt at the officer he was even more stupid than he had given him credit for you can rest easy mr inspector he said it was not pearl who stole my cup she has been ill in bed for the last few days and unable to move as mrs jeal and dr james will tell you i must make certain of that myself said the inspector will you come with me mr pratt not i replied the american i think you are going on a wild goose chase the best thing for you to do mr inspector is to see if any vagabonds have been in the village lately i have already done so replied german coolly and the villagers assure me that no stranger has been seen hereabouts for some days however i am willing to give this girl the benefit of the doubt but i must see her as pratt still refused to come and tempest was unwilling to call at the cottage of mrs jeal on such an errand the inspector went himself he found no difficulty in entering as raston was at the door all the same the curate was indignant on hearing the accusation he took german into the sitting room but refused and in this he was backed up by the doctor to let the inspector enter the bedroom of the sick girl not that german desired to do so after an interview with mrs jeal she was most indignant at the slur cast upon the character of the girl she called her adopted daughter there was a scene and mrs jeal proved herself to be more than equal to the official from portfront i never heard anything so wicked in my life cried mrs jeal the poor child may be mad but not mad enough to take what is not her own i wonder at you sir that you should come here on such an errand my duty is clearly before me replied the inspector stiffly is the girl really and truly ill you can take my word for that mr german said raston or if you do not believe me here is dr james ill repeated the doctor when the question was put to him she had a bad attack of inflammation of the lungs and she is worse this morning than i have ever seen her i do not wish her disturbed mr inspector she could not have gone out last night to the chapel doctor not without the risk of being dead this morning replied james dryly besides pearl darry is not a thief no sir whosoever stole that cup it was not my patient and i would have you know cried mrs jeal with her arms akimbo that i sat beside her the most of last night and not one step did she stir off the bed ah well said german who could not go against this evidence it is very plain that i am in the wrong unless there's no unless about it sir cried mrs jeal pearl wasna oot o' this hoose in her excitement she was falling into the scotch speech of her childhood i wonder at ye i do that hoots awa' wi' ye baffled in this quarter the inspector took his way into the village first he examined the chapel then he started out to make inquiries for quite three days he exasperated everyone in the village with his questions and suspicions but for all his worry he was unable to get at the truth no tramps had been to the village old barker proved his innocence with the assistance of a wrathful wife and there was not a single person to whom the well meaning but blundering inspector could point as likely to have stolen the cup finally he was obliged to state that he could do nothing and withdrew himself and his underlings from colester much to the relief of the villagers whom he had grievously offended by his unjust suspicions the cup had vanished as though it had been swallowed up by the earth and no one was able to say who had taken it a grievous loss sighed mr tempest when he became resigned but i sorrow not so much for the theft of the cup as for the awful sacrilege of which the thief has been guilty and he took occasion to refer to the terrible deed in a wrathful sermon the villagers shook in their shoes when they heard of the ills likely to befall the thief but not one was able to say who was guilty for a whole week things went on much as usual and the excitement died away leo was still in london and through pratt sybil had heard from him he had seen his creditors and had settled all his debts he was now thinking about enlisting before he could do so however sybil sent a message recalling him to colester to defend his good name it so happened that barker held his tongue for some time but when the first effects of the fright lest he might be accused passed away he began to talk the old man was given to babbling in his cups thus it came about that he mentioned that he believed mr haverleigh had taken the cup it seemed that barker had seen leo near the chapel as he was leaving it about half past nine mr haverleigh said the old man had seemed to shun recognition and had hurried past him not thinking anything of the matter barker had left him near the chapel door now however he hinted that leo might have had some reason to be there at so untoward an hour also he had gone away the next morning early it was well known in colester that the young man was in debt and that his mother had refused to pay his debts what then was more likely people argued than that leo should have stolen the cup should have taken it up to london before the loss was discovered and should have sold it to pay his debts in a few hours this sorry tale was all over the place and so came to sybil's ears it was her father who heard it and her father who told her but surely you do not believe it cried the girl when the accusation was made you have known leo all these years whatever you may have against him father you know that he would never commit so wicked an act i say nothing until i hear what he has to say replied the vicar who for some reason seemed to be biased against leo but you must admit that it was strange he should be near the chapel at so late an hour and we know that he is deeply in debt mrs gabriel told me herself that he owed three hundred pounds in a moment of madness i won't hear a word against leo interrupted sybil pale but resolute not if an angel came down to accuse him would i believe him guilty how could he have got the key and if he did not get the key how could he have forced himself through that small window i say nothing until i hear his defence said the vicar obstinately but the whole affair is highly suspicious i never knew you to be unjust before father cried sybil mrs gabriel has infected you with her dislike of leo i shall say nothing myself although i could say more than you think but i shall send at once to leo and he shall come back to rebut this wicked accusation without listening to another word sybil ran off to see pratt who was equally indignant it is disgraceful he said furiously leo never would do such a thing never be comforted my dear i'll ride over to portfront this very day and send a wire to him and this he did without delay more than that he defended leo heartily when he returned so did raston hale kept silent but the majority of the villagers were against the young man leo returned in disgrace chapter viii haverleigh's defence thanks to the care of dr james and the nursing of mrs jeal the sick girl took a turn for the better in a remarkably short space of time she began to improve and when leo arrived back in colester she was on a fair way of recovery although the doctor did not like mrs jeal he could not but admit that no mother could have been kinder than the midwife she waited hand and foot day and night on pearl and refused to let anyone take her place even when she was worn out with watching in the middle of her trouble she was called away to london one day shortly after the theft of the cup she received a telegram from town informing her that her father was seriously ill and that she was to come up at once if she wanted to see him alive now if there was one strong feeling mrs jeal possessed it was love for her father of whom she often spoke much as she liked pearl she was not prepared to stay beside her in the face of such a summons the old man might die if she delayed i can get joan barker in to nurse pearl she said to the doctor and go at once to london i may be away a week or two humph said james running his eye over the telegram i suppose you must go the matter seems urgent mrs barker is not so good a nurse as you though but pearl is much better doctor said mrs jeal anxiously yes i'll pull her through well pack your traps mrs jeal myself and mr raston will attend to pearl with the assistance of mrs barker you must leave me some address though in case anything goes wrong during your absence not that i think anything will pearl is mending rapidly mrs jeal gave an address in a humble battersea street and in a few hours was ready for the road she took a tender leave of pearl to whom she appeared to be sincerely attached and that same morning left for portfront by a carrier's waggon when she departed the village was still filled with anxiety regarding the loss of the cup as has been said before no railway had yet opened up the solitudes of colester and king's meadows but those who wished to get quickly to london took the steamer from portfront and in a few hours came to worthing at which place a train was easily procurable mrs jeal took this route and having started early she arrived in town that same night she sent a wire telling of her arrival to dr james he showed it to sir frank hale quick work said james yet we are far enough away from the world here that's true replied the baronet so mrs jeal has gone to town i saw her at portfront when i was there yesterday morning it is not often she goes to town i suppose she does not wish to lose the money the money hale what do you mean why it seems from what mrs jeal told me that her father is not badly off and if he dies she will come into a tidy bit of money there are other relatives though and she was afraid lest they should get the old man to leave the fortune to them fortune said james with a smile a large word for a small legacy i don't know so much about that responded the cripple snappishly from what the woman told me her father is well off he was a porter or something in a stockbroker's office and dabbled in mines himself it seems he was lucky in his speculations and made money by the way james has haverleigh turned up yet no but i heard that mr pratt had sent a telegram to him i expect he will wonder what is the matter that pratt should ask him to come back not he growled hale he knows well enough why hale you don't believe he stole the cup the cripple remained silent for a time it is a difficult thing for me to say he finally remarked you know james that my sister edith is deeply in love with the man i don't like him myself i never did but if he would marry my sister i should not decline the alliance i put her happiness before my own feelings well under the circumstances i really am not prepared to give an opinion i know that leo was in debt and it is common talk that mrs gabriel refused to pay his debts yet she informed me that he went up to london to settle them now he must have got the money from somewhere and who would trust him it looks black against him i confess replied james shaking his head still i cannot believe that haverleigh would sink to being a common thief you will see when he returns that he will be able to explain if he ever does return growled hale doubtfully he will why miss tempest believes in him and he must come back if only to justify her faith i believe those two are in love with one another hale well they will make a handsome couple he will have to get back his good name first retorted hale jealously and as to there being anything between them i don't believe it good day james don't go spreading cock and bull stories as the baronet walked off the doctor looked after him with a smile of contempt he knew that hale was madly in love with the vicar's daughter and that he regarded leo as a too successful rival you'll be delighted if the poor chap comes to harm muttered james you are a viper but i am sure haverleigh will clear himself a girl like sybil tempest is not likely to be deceived in the character of the man she loves i would rather believe her than you sir frank hale and james who had no great love for the spiteful little cripple walked away to see pearl by this time the opinion was that leo would not return it was positive said the gossips that he had stolen the cup in order to procure money for the payment of his debts the most likely thing was that he would clear out of the country what fools these people are said pratt who heard this if the man intended to leave the country he certainly would not pay his debts only a heaven born ass would do that he would take the money himself and leave his creditors unpaid but the gossips did not see matters in that light they were bent upon thinking the worst of leo all this time mrs gabriel said nothing but remained shut up in the castle she knew well enough what was being said about leo and could not bear to face anyone the more particularly as she did not know how to defend him she denied herself to everyone even to pratt although he called several times to interview her on behalf of her nephew the young man had a strong defender in pratt he went about everywhere insisting on haverleigh's innocence in this opinion he was supported by sybil by the curate and strange to say by mrs bathurst the whole thing is absolute nonsense said mrs bathurst why should mr haverleigh be such a fool mrs gabriel would have paid his debts in the long run and then if he had not wished to pay them himself he could have enlisted and slipped away to africa without anyone being the wiser then there's another thing he would not commit a crime for such a purpose if he was in difficulties before he would not make them worse by putting himself within reach of the law all of which was common sense although leo's enemies were too much bent on thinking the worst of him to accept such a reasonable view it was while matters were in this state that leo haverleigh returned he drove up to the castle one night without informing anyone of his coming mrs gabriel was amazed when he presented himself before her he looked bright and cheerful not at all like a man who had been accused of a sordid crime but it must be remembered that leo knew nothing of his new reputation all he knew was that pratt at the instance of sybil had recalled him to colester he thought that this telegram had to do with some new difficulty with regard to his love affairs good evening mother he said as he marched into the room where mrs gabriel was sitting i have returned you see and are you not ashamed cried mrs gabriel rising with a wrathful expression i thought some feeling of decency would have kept you away oh come now mother returned leo trying to keep his temper i am not so bad as all that if i have been foolish and extravagant surely you can forgive besides my debts are paid i am a free man you won't be a free man long said mrs gabriel grimly i am willing to do what i can for you badly as you have treated me but i cannot condone a felony that is out of the question leo stared and sat down you use very extraordinary words he said at length i never heard that a man who was in debt could be called a felon come mother he went on trying to be amiable a difficult task with a woman like this don't use big words for a trifle i intended to enlist but i thought i would come down first to see you and talk the matter over you have been kind to me and i do not want to part in anger let us arrange matters in a kindly spirit mrs gabriel looked at him aghast at his boldness how dare you speak to me like this she cried are you not aware that everyone in colester is talking of your crime crime leo started to his feet what crime he looked bewildered as if you didn't know i wonder you have the impertinence to come back here how much did you sell the cup for leo still looked puzzled cup he echoed what cup mrs gabriel grasped him by the shoulders and shook him her eyes blazing with anger you are absolutely shameless she cried i mean the cup which mr pratt presented to the chapel and you know too it has been stolen and you are the thief haverleigh stared at her for a moment and then burst out laughing is this a joke mother he said at length if so it is a very poor one it is not a joke retorted mrs gabriel still angry the cup was missing on the very morning you went up to london you stole it leo and took it away to pay your debts i never nor did i cried haverleigh now beginning to lose his temper who dares to say such a thing about me the whole village says it and everyone believes it does sybil i don't know nor do i care and so far as she is concerned you need not think to marry her mr tempest will never let his daughter become the wife of a stop cried leo before she could utter the shameful word how dare you call me by a foul name i know perfectly well you hate me but you have no right to believe that i did this thing i know that sybil believes me guiltless she would never credit the man she loves with such a contemptible crime and pratt believes in me also he sent me a telegram asking me to come back i thought it had to do with some trouble you had made over my engagement to sybil i never expected this how dare you accuse me of such a crime the whole village accuses you said mrs gabriel passionately you have paid your debts i know you have where did you get the money not from me not from pratt for i asked him and barker saw you lurking about the chapel on sunday night at a late hour what were you doing there if it was not to steal oh shame upon you leo how can you stand there and deny your guilt because i am not guilty cried leo furiously i tell you i did not steal the cup i did not even know that it was lost i was near the chapel on that night and at that hour i can explain why i was there explain then said mrs gabriel with a stamp not to you and not until i have thought over my position everyone seems to have judged me guilty without giving me an opportunity of defending myself you cannot muttered mrs gabriel you dare not the scorn of her speech carried leo beyond all bounds of prudence he had not intended to defend himself until he had consulted with pratt the situation was so unpleasant and dangerous that he wanted an older and wiser head than his own to deal with the matter but mrs gabriel's taunt made him forget his resolutions i dare and i can he burst out i went to the chapel to meet sybil her father would not let us see one another so we had to do so by stealth i was going away on monday morning and she wished for a meeting as i did myself in her pew she left a note and she let me know by signs during the service that she had done so i looked in the vicar's pew after the service was over and found that she asked me to meet her at the door of the chapel shortly after nine i was there and i saw old barker going away i think he saw me but as i did not wish to attract attention i kept out of his way as much as possible sybil came about half past nine perhaps later and we had a talk then i took her back to the vicarage and returned here to sleep i was on my way to portfront by seven in the morning that is all i know a likely story sneered mrs gabriel i do not believe one word of it leo looked at her with great dignity if you do not choose to believe me i cannot make you he said but from this moment all is at an end between us god knows why you hate me so i have done nothing to deserve it what i have told you is the truth sybil can vouch for it i have some hesitation in asking her to do so as she will have to say that she was alone with me at that late hour and you know well what the gossips will say still if i am in danger of arrest she will come forward although i would rather suffer myself than that she should be lightly spoken of i shall see her and her father for some reason best known to you mrs gabriel mr tempest has taken a dislike to me but he is a just man and i am sure he does not believe me guilty you'd better see him and ask said mrs gabriel tartly i say again that i don't believe your explanation where did you get the money to pay your debts if it was not from selling the cup i borrowed it retorted leo after a pause i did not intend to tell you but it seems i must in order to clear my character you would not help me and pratt was not ready to do so i daresay if i had pressed him he would have helped me but i did not think it right he should pay for my folly i borrowed the money if you must know from frank hale mrs gabriel who had seated herself looked at the young man indignantly why will you tell these lies she said trying to speak calmly i had an idea that hale might have assisted you and i went to see him he absolutely denies that he lent you a penny leo looked bewildered he denies the debt said he why he has my acknowledgment he gave me the three hundred pounds in gold on sunday morning i packed it in a gladstone bag and took it to london with me there i paid it into my bank and gave my creditors cheques for in gold burst out mrs gabriel contemptuously is it likely that in these days a man would pay such a large sum otherwise than by cheque why if you said notes it would be more reasonable but gold bah i tell you he did said leo now thoroughly angry i wondered myself at the time and i mentioned to sybil how inconvenient it was i asked hale for notes for a cheque he refused both and said i must take the money as he chose to give it or not at all he gave it to me in three bags each containing a hundred sovereigns i paid that into my london bank oh i daresay you did sneered mrs gabriel but you should have got a better price for the cup you still believe me guilty cried leo recoiling i do hale denies that he paid you the money i shall see him about it to morrow said leo he will not dare to deny what is the truth and i leave the castle this very night mrs gabriel i shall never call you 'mother' again you are cruel and wicked tell me why you hate me so mrs gabriel's eyes flashed if i told you that she began then closed her mouth and turned away then you do hate me yes with all my soul she turned on him like a fury i have hated you from the moment you came into my house all these years i have been on the point of turning you out go now and never darken my doors again i was a fool to have anything to do with you go go for a moment leo stood bewildered at her furious speech he thought she was mad for he could not conceive why she should speak so it was useless to talk or to remonstrate or to seek an explanation he looked at her for a moment then without a word he walked away in another quarter of an hour he had left the castle bag and baggage thank god cried mrs gabriel when alone i am rid of him at last chapter ix a bad reputation pratt sat alone in his library he was not reading for although he had many books he rarely looked into one of them he collected rare editions he indulged in gorgeous bindings and placed all his gatherings on shelves behind glass doors it was the look of the thing pratt liked if his collection had been so many volumes of blank pages he would have been just as well pleased as the evening was cold there was a fire in the steel grate the room looked comfortable and luxurious it was decorated in dark red with bookcases of rosewood and many busts of celebrated men on the desk stood a reading lamp and this was the only light in the room before the desk sat pratt he was playing with a small pile of precious stones which he had shaken out of a leathern belt the jewels gleamed in the light with rainbow hues and pratt fingered them with loving care recalling where each one had been bought and found he was crazy about his gems but never showed them to anyone moreover in addition to his liking for such things it was a portable way of carrying about his wealth the door opened softly and a servant entered pratt did not turn his head for he knew the footstep but when he heard that leo wished to see him he poured the jewels back into the belt flung it into a drawer and told adam that was the man's name to admit mr haverleigh adam was a tall soldierly looking man of the fair saxon type he had been with mr pratt for years knew all his secrets and was absolutely devoted to him as well he might be for pratt had once saved his life adam never forgot the obligation and was pratt's devoted slave hullo leo said pratt rising when the young man entered the room where did you come from from london if you want to be precise said leo after shaking hands my bag is in the hall pratt what have you not been to the castle i have been there and i have come away in fact pratt she has turned me out at last i always knew that it would come to this as leo sat down pratt frowned and when he frowned he did not look pleased ah said he calmly so she has turned you out on account of this theft i suppose yes it is the first i ever heard of it said leo looking up your wire said nothing about such an accusation i don't suppose you could very well have mentioned it in a telegram however mrs gabriel insisted that i had stolen the cup and sold it in london in order to pay my debts we had a few words on the subject and parted i am now here to ask you for a bed my dear fellow you shall stay here as long as you please let me ring for adam to bring you some supper and pratt touched the bell a few sandwiches and a glass of port will be sufficient said leo i am not in the humour to eat by the way as adam entered i see he has got back who adam yes where did you meet him at portfront said leo with a nod to adam who smiled he told me he had been up to london on your business i gave him a lift part of the way didn't i adam i shouldn't have got home otherwise sir said adam respectfully and departed to get food for his benefactor pratt seemed pleased that his servant was so friendly with leo he had a great opinion of adam's intelligence also adam was a power in the house but leo did not know that later on he learned all about it to his great astonishment come now said pratt when leo had eaten and had finished a glass or two of port tell me about this cup did you take it i certainly did not said leo stiffly i wonder at your asking me such a question pratt i am not a thief his host laughed somewhat nervously i only wanted to be sure my dear lad he said don't get angry with your best and only friend i have another friend said leo looking up from the cigar he was cutting and that is sybil she does not believe that i am guilty have you seen her then no but i do not want to see her in order to know that she loves me mr pratt and would never believe me guilty no not though the evidence was twice as strong against me the evidence is strong said pratt rubbing his chin you were seen at the chapel and and i have paid my debts finished leo so i have and i can explain how i paid them also my movements on that night and he forthwith related to pratt the story he had already told mrs gabriel the man believed him much more readily than the woman but then pratt liked leo and mrs gabriel as she had shown plainly hated him with all the intensity of her stern and cruel nature you say that hale lent you the money asked pratt as i told you in gold and he now denies that he did so so mrs gabriel says but i shall see for myself to morrow pratt reflected staring into the fire it seems to be a conspiracy he said slowly i wonder what his game is leo remembered that sybil had also been uncomfortable when she heard that hale intended to lend him the money a thought flashed into his mind as pratt spoke i believe that hale is in love with sibyl said he humph and his sister edith is in love with you leo coloured a little at this very direct remark i believe she is said he with an embarrassed laugh but i assure you pratt the feeling is not reciprocal the only woman i have ever loved whom i shall ever love is sybil tempest and the course of our true love does not run smooth he finished with a sigh a conspiracy repeated pratt who was not paying much attention to what leo was saying yes i believe it to be one by lending you that money hale hoped to get you into his power so as to induce you to give up sibyl to him and marry edith if he ever did have so ridiculous an idea said leo angrily he has thrown away the fruits of it by denying the loan no the unforseen has happened and he is simply making use of the new development said pratt you are accused of having sold this cup to pay your debts if hale acknowledged that he gave you the money he would take away the motive and would in a measure prove your innocence that is exactly what he will not do unless he hesitated unless i give up sybil and marry his sister precisely replied pratt however this is only a theory you had better wait until you see hale before you make up your mind i don't mind making you a bet leo that what mrs gabriel says is true do you think hale will deny the loan i am certain of it i have studied human nature a great deal during a not uneventful life and if ever i saw a crafty scoundrel hale is the man i wish you had told me that he was the friend who was to lend you the money i would rather have found it for you myself than have let you go to him i wish i had spoken out but it's too late now and how did i know the man would be such a scoundrel not that we yet can be certain that he is pratt only the worst of it is added leo wrinkling his young brows that i cannot now repay the money if he denies the debt you will not need to repay it i shall insist upon doing so when i am able cried leo vehemently but mrs gabriel won't help me i will let you have the three hundred pounds said pratt i don't see why you should pratt as it is you are too kind to me no i will borrow no more this interview with mrs gabriel has fixed my mind as to enlisting i shall see if i can't arrange about the money for hale i have some jewellery and other things i can sell in some way or another i'll contrive to get out of his debt he won't admit that you are in his debt persisted pratt but it is no use talking all night about these things leo you have a friend in me and as i know you are innocent i'll get you out of this trouble somehow to morrow you can see hale and miss sybil i'll see him first said leo grimly after which speech ominous of evil he retired to bed worn out with his long journey and by the anxiety attendant on his new position which was that of an absolute pauper he soon fell into a dreamless sleep pratt remained in the library and for a long time sat watching the dying fire he also saw trouble ahead but it had to do more with himself than with his guest since the illness of pearl sybil had attended to the decorating of the altar sometimes she had the assistance of peggy bathurst but mrs bathurst still fearful lest peggy might become engaged to the curate would not let her come as often to the chapel as sybil wished so miss tempest usually decked the altar alone the morning after leo's arrival she was in the chapel at mid day with her arms full of flowers taking these and the altar vessels into a quiet corner she began to arrange the blossoms while thus engaged she heard a step at once she sprang to her feet with the love light in her eye she had no need to see the newcomer her heart told her it was leo my dear she took him into her arms how glad i am to see you again oh leo i have so many sad things to tell you i know all my love said the young man kissing her i arrived last night and saw mrs gabriel she did not spare me your mother she is no more mother of mine sybil she told me she hated me called me a thief and turned me out of the castle i shall never enter it again never last night i slept at pratt's he was a good samaritan and took me in this morning i went to see hale sybil clapped her hands oh then it is all right she cried joyfully i could have told my father that you had got the money from him but i thought it better you should do so yourself i can't do that without hale calling me a liar leo what do you mean that in the eyes of the people here i am both a liar and a thief hale whom i saw this morning denies having given me the money has he spread that all about the town asked sybil scarcely able to believe her ears no he is too clever for that now i know sybil why he gave me the money in gold so that he might be able to deny the debt if occasion arose as it has done had he given me a cheque his signature would have given him the lie but what does he mean by denying that he lent you the money well i'll give you pratt's theory i believe it is the true one and the young man rapidly repeated the conversation he had had with the american on the previous evening so you see you were right sybil i knew it said sybil in low tones do you remember how i told you on the day of mrs bathurst's picnic what is to be done now there is nothing to be done save to fight said leo fiercely and fight i shall i had intended to enlist but i shall not do that until i have cleared my name to leave here now would be to give colour to the lies that are being told about me i shall stay with pratt he is my friend and you sybil also we three will fight it out mr raston is also your friend leo he says he does not believe for one moment that you did what you are accused of doing thank god for that how can anyone who knows me believe me guilty of so terrible a crime to rob a church think of it sybil your father does he believe i did this vile thing he suspends his judgment leo until he has heard your defence alas sybil what defence can i make save state that i am innocent i cannot make hale confess that he lent me the money and i cannot prove independently of him that he did so this morning he coolly denied all knowledge of the loan but said that for my sake he would not speak of the visit i had made or the threats i had used did you use threats leo i am afraid i did dear but is it not enough to make an honest man's blood boil to be placed in such a position i threatened to give him a thrashing but when i remembered that he was a cripple of course i could not do that but for all his physical weakness he is a venomous beast no sybil without hale i can do nothing he paused for a moment and then went on i think the best way to do is to wait he said if this is a plot on hale's part he will continue to carry it out that is he will make some proposition to me about giving you up i don't suppose he will want me to marry his sister now that i am called a thief sybil placed her hand over his mouth you must not be so bitter leo i will not have you revile yourself in this way don't you think you had better see my father what good would that do my dear i can only tell the story i tell you and as i have no evidence to prove its truth he probably will not believe me no sybil it is best for me to remain quietly with pratt and wait until hale makes some move besides pratt is a clever man of the world and can guide me no doubt everyone will be disagreeable but i must put up with that i refuse to go away as though the charge against me were true you will see me sometimes sybil whenever i can she replied but it will not be easy when my father hears that you are back he will be more particular than ever to keep me from meeting you leo mused i wonder why he has changed so sybil he used to like me i think mrs gabriel said something which has turned him against you very probably replied leo bitterly for some reason she hates me but all is at an end between us i wait here sybil to vindicate my character and afterwards i shall carry out my plan of enlisting i may be years away from you but you will be true i know i swear to be true leo i marry no one but you not even hale whispered leo straining her to his breast sybil laughed if i disliked him before think how i hate him now she said he is acting a mean part but his punishment will come now go leo for my father may come at any moment the two lovers embraced and parted leo went away much comforted by the belief sybil had in his innocence he returned to the nun's house and spent the day with pratt talking over the position of affairs it was a disagreeable position and at the present moment he could see no way of mending it hale alone could prove his innocence and hale refused to speak out bitterly did leo regret that he had ever been tempted to believe in this fox the days went by and the position remained much the same as it was by this time the excitement consequent on the loss of the cup had died out leo remained mostly within doors as he did not care about meeting the cold looks of those he had known from childhood mrs gabriel gave no sign but secluded herself within her own grounds once or twice pratt saw her on leo's behalf but he could do nothing with her however he told leo to keep up his spirits that all would come right but how this alteration was to be brought about he did not say pratt knew when to keep his own counsel towards the end of the week mrs jeal returned her father was much better she said and she had come back to look after pearl the mad girl was now out of bed but as yet unable to leave the cottage someone had conveyed to her the news of the loss raston shrewdly suspected joan barker but strange to say she was not so upset about it as had been expected the master has taken his cup to use in heaven she told the curate who often came to sit with her when he thinks fit he will bring it back again to the altar raston was puzzled by this queer view but as it prevented the girl from fretting he outwardly agreed with her having settled the matter thus pearl rarely referred to the loss she was quite content to wait until the cup was restored taking a hint from raston mrs jeal never discussed the matter all the same she knew more about the missing cup than the colester people knew and it was in this way she explained the matter to harold raston sir she said one day shortly after her return i want you to get me speech with his reverence i wish to make a statement to him indeed mrs jeal what is the statement it is about the cup sir but i prefer to speak to the vicar and to mr haverleigh i hear he is staying with mr pratt i believe he is some foolish people accuse him of having stolen the cup mrs jeal i hope you will be able to give us some information likely to lead to its discovery so that mr haverleigh's character can be cleared mrs jeal screwed up her mouth and sent out a flash from her wicked eyes she absolutely refused to speak save in the presence of mr tempest and leo therefore after a consultation with the vicar raston went to see leo and asked him to come to the vicarage leo was surprised at the summons and not very willing to obey it he resented the way in which he had been treated by mr tempest still from what was hinted by mrs jeal he fancied that she might be able to clear his character so he accompanied raston to the place of meeting mrs jeal was already in the study seated beside the vicar's desk she was dressed in her best and looked demure as any cat tempest reddened when he saw leo and held out his hand leo refused to take it no sir he said coldly you have not treated me well i thought you were my friend but i find you believe me to be a thief pardon me replied tempest suddenly growing hard i do not say that you took the cup i refuse to believe anything against you until i hear what you have to say in your own defence i make no defence mr tempest rejoined leo sybil believes me guiltless so does pratt raston also is my friend i can only wait until i am vindicated by time or perhaps mrs jeal will prove to you that i did not steal the cup and leo looked at the crafty face of the woman mrs jeal at a nod from the vicar rose and folded her hands i can prove that you did steal it mr haverleigh she said i saw you pawn the cup in london chapter x the price of silence for a few moments there was a dead silence tempest looked gravely shocked mrs jeal triumphant and the curate much disturbed he had been so certain of leo's innocence that this precise evidence took his breath away leo was thunderstruck and passed his hand across his eyes to make sure that he was not dreaming you saw me pawn what i never had in my possession he said quietly mrs jeal shrugged her plump shoulders i can say no more than i know she said of course i quite expected you would deny my story i have not heard it yet replied the accused man slowly and i shall be glad to hear it at the present moment i declare most solemnly that i never took the cup i did not even know it was stolen until i returned from london where you had pawned it finished mrs jeal the vicar interposed he was struck by leo's calmness which was not that of a guilty person i think you had better tell your story mrs jeal he said then we can hear mr haverleigh i thank you for giving me a fair trial mr tempest said leo quietly and sat down with his eyes on the face of the woman mrs jeal cleared her throat and in a slow voice began to speak she rather enjoyed her position and made the most of it but before speaking of what i know sir she said looking at the vicar might i ask if it is true that you have offered a reward for the recovery of the cup i have not done so myself said tempest gravely but mr pratt who presented the cup to me has offered the sum of fifty pounds to whomsoever will give information likely to lead to its recovery if you know of anything mrs jeal i'll get the reward said the woman a greedy light in her small eyes yes sir i do know of something i went up to battersea in london to see my father who is ill he is a retired gardener your reverence and has invested his savings in a seed shop my mother is still alive and she looks after him they do fairly well out of the shop and of course your reverence i give them some assistance as becomes an only child this is not to the point mrs jeal i am coming to the point shortly said the woman with a look at leo who made no remark but it is necessary that your reverence should understand how it was that i came to see mr haverleigh taking the cup to old penny's pawnshop leo could bear it no longer and started to his feet it is absolutely false he exclaimed passionately i did not pawn the cup i never had it in my possession i was never in battersea in my life and i do not know the name of penny better wait and hear the story leo said tempest in a more friendly tone he was beginning to be impressed by the bearing of the young man even in the face of mrs jeal's evidence he thought leo might be innocent after all the evidence was circumstantial and that is not always to be relied upon you shall have every justice he said patting leo's shoulder i know what i know said mrs jeal when leo sat down again one evening last week i was out late i had been to get some medicine for my dear father in barry street there is a pawnshop kept by an old man called penny i have known it most of my life as i passed i saw mr haverleigh ahead of me he did not stop immediately at the shop you saw me cried leo bewildered how was i dressed in a blue serge suit with a hard fawn coloured hat said mrs jeal glibly over your arm you carried a coat and under it you had a parcel it was the cup you are telling a pack of lies said leo angrily how did you know the cup was in the parcel wait and you shall hear said mrs jeal tartly i do not care about being hurried you passed the shop i recognised you at once and wondered what you were doing in so poor a quarter of the town of course i knew that the cup had been stolen but i never thought that you had it under your arm you had a silk muffler round your throat although the evening was warm and apparently you wished to escape observation i was determined to find out what you were doing so i followed you you went round the block until it grew darker then you returned to the shop and entered i waited on the other side of the road in half an hour you came out again you had the great coat on and your hands in your pocket after looking up and down the street to see if anyone was observing you i saw you walk rapidly to the end i did not follow as i was anxious to see why you had been to the pawnshop why all this anxiety mrs jeal asked tempest annoyed well sir of course i know that mrs gabriel does not approve of mr haverleigh's behaviour that has nothing to do with the matter interposed mr tempest sternly and leo gave him a grateful look all you have to do is to state facts mrs jeal dropped an ironical curtsey very good sir said she but i must say that i thought mrs gabriel had cut off mr haverleigh's allowance and that he was pawning some jewellery to keep himself in bread i never pawned anything in my life said leo disgusted at the plain spite of the woman go on mrs jeal you saw this man penny no doubt i did that cried the woman triumphantly i have known him for many years i went into the shop and into his back parlour on the table i saw the cup yes gentlemen you no doubt are surprised but it was the very cup i had so often seen on the altar of the chapel it is wholly false cried leo rising i never pawned the cup someone must have impersonated me it was yourself mr haverleigh insisted the woman i had a talk with old penny but of course i said nothing about having seen the cup before i did not mention that i knew you penny told me that he had given you four hundred for the cup it was worth much more he said and he was chuckling over the bargain he had made i left the cup in his possession and returned home several times i went to the shop to hear if you had redeemed the cup but it was still with penny i then had to attend to my father and gave the matter little thought but when i returned and heard how you mr haverleigh had stolen the cup it became my duty to let his reverence know what you had done with it and i hear added mrs jeal with a malignant smile that your debts have been paid who told you so asked raston who hitherto had been silent mrs gabriel i went to tell her what mr haverleigh had done she said that she expected as much as she had refused to give him the money to pay his debts so that is all i know i am prepared to take my oath in a court of law that this is true there was a pause then tempest observed quietly if that is all you have to tell mrs jeal you can go i will speak to mr haverleigh but will i not you will do nothing interrupted the vicar go away and hold your tongue lest you get into trouble you're going to let him off i see said mrs jeal with a toss of her grey head well i have done my share good day gentlemen and she sailed out of the room quite satisfied that she had ruined leo when the three were alone tempest addressed leo who sat silently beside the table leo he said sadly i do not want you to get into trouble if you will confess to me that you did what mrs jeal says i will see about getting the cup back and say nothing more about the matter i will give you money to leave the town i tell you i am innocent cried leo passionately why do you want me to confess a crime of which i am not guilty i shall not leave colester here i stay until my innocence is acknowledged but the evidence against you urged the vicar sorely perplexed you were seen about the chapel on the night the cup was stolen your debts are paid yet mrs gabriel did not give you the money and you have none of your own and now mrs jeal says she saw you pawn the sacred vessel i admit that the evidence is strong said leo recovering his calmness all the same i am guiltless i was at the chapel on that night i was to meet sybil since you had forbidden me to meet her please leave my daughter's name out of this said tempest an angry spot on each cheek he was annoyed at the mention of the meeting but in the presence of raston he controlled himself out of pride i can't leave sybil's name out of it said leo sadly i would if i could but she is as anxious as i am that i should recover my good name i did meet sybil and she will tell you that i left her at the door of the vicarage before ten o'clock i therefore could not have stolen the cup i got the money to pay my debts from frank hale from hale then he will say as much cried the vicar this will go far to prove your innocence leo i don't think hale will help me much said leo coldly however we can talk of that later or you can see hale for yourself mr tempest but i declare most solemnly that hale lent me the money as to pawning the cup i said before and i say again that i did no such thing i did not take the cup i was never in battersea and i do not know the man mrs jeal calls old penny if you want to have me arrested mr tempest you will find me at mr pratt's far from wishing to run away i court an investigation leo stammered the vicar restlessly i do not want to get you into any trouble if i can help i am in the deepest trouble returned leo and more will not matter you can have me arrested if you like i know that sybil believes me to be innocent so does pratt i do not care for anyone else's opinion i think you are treating me cruelly mr tempest and some day you will be sorry that you showed so little charity i go now and i shall not see you again until such time as you give evidence against me in court and with this last bitter speech leo walked out of the room with his head in the air the two clergymen looked at one another they did not know very well what to say tempest sat down with a sigh i do not know what to think i do said raston sharply notwithstanding the woman's story i still believe that haverleigh is guiltless circumstances have so culminated that he appears to be in the wrong there is a mystery about the whole of this affair and it seems to me that haverleigh has some enemy that may be so admitted tempest struck by this remark but what is to be done i can't have leo arrested even if he were guilty which i am now inclined to doubt i cannot ruin his life what we need replied the curate is some clever man who will get to the bottom of this if you can spare me for a few days mr tempest i will go to london and see marton marton repeated the vicar who is marton raston laughed such is fame said he lightly marton is one of the best detectives in england he was leaving college when i went up and we met for a few weeks when i was curate in the battersea slums i met him again as he has a wide acquaintance with the criminal classes we renewed our college friendship and i still write to him now with your permission mr tempest i will put this case into marton's hands it is just the kind of mystery he would love to solve the man is a gentleman i suppose raston certainly he is my friend i know the pawnshop of old penny he is a scotsman if you can grasp the idea of a scotsman keeping a pawnshop i'll tell marton the whole case and we can then go to this shop if possible we may get back the cup who is to pay four hundred pounds for it asked tempest we'll see replied raston quietly i shall do nothing without marton's advice have i your permission tempest nodded i think it is the best thing you can do go to london and keep me advised of everything i should like to know mr marton's opinion of the matter it is probable he'll come down here later on said the curate but in the meantime mr tempest do nothing to haverleigh i promise you that replied the vicar and the matter being settled in this way the two men shook hands afterwards raston went to prepare for his departure while this was taking place leo was talking in the chapel with hale haverleigh had gone up to see if sybil was about as he wished to tell her of this new development of the conspiracy against him leo felt sure by this time that there was a conspiracy and that hale was concerned in it he was therefore rather pleased when he saw the cripple walking up the hill before him leo made up his mind to force the truth out of him and hurried on so as to catch him hale heard his steps and turned with a queer smile on his face he was not at all abashed by the presence of the man to whom he had told a lie but on the contrary welcomed him in the most friendly manner haverleigh was irritated by this false behaviour either you think me innocent and wish to be my friend he said or you believe that i am guilty and have some reason to be feigning good fellowship i must have some understanding with you hale come into the chapel we will not be disturbed there as it is mid day and everyone is at dinner and leo without waiting for a reply entered the door the chapel was empty even sybil was not in sight hearing the halting steps of the cripple behind him leo led the way into the crusaders' chapel where he sat down beside one of the tombs hale paused before him and looked down in a whimsical manner you have chosen a strange place he said looking round it is a sacred place replied leo coolly and you may be the less inclined to tell lies i presume you have some religion how dare you say i tell lies cried the baronet scowling because i have had some experience of your capability in that direction and now i should like to know what you mean by denying that you lent me the three hundred pounds hale shrugged his unshapely shoulders and sat down with a painful effort placing his crutch beside him you were fool enough to speak to me in the presence of my sister he said i could only say what i did say now that we are alone i am willing to answer any questions you may put to me you will answer truthfully i hope assuredly it is time we understood one another go on you lent me three hundred pounds said leo in the form of a query in gold assented sir frank coolly why did you lend it to me in gold a whim of mine i don't think so said leo slowly you had some scheme in your head i believe you wanted to deny the loan if you found it convenient you are very clever haverleigh that is just what i did want had i given you a cheque you could have proved the loan even notes might have shown the truth but i wanted to be free to act as i pleased so i went to the trouble of getting gold from the bank then it seems to me that you had this cup stolen by some confederate and intended to lay the blame on me so as to get me into a trap indeed no protested hale so loudly that leo believed he was speaking the truth the stealing of the cup and the subsequent blame being thrown on you was unexpected but i took advantage of the opportunity you can prove your innocence only by my help haverleigh and i give my evidence only on conditions i was prepared for such a speech said leo calmly but it won't do my friend you must go to tempest and tell him that you gave me three hundred pounds to pay my debts perhaps then he may disbelieve this ridiculous story of my being a thief hale sat up alertly then you didn't steal the cup certainly not how dare you suggest such a thing i suspect you know more about the loss of the cup than i do the baronet looked down on his crooked leg and smiled ironically do you mean to infer that i thrust this misshapen body through that window no but you have plenty of money to pay for any rascality i am not so fond of parting with money said hale dryly i know nothing about the cup but i really thought you stole it mrs jeal's tale ha leo started up she told you that why because she is a woman who is fond of money said hale quietly knowing that my sister is in love with you haverleigh she came to threaten me she declared that she would proclaim you a thief if i did not pay her it was her belief that such a course would break my sister's heart and what did you do i told her i would inform the police if she dared to speak to me in that manner again i believe she then went to the vicar but if i come forward haverleigh and state that i lent you the money it will go a long way towards clearing you of course i do not understand this pawning business the woman says she saw you she saw my double or someone dressed up to resemble me said leo vehemently but she did not see me i was never near the shop so you say said hale smiling cruelly however you must see that i can help you i will do so on one condition no on two i can guess the two said leo looking at his mean face you want me to surrender sybil so that you may marry her and to make your sister my wife is that not so hale smiled again you save me the trouble of an explanation he said then i absolutely refuse to do what you want hale i respect your sister who is a kind and good hearted girl but i do not love her and not for all the gold in the world would i marry her on the other hand nothing will induce me to give up sybil she shall never become your wife i wonder you have the impertinence to propose such a thing to me if you don't do what i ask said hale very pale and venomous i shall refuse to help you i shall deny that i lent you the money deny what you please leo walked to the door of the chapel everything is in your favour and you can have me arrested if you choose but i decline to sell my love to buy my safety good day hale and he marched away chapter xi the london detective sybil had seen leo go into the room where her father was waiting with mrs jeal and wondered what the woman had to do with her lover she was called out to see a sick woman on behalf of her father and on her way home bethought herself how she could see leo the girl was in a perfect fever of nervous fear for the young man then it struck her that the best thing to do would be to call at mr pratt's no sooner had she made up her mind to brave her father's anger in this respect than she went at once to the nun's house she feared if she delayed that her courage might evaporate the door was opened by adam who explained that mr pratt was from home he went into portfront to day miss said adam i only hope he will be able to get back this night as there is a sea fog coming up the channel there is no danger of his losing the road adam said sybil cheerfully but i don't want to see mr pratt it is mr haverleigh who he is in the library miss replied adam and admitted her into the house when sybil found herself alone with leo she had a qualm what would her father say should he ever come to know that she had paid such a visit leo was seated at the desk his face hidden in his arms looking most dejected he lifted his head as she entered and at the sight of his face sybil forgot all about her father and the impropriety of the visit at once she ran to her lover and drew his head down on to her breast with a look of almost divine pity my darling leo she said i knew that you were miserable and i have come to comfort you how good of you dear replied haverleigh stroking her hair but your father i did not think he would let you come to me my father does not know that i am here said sybil blushing as he placed a chair for her but i knew you had been to see him and i could not rest until i heard all about the interview was he very angry no i think he is inclined to believe in my innocence in spite of mrs jeal's story and heaven knows she has painted me black enough i wondered what mrs jeal was doing at the vicarage leo i don't like that woman she looks sly and wicked but what story can she have to tell about you dear sybil she says that she saw me pawning the cup in london and while sybil filled with surprise sat looking at his agitated face leo told all that mrs jeal had said so you see dear he continued that there is some sort of conspiracy against me i believe hale is in it too it is a strange story she said musingly i wonder who it was could have impersonated you did the man give your name by jove cried leo starting up i never thought of asking yet the rascal must have given it for the pawn ticket sybil i can't help thinking that hale knows something about this he saw me in the chapel an hour ago and said that he would make a statement to the effect that he had paid me the money if i would give you up and marry his sister sybil's eyes flashed how dare he she cried he wants to drive you into a corner leo what did you say i refused to have anything to do with him dear he can join with your father in having me arrested for all i care i would rather that than give up my sybil but you see the position what is to be done can't you go to london and see this man penny no i dare not leave the place your father and the others would think that i was seeking safety in flight i might be arrested before i got as far as portfront i don't say that your father would go so far but there is always the chance i am sure mrs gabriel would not counsel mercy for some unaccountable reason she hates me thoroughly my poor leo sybil stroked his cheek fate is very cruel to you but never mind in spite of everything i will be true to you and what is more leo i'll help you to prove your innocence how can you do that my love she pursed up her pretty mouth and crossing her slender feet looked on the ground with an air of portentous gravity i don't believe this story of mrs jeal's she said there is something behind it as you cannot go to london and i see it would be foolish of you to go away from colester at present we must do the best we can through the newspapers leo looked at her in surprise and knelt beside her what can we do with the newspapers darling put an advertisement in every london daily paper saying that the cup has been lost giving a description and offering a reward if any information is given to me to you sybil what would your father say he won't know besides leo darling you are more to me even than my father and i am angry at the unjust way in which you are being treated i will write out a number of these advertisements and send them up with post office orders the replies to be sent to 's t colester post office' but what good will that do oh you stupid darling i have to think for two i see why this pawnbroker what is his name penny well if penny sees the advertisement he will recognise the cup from the description and know that it has been stolen he will be afraid of getting into trouble with the police and he no doubt will write saying that the cup was pawned with him and that he will be willing to sell it back for the price paid then we'll get it back leo when i am certain i'll tell my father and he will arrange about buying it again yes but how does all this benefit me this penny creature will explain who pawned it and he will give the name of the person mrs jeal said resembled you he might do that if the matter were made public by advertisement if we approach him privately he will very likely deny everything we can't be too careful leo but the reward said haverleigh puzzled i have no money you have no money what will you do when the cup is back or if information is given likely to recover it i am sure my father can arrange about the money with mrs gabriel now do not say a word leo she has nothing to do with you now and after all added sybil naively i don't see why any money need pass this is a trap i am laying for that pawnbroker that is if mrs jeal's story is true which i am inclined to doubt i'll put the advertisement in on chance leo and see what comes of it but it is such a mad idea remonstrated the young man who could not follow all these feminine arguments let me tell pratt about your suggestion he will be able to advise us sybil rose to her feet and shook her head obstinately if you say a word to mr pratt i'll never forgive you let me try this experiment all alone leo dear it can do no harm and it might do a lot of good we must not tell anyone about it sybil i kept the fact of my borrowing that money from hale a secret and i have regretted it ever since let us ask pratt's advice no leo sybil was still obstinate i want to try this myself if it fails it can do no harm and if it succeeds i shall have the joy of knowing that it was i who got you out of this trouble now promise not to tell at first leo refused he did not want sybil to mix herself up in this disagreeable case even for his sake but she used such endearments and kept to her point with such pertinacity that he gave in it was useless to contend against sybil when she set her heart on getting anything she never would give in however discouraged therefore before she left the library she had drawn out an advertisement with the assistance of leo in which the appearance of the cup and its latin inscription were carefully set down a reward of fifty pounds was offered and the answers were to be sent to s t at the colester post office there said sybil when this document was completed i have set my trap now we shall see who will fall into it i'll make a dozen copies at once and have them sent off by to morrow not a word leo about this i will be silent as i have promised all the same i do not feel comfortable about your experiment to tell you the truth sybil i can't see the sense of it now don't look angry dear i know it is all done out of love for me i am not sure that you deserve my love pouted sybil as he escorted her to the door you place all kinds of obstacles in my way she was rather angry for her heart was fully taken up with the magnificence of her scheme however leo managed to calm her and gain her forgiveness he was quite unaware of what he had done wrong but sybil said that he had behaved disgracefully so he apologised then she said that she was a wicked girl and after kissing him ran away all this was very foolish but very sweet leo often recalled that interview to her in after days and they both agreed that they behaved like two most sensible people but at present leo was too sad to enjoy the stolen meeting as a true and loyal lover should have done that same night the sea fog rolled up thick and white mr pratt did not return home at which non arrival adam was not surprised mr pratt was too fond of his creature comforts to drive twenty miles through a damp and clinging mist leo had the whole house to himself and adam who thought a good deal of him did his best to make him comfortable he consulted with the cook and gave leo a capital little dinner together with a bottle of superfine burgundy then he supplied him with cigars of the best and coffee of the finest and left him comfortably seated before the drawing room fire under these circumstances leo felt happier than he had expected seeing at what a low ebb his fortunes were the position of the unfortunate young man was undeniably hard here he was deserted by his aunt mrs gabriel she had taken him up brought him up to expect a large fortune and then for no cause at all had suddenly cast him out on the world to earn his own living as best he could and in addition to this although it was hardship enough poor leo's character was gone he was accused of a sordid crime and might have to answer for it to the law he did not see what defence he could make certainly if he acceded to hale's terms he could vindicate his position in some measure by accounting for the sum of money he had used to pay his debts but in this case sybil would be lost to him and what would life be without sybil altogether leo was in low spirits in spite of the fire and the burgundy and the memory of that charming interview but it was no use lamenting as he very truly observed to himself so he tried to shake off the feeling of depression and went to bed he was young the world was large and he hoped in some way or another to sail out of these troubled waters into a peaceful haven hope was the silver lining to his cloud of black despair meanwhile raston had written to his friend marton a full account of the loss of the cup of the accusation by mrs jeal of leo and of the suspicions entertained by the villagers concerning the probity of the young man for some days he heard nothing then one evening marton himself arrived unexpectedly at colester he went at once to the curate's lodgings and was received with great surprise my dear marton this is an unexpected pleasure said raston assisting his distinguished visitor to pull off his coat i thought you would have written to me about your visit to penny i didn't go there replied marton with a laugh the fact is harold i cannot quite understand this case you have not explained matters clearly enough in your letter i have set a detective to watch penny and penny's shop and i have come down to hear all details from your own worshipful lips but what a foggy sort of place you have here i have been driving in your mail coach through a kind of cotton wool the guard thought we would never reach colester i felt like a character of dickens in that coach you are a primitive people here do you know i rather like it marton was a tall slim black haired man neatly dressed in a tweed suit he constantly smoked cigarettes and maintained a perfectly calm demeanour no one ever saw marton excited his face was clean shaven and his grey eyes were sharp and piercing he looked what he was a thorough gentleman and a remarkably shrewd clever man his fame as a detective is so well known that it need hardly be mentioned i must get you something to eat said raston no i dined at portfront before i left give me a glass of port and i can smoke a cigarette this fire is comfortable after the fog i have some excellent port marton my dear mother is under the impression that i am delicate and keeps me well supplied from my father's cellar i don't know what he says to it being a clergyman you had better not know said marton dryly your father had a vocabulary of there there i'll say nothing more i want my port my cigarette and a full account of this case it seems to be an interesting one i shouldn't have come down otherwise even for your sake my dear harold i have just twice as much business on hand as i can do with the detective life is not a happy one raston poured out a glass of port and placed it at marton's elbow he watched his friend light a cigarette and himself filled his well worn briar then when they were comfortably established he related all that he knew about the case marton listened with his eyes on the fire but made no observation until the recital was finished indeed even then he did not seem inclined to talk well said raston rather impatiently what do you think wait a bit my friend it is a difficult case i am not prepared to give you an opinion straight away i must ask something about the people concerned in it first this leo haverleigh what about him he is a good man and perfectly honest i should as soon have suspected myself of stealing the cup as leo and i have known him for some time well if anyone ought to know the truth about a man's character i should think a clergyman was the person said marton is it not balzac who says the clergy are all in black because they see the worst side of human nature humph have you had to put on mourning for this haverleigh no he has been a trifle wild and has got into debt but otherwise there is nothing wrong about him besides added the curate miss tempest is in love with him and they are engaged she is a noble girl and would not love a scoundrel ah said marton cynically i have seen a remark of that sort in novels my good man in real life but that is neither here nor there i should like to meet this young man i can take you with me to night he is staying with mr pratt at the nun's house it is no very great distance away i can wait till to morrow harold i have no very great desire to go out into this dense fog by the way who is this mr pratt a newcomer to colester he has been here off and on for the last few months and has decided to settle here he is well off and has travelled a great deal his house is beautifully furnished quite an acquisition to the neighbourhood said marton drowsily i must make the acquaintance of your people here to morrow just now i feel inclined to go to bed but tell me your opinion of this case well said marton thoughtfully from all the evidence you give me it seems that haverleigh is guilty no marton replied the curate i'll never believe that and you forget that he claims to have obtained the money from sir frank hale well then his possession of three hundred pounds is easily proved i shall see sir frank hale and question him with regard to this mrs jeal her story seems credible enough i don't suppose she has any enmity against haverleigh no but she is a woman i neither like nor trust a demure cat like creature with a pair of wicked eyes you make me long to see her said marton waking up that is just the sort of person i like to meet do you think she may have stolen this cup herself and have invented this wild story to account for the loss i have heard of stranger and even more daring things no that is out of the question marton on the night the cup was stolen mrs jeal was watching beside this sick girl the mad creature i have told you about she is innocent then i can only say that young haverleigh seems to be the most likely person only the evidence against him is so plain that i believe him to be guiltless i always mistrust too plain evidence raston it shows signs of having been prepared well i'll see this young man to morrow and have a chat i go by the face a great deal have you a photograph of him no said the curate on the spur of the moment oh yes by the way i took a group of our people at a picnic it is not a bad picture although small you can see the whole lot at a glance raston got out the photograph and marton went to the lamp to see it the more plainly he glanced at first carelessly at it then his eyes grew large his attention became fixed at that moment there was a ring at the door marton looked at the clock you have a late visitor he said a call to see some sick woman probably why do you look so closely at that picture marton there is a face here i know who is that raston looked that is the man with whom haverleigh is staying pratt pratt repeated marton in a thoughtful tone has he a tattooed star on his cheek just under the cheek bone yes and he is tattooed on the arm also the right arm i expect he had it done while he was a sailor oh said marton dryly he says he was a sailor not to my knowledge but he has mentioned something of being an amateur one do you know him marton if he is the man i think he is i know him better than you do raston then who is raston had just got thus far when the landlady opened the door to announce mr pratt here is the man himself marton marton echoed pratt who was standing in the doorway yes mr angel said marton looking straight at him pratt stood for just half a moment as though turned into stone then he turned on his heel and went out of the door and down the stairs as swiftly as he was able without a word marton darted after him by the time he reached the street door pratt had disappeared in the fog chapter xii a surprise raston was astonished when pratt disappeared so suddenly and marton rushed out after him he went to the door but his friend was not to be seen it was little use following for he did not know which direction the man had taken and the fog was so thick that he could hardly see the length of his hand before him the whole of the spur upon which colester was built was wrapped in a thick white mist and those who were abroad in the streets ran every chance of being lost the village was small but the alleys and streets were tortuous so there would be no great difficulty in mistaking the way for over an hour the curate waited yet marton did not return he could only suppose that the detective had followed pratt for what purpose he could not divine evidently marton knew something not altogether to pratt's advantage and pratt was aware of this else he would hardly have disappeared so expeditiously moreover marton had addressed pratt as angel which hinted that the american was masquerading under a false name still wondering at what was likely to be the outcome of this adventure raston placed himself at the door and waited for the return of his friend but as time passed he made sure that the detective a stranger in the village had lost his way i can't leave him out of doors all night soliloquised raston peering into the fog yet i do not know where to look for him however his own good sense must have told him not to go too far it was now after ten o'clock and most of the villagers were in bed mr raston then ventured upon a course of which he would have thought twice had the situation been less desperate he placed his hands to his mouth and sent an australian cooe through the night this accomplishment had been taught to him by an australian cousin as this especial cry carried further than most shouts raston congratulated himself that he knew how to give it it was the only way of getting into communication with marton after shouting once or twice raston heard a faint cry in response it came from the right so the curate feeling his way along the houses started in that direction shouting at intervals shortly the answering cry sounded close at hand and after some difficulty and inarticulate conversation the two men met with an ejaculation marton grasped the hand of his friend thank heaven you have found me said the detective i have been going round in a circle did you catch up with pratt asked raston no the rascal disappeared into the fog and i lost myself in pursuit of him in about three minutes why do you call him a rascal because he is one i know all about him but i never thought i should have stumbled on 'mr angel' in this locality i feel like saul who went out to look for his asses and stumbled on a kingdom is his name angel that is one of his names he has at least a dozen why he should have chosen one that fitted him so badly i cannot say by this time raston holding on to marton's coat sleeve had guided the detective back to his lodgings the man was shivering with cold for he had gone out without coat or hat he hastily swallowed a glass of port and began getting his things to go out you're not going into that fog again protested raston you'll only get lost not under your capable guidance laughed the detective you must guide me to the house of this mr pratt i intend to arrest him arrest him echoed the curate staring dear me what has he done ask me what he hasn't done said marton with a curl of his lip and i'll be better able to tell you it's a long story raston and time is passing i want to go to the man's house is it far from here some little distance replied the curate wondering at this haste i can find my way to it by guiding myself along the walls but you can't arrest him marton whatever he has done unless you have a warrant i accept all responsibility on that score replied marton grimly the police have wanted mr angel alias pratt for many a long day now the rascal knows that i am here he will clear out of colester in double quick time i want to act promptly and take him by surprise now don't ask questions my dear fellow but take me to the house i'll tell you all about this man later on by the way he is the individual who gave your church this celebrated cup yes i really hope there is nothing wrong everything is wrong i expect the cup was stolen it is stolen pshaw i don't mean this time pratt stole it himself i wonder he dare present his spoils to the church the fellow must have very little religion to think such an ill gotten gift could be acceptable stolen murmured raston putting on his coat but why who is pratt simply the cleverest thief in the three kingdoms come along raston gasped but he had no time to ask further questions the detective had him by the arm and was hurrying him to the door when outside he made the curate lead and followed close on his heels raston rather dazed by this experience turned in the direction of the nun's house and guiding himself along the walls and houses managed to get into the street in which it stood that is he and marton found themselves on the highroad which led down to king's meadows it was fully an hour before they got as far as this for the fog grew denser every moment finally raston stumbled on the gate drew his friend inside with an ejaculation of satisfaction and walked swiftly up the path that led to the house on the ground floor all was dark but in the centre window of the second storey a light was burning marton did not wait for the curate but ran up the steps and knocked at the door he also rang and he did both violently for a time there was no response then the light disappeared from the window above in a few minutes the noise of the bolts being withdrawn was heard and the rattle of the chain the door opened to show leo in his dressing gown standing on the threshold with a lighted candle in his hand he looked bewildered and angry as though he had just been aroused from his first sleep which indeed was the case what the devil is the matter he asked crossly peering out into the night you make enough noise to wake the dead who is it it is i and a friend haverleigh said the curate pushed forward by the detective is mr pratt within i suppose so replied leo much astonished at this nocturnal visitation he is no doubt in bed i can't understand why he did not hear the noise you made has he left anything at your place raston ah you knew he was going to see mr raston put in marton sharply he left here over two hours ago and i went to bed then i heard him come back just as i was falling asleep but he did not come up to my room if you will tell me what is the matter i'll rouse him let us enter haverleigh said the curate who was shivering we have much to tell you still much puzzled leo led the way to the library after shutting the door and the two men followed him he lighted the gas colester was not sufficiently civilised for electric light and then turned to ask once more what was the matter raston thought the best way to bring about an explanation was to introduce his friend who was already looking keenly round the well furnished room this is mr marton he said he is a london detective with a bitter laugh leo set down the candle on the table what he said are you the man with the bow string raston scarcely worthy of your cloth if you wanted to arrest me you might have waited until morning who is this young gentleman asked marton suddenly i am leo haverleigh mr detective replied the young man sharply and i suppose you have come here at the instance of mr tempest to arrest me marton snatched up the candle and held it close to leo's face he was apparently quite satisfied for he spoke in a more friendly tone you need not be afraid mr haverleigh he said soothingly i have not come to arrest you but to investigate the case i don't think there is any chance of your being arrested your face is enough for me but this is all very well he added impatiently i want pratt i will go and wake him said leo who could make neither top nor tail of all this but who was relieved to find that he was not in danger of arrest he retired from the room while marton darted about here there and everywhere he was like a bloodhound nosing a trail suddenly he stopped before a cabinet a drawer of which was open too late said marton in a tone of disgust he's bolted how could he bolt in this fog asked raston dubiously oh he'll find his way somehow tony angel is the cleverest of men for getting out of a difficulty he has evaded the police for years see my dear chap this drawer is open that means he has taken money or valuables from it and is now on his way to heaven knows what hiding place can you be sure of that the open drawer may be an accident besides he would not think you would act so promptly indeed that is just why he has bolted so expeditiously said marton with something of admiration in his tones angel has experienced my promptitude before and several times i have been on the point of capturing him he has taken french leave within the last two hours but for that infernal fog i should have stuck to him till i ran him down or at all events i might have disabled him with a shot the curate looked at his friend aghast a shot he stammered marton produced a neat little revolver i should have used that had i been able he said quietly it does not do to adopt half measures with our mutual friend besides if hard pressed he would have returned the compliment your haverleigh fellow is a long time he'll be back soon you can trust leo surely marton you do not think he knew anything of pratt's doings with such a face as that he knows precious little retorted marton he is a good fellow but not sharp he did not steal that cup nor did he help pratt to get away no raston our criminal friend came back here while i was blundering in the fog and after taking some money cleared out without loss of time i sha'n't catch him now i suppose the telegraph office is closed yes it closes here at nine o'clock and even if you sent a wire it would not be delivered at portfront to night no i suppose not you are all so slow in these country places it is clever of you to mention portfront raston you think that tony angel will go there how else can he get away i don't know you know the country better than i do but i tell you what our friend will not go to portfront or anywhere near it why not asked the curate bewildered because you expect him to go there angel always does the thing that is not expected i wish i had caught him i've been years trying to hunt him down and the beast has made himself comfortable here said marton with a glance round i bet you raston that the greater part of these things have been stolen stolen marton how terrible and the cup he stole that also replied marton promptly lighting one of his cigarettes oh he is a clever man is angel ah here is our young and enterprising friend well mr haverleigh so pratt has gone yes said leo looking puzzled i went to his room and found that his bed had not been slept in the back door is open although closed that is it has not been locked how do you know pratt has gone i'll tell you later throw a few logs on that fire raston it will soon burn up here is a bottle of whisky too and some soda i left that for pratt said leo somewhat surprised at the cool way in which this man was behaving and pratt was too clever to muddle his head when he needed all his wits about him by the way has his jackall gone also adam is not in if that is what you yes mr haverleigh that is exactly what i do mean ha clever man pratt he came back here straight and warning his pal walked off leaving the empty house to me and to you mr haverleigh did you hear him leave i heard nothing until you knocked at the door then i wondered why adam did not hear you the other servants are asleep at the back of the house and i suppose they also expected adam to answer the bell that is extremely probable well let us hope the remaining servants will sleep well to morrow they must leave this house why in heaven's name asked leo starting up for the very simple reason that the police will be put into possession here by me to morrow what did pratt steal the i don't understand raston what does this man mean who is he what are wait a bit mr haverleigh interrupted marton motioning the curate to hold his tongue all in good time i am horace marton a detective i was asked by mr raston to investigate this robbery and he was telling me about it at his lodgings your friend mr pratt arrived and when he saw me he bolted out into the fog i followed and lost him then i got back to raston here and we have been over two hours looking for this confounded place during that time pratt and adam have made themselves scarce but why should they do that asked leo still puzzled because this man who calls himself pratt and poses as a giver of gifts to the church is a well known london thief and his man adam is what he would call a pal 'tony angel' that is the real name of mr pratt but he had half a dozen others beside i congratulate you on your friend mr haverleigh i never knew anything of this cried leo utterly taken aback i am quite sure of that haverleigh said the curate heartily marton chuckled wait a bit harold he said do not be in such a hurry how do we know that mr haverleigh has not been working together with tony angel he may know all about him and may have been employed by him to steal the very cup which was given by pratt as an evidence of his respectability leo jumped up and would have flung himself on marton but raston held him back how dare you make such an accusation against me cried the young man furiously let me go raston don't you hear what he says wait a bit haverleigh urged the curate marton does nothing without a motive he can explain if you will remain quiet thus advised leo sat down again but in rather a sulky humour i am a trifle tired of being called a blackguard he said frowning at marton who regarded him with a friendly smile i know absolutely nothing about mr pratt save that he was a friend of mrs gabriel's and that he has been very good to me i always thought he was what he represented himself to be small wonder you did said marton coolly angel would deceive a much cleverer man than you appear to be mr haverleigh and look here i may as well tell you at once that i am certain you knew nothing about him also i am equally certain that you have had nothing to do with this robbery i cannot say yet whether pratt as i may continue to call him for clearness' sake stole the cup but you are innocent mr haverleigh and i intend to do my best to get you out of your trouble shake hands at first leo hesitated for he was still sore about the accusation but the detective regarded him in a friendly manner and his smile was so irresistible that in the end he shook hands heartily he felt that the man who spoke thus would be a good friend you know all about the case all that mr raston could tell me said the detective even to the fact that you borrowed the money for which you are accused of stealing the cup from sir frank hale then i wish you would make him acknowledge the loan said leo petulantly marton started and looked at the young man does he not do so no he is in love with miss tempest who is engaged to me and he says he will deny the loan if i do not give her up and marry his sister i suppose interposed the curate whereat leo nodded humph said marton thoughtfully caressing his chin it seems to me mr haverleigh that you have been made a tool of by unscrupulous people but i'll give my attention to this to morrow i'll get the truth out of this hale he don't dare to palter with me leave yourself and your reputation in my hands haverleigh very gladly said leo heartily but what about pratt marton reflected and took a sip of whisky and water he's gone i do not think he will appear again in colester but he has left his house and all these beautiful things behind him put in raston with a glance around i see he has made himself comfortable said marton with a shrug it was always his way this is not the first time he has furnished a house settled down he has been driven out of every burrow however this time i discovered his hiding place by accident colester was about the best place in the whole of england he could have chosen no one would have thought of looking for him here i daresay he expected to settle down and die in the odour of sanctity surrounded by his ill gotten gains but he has not gone empty handed haverleigh he is too clever for that and is always prepared for an emergency but who is pratt well you are asking me a hard question i understand he is a workhouse brat of sorts he himself claims to be the illegitimate son of a nobleman certainly he has a very gentlemanly appearance he has been working for at least thirty years and has always contrived to evade the english police i believe he was laid by the heels in america he has travelled a great deal i believe you he knows the whole world and all the scoundrels in it a king of crime that is what pratt is the generality of thieves adore him for he has his good points and he is generous well we have talked enough for to night i'll sleep here haverleigh raston i'll return to my own place said the curate rising to go and this he did but marton having found the burrow of pratt alias angel did not intend to leave it he was quite as clever as the man he was hunting chapter xiii an interesting document marton did not wish the identity of pratt to be concealed on the contrary he gave it as wide a publicity as possible hoping that it might lead to the man's capture everyone from portfront to colester knew the would be country gentleman so it was not unlikely that he might be caught considering that only a night had elapsed it was impossible that he could have got far away especially in a fog and if pratt escaped there was always the off chance that adam might be laid by the heels an examination next morning showed marton that the two bicycles were missing so he judged that both men had gone off together it was improbable in marton's opinion that they had gone to portfront as they could not possibly leave before the steamer at seven o'clock and the police could be communicated with by telegraph before they could get clear of the place at half past six marton routed a telegraph operator out of his bed and set him to work he wired to the inspector at portfront to arrest pratt and his man forthwith or at all events to detain them until the london police could be communicated with and a warrant for pratt's manifold iniquities procured but to marton's surprise no answer was returned from inspector german yet the inspector knew pratt well and if the man set foot in portfront could easily seize him later on somewhere about nine o'clock the reason that no answer had arrived became apparent a messenger came from portfront to say that the telegraph wire between that place and portfront had been cut midway there was only one line so all communication had been broken off the steamer had started and without doubt the two men were on board at once marton started off to portfront on the curate's bicycle on his arrival he went to see german the inspector was much astonished when he heard the story he had not received the wire and therefore had done nothing in marton's company he hurried to the office of the steamer you see the kind of man we have to deal with german said marton much vexed it was a clever dodge to cut the wire and yet he gave himself away i did not think he would go to portfront but the cutting of the wire proves he did we'll wire to worthing and stop him there an inquiry at the steamer office resulted in nothing it seemed that mr pratt had a season ticket and therefore had not purchased one nor had adam so it might be that he was still in the town the loafers on the pier said they had not seen pratt go aboard humph said marton he sneaked on in some disguise is he clever at disguising himself asked german i should think so his own mother would not know him still he had no time to make up before he left colester so he may not be so carefully disguised i daresay we can catch him at worthing a wire was sent to worthing forthwith and another to scotland yard requesting that someone might be sent down to take charge of pratt's house and to identify the goods he had in it there was a list of the houses pratt had broken into and a list of the stolen goods also so it would be easy to have this brought down and compared with the contents of the nun's house having thus done all that he could under the circumstances marton returned to colester where he found the curate and leo waiting for him the latter had now taken up his quarters at the inn but he kept within doors as now that the identity of pratt was known leo was credited with having been his confederate there was tremendous excitement in colester over the discovery that the village had entertained unawares a well known london thief many of the villagers flattered themselves on the stern and non committal attitude they had adopted towards the too fascinating stranger mr pratt had never been very popular but now he was spoken ill of on every hand the whole village would have been delighted to have seen him in the power of the law but pratt was too clever for them all the wire to worthing produced no result neither pratt nor adam were on board it then appeared that the steamer had put in at bognor marton had omitted to advise the police there of the fugitives so it was presumed that they had got off with the rest of the passengers the captain did not know adam by sight and pratt had evidently disguised himself well at all events in the crowd the two had passed unnoticed although the london stations were watched no sight could be caught of them a clever man pratt said marton when informed of his ill success i am perfectly certain of the way in which he went about the matter he and his servant got off at bognor and alighted at some station just outside the metropolis they got to their own haunts by some back way do you know of their haunts asked leo who was keenly interested in the matter and could not help feeling relieved that pratt had escaped oh they change them every now and then besides adam will keep out of sight and pratt will so disguise himself that there will be no recognising him he's got clean away this time and i believe mr haverleigh added marton with a laugh that you are rather pleased well said leo with some hesitation in spite of all you say i can't bring myself to believe that pratt is a bad sort of chap he was very kind to me he is kind to most people he poses as a kind of modern robin hood who robs the rich to give to the poor i have known him to do many kind actions but he is a scamp for all that and if i could lay my hands on him i'd get him mrs gabriel was much annoyed to find that pratt was so notorious a character she determined to clear herself of complicity in his sordid crimes although no one ever suspected that she had any knowledge of the man's true character she sent for marton and had a long talk with him about pratt incidentally a reference was made to leo i have asked you to see me mr marton she said because it was i who introduced mr pratt to colester i have known him ten years and he always appeared to me to be a most respectable american he is not an american at all said marton but he could assume any nationality that suited him for the moment he is a brilliantly clever man mrs gabriel and i do not wonder he took you in he got no money out of me at all events said the lady grimly ah then you escaped easily the wonder is he did not try and marry you a rich widow is exactly the kind of victim he would like i am not the sort of woman to be anyone's victim mr marton marton looking at her stern strong face quite agreed but he was too polite to give vent to his feelings he merely inquired how mrs gabriel had become acquainted with this prince of swindlers she had no hesitation in giving him full details i met him at a swiss hotel many years ago she said he was then called pratt and he posed as a rich american i met with an accident while out walking on the hill above montreux and lay out till nightfall mr pratt rescued me from this very unpleasant position and took me back to the hotel a friendship sprang up between us and when he returned to england he called on me as he was always the same for ten years and i saw much of him i never suspected that he was other than he represented himself to be besides mr marton you must admit he is a most fascinating man much too fascinating mrs gabriel as many have found to their cost mrs gabriel reflected a moment do you think he will be put in prison certainly if we catch him replied marton quietly he is a man dangerous to society all his life he has been a rogue and a criminal all his money comes to him in the wrong way that house below i believe you let it to him mrs gabriel is filled with the proceeds of his robberies he bought the furniture but the objects of art even the pictures have all been stolen in a few days i shall have some people down from scotland yard to identify the things and restore them to their owners but as to mr pratt i fear he has escaped out of the clutches of the law as usual i cannot say i regret it said mrs gabriel boldly bad as he is there are worse people in the world mr marton but tell me sir you are investigating this robbery my adopted son mr haverleigh is suspected he is perfectly innocent mrs gabriel the money he was said to have obtained from the sale of the cup was given to him by sir frank hale sir frank denies it so mr haverleigh says but i'll see sir frank myself and see what i can make of him i would rather believe mr haverleigh than anyone else he has an absolutely open nature he is a fool if that is what you mean pardon me i do not think so a man can be straightforward and honourable as mr haverleigh is without being a fool as yet i have not investigated this case as my attention has been taken up with pratt but in a day or so i hope to go to work and then i am prepared to say that the crime will not be brought home to your nephew have you any suspicions not yet i have not searched out the evidence sufficiently mrs jeal saw my nephew pawn the cup ah that is a mystery which i must fathom mrs gabriel a person resembling mr haverleigh pawned the cup but i am sure it was not your nephew there is a conspiracy against him on whose part i am not prepared to say yet but i shall find it out clear his character and punish those who have been concerned in it and now mrs gabriel i must bid you good day as my time is fully occupied let me however inform you that there is no need to excuse your association with mr pratt i quite understand how he wriggled himself into your acquaintance and you are in no way to blame once more good day marton bowed himself out but he had seen enough of mrs gabriel to note the strong hatred she bore towards leo and he wondered what could be the reason also he saw that for a moment she had flinched at the mention of conspiracy which set him on the alert as to whether her detestation of her nephew had carried her so far as to plot against his good name if there is anything the matter hale is the man to know murmured the detective he lent the money and now declines to acknowledge the loan i believe there is something bad at the back of all this poor haverleigh seems to be the most harmless of men yet he is being ruined in some underhand way well i'll settle pratt's matter and then clear his name but before marton could do this providence took the task out of his hand for the next ten days he was busy consulting with those sent down from scotland yard about the numerous stolen articles found in the nun's house the cabinet of antique coins was restored to a famous collector who had lost them five years before many pictures were replaced in the galleries of country houses and in one way and another by the time the nun's house was denuded of what belonged to other people there remained very little but the furniture and even some choice articles of furniture were found to be the property of other people it was really wonderful the amount of stolen goods that pratt had collected he must have thieved for years to have got together such a collection but he will start no more burrows said marton when all was at an end he never expected that i should find him here and therefore collected all his treasures his life is not long enough to enable him to bring together such a collection of things again besides he has not the same wide field for his knaveries the police are one too many for him now marton said this to the vicar who was deeply shocked to hear of the wickedness of the man from whom he had accepted the cup do you think that sacred vessel was stolen also mr marton asked the good man i am perfectly sure of it replied the detective promptly but we have not got the cup down on our list and no one has come forward to claim it it has not been advertised mr marton pardon me sir it has been advertised and by someone in this place i saw this notice in the daily telegraph also in the times can you tell me who 'st' is mr tempest the vicar took the newspaper handed to him and looked at it in a bewildered manner he read the notice carefully but it never struck him that the initials were those of his own daughter i really do not know who can have inserted this mr marton he said it seems to be carefully worded too and a reward of fifty pounds has been offered dear me i have a rival who is investigating the case said marton with a smile is the description accurate vicar perfectly even the inscription if you will permit me to take this away mr marton i will see if i can discover who has put it in i am annoyed that the thing should have been taken out of your hands but mr marton before i leave you let me state to you my conviction that my young friend leo haverleigh did not steal the cup ah indeed mr tempest said marton eyeing the old man keenly and what has led you to such a happy conclusion i have no grounds for it save my inward conviction there is the story of mrs jeal you know mr tempest looked troubled most remarkable story he said but we have heard of many cases of accidental resemblances mr marton i fear i have been unjust to leo and i wish to withdraw any charge i may have made against him i heard his defence and saw his face while he was making it unless the face is not the index of the mind i cannot bring myself to believe that he lied no mr marton i cannot give you my reasons but i am convinced that i misjudged leo were you prejudiced against him by mrs gabriel asked marton for leo had told him his suspicions on this point mr tempest hesitated i admit that i was he said at length she said something to me which i am not at liberty to repeat does it make mr haverleigh out a villain by no means said the vicar hastily what she told me is sad but not wicked more his misfortune than his fault i can say no more i can keep this paper mr marton thank you sir good day good day and the vicar walked away leaving marton pondering it was three days after this and when marton was about to begin his investigation of the case that he received a letter from london he was more surprised than he chose to say when he found that it came from mr pratt that gentleman gave no address he had posted the letter at the general post office so that even the district where he was hidden should not be traced the letter as marton said afterwards was one of consummate impudence and it took him all his time to read it with patience as a human document it possessed a certain value the letter ran as follows and marton swore as he read dear marton so you have let me slip through your fingers again is it not about time that you stopped setting your wits against mine several times you have tried but always you have been beaten really you must take lessons in the art of thief catching if you want to deserve the reputation you possess i am bound to say that but for the fog i should have been caught but thanks to its friendly shelter i ran back to my house while you were blundering about like a lost sheep and warned adam i knew you would have to get raston to show you the way and would be some time still i knew your infernal pertinacity and made myself as scarce as possible in a very short space of time i should like to have seen your face when you came to my house and found your prey had escaped i packed up my jewels which i always keep prepared for such an emergency as this and dressing myself warmly i mounted my bicycle adam who had likewise made his preparations mounted another and we both went down the main road in spite of the mist there was no difficulty the highway runs in a straight line to portfront and there was no vehicle abroad to make our travelling dangerous we did not hurry but took our time as i did not wish to get to portfront before the steamer went as a matter of fact we did but hung about the outskirts of the town until it was time to be aboard of course i do not need to tell you how i stopped you from communicating with the portfront police i suggested the idea and adam climbed the pole to cut the telegraph wire we had a very pleasant trip as far as bognor where we got on the train and stopped at some station the name of which i need not tell you we are now in london in very comfortable circumstances if you are clever enough to find me which i don't think you are i promise to give myself up as soon as you appear but there is no chance of my seeing you better remain in colester my dear marton and turn farmer it is all you are fit for upon my honour it is one thing i should like to know how the devil did you manage to find out my retreat i never thought you had it in you i went to see raston on some business likely to enhance my popularity in the parish and i dropped across you for the first time in my life i was taken aback was it design or accident that i found you there i do not wish to compliment you undeservedly well you have driven me away and i must find a new place in which to pass my old age it is too bad of you marton on my soul too bad i was getting so popular in colester now i suppose everyone of the honest men are swearing at me yet i never robbed them one other thing if you came down to investigate that robbery of the cup i presented to the church you can spare yourself the trouble i stole it myself it went to my heart to lose so valuable an object and i was sorry when i had given it i could not ask for it back so i resolved to steal it i went to the church and as i am a small man i climbed in through the lepers' window i got the cup climbed out again and went back to my house then i was afraid lest the cup would be seen by chance and all my popularity would go i therefore resolved to pawn it that is a way i have kept safe many a piece of jewellery i could not go myself but i sent adam he is rather like leo haverleigh and so that fool of a mrs jeal made the mistake you need not look for the cup in battersea now as i have redeemed it i took the ticket from adam and went myself it is now in my possession again and i do not intend to part with it any more you know how fond i am of beautiful things dear marton well i daresay you guessed that i stole the cup here is my confession and you can tell all those fools at colester including the vicar that leo haverleigh is perfectly innocent he has not enough brains to steal anything i only took back my own and i am proud of it as i have bamboozled the lot of you clever mr marton included leo got the money with which he paid his debts from sir frank hale you can ask him hale i mean if he denies it i leave him to you as you are clever enough to get the truth out of him he wants to marry sybil tempest and desires leo to marry his sister edith all this was a plot to get leo into his power and force him to do what was wanted i hope you will punish the young man hale he is a cripple and has all the spite of one i should have punished him myself but you have deprived me of that pleasure i therefore call upon you to do your best and now my dear marton good bye give my love to all the mourning population of colester and especially to mrs gabriel my dear and life long friend i am afraid she will not get her rent also i had the house re decorated at her expense the bills will be sent in to her let her pay them with my blessing i will write to leo myself and give him my blessing i have much to say to him that will be of no interest to you he is a good fellow and i wish to see him married to sybil he will be some day i can manage her fool of a father even at a distance now i hope you will look after yourself for my sake marton so long as the scotland yard idiots keep you on my track i am safe if you died they might perhaps pick a clever man dangerous to me my friend so with all kind regards and best wishes until we meet believe me my dear failure yours never in the flesh richard pratt chapter xiv an unexpected meeting i have been much to blame said the vicar i set myself up as a judge when i had no right to do so leo you must forgive me i forgive you freely replied the young man grasping the hand held out by mr tempest appearances were against me so it was little wonder that you did not entirely trust me still mr tempest you should have known me better than to think me guilty of such a crime i know i know i have been wrong well let us drop the subject my character is now clear and i have no wish to recall a very disagreeable past this conversation took place in the study of mr tempest and in the presence of sybil and marton the detective had shown the vicar the insolent but welcome letter he had received from pratt the confession therein entirely exonerated leo and he could again hold up his head he and mr tempest were quite reconciled sybil with her hand in leo's looked thoroughly happy i never lost faith in you leo she said sooner or later i knew that all would be well i have to thank marton for the clearing of my character sybil faith you are wrong there said marton smiling i thought you were innocent but as i had not looked into the case i saw no means of proving it had not pratt sent this confession i should still be in the dark he is a scoundrel but he is a good friend to you haverleigh i don't agree with you said tempest sharply for he was still sore on the subject of the cup pratt knew that leo was suspected and he should have come forward long ere this to put the matter right you ask too much from a man of pratt's nature said marton dryly it is wonderful that he should have confessed his guilt even at the eleventh hour however this closes the case and i can go back to london we know now who stole the cup and we know also that it cannot be recovered pratt will stick to it this time it was only his vanity and desire for popularity that made him give it away in the first instance if it came back to me i should never accept it said the vicar emphatically a stolen cup should never have been put to sacred uses i wonder at the daring of the man oh a man like pratt is capable of anything said marton with a shrug but you will never see him again mr tempest and now mr haverleigh i think you should see sir frank hale and make him confess that he lent you the money there will be no difficulty about that replied leo hale told only two people that he repudiated all knowledge of the loan one was my aunt the other myself he is too cunning to tell the world the untruth he told us besides my character being cleared he can have no further hold over me i fear he will be angry i am certain he will let us see him together leo was quite willing to do this so after taking a fond leave of sybil and a cordial one of her father he set out with the detective to bring sir frank hale to his bearings on the way marton asked leo's permission to touch upon a delicate subject haverleigh told him to speak freely i owe you too much to take offence at anything you may say he observed you have been my very good friend marton oh that's all right replied the detective brightly and i really do not deserve your thanks any help i have given you has been purely accidental if pratt had held his tongue you would still have been in the same position as before but i am bound to say haverleigh that even before the arrival of this letter mr tempest expressed his belief in your innocence i am glad of that said leo he treated me badly and it is a pleasure to me to hear that his own good sense told him i was innocent before he had the actual proof i am anxious to stand well with him marton ah that is the matter i wish to discuss i see that you and miss tempest are much attached to one another do you think the vicar will consent to the marriage i really can't say even before this scandal he seemed to be displeased with me and kept me away from his house as much as possible he did not want to see me and he would not let me see sybil we had to meet by stealth now he may have changed his mind and if he has what then then i can announce my engagement to sybil said leo but you see i am not in a position to marry and may not be for a long time i have to make my way in the world and to make money also i thought of enlisting for this war and of fighting my way through the ranks to a commission even then i do not see how you could marry you might gain a commission but not money until your worldly prospects are more secure i do not think you should engage yourself to miss tempest that is straight speaking marton you gave me permission to speak out i like you haverleigh and after the trouble you have come through i think you should be rewarded by getting your heart's desire but if you love miss temple you will not marry her until you can give her a comfortable home even if you are successful in south africa a baggage waggon is not the place for a delicate girl you can offer her nothing better than that true enough i admit that what you say is correct but what am i to do well said the detective after a pause it seems to me that you have some claim upon your aunt she took charge of you and brought you up i understand she intimated that you would be her heir and you received an education to fit you for the position if she intended to send you adrift as she has done she should at least have had you taught some profession or trade whereby you could earn your bread and butter yes i think you have a right to demand some assistance from her leo shook his head and flushed i can't bring myself to do that he said in a low voice she has insulted me so deeply that it goes against my nature to eat humble pie i would rather make my own way in the world as to sybil i shall not ask her to engage herself to me until as you say i can offer her a home you can do nothing but enlist i suppose no soldiering is all i am fit for now that my name has been cleared i will bid farewell to sybil and enlist straight away she will wait for me i am certain i get my commission i can perhaps see my way to make her my wife if i am shot well leo shrugged his shoulders there is an end to all things haverleigh said marton after a pause will you tell me what reason your aunt has for disliking you so much i don't know she has always been stern and hard with me lately she has openly hated me that is why i left her there is something connected with you that is wrong not to my knowledge i have been foolish but not wilfully wicked i know that but mrs gabriel knows something it may be about your parents that has prejudiced the vicar against you it was her influence that made him turn against you he admitted as much to me but he refused to say what she had told him i guessed all this said leo quietly but what can i do insist upon knowing what has been said you have a right to if the vicar will not speak out and he has given his word not to mrs gabriel may be forced to do so were i you haverleigh i should see her and insist upon an explanation she won't give it i should force it out of her said marton determinedly oh i know she is a hard woman but if you persevere she must give way leo thought for a few moments well marton he said at length i will see the vicar first and speak to him on the subject of sybil from what he says i may see the reason of his attitude towards me then i can call upon mrs gabriel you may be sure i shall do my best marton nodded but said no more for the present as by this time they were at the door of hale's house a demure servant opened the door and took in their names shortly she ushered them into a room where sir frank was seated in a chair by the window reading to his sister edith hale looked pale and ill she lay on a sofa but started up and blushed rosy red when she saw leo there was no doubt that the poor girl was deeply in love with the young man leo in the kindness of his heart felt a pang it seemed to him that he was treating her cruelly although the position was none of his making good day said hale without rising and including leo and marton in one swift glance i am surprised to see you haverleigh i thought you did not care about keeping up my acquaintance leo would have replied sharply but as edith was present he cast a meaning glance in her direction i should like to speak with you alone he said that is in the presence of mr marton before hale could reply marton interposed wait a bit he said in his smooth voice and with a glance at the girl there is something to be said first in the presence of miss hale in my presence she exclaimed turning red while her brother scowled yes something you will be pleased to hear you both know that mr haverleigh has been accused of stealing this chapel cup i never believed it never cried edith eagerly and leo gave her a look of gratitude which made her turn pale with emotion and you sir frank hale shrugged his shoulders i never thought much about the subject he said the lie coming at once to his practised lips the evidence was against haverleigh i admit but i tried to think the best of him your speech is rather contradictory sir frank was the dry response of marton but i think you must have thought well of haverleigh or you would not have helped him out of his difficulty by lending him money oh frank did you do that cried edith taking her brother's hand i love you for it how good you are hale's face grew blacker and blacker had he been alone he would have lied but in the presence of the sister he loved so deeply he could not bring himself to deny the truth moreover he had a kind of instinctive feeling that marton had come to proclaim the innocence of leo else why should he come at all his plot of getting leo into his power had failed he was clever enough to see that so it only remained for him to retreat with as much dignity as possible i was only too glad to help haverleigh he said quietly and with marked courtesy he was in debt and the three hundred pounds i gave him was of some use i believe i beg that he will say no more on the subject how good you are how good you are gasped edith caressing her brother leo and marton glanced at one another hale's masterly retreat took them both by surprise when leo remembered the conversation in the chapel he could hardly believe his ears the only thing to be done was to beat the man with his own weapons i will say no more hale save that when i am able the money shall be repaid i thank you heartily for your kindness sir frank bit his lip but summoned up sufficient dignity to be gracious he and leo were both wearing masks for the benefit of edith pay the money when you like he said sitting up i am shortly going abroad with my sister and i do not think we shall see one another for a long time however my solicitor at portfront will attend to the matter of the loan then there really was a loan said marton determined to get the plain truth out of hale in the presence of witnesses certainly i gave leo three hundred pounds in gold i have already said so and it was with that loan he paid his debts pursued marion yes said leo seeing his drift i paid them with that money but the good people here declared that i sold the cup to pay them how could they how could they muttered edith because they are fools cried sir frank seeing that he was completely beaten for my part i never believed that haverleigh did such a thing thank you said leo inwardly smiling at the lie then you will be delighted to hear that the thief has been found as marton spoke hale suddenly turned pale and rose with an effort the thief has been found he stammered yes replied marton with a swift glance thinking at once of his theory of a conspiracy it seems that this man angel i beg your pardon you know him as pratt stole the cup but it was mr pratt who gave it cried edith quite so miss hale afterwards he was sorry that his generosity had led him to make so great a sacrifice therefore he stole what he had bestowed and what about this story of mrs jeal asked hale trying to be amiable oh that was part of the business sir frank pratt thought the cup would be seen here even if he kept it in his house so he sent it up to london to be pawned for safe keeping you do not understand why this should be done but then you have never come into contact with a man like pratt however for reasons i need not explain he pawned the cup his servant adam is rather like mr haverleigh and it was thus that mrs jeal not having a clear view made a mistake you understand sir frank quite replied hale in a strangled voice he was pale and anxious looking leo thought that this was anger at his escape but marton took another and a more serious view i am sure you are pleased that haverleigh's character has been cleared i am pleased very very pleased said edith joyfully and so is frank are you not frank yes very pleased hale forced himself to say so much then he walked to the door i am not well he said turning for a moment you will excuse me gentlemen my sister will see you out if you he paused and darting a look of hatred at leo left the room haverleigh was more surprised than marton who had captured a fresh idea and was already building up a theory leo remained only a short time he was most embarrassed by the looks of edith and escaped as speedily as courtesy permitted when they left the house and were some distance on the road marton spoke i think there is insanity in that family he said why do you think so the girl is queer no woman in her sane senses would give herself away as she does the brother is a cripple and queer too never you marry into that lot haverleigh they have some hereditary taint i have no intention of marrying anyone but sybil said leo dryly but did you see how hale backed out of his false position yes and i believe he has more to do with this matter than you think i should not be at all surprised to find that he and mrs gabriel for some reason had been working together against you oh there has been there may be yet some conspiracy against you i can understand hale conspiring said leo he wants to marry sybil and wishes edith to become my wife but mrs gabriel why should she we have yet to find that out interrupted marton go and see what the vicar says i must be alone for a time i want to think the matter out at all events hale has acknowledged that he lent you the money in the presence of witnesses you are all right in that quarter i daresay he'll make another attempt to best you though nonsense did you not hear him say that he was going abroad with his sister i think he will leave me alone now perhaps replied marton thoughtfully we'll see i'll believe he is going abroad when he is across the channel i'm off for a long walk and the detective set off at a brisk pace leo thought no more about this especial matter leaving it entirely to marton forthwith he returned to the vicarage saw mr tempest and then and there asked him if he objected to him as a suitor for sybil at this very direct question mr tempest wriggled and looked uncomfortable you put a very painful question to me leo he said after a pause i am ashamed of myself for having thought so ill of you and i should like to make amends if possible i know that you are attached to sybil but now that you are at variance with your aunt i do not see that you are justified in asking me to consent to this engagement i know what you mean said leo proudly and i do not intend to engage myself until i am in a better position all i ask is that you will not force sybil to marry hale when i am away i should not let her marry hale in any case cried the vicar angrily i would never give my child to a cripple moreover the hales are not so sane as they might be and leo i shall not force sybil's inclinations in any way she can remain unmarried all her life if she pleases that is all i want said leo gladly i am going to enlist mr tempest and if i get a commission there may be some chance of my asking sybil to be my wife she will be true to me while i am away i know she will humph said the vicar doubtfully a commission eh leo interpreted his objection then you have something against me personally he said and for this reason you do not want me to think of sybil in any way what is the matter mr tempest i can't tell you leo the vicar looked directly at him so far as you are concerned i do not wish for a better husband for my daughter but mrs gabriel has informed me of something which makes me unwilling to countenance the marriage don't ask me what it is i cannot tell you i do not ask you to tell me mr tempest this very night i shall ask mrs gabriel herself what she has been saying better not advised the vicar it will only cause you much distress leo looked at him in astonishment what could his aunt have been saying about him or his parents likely to make the vicar take so strong a view of the matter if there is anything wrong i have a right to know he said at length i shall insist upon an explanation mr tempest if i discover any valid reason why i should give sybil up i am quite ready to yield when you next see me mr tempest i shall either have given up the idea of marrying your daughter or i shall insist upon marrying her in spite of you and mrs gabriel you cannot say that i am treating you unfairly i go now but my dear boy called out mr tempest much distressed he spoke to the empty air leo had already left the room and was out of the gate after leaving the nun's house leo had taken up his residence at the colester arms marton was there also and leo expected to see him at dinner he was anxious to tell him what the vicar had said but the detective did not return from his walk and after waiting for him till close upon nine o'clock leo left the hotel and walked towards the castle to have it out with mrs gabriel the night was moonless but there were many stars here and there a swathe of mist lay on the plains below but up on the hills all was comparatively clear leo who knew every inch of colester walked slowly out of the town gate and crossed to the other hill he took a narrow private path which he knew of wishing to get unobserved to the castle just at the foot of this path he met marton the recognition was mutual you are going to see mrs gabriel said the detective yes where have you been marton i have been trying to see her but she is ill at least so the butler says i suspect however this is a lie she doesn't want to see me shall i yes you go up i must return to the hotel and get some dinner i have been walking and thinking until i am worn out i'll wait your return and we can talk over the matter what matter the conspiracy of mrs gabriel and hale said marton promptly get on with you haverleigh i'm off to dinner and he went away at a quick pace leaving leo much astonished however there was no use in standing and wondering so he pursued his way as mrs gabriel was said to be ill and had denied herself to marton it was not unlikely that he would be treated in the same way therefore instead of going to the front door leo went round the castle on to the terrace this was shut off from the rest of the ground by a high fence with a gate in it leo had retained the key of this gate and had no difficulty in getting in the room which looked on to the terrace was lighted but the blinds were down leo peered in he saw mrs gabriel seated in a chair standing near her was mr richard pratt chapter xv a new complication leo was so surprised by this unexpected sight that for the moment he stood still then he made up his mind to interview the pair mrs gabriel and pratt evidently understood one another and the two of them together might probably tell him more about himself than one would do moreover leo was angry at the way in which pratt had let him lie under the imputation of being a thief when he could have lifted the disgrace from off his shoulders certainly pratt could have done so only at the risk of incriminating himself but at the time leo was too much annoyed to think of this he saw that there was some mystery and thinking it might have to do with mrs gabriel's enmity towards himself he interrupted what seemed to be a furious conversation by knocking at the window mrs gabriel and pratt turned in the direction where the sound came she with a pale face and pratt with a levelled revolver which he took from his breast pocket leo might have been in danger of his life but that he chanced to remember a peculiar tune which pratt had taught him in order to announce his coming while he was staying at the nun's house at the time leo had thought this was only a freak of the old man's but now that he knew who pratt was he saw that there was use in it to pratt if not to himself at all events he began to whistle hardly had he got through the first few bars before pratt's watchful attitude relaxed and he tossed the revolver on to the table mrs gabriel still continued to look agitated but pratt stepped towards the window and opened it coolly i knew it was you he said pulling leo into the room and shutting the window it is a lucky thing you remembered my signal else i might have drilled a hole in you you come at a happy moment here he stopped and looked suspiciously at the young man have you that infernal marton with you he asked with a glance at the window and a movement towards the revolver no no replied leo hastily i am all alone that's a good thing said pratt grimly i won't be taken alive i promise you but i knew you would not give me away i said so to mrs gabriel she said you would speaking the worst of you as usual leo was too much taken aback by the discovery that pratt was in the castle to reply immediately moreover the man was so cool and composed that he felt as though he were in the wrong he tried to collect his scattered thoughts but before he could open his mouth mrs gabriel spoke in her usual domineering tones what are you doing here leo she asked how did you get on to the terrace no one can get on without the key of the gate i happen to have the key said leo showing it you gave it to me yourself some years ago when i left you i took it with me by mistake it has come in useful to night you may thank your stars both of you that i did not bring marton back with me he left me at the foot of the hill with a story that you were ill mrs gabriel leo said pratt in an agitated tone surely you would not have brought the man here to get me into trouble i did not know you were here said haverleigh carelessly for he was still angered at the man i have been here ever since the night i fled from raston's house it was adam who went on to london and cut the wire and the letter in which you said you had stolen the cup i wrote that here and posted it to adam that he might send it from london mrs gabriel helped me to hide no one knows that i am in this house save herself and now you are a sharer in our secret it must be difficult to keep your presence here a secret from the servants said leo wondering how the man had forced mrs gabriel to help here the lady herself interfered it is not difficult at all she said in her most offensive tones you know nothing of what you are talking about pratt is up in the tower room and i take him food myself from my own meals it is impossible that anyone can guess well my dear aunt said haverleigh emphatically i know that pratt is here i think therefore you had better behave towards me in a more civil manner ha scoffed mrs gabriel folding her arms and looking defiant you would not dare to state the truth how do you know that said leo dryly pratt is wanted by the law he committed a theft here and allowed me to lie under suspicion why should i not give him up and accuse you of being an accessory to his concealment mrs gabriel frowned and her black eyes flashed but pratt who had taken a seat did not move he merely laughed i don't think you will give away leo he said i admit that mrs gabriel is enough to irritate a saint but if you punish her you punish me also and you deserve punishment retorted leo probably i do but i have my own opinion of the matter all i ask you to do is to hold your tongue until such a time as i can get away when are you going away soon i hope cried mrs gabriel spitefully i am rather tired of having a jail bird in my house oh you refer to that american affair said pratt airily i had quite forgotten it well my dear lady i do not intend to burden you with my presence after to morrow by this time no one will be watching for me hereabouts as i am supposed to be in london i shall go to morrow night and return to my london quarters where adam awaits me by the way haverleigh has that fool of a detective gone he is going to morrow said leo in a surly tone all the better we can travel to london together ah you smile my dear leo but i assure you that if i chose to travel with marton i should do so i can disguise myself so effectively that even he would not know me it is not the first time i have baffled him look here mr pratt or whatever you choose to call yourself said the young man calmly you have been kind to me in your own way and i do not want to take advantage of your present unfortunate position at the same time you are a thief and a criminal and i want to have nothing to do with you mrs gabriel may approve of your company but i do not wish to have you for a friend i shall hold my tongue but i recommend you to leave this place as soon as possible mrs gabriel glared at leo as she could ill brook his references to herself she half rose as though she would have flown at him but a glance from pratt quelled her and she sat down with more meekness than could have been expected from such a redoubtable termagant pratt still keeping his temper turned to leo it is very good of you to interest yourself in my movements he said in silky tones but i can look after myself it is a grief my dear fellow a great grief that i should be compelled to leave this neighbourhood i like the place and the people are fairly agreeable i was nicely settled in the nun's house and surrounded with stolen goods interrupted leo wrathfully pratt sighed i had some charming things he said how i shall miss them i am too old to make another such collection i suppose they have all returned to the people i took them from i fear the stupid creatures will not appreciate them as i have done pratt's impudence was so consummate that leo could not help laughing but mrs gabriel rose in a black fury and shook her fist in the man's face how dare you boast of your iniquities in my house she cried in your house my dear lady queried pratt blandly mrs gabriel got very white and sat down again apparently pratt had some power over her which she was afraid he might use leo had never seen the woman so cowed well well continued pratt stretching his legs i have to go thanks to that wretched man marton how was it he appeared so unexpectedly raston sent for him to london to find out who committed the robbery ah pratt laughed i hope mr marton is satisfied now my letter should have pleased him it pleased me more said leo bluntly my name is now clear and you will be glad to hear he added turning to mrs gabriel that hale in the presence of marton and his sister confessed that he lent me the money i am afraid your plot against me has failed my dear aunt hold your tongue said mrs gabriel angrily no the time has passed for that i am no longer in your power i intend to make my own way in the world with assistance from mrs gabriel said pratt quietly she will start you with a thousand pounds my dear leo i won't give one penny said mrs gabriel glaring you can do your very worst pratt i have been your milch cow long enough i would not take anything from her said leo interposing and i'll thank you mr pratt to leave my affairs alone if you will persist in meddling with them i shall not keep my promise of silence oh yes you will chimed in pratt fixing him with his eye you dare not betray me leo dare not echoed the young man angrily not unless you want to be called an unnatural son my boy leo stared not taking in the meaning of this speech for you are my son leo added pratt in low tones his eyes never leaving haverleigh's face your your great heavens mrs gabriel burst into a taunting laugh ah you know it at last she cried triumphantly and he has told you after threatening me with all sorts of things to keep me silent it's it's not true gasped leo it is perfectly true said the woman jeeringly you are the son of the cleverest thief in the three kingdoms hold your tongue you hag shouted pratt angrily for leo was as white as ashes and his face wore an expression of terrible agony i won't be quiet you told him yourself and now he shall know all as the vicar does finished mrs gabriel laughing fiercely leo started to his feet sybil he cried out staring at his enemy i know now why the vicar will not let me marry her you you told him you were an illegitimate son said mrs gabriel rapidly i did not say who was your father but now that pratt's true character is known i shall tell tempest everything then we shall see if he will let you speak to sybil again you dare say a word mrs gabriel and i but the woman was not to be stopped she turned like a fury on pratt who had risen angrily hold your tongue she said savagely i have had about enough of you and your precious son you made me take him to my home and tell everyone that he was the son of my dead brother a lie as you well know and you she added turning on haverleigh you know now why i have hated you all these years that man knows a secret of mine and he forced me to do his bidding i took you here i brought you up i gave you money and i let you take a position to which you were not entitled position mrs gabriel laughed scornfully your position should be in the gutter where you were born you are no kith or kin of mine thank god and i do thank god said leo vehemently you are a bad evil minded woman although my father is a thief i would rather be his son than connected with you in any way for years you have made my life a hell on earth with your vile temper terrible as is what you have told me i prefer the thief to the righteous woman the mistress of the castle recoiled aghast before this outbreak of anger never had the usually good tempered young man spoken so fiercely to her as he advanced towards her she believed that he was going to strike her and put up her arm with a look of terror in her eyes for once the bully was cowed bravo my boy cried pratt laughing at her discomfiture and clapping leo on the back the young man started away don't touch me he said harshly is it not enough that i should have the shame of being your son but that you should approve of any action i do but i do not believe that you are my father where is the proof in london said pratt very quietly and wincing at the tone of leo's speech if you come with me to london i can show you sufficient proof to make you believe my mother leo with a sudden thought cast a look at mrs gabriel i am not your mother she said scornfully didn't i say there was no blood of mine in your veins your mother is dead leo said pratt in a low voice mrs gabriel laughed insultingly and i daresay she was some if you dare to say another word growled pratt casting a bitter look at her i'll give your secret to the world i don't care if you do retorted mrs gabriel but leo saw that she quailed what could she have done to give a man like pratt he could not call him father a power over her you do care said pratt quietly but if you don't i'll begin by telling leo here goes leo my son in a moment mrs gabriel's defiant attitude became one of supplication she sprang forward and caught pratt by the arm don't don't she said faintly i'll do whatever you wish will you dare to speak again as you have done no no i know you are the stronger i could kill you she muttered with a flash of her old temper but i have to give in i have to well drawled pratt taking a pleasure in bringing her to her knees a position to which she was quite unaccustomed you have persecuted my poor son so that i think he should have something to hold over your head it would serve you right i don't want to know your wicked secrets said leo very pale but otherwise calm it seems to me that you are an evil couple and i heaven help me have a father who is a thief what of that said mrs gabriel getting angry again you are a thief as well are you not the cup i did not steal it said leo proudly you know as well as i do that this this he winced father of mine took it away from the chapel that is just where you are wrong he did not mrs gabriel pratt's voice sounded dangerous she was quiet at once and looked at him in a frightened way but leo had heard enough to arouse his suspicions he turned on pratt and seized him by the arm have you been telling a lie muttered the unhappy young man his father shook him off it's no use telling another one he said in a dogged way now you know so much you may as well know all i know nothing about the cup but to clear you i took the blame on myself you see leo he said calmly my character is already so bad that a robbery more or less does not matter i did it for you my boy as i have done everything else i wanted you to be a gentleman and marry the girl of your heart sybil loves you and i thought when the vicar knew you were innocent that he would let you marry her he might have done so said leo sitting down in absolute despair but since mrs gabriel told him that i was illegitimate he has never been the same he is a proud man too proud to let the son of a thief marry his child taunted the woman he doesn't know that leo is my son said pratt fiercely i intend to tell him as soon as you are away she said you will do nothing of the sort said pratt in a slow venomous way which made her shrink back by speaking to the vicar and telling a lie you have caused trouble enough he must know no more i did not tell a lie you did my son was born in lawful wedlock then why didn't you bring him up yourself said mrs gabriel with a sneer you gave him to me in london and made me adopt him i had to say that he was my nephew oh how you have used me and i have not done using you hold your tongue or it will be the worse for you you know the power i have i will not scruple to use it if you dare to do anything against my orders now you can go i want to speak to my son alone mrs gabriel seemed inclined to dispute this order but a look from her tyrant cowed her with a defiant flinging up of the head she walked out of the room and closed the door she will tell the servants said leo oh no she won't said pratt coolly you don't know the power i have over her she will not dare i don't want to know anything said leo looking down on the ground with folded arms i know quite enough are you speaking truly pratt met his gaze in a perfectly composed manner i am speaking the truth he said you are my son and your mother died two years after you were born i was then in some danger from a well no matter to make a long story short i wanted to procure a home for you where you would be brought up like a gentleman having a certain power over mrs gabriel i fixed upon her and made her tell the story of your being her nephew she did all i wished but had i known how she treated you he muttered clenching his fist i should soon have brought her to her bearings and it was this power that made her introduce you into colester society yes i can do what i like with the woman i know it is a terrible thing for you to find out what i am but i took to bad courses early leo and i went from bad to worse it is a second nature for me to steal oh leo rose with a sickening sensation of disgust don't tell me any of your evil doings i know that you are my father that you are a thief i want to know no more you have ruined my life i have not said pratt how can you say such a thing what you have heard to night need go no further i shall say nothing and mrs gabriel will be forced to hold her tongue your name is cleared of this theft did you not steal the cup broke in leo looking at his father no i did not if i had stolen it i should say so but i do not know who took it i am going to london to find out old penny the pawnbroker is a friend of mine i know enough to get him into trouble as a receiver of stolen goods so he will have to tell me who it was impersonated you you said in your letter that adam pratt interrupted impatiently adam had nothing to do with it he said i invented all that to throw dust in marton's eyes i suspect that hale has something to do with the stealing of the cup he may have taken it himself for all i know but old penny will tell me i'll get to the bottom of this you may be sure as to you leo hold your tongue about being my son and come back to mrs gabriel she will be quite willing to receive you and i can force her to make you her heir then you can marry sybil when you are rich and have an assured position the vicar will overlook the stain on your birth it is a lie certainly added pratt with a shrug but to tell the truth would be to make matters worse so we must leave things as they are for once mrs gabriel has got the better of me but it won't occur again you stay with her and i promise you she will be as polite as possible to you you will be master here leo listened to this long speech with his aching head between his hands when pratt had finished he looked up quietly it is good of you to take all this trouble he said but i cannot come back to mrs gabriel even if she loved instead of hating me i could not come back on those terms i can never marry sybil either do you think that i would let her become my wife knowing who i am your sins must be visited on me pratt i can't call you father you say you are my father and you declare that you can prove it when you are in london i expect you to do so let me know your address and i'll come up but for the moment i assume that you are speaking the truth in that case there is nothing for me to do but to go to south africa and seek a soldier's death i would rather die than marry sybil now don't talk like that leo said pratt much moved and wincing at the contempt of the young man i am not so bad as you think i have done many a kind action i can oh don't defend yourself said leo rising to go i must get away by the same way i came i shall say nothing but i hope you will be out of colester by to morrow night marton leaves in the morning so the coast will be clear i'm going now and i hope to hear from you so that you may give me proof of the truth of this story you don't believe me i do in a way it seems to be true you say so and mrs gabriel also i suppose i am your son but i am hoping against hope that you may not be able to prove the truth leo said pratt following him to the window i am your father and if you intend to leave sybil you may as well come with me i can go with you to south america and there i can lead a new life i am rich in spite of losing the nun's house i have a belt of jewels thousands of pounds of the most valuable and all stolen cried leo thrusting him back in disgust for god's sake don't speak to me any more or i shall forget that you are my father if you only knew how i loathe myself for being your son i never thought it would come to this let me go let me go and leo pulling his arm from the grasp of pratt rushed out on to the terrace in another ten minutes mrs gabriel re entered she found pratt with his head buried in his arms sobbing like a child at the sight she burst out laughing then she locked the window leo had left open get to bed pratt she said contemptuously and pleasant dreams to you chapter xvi sybil's visitor leo had never felt so wretched in his life as he did the next day seeing that he was greatly disturbed marton wished to learn the reason as haverleigh had promised to keep secret the presence of his father at the castle he was obliged to evade a direct answer i saw mrs gabriel he said quietly we had a long conversation and she told me what she had said to the vicar is it a serious matter asked the detective serious enough to prevent my marriage replied leo but what it is i do not feel called upon to explain it concerns myself and no one else if you could help me marton i should tell you but you cannot no one can i don't think there is any more to be said seeing the young man thus determined marton said no more as he did not wish to force leo's confidence the next morning he took his departure assuring haverleigh that he was always at his disposal when wanted depend upon it he said as he took leave you are not yet done with mrs gabriel she will get you into more trouble when she does write to that address thank you marton should i require your assistance i will write the two men parted marton to london and leo back to the inn he was very miserable the more so as he had to avoid the society of sybil knowing what he did it was impossible for him to talk of love to her he felt that he had no right to do so that he was gaining her affections wrongly sooner or later he would have to leave her but he did not wish to break away abruptly little by little he hoped to withdraw himself from her presence and thus the final separation would be more easy all the next day he wandered alone on the moor where there was no chance of meeting with sybil the morning afterwards he received a note from mrs gabriel stating that a certain person had taken his departure leo was then in a fever of anxiety lest the person should be captured however he learned within twenty four hours that there was no need to worry an unsigned telegram came from london intimating that the sender was in safety and would communicate with him when the time was ripe leo took this to mean that pratt could not easily get at the papers verifying his story owing to the vigilance exercised by the police who were on the look out for him leo therefore possessed his soul in patience until such time as all should be made clear meantime as he told pratt he was hoping against hope that the story was not true certainly pratt had spoken in what appeared to be a most truthful way he had exhibited an emotion he would scarcely have given way to had he been telling a falsehood but haverleigh knew what an actor the man was and until proof was forthcoming still cherished a hope that a comedy had been acted for some reason best known to pratt himself that is it was a comedy to pratt but to leo haverleigh it approached perilously near to tragedy afterwards looking back on the agony of those few days he wondered that he had not killed himself in sheer despair but he could not remain in the same place with sybil without feeling an overwhelming desire to tell her the whole story and thus put an end to an impossible situation once she knew the truth that he was the son of a criminal she would see that a marriage was out of the question leo was quite certain that she would still love him and after all he was not responsible for the sins of his father but for the sake of mr tempest she could not marry him nor as he assured himself would he ask her to do so two or three times he was on the point of seeking her out and revealing all but a feeling of the grief he would cause her made him change his determination he resolved finally to leave her in a fool's paradise until he had proof from pratt of the supposed paternity but to be near her and not speak to her was unbearable so he sent a note saying he was called away for a few days on business and went to portfront here he remained waiting to hear from pratt and no man could have been more miserable a mood scarcely to be wondered at considering the provocation meantime colester society had been much exercised over the discovery of leo's innocence and the supposed delinquency of pratt certainly as haverleigh and mrs gabriel knew pratt had generously taken on his own shoulders the blame which had wrongfully rested on those of the young man but no one else knew this and even if pratt had come forward and told the truth no one would have believed him he had been so clearly proved to be a thief and the scandal concerning the stolen goods in the nun's house was so great that there was no ill deed with which the villagers and gentry of colester were not prepared to credit him mrs bathurst was particularly virulent in her denunciations of the rascal but i always knew that he was a bad lot said mrs bathurst did i not say it was incredible that a wealthy man should come down to pass his days in a dull place like colester how lucky it is that we found out his wickedness thanks to that dear mr marton who is i am sure a perfect gentleman in spite of his being a police officer i shall always look upon him as having saved peggy the creature so she always called her former favourite wanted to marry peggy i saw it in his eye perhaps i might have yielded and then what would have happened i should have had a jack the ripper in the family oh scarcely as bad as that mrs bathurst said raston to whom she was speaking pratt was never a murderer how do you know that mr raston for my part i believe he was capable of the most terrible crimes if he had married peggy the very idea makes me shudder but the dear child has escaped the snares of evil and i hope to see her shortly the wife of a good man here mrs bathurst cast a look on her companion raston smiled he knew perfectly well what she meant failing the wealthy pratt who had been proved a scoundrel the humble curate had a chance of becoming mrs bathurst's son in law and raston was not unwilling he loved peggy and she loved him they understood one another and had done so for some time never would peggy have married pratt had he asked her a dozen times but as she had told raston the man had never intended to propose knowing this raston was glad to see that mrs bathurst was not disinclined to accept him as a suitor for her daughter he then and there struck the iron while it was hot i do not know if i am a very good man mrs bathurst he said still smiling but if you think me good enough for peggy i shall be more than satisfied i have the curacy and three hundred a year my family you know all about and i suppose you have formed your own conclusions as to the merits of my personality i am not likely to turn out a criminal like pratt you know really mr raston you take my breath away said mrs bathurst quite equal to the occasion i never suspected that you loved peggy still if such is the case and she loves you and you are prepared to insure your life in case you die unexpectedly i do not mind your marrying her she is a dear girl and will make you an excellent wife thank you mrs bathurst then i may see peggy now she is in the garden harold mrs bathurst had long since informed herself of the curate's christian name so as to be prepared for an emergency of this sort go to her and take with you a mother's blessing thus burdened raston sought out peggy and then and there told her that all was well they could love one another without let or hindrance the engagement had been sanctioned officially by mrs bathurst peggy laughed consumedly when raston related the pretty little comedy played by her mother she must think you a donkey harold she said mother thinks everyone is as blind as herself mrs bathurst fancies herself very wide awake my dear those who are particularly blind always do harold then they began to talk of their future of the probability of sybil becoming the wife of leo and the chances of mrs gabriel taking the young man again to her castle from one subject to another they passed on until peggy made an observation about pearl she is out and about i see said peggy but she still looks thin and no wonder her illness has been a severe one but she will soon put on flesh and regain her colour she is always wandering on the moor and the winds there will do more to restore her to health than all the drugs in the pharmacopoeia of james why does she go on the moor said peggy i thought it was the chapel she was fond of sitting in ah she has changed all that said raston sadly it seems i think i told you this before that mrs jeal told her some horrible calvinistic doctrine and poor pearl thinks she is lost eternally it was her idea that the cup was given into her charge and now she believes that the master has taken it from her because she is not good enough to be the custodian poor girl said peggy sympathetically but i thought harold that she believed the cup had been taken up to heaven for the supper of the master she did believe that till mrs jeal upset her mind anew now she thinks she is lost and i can't get the terrible idea out of her head she is like a lost thing wandering about the moor only one cure is possible what is that harold the cup must be restored to the altar she has built an altar has she built one i followed her on to the moor the other day wishing to calm her mind some distance away in the centre of the heather she has erected an altar of turf and she told me that if the master forgave her he would replace the cup which he had taken from her on that altar she goes there every day to see if the cup has returned if it did i believe she would again be her old happy self but there is no chance of the cup being returned no said raston a trifle grimly pratt has got it again in his possession and he will not let it go save for pearl i do not think it matters much we could never again use it for the service of the chapel a cup that has been stolen cannot be put to sacred uses do you think it was stolen i am certain of it everything belonging to that man was stolen what a pity peggy that such a clever fellow should use his talents for such a bad purpose a great pity i liked mr pratt and even now although he is such a wretch i can't help feeling sorry for him so do i peggy there was good in pratt let us hope he will repent but now darling don't let us talk more of him he has gone and will never come back what about the wedding day oh harold began peggy and blushed after this the conversation became too personal to be reported it is sufficient to say that the wedding day was fixed for two months later while all these discoveries in connections with pratt were being made in colester events which had to do with sybil's advertisement had happened which prevented her keeping it any longer a secret from her father she put off telling him till the very last moment but when one day a london visitor arrived she was forced to speak out a card inscribed with the name lord kilspindie was brought to her and on the back of it was a pencilled note hinting that the gentleman had called about the advertisement sybil ordered that he should be shown into the drawing room and went to her father's study the vicar was preparing his sermon and looked up ill pleased at the interruption what is it sybil he asked i am busy please forgive me for interrupting you father she replied coming to the desk and putting her arm round his neck but i have something to tell you something to confess you have been doing nothing wrong i hope said tempest suspiciously i don't think it is wrong save in one particular that advertisement it was i who put it into the papers sybil and you never told me the vicar was annoyed at the same time he felt relieved that it was nothing worse he fancied that she might be about to confess that she had married leo it was no use telling you until something came of it father replied sybil calmly so do not be angry now that the whole mystery has been cleared up the advertisement is useless but i received one answer to it a gentleman called lord kilspindie wrote to me at the post office as 's t' asking to see me about the cup he had something serious to say about it i was curious i think you would have been curious yourself father so i wrote and giving my real name and address asked him to come down here he is now in the drawing room tempest rose to his feet looking vexed lord kilspindie in the drawing room and i only know of the matter now really sybil you have behaved very badly what does he want to tell us something about the cup i suppose said sybil do you know lord kilspindie father no more than that he is a border lord and a wealthy man i believe he has a splendid and famous castle near the tweed sybil you should have told me i am sorry but i didn't think it was worth while until he came you are not angry father i have done nothing so very bad and it was my eagerness about leo that made me take up the matter you offered a reward of fifty pounds how is that to be paid sybil laughed i don't think there will be any question of reward with lord kilspindie she said besides he has not brought the cup you know that mr pratt has it and is likely to keep it come father forgive me and let us see lord kilspindie i am filled with curiosity you are a wicked girl said the vicar indulgently and gave her a kiss if you do this again i never will father unless leo is again in danger the vicar sighed his conscience pricked him about leo and he did not know how to act towards making amendment certainly if he gave his consent to the marriage leo would be more than repaid for the ill thoughts entertained about him but tempest was filled with pride of race and could not bring himself to give his beautiful daughter to a nameless man however he could not consider the matter now since his illustrious visitor was waiting in the drawing room so with sybil he went to greet him miss tempest said lord kilspindie coming forward with a look of admiration at the beautiful girl before him and you sir sybil allowed her father to speak as was right and proper i am the vicar of this place lord kilspindie said tempest politely and this is my daughter it was she who put the advertisement in the paper i presume that it is to that we owe the pleasure of your company that and nothing else said lord kilspindie taking the seat pointed out to him by the vicar i have been looking for that cup for over twenty years it is not in your possession it was for a few weeks replied the vicar who was very curious i had better tell you the whole story and then you can judge for yourself if you will be so kind replied lord kilspindie courteously he listened attentively while mr tempest narrated all the events in connection with the cup from the time pratt had arrived in colester the story was a strange one and the visitor was much interested however he did not offer one interruption sybil watched him the meanwhile he was a tall grey haired man of over sixty but still vigorous and straight his face was lined however as though he had undergone much trouble he had a soldierly look about him and all the time the vicar was speaking tugged at a long grey moustache the only hair he wore on his face sybil thought of the line in the ancient mariner about long and lean and brown as the seashore sand she could not quite recall the quotation but to her it described kilspindie perfectly he was rather sad looking and his quiet grey eyes looked as though he had known bitter trouble and indeed he had sybil learned that later a very interesting story he said politely when mr tempest had finished but disappointing in its ending you say this man pratt has now the cup in his possession he confessed as much my lord in a letter to the detective in charge of the case it is a pity he has escaped with it a great pity responded the other i suppose there is no chance of his being captured from what mr marton said i should think not put in sybil he says that pratt has baffled all the cleverest detectives in england for a great number of years kilspindie sighed no chance of getting it back he murmured and the luck will still be bad the luck echoed sybil catching the word you will think me superstitious he said with a smile but the fact is that the cup is said to be a fairy gift and has been in our family for generations the luck of the family goes with the cup like the luck of edenhall said sybil remembering longfellow's poem precisely responded kilspindie the legend is a curious one i must tell it to you some time of course my opinion is that the cup is of roman manufacture i recognised it from its description and especially from the latin motto you set down in the advertisement i think that goblet was dedicated to bacchus and was probably lost by some roman general when scotland was invaded by the caesars all this time mr tempest was trying to recover from the horror of his thoughts a pagan cup he gasped and a stolen cup oh my lord and it was used as a communion cup pratt said that he had brought it from italy where it was so used by the romish church i thought it was sanctified by such a use and did not hesitate to put it again on the altar i really don't know what to say it is like sacrilege i am sorry mr tempest but the cup has been at kilspindie castle for five hundred years it never was used in the service of the church over twenty years ago it was stolen by a woman by a woman echoed sybil she had quite expected to hear pratt's name chapter xvii lord kilspindie explains before you begin your story my lord said the vicar will you please inform me how you came to know of the loss of the cup i have already done so mr tempest i saw the advertisement offering a reward for its recovery the description and the quotation of the latin motto were sufficient to show me that it was my heirloom i wrote to the office of the paper and afterwards received a letter from miss tempest here asking me to call i have taken up my abode at the inn as i may stay here for a few days i want to know all i can about the matter if i can only trace and recover the cup through your agency i shall be eternally your debtor i cannot tell you more than i have related replied the vicar this man pratt took back the cup and is now in london where no one knows i fear the cup is as lost as though it had been swallowed up by the ocean it is enough that i know in whose possession it is said kilspindie with determination in some way or another i shall find this man for i may tell you mr tempest that besides the recovery of a family treasure i have another and more important object in view the recovery of my son who was stolen from me at the time the cup disappeared tempest expressed much astonishment at this information and sybil opened her eyes wide she had never thought that her attempt to clear the character of her lover would lead to such a result neither she nor her father knew what to say and seeing them silent lord kilspindie continued to speak how the cup came into the possession of this man i cannot say it was taken from the castle by a nurse called janet grant who also carried away the child why did she do that asked sybil horrified out of revenge for a fancied slight she received from my wife replied kilspindie with a sigh but it is best i should tell you all from the beginning first you must know the legend of the cup that you may understand the value we grants attach to its possession i am fond of folk lore murmured the vicar settling himself down for a pleasant half hour your family name is grant then my lord yes our title is kilspindie an earldom my son who was stolen my only son and only child alas is lord morven if he be still alive but who knows if i shall ever see him again hope for the best said the vicar gently god is over all you are right mr tempest but how many weary years have i waited and have had to comfort myself in that fashion now when i had lost all hope the advertisement roused it again if i find the cup i may discover my boy or at all events i may find out if he is alive or dead i am sure he is alive said sybil impulsively dear lord kilspindie if there was no chance of your finding him i should not have been guided to put in that advertisement it was entirely my own doing and had i consulted with my father it would never have appeared it certainly would not said the vicar promptly i had placed the matter in the hands of mr marton and i was angry when i saw the advertisement very angry indeed you must not be angry any more mr tempest said kilspindie with a smile seeing that it may lead to the discovery of my son i owe much to miss tempest's indiscretion as you no doubt call it no said sybil resolutely i am sure papa does not call it that i did it to help leo and i would do it again but tell us the legend lord kilspindie the old man laughed if you have not the imagination of the celt you will think it but a poor thing he said in the days of bruce and on the border nigel grant the head of the clan my ancestor mr tempest was riding home from a foray against the english he had been successful and had collected a large mob of cattle which were being driven to the castle by his followers he was anxious to get home for when he had left two weeks previously his wife was expected to give birth to a child the chief eagerly desired that it might be a boy for he had few relatives and those he had were his bitterest enemies what said tempest and the scotch so clannish they are more clannish in the highlands than on the border replied the old lord many of the border families fought with one another my clan did also for many a long day although they are friendly enough now however you know the reason that nigel grant was so eager for an heir wouldn't a girl have done asked sybil mischievously by no means the chief wanted a brave boy to bestride a horse and wield a sword and govern the unruly grant clan with a strong hand he had prayed to the virgin to give him his heart's desire they were all roman catholics in those days remember so you may guess he rode home at top speed and as he neared the castle he was far in advance of his followers and alone and then came the fairies the fairies echoed sybil this is interesting and she laughed we call them the good neighbours in scotland you know because the fairies don't like to be talked about with disrespect but to go on with my story nigel grant was on a wide moor all alone although the lances of his men at arms glittered on the verge of the horizon suddenly from the viewless air apparently since there was no rock or tree or shelter of any kind there appeared a small woman dressed in green with a golden crown at the sight of her the chief's horse stopped all at once as though stricken into stone the fairy queen for it was she the same i suppose who appeared to thomas the rhymer ah she was mounted on a horse said sybil half to herself indeed well this queen was on foot and in her arms she carried a child stopping before nigel she placed the child on his saddle bow and told him to take it home for a year and a day 'if it returns to us safe and sound' she continued 'great good fortune will befall the grants but if anything wrong is done to it then will sorrow come' so speaking she vanished and the horse suddenly regaining motion galloped home to the castle bearing the amazed chief with his child in his arms his child my lord asked the vicar smiling it had to be his child for a year and a day he found that during his absence his wife had given birth to a fine boy but that a day or so after it was born the cradle was found empty lady grant was in a great state of terror as you may imagine when the chief told his story she declared that her child had been carried off by the good neighbours it was her wish to kill the changeling but this the chief mindful of the prophecy would not permit it was supposed that the fairy child required to be nursed by a mortal woman and this was why the chief's boy had been carried away i never heard that version of the old story before said tempest no it is usually said that the fairies want the child for themselves but in this story what i have told you was believed lady grant hoping to get back her own child in a year and a day nursed the changeling it was a peevish cross whimpering creature and marvellously ugly but when she fed it with her milk it grew fat and strong and became good tempered on the night when the year and a day were up there was heard the sound of galloping horses round the castle a wind swept into the rooms and down the corridors everyone in the castle fell into a magic sleep but in the morning the true child was found smiling in his cradle and the fairy changeling was gone in the cradle also was the cup i am seeking and a scroll saying that while it was kept in the family no ill would befall but that if lost the line would be in danger of extinction and did the prophecy ever come true asked sybil twice replied kilspindie with the most profound conviction in the reign of the first james of scotland the cup was stolen and three brothers of the chief were slain in battle only the child of one of them lived for the chief had no family then the cup was brought back i could tell you how but the story is too long and the child was spared to become the father of a large family and the second time asked tempest wondering how much of this wild tale the old lord believed the second time was in the reign of henry viii the castle was sacked and the cup taken all the family were killed but the nurse managed to save one child with whom she fled after a series of adventures the cup was restored and the child regained his inheritance how strange said sybil and now that the cup is lost again kilspindie smiled well you see miss tempest i have but one son and he is lost if i do not find him the title and estates must go to a distant cousin and the prophecy of the fairies will be fulfilled that is why i am so anxious to get the cup if i can find it and bring it back to kilspindie castle i am certain that i shall find my boy a wild story said the vicar after a pause there is oftentimes a grain of truth in these folktales but tell me how came it that the cup was stolen the third time i am about to tell you replied the visitor there was a woman called janet grant the daughter of one of my tenants she was in service at my place but after some years she became weary of the dull life we are not very lively up in the north said kilspindie with a laugh however this woman got tired and went up to london there i believe she obtained a situation but what her life was while absent i do not know she was always reticent on the point after six years she returned in the interval i had married and at the time janet returned or a year before my wife became a mother i was the father of a splendid boy my son and heir lord morven janet was taken back into my service as an under nurse for she was a very capable woman had she a good temper asked sybil guessing what was coming one of the worst tempers in the world also she was evil in her disposition had i known then what was told to me afterwards by the other servants she should never have re entered my service but they were all afraid of janet and her wicked ways and therefore remained silent when it was their duty to speak out when the boy was two years of age or it may be a trifle over the head nurse died janet expected to succeed but my wife appointed another woman she did not trust janet hinted the vicar no by this time janet was not so careful in her behaviour and my wife began to suspect her true character janet was very angry at the slight as she called it and swore she would be revenged of course she knew the legend of the cup so it struck her no doubt that if she stole the cup the usual disaster would follow what superstition murmured mr tempest well i don't know sir said kilspindie quietly you see mr tempest we had chapter and verse for what might happen however janet out of revenge took away the child and stole the cup she had no difficulty in doing either the cup was placed in the picture gallery under a glass shade for no one ever expected that it would be stolen it was not guarded so carefully as it should have been but who would have thought that any one of my faithful servants would steal as to the child janet was one day sent out with him the head nurse remained at home i believe she then took the cup with her at all events she never returned and when a search was made both the child and the cup were missing here lord kilspindie stopped and shook his head what happened after that asked sybil curiously there is no more to tell miss tempest the woman vanished utterly with the child and the cup my wife poor soul died of grief i employed all manner of means to find the woman but without result i even offered a reward and a pardon if she would bring back what she had taken but she gave no sign of her existence well kilspindie sighed that is all i have been a lonely man for over twenty years and things have gone wrong with me in every way i am certain that prosperity will not return to me and mine until the cup is brought back then i may hope to recover my son you can understand now how anxious i am to find this man pratt i would willingly pardon him all if he would give back the cup i wonder how he became possessed of it said tempest ah said kilspindie that is what we must find out he seems to be an accomplished thief so it may be that he stole the cup on the other hand janet finding herself hard up may have pawned it and pratt may have got it into his possession in that way you tell me that he has a love for beautiful things such a love said the vicar sadly that he is willing to be a thief to obtain them well my lord at present i do not see how we can help you there is one way said kilspindie after a pause give me a letter to this mr marton and with his aid i may succeed in tracing pratt in the meantime i intend to wait here for a few days at my age i am not able to get about so rapidly as i once did the man did indeed look old and worn out but he was a fine courtly gentleman of what is called the old school and sybil was quite fascinated with him after some further conversation it was arranged that he should remain at the inn until the end of the week it was now wednesday and that afterwards the vicar should accompany him to london to introduce him personally to marton leaving her father and kilspindie together sybil went to her room to think over the strange episode which was the outcome of her advertisement she was anxious to tell leo all about it but he was at portfront and she had received no letter from him sybil wondered at this as it was not like leo to neglect her for the moment she was inclined to drive to portfront and see him he had given her no reason for his departure and she was becoming anxious about him mrs gabriel still remained in seclusion and so far as sybil knew leo had never been to see her it was therefore no use talking to mrs gabriel about the man she had so cruelly cast off her father she could not appeal to because although he wished to make amends to leo for his unjust suspicions he did not wish him to marry her and would therefore do nothing likely to bring them together in this dilemma it struck sybil that she might see raston he was a kindly creature and all through the dark day had believed in haverleigh's innocence she thought that raston might be induced to bring leo back from portfront so sybil put on her hat and sought out the curate he was at home and delighted to see her this is an unexpected pleasure miss tempest he said wheeling the armchair forward i hope there is nothing wrong why should there be anything wrong asked sybil smiling raston passed his hand across his forehead with a troubled air this fact is i do not feel well this morning he said i have received a letter from town which has worried me but do not let me inflict my troubles on you miss tempest what can i do i'll tell you mr raston but first of all you must promise to keep all i tell you a secret i don't think i am breaking confidence in saying what is in my mind as i gave no promise of secrecy but i must tell you all as you are the only person who can advise me i promise to keep your secret whatever it may be miss tempest then listen to the latest information about the cup said sybil and forthwith related to raston the news of lord kilspindie's arrival and how he had been brought to colester by means of the advertisement having made this preliminary explanation she related the story which had been told to her father and herself as no promise of secrecy had been given sybil did not think she was doing wrong and besides it was necessary for raston to know all the details before he could help her to bring leo back finally she had the utmost confidence in the curate's silence it is a most extraordinary story he said when she had finished and more curious still here he stopped short and considered i can tell you what is in my mind later he said at present you must let me know in what way i can serve you i want you to help me with leo said sybil promptly for some reason he has gone to portfront and is stopping there i would go over myself and bring him back but i am afraid of offending my father i want leo to be introduced to lord kilspindie for what reason miss tempest sybil looked at the ground and began to draw diagrams with a dainty shoe well mr raston you know that i want to marry leo she said with a blush and at present there are so many obstacles to our engagement my father is not so just towards leo as he should be i suppose this is because he is poor and has no prospects if he enlists and goes to the war i do not see how that will bring us together even if he gets a commission i cannot marry him there will not be enough money now i thought that as i had done something to bring lord kilspindie a chance of getting back the cup he might be induced to do something for myself and leo something might come of it certainly miss tempest i am sure lord kilspindie is very kind she said in a feminine way he looks kind leo has delightful manners as you know mr raston he is clever in his own way and well educated lord kilspindie might take a fancy to him and make him a secretary or something at all events he might put him in the way of earning money for i am sure that lord kilspindie has power as well as wealth then you want leo to come back and meet him yes you must tell him all i have told you and say that if he loves me he must come back at once i shall do what you say miss tempest and if i can induce leo to return he certainly shall i do not know why he went to portfront his name was cleared and he need have had no hesitation in remaining at colester i'm sure i don't know what is the matter with him said sybil with a sigh he has been so strange lately i am sure he is keeping something from me but if i get him to myself i'll find out what it is but you will go to portfront mr raston yes this afternoon in fact i was going that way in any case miss tempest as i intend to journey to london why are you going to london asked sybil in surprise she knew that raston rarely went to the great city the curate hesitated again and rubbed his hair in a distracted way i would rather you did not ask me miss tempest he said at length i am going to london in answer to a letter i hope to be back on saturday i have to preach on sunday as you know the vicar said something about taking a service at portfront as lord kilspindie will be at church on sunday said sybil i think papa will stay he looks upon lord kilspindie as his guest well in any case i'll be back said the curate with a nod then i shall be able to tell you the reason i had to go in the meantime miss tempest i wish you would see pearl darry occasionally she goes wandering about the moor lamenting her lost soul poor creature i have been with her a good deal but while i am away she may do something desperate you see her miss tempest and persuade her that she is under the care of the master i'll do my best replied sybil but i am afraid i am not good enough to preach mr raston what a shame of mrs jeal to put these ideas into the girl's head she knew that pearl was not sane and to make her think such things was downright dangerous i know raston sighed if we could only get back the cup pearl would be satisfied that the master is pleased with her and has taken her into favour again then she would recover her old faith in the goodness and love of god which mrs jeal with the best intentions no doubt has destroyed i cannot think mrs jeal is a good woman i am sure she is a very bad one said sybil emphatically however i'll do as you wish mr raston good day a pleasant journey and she departed the curate took out a letter glanced at it shook his head he was puzzled by the communication and knew not what to make of it chapter xviii a miracle that same afternoon raston notified the vicar that he was going for a few days to london on the understanding that the young man would be back for morning service on sunday the vicar readily consented that he should go raston forthwith packed his bag and driving to portfront stayed there the night but for sybil's message he would have waited until the next day and have gone directly to london without pausing on the way however he wished to have a talk with leo both on account of sybil's message and because he wanted to consult with the young man about the letter which worried him this entailed a long conversation so raston put up at the hotel at which leo was staying and sent a message that he wanted to see mr haverleigh leo made his appearance looking haggard and worried and very much unlike his usual self he seemed nervous on seeing raston and hurriedly approached him as though he expected to hear bad news the events of the last few weeks had shaken leo's nerves and he was prepared for any calamity even to hear that pratt had been arrested something of the sort he expected to hear now hullo raston he cried with an affectation of brightness what brings you here i am on my way to london said raston shaking hands in a friendly fashion and i am staying here for the night as i want to have a long talk with you very glad replied leo mechanically then after a pause he raised his head there is no bad news i trust he asked anxiously by no means my news is good then it cannot concern me said leo bitterly no good news ever comes my way now what is it i'll tell you after dinner no tell me now i can't wait i am so anxious and worried that my mind cannot bear suspense you brood too much on things said raston however the matter is very simple miss tempest wants you to return at once to colester what for has her father discovered anything bad about me raston laughed no you are getting morbid on the subject the result i suppose of your late experience of man's injustice if you will sit down i will tell you what she asked me to say it is a long story an agreeable one i hope muttered leo dropping dejectedly into a chair i really cannot bear much more worry without going to chuck myself into the water haverleigh said the curate severely that is an ungrateful way to speak after the mercy god has shown you has he not brought you through much tribulation and set your feet on a rock of safety well there are two answers to that raston however i'll try and behave myself while you tell me what sybil said raston sighed not knowing leo's worry he was beginning to think him wrong to behave as he did still this was not the time to preach and unlike most clergymen raston knew where to stop he sat down near leo and related the whole story of lord kilspindie and his loss then he detailed sybil's idea that kilspindie might do something for the young man and if your future is arranged you can then be married i shall never be married raston said leo gloomily if you knew but i must keep my own counsel what takes you to london he asked suddenly you are such a home bird that there must be some strong reason the very strongest replied the curate drawing a letter out of his pocket but first you must promise to hold your tongue about what i am going to tell you leo nodded i have too many unpleasant secrets of my own not to keep those of others he said well what's up read this letter from pratt pratt haverleigh took the letter hurriedly why what is he writing to you about he cast his eyes over the letter it was to the effect that pratt would be glad to see raston at a certain place in london to speak with him about the cup which had been lost it asked the curate to keep the contents of the letter a secret or at all events to tell only leo haverleigh also it warned raston that if he behaved treacherously and brought down the police on pratt that there would be the devil to pay these last words were underlined and shocked the curate the time and place of the appointment were also underlined and from the way in which the meeting was arranged leo could see that his father had contrived to see raston without running the risk of arrest i wonder what he wants to see you about said leo handing back the letter and speaking uneasily he fancied that pratt might be going to reveal to raston the secret of his own paternity about the cup said raston returning the letter to his pocket i suppose he is about to give it back to us again not that it will ever be used again for so sacred a purpose i shall take it and return it to lord kilspindie that is only right as the cup was stolen from him ah i forgot you think that pratt has the cup said leo he has do you not remember the letter he wrote to marton saying he had stolen the cup and again had it in his possession i remember but that was one of pratt's fairy tales how do you know asked raston astonished has he written to you no i have seen him in london in colester raston pushed back his chair and stared at his friend when did you see him in colester he asked open mouthed a few days ago leo pondered for a moment while raston stared at him he wondered if it would not be as well to make a confidant of the curate and ask his advice the secret was rapidly becoming too much for him to bear alone raston was his friend a good fellow and a wise young man certainly it would be well to confide in him leo made up his mind i have to tell you something that will astonish you i speak in confidence raston anything you tell me will be sacred replied the curate with dignity leo nodded quite satisfied with this assurance then he related all that had taken place in the castle on that night when he had discovered mrs gabriel and pratt in company raston fairly gasped with surprise as the recital proceeded and when leo confessed that pratt claimed him as a son he sprang from his seat i don't believe a word of it he cried bringing his fist down on the table the man is a vile liar whomsoever you may be leo you are certainly not the son of this wretch can a bad tree bear good fruit no but he can give me proofs he has not done so yet let me speak to him leo i may be able to get more out of him than you i am your friend you know that so if you will place the matter in my hands i promise to find out the truth somehow well said leo with some hesitation i rather thought of coming with you to london pratt expects me he has not written to that effect said raston i tell you leo the man is dangerous and unscrupulous the fact that he claims you as his son will prevent you dealing freely with him i can manage him better myself you go back to colester and miss tempest it is but right that you should do what she wishes as she has held by you in your time of trouble besides i quite approve of her wish to introduce you to lord kilspindie and if oh raston stopped short what's the matter raston suppose you should be the long lost son of lord kilspindie ridiculous said leo shaking his head and flushing it is no more ridiculous than that you should be the son of a thief or rather believe yourself to be so why should you believe the bad and doubt the good see here leo raston was much excited the cup was lost along with the child pratt has the cup why should you not be the child the woman who stole both might have died and passed them on to pratt for his own purposes he says that he is your father i can't believe it raston said leo shaking his head well disbelieve it if you choose if the thing is so what you think will not alter it all i ask is that you should let me represent you at this interview i have to see pratt on my own account let me see him on yours very good raston you can do what you like i am greatly obliged to you for the trouble you are taking indeed it is only right leo protested the curate i begin to see that you have been wronged i may not be right in my surmise about your being the son of kilspindie but i am sure that i am correct in saying you are not the son of that scoundrel now go back to colester hold your tongue and wait till i come back on saturday i'll do as you wish said leo sadly but indeed i have no hope i have said the curate emphatically and the conversation ended the next day raston departed by the steamer to london via worthing and leo returned to his old quarters at the colester arms his meeting with the curate had done him good and although he did not adhere to raston's theory about his noble paternity yet he felt more cheerful and hopeful he was particular as to his toilet which in his despair he had rather neglected of late and went to the vicarage sybil was away with pearl on the moor the servant said leo would have followed but mr tempest caught sight of him and insisted that he should enter and be introduced to lord kilspindie leo willingly obeyed as he was anxious to see his supposed father according to raston he could not help smiling when he was presented kilspindie was taken by that smile he saw before him a singularly splendid young man with a graceful slender figure and a handsome face but best of all was the kindly look in the eyes kilspindie shook hands heartily with leo and sighed as he thought that his lost son might be just such another had he known of what raston and the young man before him had talked about on the previous night he might have been more particular in his inquiries and might perchance have been brought to think as raston did however he knew nothing leo said nothing and the conversation resolved itself into the common place tempest was kind to leo kilspindie was friendly and the three got on very well meanwhile sybil and pearl were walking across the moor after a time they stopped at the turf altar erected by the mad girl and she explained to her companion the reason she had made such a place the master is angry with poor pearl now she said sadly and he has taken the sacred cup from her she is not good enough to keep it but when the master is pleased and will save pearl from the pit she shuddered he will place the cup on this altar and pearl will bring it back to the chapel then she will be saved and happy but pearl you must not think of god in this way he is your father and he loves you he did love pearl but he made her ill and mrs jeal told pearl that she was wicked and in danger of the worm pearl pearl do not believe that mrs jeal is wrong god loves you why then did he make pearl ill if he loved her and why did he take away the holy grail which pearl watched over so carefully he did not take it away said sybil hardly knowing what reply to make yes he did persisted the poor mad creature pearl was not good enough to keep it but when she is good the cup will come down to earth again do you think it is in heaven now pearl i am sure it is no roof here to stop the cup from floating up to the new jerusalem in the chapel it would have stayed because the bad roof kept it down but here it went up and up and up to the sky sybil did not know what to make of this talk she soothed the girl as much as she could and tried to bring her back to that old happy state of mind which mrs jeal had destroyed with her gloomy calvinistic creed but it was all of no use only the restoration of the cup would make pearl believe that she was good again however sybil induced her to talk of other things of birds and flowers and the poor creature was in a quieter state of mind when sybil brought her back to the cottage i go every morning to the altar said pearl as she went inside the cup will come back when the master is sorry for pearl at this moment mrs jeal pulled her into the house and scolded her for being away when she saw sybil she became more civil but still behaved in a covertly insolent manner sybil grew angry you have behaved very wickedly in putting these ideas into pearl's head mrs jeal she said severely the poor creature is not responsible she does not understand she understands more than you give her credit for miss retorted mrs jeal coolly and she is not fit to be left alone but when i go away i shall put her in an asylum indeed you will do nothing of the sort cried miss tempest indignantly the poor thing would die liberty is all in all to her when are you going away i go with sir frank hale miss i am going to be the maid of his sister i heard sir frank was leaving colester said sybil coldly and i think it is the best thing he can do when does he go mrs jeal in a week miss i have got a good situation miss and i do not want to be burdened with pearl she must go to an asylum no no i shall take charge of her myself said sybil you leave her to me mrs jeal and i'll look after her well i might miss i'll see then after a pause mrs jeal asked about that gentleman at your place miss will he stay long only till the end of the week i suppose you mean lord kilspindie mrs jeal's wicked eyes blazed yes i mean him she said and gave an unpleasant laugh oh so he goes at the end of the week well miss before i take up my situation with miss hale i'll come and see you about pearl if you could take her i should be glad but you'll find her a nuisance i don't think so said sybil coldly when will you call after the departure of lord kilspindie said mrs jeal with another wicked look and went into the house sybil departed wondering why the woman had asked about lord kilspindie and why she seemed afraid to meet him had she been clever enough she might have guessed the truth as it was the matter passed out of her mind after this there were some very pleasant evenings at the vicarage leo felt almost happy in spite of his troubles he could not as yet bring himself to tell sybil that he could never marry her besides he was hoping against hope that raston would bring back some good news from london not indeed that he leo haverleigh was the lost son of lord kilspindie that such good fortune should be his never entered leo's head but that pratt was not his father leo felt that he would rather be proved to be illegitimate as mrs gabriel had told the vicar he was than have such a father as the criminal pratt yet at times he felt sorry for the man it was certain that he had in him some good qualities but whenever leo thought of him as his father he became enraged against him the thing was too horrible lord kilspindie took wonderfully to leo and this the vicar was pleased to see owing to leo's want of an honest name he could not bring himself to consent to the marriage so he hoped that the scotch lord might take a fancy to the young man and carry him off thus sybil would be safe and leo would be provided for mr tempest had evidently forgotten his own youth or he would have remembered that loving hearts are not so easily severed leo and sybil loved one another too well for aught to come between them on saturday night raston returned it was so late that leo had not expected him so they did not meet until the next morning then it was on the way to church well leo asked eagerly and what does my what does pratt say i'll tell you after service said raston hastily at present i can't think of these things but one word raston urged leo is pratt my father no replied the curate emphatically he is not and before leo could ask another question he ran off filled with joy at the intelligence but much bewildered leo went to church to offer up thanks kilspindie was also in church and with sybil in the vicar's pew mr tempest allowed raston to preach as had been arranged and took a very minor part in the service indeed he did little else but read the lessons the church was filled as everyone was anxious to see lord kilspindie mrs bathurst was there wondering if his lordship could be induced to marry peggy she quite forgot that she had promised her daughter's hand to the curate and was already scheming to get at the old nobleman that he was old did not matter to mrs bathurst she would have sold her daughter to anyone provided the match was a good one and curious to say she would have considered that she had done her duty as a mother her moral nature was decidedly warped the service was almost over and the church wardens were handing round the bags for the collection when a sweet voice was heard singing in the distance everyone recognised the voice it was pearl's and the vicar kneeling at the communion table looked rather disturbed he knew the eccentric ways of the girl and he feared lest she might come in and distract the attention of the congregation and his fears were fulfilled pearl still singing entered the church the scandalised church wardens would have kept her out but that she bore something which made them open their eyes the congregation also became aware of pearl's burden and a gasp of astonishment went round still singing some wild vague melody the mad girl walked slowly up the aisle bearing the sacred cup lord kilspindie did not see her until she was almost at the chancel steps he then gave a cry of astonishment in spite of the building and the occasion surely he might have been pardoned for the fairy cup upon which depended the fortunes of the grants glittered before his eyes there was a dead silence everyone was too astonished to speak or move the vicar himself was staring from the communion table at this miracle but raston who had come down to receive the collection stood quietly waiting till the girl reached him she came up singing placed the great gold cup in his hand and fell on her knees the master has forgiven pearl she said in a voice which could be heard all over the church she is saved and the cup will be here to watch over for ever and ever amen amen and she bowed her face in her hands raston paused for a moment in hesitation and glanced at the vicar then at lord kilspindie then he made up his mind and walking up to the altar placed the cup in its old position and there it glittered all gold and gems with the sunlight striking down on it until it became almost too glorious to look upon lord kilspindie stared with tears in his eyes the cup would be his again and he would soon have his son he never doubted but that the restoration of the one was the prelude to the discovery of the other raston pronounced the benediction and the organ broke forth into jubilant music shortly the congregation streamed out everyone was much excited the old nobleman came out with sybil and they waited at the porch for the vicar leo also was with them suddenly a woman broke through the crowd in the churchyard it was mrs jeal and she was seeking pearl in her haste she never noticed lord kilspindie until she almost ran into his arms suddenly he saw her face started and made one stride forward to clutch her by the arm the cup and then the heir he said loudly while all looked on amazed janet grant where is my son lord morven chapter xix a story of the past half an hour later and lord kilspindie was back in the vicarage library with janet grant or as it may be more convenient to call her mrs jeal mr tempest was present together with leo and mr raston and they had assembled to force the truth out of mrs jeal this was no easy matter all the evil in the woman was uppermost and with her shawl wrapped round her tightly she sat there and defied them all you may burn me you may put me in prison said mrs jeal savagely but i won't open my mouth i'll have you arrested unless you tell the truth said lord kilspindie arrest me then snarled mrs jeal there's a policeman handy my lord why are you behaving like this woman asked the vicar sternly why she retorted violently because i was badly treated by my lord there i served him faithfully for many years yet in place of giving me the position to which i was entitled he set another woman a woman i hated over my head but i paid him out she said revengefully oh many a sad hour you have had my lord and many more you will have i know where your son is but i won't tell you have got back the cup but the son my lord morven she sneered will remain in the humble position in which i have placed him something is gained said kilspindie you have revealed that my son is alive and well i'll get the rest out of you never mrs jeal shut her mouth with a snap and shook herself i'll not speak another word what a wicked woman you are said the vicar sadly mrs jeal's eyes flashed a wicked glance at him but true to her determination she held her peace it seemed impossible to do anything with so pronounced a vixen hitherto raston had been silent now he came forward i am able to deal with this matter he said quietly and i have a way of making the woman speak mrs jeal shook her head and glared the vicar and kilspindie both looked at the curate so did leo he was beginning to have a faint hope that the scene would end in the discovery that he was the rightful son of lord kilspindie with an anxious face he sat in the corner and drank in eagerly every word which fell from raston's lips mrs jeal maintained her self imposed silence mr tempest said raston when i asked you if i might go to london i did not tell you my errand i tell it to you now it was to see the man known as pratt what exclaimed the vicar you saw that man two days ago he wrote asking me to see him hinting that he had something to tell about the cup which he stole said kilspindie no my lord pratt did not steal the cup he took the blame upon himself so as to clear the name of my friend haverleigh both the old men looked at leo who winced are you sure of that asked the vicar pratt wrote to marton remember to take the blame upon himself quite so but he was not guilty for all that his record was so black when marton unmasked him that he thought a crime more or less would not matter but why should he shield haverleigh asked mr tempest leo started forward he saw that the time had come for him to speak out i can answer that he said pratt told me that i was his son tempest uttered an exclamation you must be mistaken he said mrs gabriel informed me that you were illegitimate that would not have made any difference said leo bitterly i might as well be the illegitimate son of pratt as of anyone else as a matter of fact however he told me that i was born in wedlock his wife my mother died and he placed me with mrs gabriel to bring up she believed that i was a nameless orphan and what she told you mr tempest was true so far as she knew her telling was none the less spiteful however it was that which made you unwilling that i should marry sybil yes said the vicar with a flush i did not like to think that a daughter of mine should marry a nameless man and you visit the sins of the parents on the head of their innocent offspring said leo you have not treated me well mr tempest you thought me guilty of theft scorned me because i was nameless is this the conduct of a minister of the gospel the grey head of the vicar drooped i admit that i have been wrong leo he said in a faltering tone you have vindicated your character i ask your pardon and more said he when leo grasped his hand even although there is a stain on your birth no said leo i don't want you to bind yourself to anything wait till this mystery is cleared up at present so far as i know i am the son of a criminal if that is true i should refuse to marry sybil here mrs jeal burst out into a taunting laugh lord kilspindie frowned upon her and took leo's disengaged hand the vicar held the other you are a good man haverleigh said his lordship far from suspecting the truth i wish i had you for a son and mrs jeal laughed again when quiet was restored raston went on with his story first he said i must tell you how i recovered the cup i went up and met pratt as i promised not to deliver him into the hands of the law much as he deserved punishment he spoke to me freely and i was with him three hours i do not know if i was right in letting such a dangerous criminal escape said the curate looking round but if i had given information to the police i should never have heard the truth about leo nor should i have secured the cup then i am not his son cried leo eagerly no pratt gave me his word for that who you are you shall hear presently here raston gave a glance at mrs jeal who was moving her hands restlessly and seemed to be ill at ease meantime i must go on with the story of the cup it seemed that pratt knew the pawnbroker penny and having learnt from mrs jeal's story that he had the cup he went to get it back and to learn who had pawned it and who did asked the vicar sharply raston gave the answer he least expected mrs jeal pawned it said he the woman sprang to her feet and found her tongue it is a lie she shouted furious with rage then she made a rush for the door lord kilspindie put his hand on her shoulder and forced her back into the chair i am beginning to suspect the truth he said sternly sit still or i will have you punished she scowled and relapsed into a dogged silence raston went on to tell how the cup had been stolen it seems that when pearl darry was ill he said this woman watched by her bed the poor mad creature was delirious and raved about the cup mrs jeal persuaded her that she would be eternally punished what for heaven only knows she is a child of sin groaned mrs jeal she is as pure and good as an angel cried the curate frowning it is you who are the evil doer mrs jeal well mr tempest the girl thought in her half delirious state that she would test the goodness of god she proposed to take the cup out of the chapel and place it on an altar of turf which she had prepared on the moor it was her idea that if god wished to save her he would take the cup up to heaven and then replace it at a later date on the altar she therefore while mrs jeal was absent dressed herself and ran out of the house she went to the house of old barker the sexton his door was not locked he told a lie about that to save himself and she knew where the key of the church hung it was in her hand in a moment and she went to the church sometime about ten o'clock she entered and took the cup then she replaced the key on its nail after relocking the door one moment interrupted mr tempest those scratches on the lepers' window we thought if you remember that the robber had entered that way i shrewdly suspect that old barker made those scratches to save his own skin said raston you had better ask him and it may here be mentioned that the vicar did and learned that what raston said was true the old sexton finding the cup gone feared lest he might be accused of the robbery and so conceived the idea of making marks as though someone had entered at a window which his fat body could not possibly have squeezed through it was a clever idea and misled all but old barker was punished by being sent to portfront after he had confessed it was when pearl left barker's cottage with the cup that mrs jeal met her went on the curate she had missed her out of bed and thinking that the mad girl had gone to the chapel followed she met her at the door of the cottage and saw that she had the cup it was then that the idea came into her wicked head to steal the cup it's a lie cried mrs jeal again it is what you told old penny anyhow as he is prepared to swear in court said the curate coolly he would not give you what you asked for the cup until you told him where you got it for a wonder you told the truth yes mrs jeal you followed pearl on to the moor and saw her set the cup on the turf altar waiting till she got back to your cottage you took the cup and concealed it under your shawl you took it home and found the girl back again in bed very ill from the effects of exposure for a time you nursed her while the hue and cry was being made about the cup then you made the excuse that your father was ill and went to london you have no father mrs jeal and old penny in answer to a letter of yours sent the wire you told him you had something for him and so he aided you with your plot you took the cup to london pawned it to old penny after telling him the story and got five hundred pounds for it i did not i did not mrs jeal tried again to rise and again had to remain lord kilspindie kept his heavy grip on her shoulder in his rage at her duplicity he could have slain her but he spared her for the moment that he might learn the truth after many years of darkness dawn was breaking mrs jeal saw that the end was in sight and began to sob then continued raston you banked the money and came down to tell that wicked lie about leo haverleigh you know that he was never near the place that he was innocent and that you were guilty however pratt got all this out of old penny and then gave him the five hundred pounds for the cup he took it to his own place and when i was with him he handed it to me come said kilspindie there is some good in the man he has to make reparation to you my lord said raston solemnly for he is this woman's husband and it was by his direction that your son was stolen yes here the curate pointed to leo and there is your son leo rose slowly as pale as a corpse he had expected this yet when it came the thing was too much for him he could only look at his newly found father in silence lord kilspindie gasped and he too turned pale then he made one stride forward and grasping leo's hands stared into his face yes he muttered i believe you have her her he turned on mrs jeal woman is this true he demanded but mrs jeal with a cruel smile on her fat puffy face still sat silent i could strangle you muttered lord kilspindie exasperated by her obstinacy i can make her speak said raston taking an envelope out of his pocket and here is the means of doing so still holding leo's hand lord kilspindie looked at the curate mrs jeal remained quiet a contemptuous smile on her lips and her eyes on the floor tempest much interested in this strange scene sat waiting for the end it would seem that the result was in raston's hands after i had received the cup and had heard its story the curate continued i began to question pratt about leo at portfront leo had already told me of the claim pratt had made to being his father i did not believe it for i know haverleigh's upright nature and could not think that he was the child of such a bad man at first pratt insisted that he was the father i then appealed to his better instincts and told him how leo had made up his mind to give up miss tempest rather than make her the wife of a man with such antecedents as his i think pratt really loves you leo for after a time he yielded to my entreaties and told the truth i am sure he likes me said haverleigh quietly he was always very kind to me bad as he is i at least have no reason to complain of his treatment but what did he say asked lord kilspindie anxiously i shall leave mrs jeal to tell she can repeat to you the story pratt told me i'll not say a word muttered the woman resolutely i can compel you replied raston sternly try was mrs jeal's disdainful retort the curate turned towards kilspindie pratt's story had a great deal to do with his wife my lord and on several points he referred me to her i told him that she would never speak for i well know how obstinate she is pratt then agreed to help me 'for leo's sake' he said he wrote out something and placed what he had written in this envelope i did not see what it was and i do not know now the envelope is sealed as you see now added the curate looking at mrs jeal who was beginning to show signs of uneasiness if you tell the story of how you stole the child and prove that mr haverleigh is really lord morven i will hand this letter to you with the seal unbroken if you refuse i will open the envelope now and act on the contents pratt assured me that what is contained herein would cost you much more than your liberty the three men looked at the woman her face was livid and the perspiration beaded her forehead twice she tried to speak but her mouth opened and shut without a sound will you speak asked raston quietly give it to me she muttered in a husky tone and stretching out her hand for the envelope raston withdrew it beyond her reach not until you have told us the story he said if i do will you give me the letter yes with the seal unbroken i do not know what iniquity you have been guilty of but we are all willing not to know so long as you inform us of your minor fault i have your promise to give me the letter as it is asked mrs jeal yes said raston and the other three men echoed his response mrs jeal nodded well satisfied and wiped her pale face with the end of her shawl she then took a key out of her pocket will one of you gentlemen go to my cottage she said and open the third drawer in the chest of drawers in my bedroom standing opposite to the door there you will find a parcel wrapped up in brown paper i want it brought here immediately shall i go said leo rising no said lord kilspindie i have you and i mean to keep you mr tempest no doubt has a servant whom he can trust tempest nodded and touched the bell the old butler who had been with the vicar for over twenty years appeared take this key said his master handing it to him mrs jeal will give you directions how to use it lose no time in coming back mrs jeal repeated her instructions and the servant departed on his errand then the woman rose to her feet and began to talk with an assumption of courage which would have been ludicrous had it not been so pitiful still she fought well and was game to the last you have got the better of me she said or rather that brute of a tony angel has peached if he had held his tongue i could have defied the lot of you as it is she shrugged her fat shoulders and paused ask me what questions you like she said i am in your power i must reply is this my son asked kilspindie his hand on leo's shoulder yes that is lord morven leo uttered a cry and looked at his father with moist eyes the revulsion of feeling was too much for kilspindie and he sank down into a chair leo held his hand and there was silence for a few moments i am thankful to god that he has spared me to see my son again said kilspindie solemnly and the vicar added a solemn amen and thank god that i have a father and an unsullied name said leo almost too moved to speak nor was this emotion unmanly on the part of father and son the least sentimental person must grant this much kilspindie remained seated in his chair and holding the hand of his newly recovered son both men fixed their eyes on mrs jeal who in a cold and unemotional way continued her confession i was brought up on your estate my lord she said and there i met with pratt or rather with tony angel he came on a visit to the village to get away from the police he was a handsome and fascinating man and i fell in love with him whether he loved me or not i cannot say at all events he pretended to i left your service and married him we went to london and then i discovered that my husband was a thief at first i was horrified in those days my lord i was not the hardened sinner you see me now but after a time pratt as i may call him made me as bad as himself he taught me to love fine things and comfort and as he always made plenty of money by stealing i had a gay life oh we had fine times i can tell you he go on with your story mrs jeal said the vicar sternly she tossed her head but obeyed after a time things got bad pratt was so well known to the police that he was not so successful as he had been i used to tell him about kilspindie castle and the cup pratt who loved beautiful things wanted to get the cup he proposed that i should go back and steal it i was already known in the castle so there would be a better opportunity for me to get it than himself as i wanted money i agreed and i came back to the castle did you re enter my service in order to steal the cup asked lord kilspindie yes replied mrs jeal defiantly you had plenty without it i entered as an under nursemaid and as i was comfortable i thought i would stay for a while pratt came up and urged me to steal the cup at once i refused as i did not wish to leave my good situation then an idea came into his head that if i could obtain the child of a nobleman he could hold it as a hostage what do you mean asked raston the meaning is not difficult said mrs jeal coolly pratt was always in danger of being taken by the police and his record was so bad that he would have been shown no mercy he thought if he had lord kilspindie's son that when he got into trouble he could promise to restore the child on condition that he was set free a clever idea muttered the vicar and a very wild one said his lordship what influence could i bring to bear towards helping a criminal what indeed sneered mrs jeal i assured pratt that your lordship had no power but the idea of getting the child as a hostage fascinated him and he commanded me to steal the boy for a time i refused then the head nurse died and another woman was set over my head my lady treated me badly she insulted me she showed that she mistrusted me i was angry and i determined to be revenged i was revenged by obeying pratt i took the cup and the child and went away how i i know how you stole both the child and the cup said lord kilspindie very good my lord well i went to london with pratt he pawned the cup and on the money we lived for a time then he insisted that as he might some day have to restore the child we called him leo said mrs jeal with a glance at the young man it was necessary that he should be brought up as a gentleman he knew mrs gabriel whom he had met abroad he had some power over her and what is the power asked leo mrs jeal shook her head that has nothing to do with you or with the restoration of your rights lord morven she said i keep that secret to myself pratt had a power over her and used it he brought the child to her and said he was a natural child he insisted that she should bring him up as the son of her brother who had just died abroad how pratt knew this i do not know but then he knew everything well it was done and leo was established at the castle mrs gabriel brought him up yes said leo bitterly she brought me up and he looked back on the long life of petty worry and contemptible tyranny that had been his i know all this but yourself mrs jeal i remained with pratt i was only too glad to get rid of you i hated you for your mother's sake stop that cried lord kilspindie and mrs jeal dropped a mocking curtsey at your lordship's service however i found out that pratt was treating me badly he went about with other women he even struck me i made up my mind to leave him and i did i went from one place to another and finally i came to settle in colester why did you come here asked the vicar oh your reverence can understand that i wanted to keep an eye on the young lord said mrs jeal obsequiously he was my property as well as pratt's and when the day came to give him up to his father i wanted my share of the spoil you shall have nothing said lord kilspindie sternly you ought to be glad that i do not hand you over to the police she scowled and would have become vituperative but raston moved the hand which held the envelope significantly at once a frightened look came over her face and she sat down i stayed here she continued feebly all the strength having gone out of her and saved pearl darry from her father when pratt came i was afraid i was always afraid of pratt no one knows but myself what a devil he is he told me to hold my tongue and i was too frightened of him to disobey now i'll go away from here with the hales since miss sybil has promised to look after pearl i want to put the seas between myself and that man he terrifies me and i am not a woman easily terrified why did you tell that lie about my having pawned the cup asked leo mrs jeal shook her head i can say no more she said leo would have insisted but at that moment the servant entered with the parcel of which the woman had spoken when he went out mrs jeal opened this and spread out the contents on the table here are the evidences your lordship wished for she said glancing at lord kilspindie this is the dress lord morven wore when i took him away his name is marked the underclothing is also marked the coral necklace which your lordship may perhaps recognise as an heirloom and your lordship may perhaps remember some mark by which lord morven can be recognised there is a mark if your lordship remembers kilspindie drew his hand across his forehead and thought my wife showed me the child one day and pointed out the mark yes three moles in a line just above the elbow of the left arm mrs jeal nodded and leo hastily stripping off his coat drew up his sleeve to show the three moles in question but i don't need that to assure me that you are my son said the old nobleman you have the eyes of your mother yes you are my son and lord morven i congratulate you leo said raston shaking his friend's hand and i have to thank you with all my heart said the new lord morven for if it had not been for you this would never have been discovered i should like to know however how it was that pratt claimed me as a son that was mrs gabriel's fault said raston she told him that you intended to denounce him to the police when you discovered him at the castle on that night he was afraid lest you might do so therefore he said you were his son so as to put such a betrayal out of your power as if i would ever have betrayed him said leo there was good in pratt there is no good in him cried mrs jeal fiercely how dare you say so he is a bad and wicked man i hate him with all my soul but never will i set eyes on him again he might kill me as he has often threatened to do but i have told all i have proved your identity lord morven and you have the cup my lord kilspindie the the letter she hesitated those present looked at one another should this dangerous woman go free to be a pest to society said the vicar sternly you promised said mrs jeal terrified and white to the lips leo looked at her for a moment then took the letter from the hands of raston and gave it to her we must keep our word he said and you must leave this place at once said mr tempest austerely but mrs jeal was paying no attention to them she had torn open the letter and was reading the few lines it contained i thought so she muttered with a black look i wish i could kill him she crushed up the paper and put it into her pocket again then she walked to the door good day my lord morven and good bye lord kilspindie you are poor creatures both of you your reverence will now be glad to sell your daughter for a title as to you mr raston the girl you love would have been sold to my husband by her mother i wish you joy all you men fools and with a mocking curtsey mrs jeal walked out of the room let her go we know the truth said lord kilspindie leo but leo with a nod was making for the door i must tell sybil he said and vanished half an hour later the vicar and his father went in search of him they found him sitting hand in hand with sybil in the drawing room it's really wonderful wonderful she was saying and your father will let me marry you now darling said leo if you will grant him your pardon said the voice of mr tempest leo shook the vicar's hand kissed sybil and kilspindie smiled well pleased chapter xx mrs gabriel's secret mrs jeal was not pleased she was a woman who liked to make mischief and preferred to leave sorrow rather than joy behind her in her time she had caused a good deal of misery and she had always rejoiced over it but now that she had been forced to undo the evil she had committed her heart ached bad as pratt was his wife was worse and if he had indeed killed her as he had threatened he would have been doing a service to mankind mrs jeal was a noxious snake who should have been killed without pity on leaving the vicarage she went home at once and found the cottage empty as pearl had not yet returned mrs jeal brought out the letter and again read it then she turned white and shivered finally she put it into the fire and watched it burn to black ashes afterwards she filled herself a glass of brandy and drank it neat yet she was an abstemious woman as a rule there must have been something very terrible in that letter to make her take to strong drink and what was in it no one in colester ever found out having burned it mrs jeal put it out of her mind as well as she was able yet often afterwards she shivered to think of what would have happened had it been opened in the vicarage library a narrow shave that muttered mrs jeal shortly when she had recovered herself in some measure pearl danced into the room she was now quite her old happy self the restoration of the cup made her believe that god had forgiven her and that the master believed her worthy to be the guardian of the holy grail raston had arranged the matter in order to save her from further misery early on sunday morning he had taken the cup across the moor and had placed it on the turf altar knowing that there pearl as was her custom would come and seek it he had not anticipated such a dramatic scene as had taken place in the chapel pearl believed in her own weak mind that the master had brought the cup down again from heaven she was therefore glad and merry and her singing and dancing annoyed mrs jeal keep quiet you minx she cried savagely or i'll have you shut up where have you been after making an exhibition of yourself i have been looking at the cup said pearl gaily it is on the altar i am pleased the master has given it again into my charge he has forgiven me and some day i shall be with him in paradise it was in mrs jeal's wicked mind to tell the truth to the girl but she knew that pearl would not accept the explanation besides strange as it may seem even mrs jeal had some compunction in making the girl miserable the woman was evil to the core but she must have had some good in her therefore she held her tongue on the subject of the cup where were you so early this morning she asked i found your bed empty at six o'clock i went to the altar to find the cup brought down by the dear master replied pearl and i was watching sir frank hale and his sister going away they drove with two horses and many boxes i did not mrs jeal jumped up and seized pearl's arm what do you mean she asked has sir frank hale gone and his sister said pearl twisting away with a frightened face they have left colester and gone away away oh far away oh oh what are hold your tongue said mrs jeal thrusting her into a chair and sit you there till i come back she hurriedly put on her bonnet and shawl if you stir i'll kill you and she hurried out of the house pearl's news was true there was no one in the hale's house save an old woman who was to act as caretaker she explained that sir frank and his sister had left early that morning and by this time were on their way to london whence they departed in a few days for the continent did they leave no message for me asked mrs jeal her face growing black as she clenched her hand no why should they asked the crone contemptuously what have fine folks like them to do with a woman like you i'll slap your face if you talk to me like that raged mrs jeal her worst nature coming uppermost i have influence with your master i can have you turned away no you can't replied the other hag why i heard sir frank say how glad he was to get away without seeing you he called you a witch he he he did did he muttered mrs jeal furiously now just you she was going on to threaten the caretaker when she found the door banged in her face and heard the mocking laughter of the old woman behind it treated thus scornfully mrs jeal stamped and raged like one possessed not a penny she muttered and he promised ugh the miser the beast i'll be even with him there's the money for the cup i can follow i can but i want more now that i have given up my secret her face grew dark as she thought of the burnt letter i shall be poor ha she stopped and biting her finger looked towards the castle i can make her pay this evening then it will be worth more than the cup one secret is of no use but i have another another she shook her fist at the house of sir frank said something about him that was not exactly a blessing then returned home with her mind made up she wished to leave colester which was now too hot for her as sybil would look after pearl there would be no difficulty in that quarter she had saved money and with what she had got from pawning the cup she was fairly well off for her station in life but mrs jeal was greedy and wanted more mrs gabriel was to be the milch cow this time thus it came about that mrs gabriel was informed that evening that mrs jeal wished to see her at once on important business the underlying insolence of the message annoyed mrs gabriel who always prided herself on keeping the lower orders in what she called their proper place which was under her heel and mrs gabriel was in no mood to be merciful to insolence some kind friend had informed her of the discovery of leo's true position she was savagely angry on account of pratt she had hated the young man and later on when he came to defy her she had disliked him on his own account that he should have a title and that he should marry sybil tempest these things were all gall and bitterness to the haughty woman she wanted leo to be her slave to punish him for pratt's misdemeanours but her slave had escaped and she could do nothing save sit in the empty room eating out her heart in the bitterness of impotent anger she could do nothing leo was gone pratt was gone and she was left a lonely woman she had not even the comfort of feeling that she could revenge herself feeling in this mood she was not unwilling to see mrs jeal here at least was someone on whom she could vent her rage with an imperious gesture she ordered the woman to be admitted and received her with a stormy brow mrs jeal smiled she knew that she had the upper hand and was not to be intimidated by stormy looks waiting till the servant had departed and the door was closed she introduced herself i have to speak to you on important business my lady she said with assumed meekness and addressing mrs gabriel by a title to which she laid no claim this was done to accentuate the later part of the interview mrs jeal was quite as well prepared as was mrs gabriel to make herself disagreeable she also was out of tune what business can a woman like you have with me demanded mrs gabriel with scorn and put up a lorgnette to freeze mrs jeal with a look but mrs jeal had borne the looks of even greater ladies than mrs gabriel it is strange is it not my lady she sniggered but i have something to talk about which will interest your ladyship very much indeed mrs gabriel looked more scornful than ever and i believe you have to do with this precious discovery i have my lady mr haverleigh is now lord morven i proved his right to the title you see my lady i was a nurse at kilspindie castle and i stole his lordship when a child how dare you speak to me like this cried mrs gabriel do you not know that i can have you arrested for such an admission oh no you cannot my lady retorted mrs jeal coolly only lord kilspindie can do that and he has let me go free then you leave this place said mrs gabriel haughtily i'll have no one in colester likely to corrupt the morals of the people ah you have great power here my lady great power mocked mrs jeal mrs gabriel's blood grew cold as she saw the look in the woman's eye i don't understand you leave the room and the place she said all in good time my lady replied mrs jeal calmly and took a seat as this was more than mrs gabriel could bear she rose you infamous creature she cried furiously out of my house or i'll have you thrown out by my servants my house my servants my estates sneered mrs jeal keeping an eye on her victim are you sure you can talk like that my lady i repeat i don't understand you stammered mrs gabriel sitting down she was beginning to be afraid mrs jeal would not dare to speak so unless she possessed some information dangerous to the lady of the castle i shall leave the parish to morrow went on mrs jeal coolly i have no wish to remain miss tempest will take charge of pearl and what have i to do with all this said mrs gabriel sitting up this much i want your ladyship to give me a thousand pounds ah i thought so your mission here is one of blackmail mrs jeal shrugged her plump shoulders some people would call it that she said dropping the courtesy title and as you have paid blackmail to pratt all these years i don't see why you should not give me a thousand pounds to get rid of me pratt mrs gabriel could hardly speak what do you know i know that pratt was married to you in switzerland when you were miss haverleigh and that you afterwards married mr gabriel the property was left by mr gabriel to 'my wife' those were the words used in the will and you miss haverleigh were never mr gabriel's wife it is not true muttered mrs gabriel her lips quivering it is true you know it is said the other woman a word from pratt and you would have been turned out of possession here he held his tongue so long as you took the child and brought him up i have held my tongue also because i was afraid of pratt but now he has told my secret about lord morven i want money on my own account so as to get away from him across the seas mrs gabriel drummed on the table she saw that this woman was too much for her what you say is perfectly true she said i met pratt in switzerland when i was a young girl we were married in geneva and i afterwards found out what a brute he was we parted afterwards i heard that he was dead and regarded myself as free to marry gabriel oh that was one of pratt's jokes said mrs jeal easily he was always a merry sort of brute but you see i can turn you out not without pratt's aid said mrs gabriel fiercely i won't give up the property to go to the crown i love power and i intend to keep what i have pratt made me take that child and lie about him he made me introduce him to colester society and for years he has taken money from me after doing all this do you think i'll give it up no i'll fight mrs jeal laughed unpleasantly i can put a weapon into your hand to fight with she said that is if you give me a thousand pounds what do you mean panted mrs gabriel throwing herself forward and seizing mrs jeal by the shoulders can you will you if you give me a thousand pounds replied the other woman quite unmoved and looking up with her wicked eyes into mrs gabriel's agitated face what do you know quick tell me mrs gabriel shook her don't shake me said mrs jeal tartly twisting herself free if you want to know my secret i'll tell it to you i am pratt's lawful wife mrs gabriel put her hand to her forehead and reeled to the end of the room wife wife she muttered then i am not you are not his wife finished mrs jeal coolly you never were his wife seeing he was married to me before he met you you are mrs gabriel the widow of john gabriel and the possessor of this property can you can you prove this asked the other woman gasping i'll give you my marriage certificate for a thousand pounds said mrs jeal i don't want it i've had enough of pratt then you can see the church where we were married and search the register oh it's all right give me the certificate mrs gabriel stretched out her hand eagerly not without the thousand pounds said mrs jeal resolutely i'll give you a cheque said mrs gabriel hurrying to a writing desk mrs jeal shook her head won't do she remarked i've had to do with ladies before you might stop that cheque when i had given you what you wanted no come to the bank give me the money in notes and i'll place the certificate in your hands we can't go to the bank to night said mrs gabriel frowning oh i can wait till to morrow replied mrs jeal coolly mrs gabriel lost her temper and stamped her foot give me that certificate or i'll have you arrested oh so you want me to tell my story in court my lady you dare to then give me the thousand pounds mrs jeal was beginning to lose her temper here's a coil about a trifle she said angrily instead of asking you for blackmail as i could have done i offer to give you freedom and you won't pay for it i will here's a cheque come with me to the bank at portfront to morrow and you can cash it in my presence the certificate will be given to you when the notes are in my hand you can take me to portfront with my boxes as i then can catch the afternoon steamer to london i have given up my cottage and sold my furniture and packed my things to morrow i'll take pearl to miss tempest and then we can drive to the bank you insolent woman raged mrs gabriel but she was obliged to yield for once in her life she had met a person of her own sex who had as bad a temper as herself the two women had a royal battle but in the end victory declared itself on the side of mrs jeal and she departed in triumph the next morning sybil was informed that mrs jeal and pearl were waiting to see her guessing the woman's errand miss tempest descended mrs jeal perfectly respectful dropped a curtsey i've brought you pearl my lady she said i am not 'my lady' said sybil coldly you soon will be smirked mrs jeal lady morven well i don't grudge it to you you're not so bad as some here's pearl sybil took the hand of the poor creature who was shedding tears at the thought of losing mrs jeal don't cry pearl you will be quite happy with me remember you have to look after the cup whereat pearl clapped her hands and was joyful again i shan't want you any more said pearl to mrs jeal the master has given me the cup to look after and you are too wicked to come near me mrs jeal winced and looked down here's gratitude she sighed i've loved but one thing in my life and it turns against me well pearl i hope you will be happy good bye she paused and then went on and my lady i would like to tell you the reason i told that lie about lord morven having pawned the cup it was sir frank hale made me do it sir frank echoed sybil in amazement why should he it was partly your fault miss said mrs jeal coolly he loved you and he loved his sister if lord morven had married miss edith and you had married sir frank all would have been well but on that night i brought back the cup he saw me and got the truth out of me there he used me for his own ends so as to get the blame laid on mr haverleigh how wicked of him said sybil angrily mrs jeal laughed it was his way my lady but he has gone away and will not trouble you again neither shall i good bye my lady pearl but pearl turned away like a cross child mrs jeal had to go without a farewell kiss and her wicked nature felt the slight however she controlled her emotion and went off to portfront with mrs gabriel there the cheque was cashed and mrs jeal became possessed of a thousand pounds in bank of england notes she would take no other and there's the certificate she said to mrs gabriel thank god cried that lady seizing it now i'm free of that man if he comes to colester again i'll put him in gaol and you hussey i'll have you ducked i said you would talk like that jeered mrs jeal a lucky thing i have the notes good day miss haverleigh and with this last insulting speech which she knew was untrue mrs jeal went away what became of her no one ever heard but creatures like mrs jeal always fall on their feet like cats perhaps because they have so much of the cat nature in them mrs gabriel rejoicing in her freedom returned to colester and became more domineering than ever whether pratt guessed that his wife would tell her the truth it is impossible to say but he never came near mrs gabriel again nor did he write to her if he had she would have set to work to trace him out and have him arrested with the certificate of marriage it was easy for mrs gabriel to prove that she had been deceived by a villain and she would have had no hesitation in making the affair public pratt knew this and knew her savage nature he therefore kept away and mrs gabriel unrestrained by any fear became more of a tyrant than ever she refused to come to leo's wedding or even to see him intimating to sybil who called upon her to entreat her to be reconciled to the new lord morven that she hated both of them mrs gabriel went away to london for six months and amused herself by hunting for pratt in the meantime lord morven and sybil were married also raston was united to his peggy on the same day mrs bathurst bore up heroically only she regretted that she had not known of leo's true parentage he might have married peggy she would grace a title said mrs bathurst and now said lord kilspindie when the wedding was at an end we will go to our own place and take the cup with us so it came about that the pagan cup which was the luck of the grants was replaced in kilspindie castle there was a brave home coming for the long lost son and his bride and there lord and lady morven lived beloved by all it was a happy ending to leo's troubles after a time mr tempest found that he could not live without his daughter so he took up his residence in kilspindie castle as a kind of chaplain pearl was already established at the castle and constituted herself the guardian of the cup which in her mad fancy she still called the holy grail no one tried to undeceive her but there is no danger of the cup being lost again while pearl looks after it and that is a good thing for the grants since their luck is wound up in its possession and who would doubt the truth of the tradition said kilspindie seeing that three times the legend has come true raston succeeded mr tempest as vicar of colester as mrs gabriel rather approved of him thus it was that mrs bathurst came to think herself entitled to interfere in parish affairs as the mother in law of the vicar she and mrs gabriel fought bitterly and still fight over the affairs of the kingdom raston and peggy take no notice they are perfectly happy pratt wrote one letter to lord morven telling him that he was going to lead a new and decent life in south america and asking the young man not to think too badly of him as he gave no address leo could not answer the letter so he burnt it and said nothing about it save to his father there was some good in pratt said lord morven well yes assented kilspindie he was a thief a liar and a rogue in grain nevertheless i believe he had a sincere affection for you my dear boy he certainly did a kind act when he restored to me my son and my cup and a daughter said sybil who entered at the moment who is the light of my eyes said morven kissing her we are happy now father after the storm comes the calm therefore remember to give thanks said mr tempest pointing to the cup i think we can make use of the line on that goblet and he read out in english the inscription 'to the great god who maketh the heart joyful' the god of israel said mr tempest solemnly amen and amen the end

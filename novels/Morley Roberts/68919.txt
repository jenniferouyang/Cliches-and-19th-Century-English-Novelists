who ran a sailors boardinghouse in that part of san francisco known as the barbary coast was absolutely sui generis if any drunken scallawag of a scholar who had drifted ashore on his boardinghouse mudflats had ventured in a moment of alcoholic reminiscence to say so in the classic tongue shanghai smith would have laid him out cold with anything handy from a stoneware matchbox to an empty bottle but if that same son of culture had used his mother tongue as altered for popular use in the west and had murmured jerusalem but mr smiths the daisy of all smith would have thrown out his chest and blown through his teeth a windy oath and guessed he was just so say it and mean it thats me said smith im all right but call me hog and i am hog dont you forget it apparently all the world called him hog for that he was no better than one whether he walked or ate or drank or slept was obvious to any sailor with an open eye but he was hard and rough and tough and had the bullheaded courage of a mad steer combined with the wicked cunning of a monkey dont never play upon me he said often for get even is my motter there aint many walkin this earth that can say they bested me not from the time i left bristol in the old dart till now when im known the wide world over so far as ships and sailormen were concerned he certainly spoke the truth he was talked of with curses in the pacific from the prybiloffs to the horn from san francisco to zanzibar it was long odds at any given time in any longitude that some seaman was engaged in blaspheming shanghai smith for sending him on board drunk and without a chest and with nothing better to propitiate his new shipmates with than a bottle of vinegar and water that looked like rum till it was tasted every breeze that blew trade wind or monsoon had heard of his iniquities he got the best of every one all but one said smith in a moment of weakness when a dozen men who owed so much money that they crawled to him as a chinaman does to a joss were hanging upon his lipsall but one oh we dont take that in said one of the most indebted we can ardly believe that mr smith sometimes this unsubtle flattery would have ended in the flatterer being thrown out but smith was now gently reminiscent yes i was done brown and never got the best of one swine said the boardinghouse keeper i dont ask you to believe it for i own it dont sound likely me being what i am but there was one swab as give me a hidin and he give it me good so he did he looked them over malignantly i kin lick any of you here with one hand he swore but the man as bested me could have taken on three of you with both hands and i own i was took aback considerable when i run against him on the pier at sandridge when i was in australia fifteen years ago he was a naval officer captain of the warrior and dressed up to kill though he had a face like a figurehead cut out of mahogny with a broadaxe and i was feelin good and in need of a scrap so when he bumped agin me i shoved him overprompt i shoved him down he went and the girls that knowd me laughed and two policemen came along quick i didnt care much but this naval josser picks himself up and goes to em would you believe it but when hed spoke a bit i seed him donate them about a dollar each and they walked off round a heap of dunnage on the wharf and the captain buttoned up his coat and came for me i never seen the likes of it he comes up dancin and smilin and he kind of give me half a bow polite as you like and inside of ten seconds i knew id struck a cyclone right in the spot where they breed i fought goodyou know meand i got in half a dozen on his face but i never fazed him none and he wouldnt bruise morn hittin a boiler and every time he got back on me i felt as if id been kicked he scarred me something cruel i could see it by the blood on his hands twarnt his by a long sight for his fists was made of teak i should say and in the end when i seemed to see a ships company of naval officers around me one of them hit me under the ear and lifted me up and another hit me whilst i was in the air and a third landed me as i fell and that was the end of it so fars i remember when i came to which was next day in a kind of sailors hospital i reached up for a card over my head and i read concussion of the brain on it whats more i believed it if the card had let on that id been run over by a traction engine and picked up dead id have believed it and when i reely came to my senses a medcal student says as captain richard dunn of the warrior had bin to inquire when the funeral was sos he could send a wreath they said he was the topside fighter in the hull british navy and im here to say he was he breathed fierce defiance and invited any man alive to tell him he was lying and you never got even asked the bartender seeing that no one took up the challenge never set eyes on him from that day to this said his boss regretfully and if you did smith paused took a drink so help me id shanghai him if he was king of england and one of the crowd who had put down the san francisco chronicle in order to hear this yarn picked it up again selp me he said in a breathless excitement eres a bally cohincidence eres a telegram from squimault saying as how the flagship triumphant hadmiral sir richard dunn kcb is comin down to san francisco holy moses lets look said shanghai smith he read and a heavenly smile overspread his hard countenance he almost looked good such joy was his tom he said to the bartender set up the drinks for the crowd this is my man for sure and him an admiral too holy sailor aint this luck he went out into the street and walked to and fro rubbing his hands while the men inside took their drink and looked through the uncleaned windows at the boss holy mackinaw said billy who had drifted west from michigan i reckon never to hev seen mr smith so pleased since he shipped a crowd in the harvester and got em away that night and shipped em in the silas k jones hes struck a streak o luck in his mind said one of the seamen and its this ere hadmiral now mark me mates i wouldnt be that ere hadmiral for the worth of california mr sir blooming hadmiral kcb et setterer is going to ave a time he shook his head over the melancholy fate of a british admiral rot said one of the younger men taint possible to do nothin to the likes of an admiral now if twas a lieutenant or even a captain im not sayin as mr smith mightnt do somethin but an admiral you mark me said the older man id rather be as green as grass and ship as an ablebodied seaman with billy yates of the wanderer than be in that hadmirals shoes what do you say tom tom filled himself up a drink and considered waal he answered after a long pause its my belief that it wont necessary be all pie to be an admiral if the boss is half the man he used to be for you see tis quite evident he has a special kind of respect for this admiral and when mr smith has been done by any one that he respects he dont ever forget why you know yourselves that if one of you was to do him hed forgive you right off after hed kicked the stuffing out of you this clear proof that mr smith did not respect them and was kind was received without a murmur and as the boss did not return the tide of conversation drifted in the narrower more personal channels of the marvels that had happened in the last ship and in the meantime hms triumphant known familiarly on the pacific coast station as the nonsuch two decks and no bottom was bringing rearadmiral sir richard dunn kcb to his fate in san francisco was there ever such luckwas there ever such luck murmured mr shanghai smith to think of him turnin up all of his own accord on my particlar stampin ground and ill lay odds hes clean forgot me ill brighten up his memry with sand and canvas and soujimouji so i will holy sailor was there ever such luck the morning of the following day hms triumphant lay at her anchors off saucelito in san francisco bay and was glad to be there for this was in the times when the whole british fleet was not absolutely according to cocker she leaked not a little and she rolled a great deal and she would not mind her helm except upon those occasions when the officer in charge of the deck laid his money and his reputation on her going to starboard when according to all rules she should have altered her course to port but though she was a wet ship with a playful habit of trying to scoop the pacific ocean dry and though her tricks would have broken the heart of the chief naval constructor had he seen her at them she was the flagship in spite of her conduct because at that time she was half the whole pacific squadron the other half was lying outside esquimault dry dock waiting for it to be finished and when the chronicle said that dicky dunn was the admiral it had not lied if any of that papers reporters had known dicky as his men knew him he would have spread himself in a column on the admirals character and personal appearance hes the deadspit of a bosons mate to be sure said the crew of the triumphant when they received him at esquimault an ard nut he looks and a hard nut he certainly was though he stood five feet nine in height he looked two inches less for he was as broad as a door and as sturdy as the forebitts his complexion was the colour of the sun when it sets in a fog for fine weather the skin on his hands shone and was as scaly as a lizards hide his teeth were white and his eyes piercing he could roar like a foghorn and sing as the crew said like any hangel there wasnt the match of dicky on any of the seas the wide world over the only trouble was that he looked so much like the traditional sailor and buccaneer that no one could believe he was anything higher than a warrant officer at the most when he had none of his official gear about him though the admiral did not know it one of the very first to greet him when he set his foot on dry land at the bottom of market street was the man he had licked so thoroughly fifteen years before in melbourne oh its the same said smith to his chief runner who was about the hardest case in california he aint changed none just so old he was when he set about me why the galoot might be immortal mark him now will you know him anywhere it dont pay me ever to forget replied the runner he had to remember the men who owed him grudges then dont forget this one said smith do you find me a considerate boss oh well said the runner ungraciously youve got to do a job for me billy and what im goin to have this hyer admiral shipped before the stick on the toughest ship thats about ready to go to sea replied smith billy flinched sir its the penitentiary i dont care if its lynchin said smith helpor get im bossin this job which is it and billy seeing that he was to play second fiddle concluded to help and he said to himself if we get nailed ill split calls himself a considerate boss well shanghai smith has a gall which do you reckon is the worst ship inside the gate now asked smith after he had savoured his cunning revenge for a few minutes the harvester aint due for a month sir smith looked melancholy no she aint thats a fact its a solid pity sant would have suited this dunn first class he was the most notorious blackguard of a shipmaster yet unhung and the fact that smith and he were bitter enemies never blinded shanghai to the surpassing merits of his brutality theres the cyrus g hake smith shook his head contemptuously dye think i want to board this admiral at the palace hotel why johnson hasnt hurt a man serious for two trips oh well i thought as hed sure break out soon said bill but theres the president they do say that her new mate is a holy terror i wont go on hearsay said smith decidedly i want a good man you and i knowone thatll handle this dicky dunn from the start now whats in the harbour with officers that can lick me well i always allowed as you know mr smith that simpson of the california was your match smiths face softened well mebbe he is at any other time he would never have admitted it and the california will sail in three days righto said smith simpson is a good tough man and so is old blaker bill the california will do but its an almighty pity the harvester aint here i never knew a more unlucky thing but we must put up with the next best but howll you corral the admiral sir asked bill you leave that to me replied his boss ive got a very fruitful notion as will fetch him if hes half the man he was next evening smith found occasion to run across a couple of the triumphants crew and he got them to come into his house for a drink are these galoots to be dosed and put away asked the bartender certainly not said smith fill em up with good honest liquor at my expense the bartender hardly knew where good honest liquor was to be found in that house but he gave the two menowars men the slowest poison he had and they were soon merry is the admiral as dead keen on fightin with his fists as he was asked smith rather said the first man oh no hes tired said the second e allows e cant find no one to lick im e never could oh thats his complaint is it said smith and is he as good as he was i heerd him tell the first luff ony the other day as e reckoned to be a better man now than he was twenty years ago and i believes im ard oh my i do believe if e ran agin a lamppost hed fight through it it was enough for smith to know that the admiral was still keen on fighting to draw a man like that would not be so difficult when he had turned the two naval seamen into the street he called for the runner have you found out what i told you yes replied bill he mostly comes down and goes off at eleven is he alone mostly he has a young chap with him i reckon they calls him the flaglieutenant a kind of young partner he seems to be but thats the only one so far and the california sails day after termorrer bright and early couldnt be better said smith after waitin all these years i cant afford to lose no time thishyer racket comes off tonight look out mr bully admiral im on your track and the trouble did begin that night mr sayitandmeanit smith laid for admiral sir richard dunn kcb etc etc from ten oclock till halfpast eleven and he was the only man in the crowd that did not hope the victim would come down with too many friends to be tackled its a penitentiary job so it is said bill and yet when the time arrived his natural instincts got the better of him the admiral came at last it was about a quarter to twelve and the whole waterfront was remarkably quiet the two policemen at the entrance to the ferries had by some good luck or better management found it advisable to take a drink at johnsons just opposite and the admiral was only accompanied by his flaglieutenant thats him said smith id know the beggar anywhere now keep together and sing he broke into down on the suwannee river and advanced with bill and bills two mates right across the admirals path they pretended to be drunk and as far as three were concerned there was not so much pretence about it after all but smith had no intention of being the first to run athwart the admirals hawse when he came close enough he shoved the youngest man right into his arms the admiral jumped back and landed that unfortunate individual a roundarm blow that nearly unshipped his jaw the next moment every one was on the ground for bill sandbagged the admiral just as he was knocked down by the lieutenant as sir richard fell he reached out and caught smith by the ankle the boardinghouse master got the lieutenant by the coat and brought him down too and as luck would have it the youngsters head hit the admirals with such a crack that both lay unconscious do we want the young un too asked bill when he rose to his feet swinging his sandbag savagely and smith for once lost his head leave the swine and puckarow the admiral he said and indeed it was all they could do to carry sir richard without exciting any more attention than four semiintoxicated men would as they took home a mate who was quite incapacitated but they did get him home to the house in the barbary coast when he showed signs of coming to he was promptly dosed and his clothes were taken off him as he slept the sleep of the drugged they put on a complete suit of rough serge toggery and he became tom deane ab they do say that he is the roughest toughest hardest nut on earth said bill so well sec what like he shapes in the california i dessay hes one of that lot that lets on how sailormen have an easy time its my notion the california will cure him of that by four oclock in the morning tom deane who was as his new shipmates allowed a hardlooking man who could and would pull his weight lay fast asleep in a forward bunk of the californias focsle as she was being towed through the golden gate and his flaglieutenant was inquiring in hospital what had become of the admiral and nobody could tell him more than he himself knew so much he told the reporters of the chronicle and the morning call and flaring headlines announced the disappearance of a british admiral and the wires and cables fairly hummed to england and the world generally at the same time the san francisco police laid every waterfront rat and tough by the heels on the chance that something might be got out of one of them what did i tell you asked bill in great alarm as he saw several intimate friends of his being escorted to gaol are you weakenin on it said smith savagely if i thought you was id murder you give me away and when i get out ill chase you three times round the world and knife you my son and though bill was so much of a terror he could not face smiths eyes well i aint in it anyhow he swore but certainly tom deane ab was in it and was having a holy time when the admiral woke which he did after half an hours shaking administered in turns by three of the californias crew who were anxious to know where he had stowed his bottle of rum he was still confused with the dope given him ashore so he lay pretty still and said send mr selwyn to me but selwyn was his flaglieutenant and was just then the centre of interest to many reporters send hell rouse out old son and turn to said one of his new mates and the admiral rose and rested on his elbow where am i on board the california to be sure im dreaming said the admiral thats what it is to be sure im dreaming there was something in his accent as he made this statement that roused curiosity in the others no you aintnot much said the first man who had spoken and even if you was i guess simpson will wake you rouse up before he comes along again he was in here an hour back inquiring for the trumpet of the day of judgment to rouse you come along deane now then my names dunn said the admiral with contracted brows devil doubt it said his friend and who done you was it shanghai smith the admiral sat up suddenly and by so doing brought his head into violent contact with the deck above him this woke him thoroughly just in time to receive mr simpson mate of the california who came in like a cyclone to inquire after his health did you ship as a dead man asked mr simpson for if you did ill undeceive you and with that he yanked the admiral from his bunk and dragged him by the collar out upon the deck at a run mr simpson was bucko to his fingertips and had never been licked upon the high seas but for that matter viceadmiral sir richard dunn kcb had never hauled down his flag either to any man it surprised him as it would have surprised any of his crew to find that he took this handling almost meekly but then no one knows what he would do if the sky fell and as far as the admiral was concerned the entire world was an absurd and ridiculous nightmare he rose at the end of his undignified progress and stared at the mate whowho are you he said mr simpson gasped who am ioh who am i well ill oblige you by statin once for all that im mate of this ship and youre my dog but the dog shook his head nothing of the sort he said as he staggered with the remains of the opiate im a british admiral and my names sir richard dunn wheres my ship any ordinary kind of backanswer or insubordination received only one kind of treatment on board the california and when a man had been beaten to a jelly he rarely recovered enough spirit to inquire why he had been hammered but this was a new departure in backtalk oh youre an admiralan admiral heh said simpson of course said sir richard and a sudden gust of rage blew the last opium out of him why damn it sir what the devil do you mean by laying your filthy paws on me wheres your captain sir by all thats holy ill smash you if you so much as look at me again now it is a remarkable fact that the utterly and entirely unexpected will sometimes shake the courage of the stoutest heart it is possible that a tiger would itself turn tail if a lamb rushed at him with open mouth and though mr simpson would have tackled a prizefighter knowing he was a prizefighter the fact that one of the kind of men whom he was accustomed to wipe his boots on now turned upon him with entirely strange language and a still stranger air of authority for a moment daunted him utterly he stood still and gasped while the admiral strode aft and went up the poop ladder he was met there by the captain who had been the terror of the seas as a mate a narrow escape of a conviction for murder had partially reformed him he had also become religious and usually went below when simpson or the second greaser was hammering any one into oblivion and obedience what is this asked captain blaker mildly yet with a savage eye mr simpson what do you mean by allowing your authority and mine delegated to you to be disregarded sir said mr simpson and then the admiral turned on him hold your infernal tongue sir he roared and sir if you are the master of this vessel as i suppose i require you to put about for san francisco i am a british admiral sir my name is sir richard dunn oh youre an admiral and you require said blaker waal i do admire you look like an admiral the waterfront is full of such take that sir and the resurgent old adam in blaker struck the admiral with such unexpected force that dunn went heels over head off the poop and landed on simpson the mate improved the opportunity by kicking him violently in the ribs when he was tired he spoke to the admiral again now you lunatic take this here ball of twine and go and overhaul the gear on the main and if you open your mouth to say another word ill murder you and though he could not believe he was doing it sir richard dunn crawled aloft and did what he was told he was stunned by his fall and the hammering he had received but that was nothing to the utter and complete change of air that he experienced as he overhauled the gear he wondered if he was an admiral at all if he was how came he on the maintopgallantyard of a merchant ship if he wasnt why was he surprised at being there he tried to recall the last day of his life as an admiral and was dimly conscious of a late evening somewhere in san francisco at which he had certainly taken his share of liquor a vague sense of having been in a row oppressed him but he could recall nothing till he had been yanked out of his bunk by that truculent devil of a mate then patrolling the poop ii must be mad said the admiral now then look alive there you dead crawling cat said mr simpson or ill come up and boot you off the yard do you hear me yes sir said the admiral quickly and as he put a new mousing on the cliphooks of the mizzentopmaststaysailtrippingline block he murmured i suppose i never was an admiral after all i dont seem to know what i am and the hardest nut among the admirals of the active list wiped away a tear with the sleeve of his coat as he listened to the sacred commination service with all its blessings intoned in a downeast twang by the eminent mr simpson hes crazy said simpson to the second greaser says hes an admiral ive had the apostle peter on board and a cook who said he was st paul but this is the first time ive run against an admiral before the mast does he look like it sir asked wiggins laughing he looks the toughest case you ever set eyes on said simpson but youd have smiled to see the way the old man slugged him off the poop and yet theres something about him i dont tumble to i guess thats where his madness lies guess ill cure him or kill him by the time we get off sandy hooknow then you admiral come down here and start up the fore rigging and do it quick or ill know the reason why and the knight commander of the bath came down as he was bid and having cast a perplexed eye over simpson and wiggins who sniggered at him with amused and savage contempt he went forward in a hurry this is a nightmare he said im dreaming damme perhaps im dead when he had overhauled the gear at the foreand being a real seaman he did it wellwiggins called him down to work on deck and he found himself among his new mates by now they were all aware that he believed he was an admiral and that he had spoken to simpson in a way that no man had ever done that was so much to his credit but since he was mad he was a fit object of jeers they jeered him accordingly and when they were at breakfast the trouble began say are you an admiral asked knight the biggest tough on board except simpson and wiggins and the admiral did not answer he looked at knight with a gloomy introspective eye mind your own business he said when the question was repeated and knight hove a full pannikin of tea at him this compliment was received very quietly and the admiral rose and went on deck takes water at once said knight he aint got the pluck of a mouse but the admiral went aft and interviewed mr simpson may i have the honour of speaking to you sir he said and simpson gasped a little but said he might have that honour well sir said sir richard dunn i dont know how i got here but here i am and im willing to waive the question of my being a british admiral as i cant prove it thats right said simpson ah ill have you sane enough byandby my man the admiral nodded but i wish to have your permission to knock the head off a man called knight forard it was always my custom sir to allow fights on board my own ship when i considered them necessary but i always insisted on my permission being asked have i yours sir simpson looked the admiral up and down your ship eh youre still crazy im afraid but knight can kill you my man im willing to let him try sir said the admiral he hove a pannikin of tea over me just now and i think a thrashing would do him good and conduce to the peace and order of the focsle oh you think so said simpson very well you have my permission to introduce peace there i thank you sir said the admiral he touched his hat and went forward he put his head inside the focsle and addressed knight come outside you bully and let me knock your head off mr simpson has been kind enough to overlook the breach of discipline involved and knight nothing loth came out on deck while simpson and wiggins stood a little way off to enjoy the battle id like to back the admiral said wiggins ill have a level five dollars on knight said simpson who remembered that he had on one occasion found knight extremely difficult to reduce to pulp done with you said wiggins and in five minutes the second mate was richer by five dollars as his mates carried knight into the focsle i dont know when i enjoyed myself more said simpson with a sigheven if i do lose money on it while it lasted it was real good did you see that most beewtiful upper cut and the righthanded cross counter that finished it was jest superb but ill hev to speak to the victor so i will and he addressed the admiral in suitable language dont you think because youve licked him that you can fly any flag when im around you done it neat and complete and i overlook it but half a look and the fust letter of a word of soss and ill massacre you myself do you savvy and the admiral said yes sir he touched his cap and went forward to the focsle to enter into his kingdom for knight had been topside joss there for three voyages being the only man who had ever succeeded in getting even one payday out of the california the principle on which she was run was to make things so hot for her crew that they skipped out at new york instead of returning to san francisco and the fresh crew shipped in new york did the same when they got inside the golden gate i understand said the admiral as he stood in the middle of the focsle that the gentleman ive just had the pleasure of knocking into the middle of next week was the head bully here now i want it thoroughly understood in future that if any bullying is to be done im going to do it all the once obedient slaves of the deposed knight hastened to make their peace with the new power they fairly crawled to the admiral you kin fight said one i knew it jest so soon as you opened yer mouth said another the tone of yer voice argued you could its my belief that he could knock the stuffin out o mr simpson said the third twould be the best kind of fun said another admirer of the powers that be for blaker would kick simpson in here and give the admiral his job right off hes got religion has blaker but he was an old packet rat himself and real bucko he was and believes in the best men bein aft and though the admiral said nothing to this he remembered it and took occasion to inquire into its truth he found that what he knew of the sea and its customs was by no means perfect he learnt something every day and not least from knight who proved by no means a bad sort of man when he had once met his match is it true asked the admiral what they say about captain blaker giving any one the mates job if he can thrash him it used to be the custom in the western ocean said knight and blaker was brought up there hes a real sport for all his bein sort of religious yes ill bet its true he turned to the admiral suddenly say you wasnt thinkin of takin simpson on was you if whats you says true i was said the admiral it dont suit me being here say now partner put in knight whats this guff about your being an admiral what put it into your head and sir richard dunn laughed as he began to feel his feet and find that he was as good a man in new surroundings as in the old ones he recovered his courage and his command of himself after all this will be the deuce of a joke when its over he thought and i dont see why i shouldnt get a discharge out of her as mate talk about advertisement he knew how much it meant look here knight he said aloud i am an admiral i cant prove it but my ship was the triumphant i dont want to force it down your throat but if youd say you believe it i should be obliged to you knight put out his hand i believes it sonny he said for i own freely that theres suthin about you different from us a way of talk and a look in the eye that aint formiliar in no focsle as i ever sailed in and if you was lyin how come you to lie so ready bein so drunk when simpson hauled you out o yer bunk no i believe youre speakin the trewth and sir richard dunn kcb shook hands with charles knight ab i wont forget this he said huskily he felt like mahomet with his first disciple and now in confidence said the admiral i tell you i mean to have simpsons job by the time were off the horn good for you cried knight oh he kicked me somethin cruel the time him and me had a turnup give it him old man and heres a tip for you if you get him down keep him down dont forget he kicked you too i dont forget said sir richardi dont forget by any means yet he did his duty like a man though many things were strange to him he tumbled to them rapidly one of his fads had been doing ornamental work even when he was an admiral and he put fresh pointing on the poop ladder rails for blaker in a way that brought every one to look at it there was no one on board who could come within sight of him at any fancy work and this so pleased simpson that the admiral never had a cross word till they were south of the horn then by chance the mate and the captain had a few words which ended in simpson getting much the worst of the talk as luck would have it the admiral was the handiest to vent his spite on and simpson caught him a smack on the side of his head that made him see stars dont stand listenin there to what dont concern you you damned lazy hound he said and when the admiral picked himself off the deck simpson made a rush for him the admiral dodged him and shot up the poop ladder he took off his cap to the captain while simpson foamed on the maindeck and called him in vain at any other time blaker would have gone for the seaman who dared to escape a thrashing for the moment by desecrating the poop but now he was willing to annoy simpson well what do you want he roared the admiral made a really elegant bow well sir i wanted to know whether western ocean custom goes here ive been told that if i can thrash your mate i shall have his job they say forward that thats your rule and if so sir i should like your permission to send mr simpson forward and take his place there was something so open and ingenuous in the admiral that captain blaker for the first time on record burst into a shout of laughter he went to the break of the poop and addressed the mate do you hear mr simpson he inquired genially send him down sir said simpson are you sure you can pound him simpson gritted his teeth and foamed at the mouth kick him off the poop sir the admiral spoke anxiously im a firstclass navigator sir is it a bargain and blaker who had never liked simpson laughed till he cried are you willing to stake everything on your fightin abilities mr simpson and when simpson said aye through his teeth the admiral jumped down on the maindeck now according to all precedents the fight should have been long and arduous with varying fortunes but the admiral never regarded precedents and inside of ten seconds mr simpson was lying totally insensible under the spare topmast to encounter the admirals right was to escape death by a hairsbreadth and it took charles simpson able seaman vice mr simpson chief officer two hours and a quarter to come to and i thot he could fight said the disgusted skipper come right up mr whatsyourname youre the man for me there aint no reason for you to trouble about my second mate for simpson could lay him out easy all i ask of you is to work the whole crowd up good and i dont care if you are an admiral you are the right sort all the same i guess that simpson must have reckoned he struck a cyclone and blaker rubbed his hands like simpson at the fight between the admiral and knight he did not know when he had enjoyed himself more he improved the occasion by going below and getting far too much to drink as was his custom and the promoted admiral took charge of the deck ability tells anywhere said sir richard dunn i didnt rise in the service for nothing ship me where you like and ill come to the top if i dont take this hooker into new york as captain and master ill die in the attempt he had quite come to himself and was beginning to enjoy himself his natural and acquired authority blossomed wonderfully when he took on the new job and as blaker never swore the admirals gift of language was a great vicarious satisfaction to him wiggins accepted the situation without a murmur even simpson himself bore no malice when his supplanter not only showed none but after knocking the bosons head against a bollard gave his place to the former mate though he kept the men working and got the last ounce out of them none of them were down on him i tell you hes an admiral sure they said hes got all the ways of one i own said bill an old manowars man i spoke to an admiral myself once or rather he spoke to me what did he say asked the rest of his watch he said replied bill proudlyhe upped and said you crosseyed son of a dog if you dont jump ill bash the ugly head off of you and you bet i jumped oh hes all the ways of some admirals he has well admiral or none said the rest of the crowd things goes on pleasanter than they done when you was mate simpson and simpson grunted and he gets more work out of us than you done either simpson for all your hammerin of us ill likely be hammerin some of you again shortly said simpson and as he was cock of the walk in the focsle whatever he was in the ship the others dried up nothing of great interest happened till they were well east of the horn and hauled up for the northward run and then blaker took to religion or what he called religion and rum in equally undiluted doses im a miserable sinner i am he said to the admiral but all the same ill do my duty to the crowd he called them aft and preached to them for two hours and when one man yawned he laid him out with a welldirected belaying pin the next day when it breezed up heavily and they were shortening sail he called all hands down from aloft on the ground that their souls were of more importance than the work in hand come down on deck you miserable sinners said blaker through a speaking trumpet his voice rose triumphantly above the roar of the gale come down on deck and listen to me for though im a miserable sinner too theres some hopes for me and for you theres none unless you mend your ways in accordance with what im telling you even with the speaking trumpet he could hardly make himself heard over the roar of the increasing gale and the thunderous slatting of the topsails in the spillinglines dont you think sir that theyd better make the topsails fast before you speak to them said the admiral no i dont replied blakernot much i dont not by a jugful for if one of em went overboard id be responsible before the throne and dont you forget it damme hes mad said sir richardmad as a march hare shell be shaking the sticks out of her soon he leant over the break of the poop and called up wiggins mr wiggins one word with you wiggins came up as blaker roared his text through the trumpet will you stand by me mr wiggins if i knock him down and take command i will but mind his gun said wiggins when hes very bad hell shoot it was not any fear of blakers sixshooter that made the admiral hesitate to take the command even from a madman at sea is a ticklish task and may land a man in gaol for all his being a shanghaied admiral i tell you mr wiggins that simpson is a good man ill bring him aft again and wiggins made no objection when simpson was called up by the admiral mr simpson said the mate this is getting past a joke have you any objection to taking on your old job if i secure this preaching madman and take command simpson was full up of the focsle and as he had a very wholesome admiration for the admiral he was by no means loth to return to his old quarters im with you sir in another quarter of an hour we shall have the sticks out of her and still blaker bellowed scripture down the wind he was still bellowing though what he bellowed wasnt scripture when simpson and wiggins took him down below after five minutes of a row in which the deposed captain showed something of his ancient form as the terror of the western ocean as they went the admiral now promoted to being captain of a cape horner picked up the battered speaking trumpet and wiped some blood from his face which had been in collision up aloft with you and make those topsails fast he roared look alive men look alive and they did look alive for dicky dunn never needed a speaking trumpet in any wind that ever blew when things were snugged down and the california was walking north at an easy but tremendous gait he felt like a man again he turned to simpson and wiggins with a happy smile now were comfortable and things are as they should be mr simpson let the men have a tot of grog and hows mr blaker waal said simpson cheerfully when we left him he warnt exactly what you would call religious nor resigned but if blaker was not happy the admiral was thoroughly delighted now you see what i said was true he declared at dinner that night if i hadnt been an admiral and a man born to rise how could i have been shipped on board this ship as a foremast hand and come to be captain in six weeks ill be bound you never heard of a similar case mr simpson and simpson never had was it shanghai smith do you think as put you here he asked the admiral had heard of shanghai smith in the focsle when i get back ill find out he said and if it was ill not trouble the law mr simpson i never allow any man to handle me without getting more than even you dont said simpson if his manner was dry it was sincere but i dont bear malice afterwards your health mr simpson this kind of trade breeds good seamen after all but you are all a trifle rough simpson explained that they had to be when the owners scheme is to have one man do three mens work they have to get men who will make em do it and when the owners get a bad name and their ships a worse then men like shanghai smith have to find us crews if you could get back to san francisco and hammer an owner some of us would be obliged to you sir ah when i get back said the admiral this will be a remarkable yarn for me to tell mr simpson i still feel in a kind of dream would you oblige me by going to mr blaker and telling him that if he continues to hammer at that door ill have the hose turned on him and when simpson went to convey this message the admiral put his feet on the table and indulged in a reverie ill make a note about shanghai smith and settle with him in full but i shall rise higher yet i know its in me steward yes sir said the steward i think ill have some grog he drank to the future of admiral sir richard dunn master of the california the settlement with shanghai smith it is easy to understand that there was something more than a flutter in shipping circles in san francisco to say nothing of the sailors boardinghouses when a telegram reached that city from new york which was expanded as follows the lost admiral admiral sir richard dunn whose mysterious disappearance in san francisco three months ago caused such great excitement has arrived at new york in command of the ship california he was it appears assaulted and drugged and put on board that vessel and owing to a series of exciting incidents during the passage finally took charge of her the admiral is in good health he states that he has no idea who was responsible for the outrage the bartender at shanghai smiths house was the first to spot this cable he put his hand on the bar and vaulted it say billy see this he shook up the runner who was taking a caulk on a hard bench having been engaged between four and six in getting three drunken men on board the wanderer it is often easier to get a dozen amenable to reason than three just as it is easier to handle many sheep than few he was very tired and sulky well wods up now he grunted hell is up and flamin said tom you aint forgot the admiral by any chance now billy woke as suddenly as if he had been sleeping on the lookout and had been found hard and fast by the mate eh what has the california turned up you bet she has said tom and he burst into laughter what dye reckon he was on board of her when she came to n york cooks mate no captain captain think of that and he says he dont know who laid him out and put him aboard of her billy rose here gimme the paper youre drunk he read the telegram with protruding eyes by the holy frost but he must be a dandy say smith must know this he marched to smiths bedroom and induced his boss to sit up and hear the news after smith had used more bad language with his eyes shut than most men in san francisco could lay their tongues to when wide awake dont i tell you its about the admiral expostulated billy its about dunn as you shoved on the california but now shanghai was wide awake he looked at billy with wicked eyes as i shoved in the california eh say that again and ill get up and knock the corners off of you you miserable tarhead if i hear you whisper that i had the last joint of the little finger of my left hand in the game ill murder you billy fell back from the bed in alarm though he looked big enough to have eaten shanghai smith he lacked the devil which had made his boss what he wasthe terror of the coast and of sailormen and a political power in his quarter of the city oh very well then mr smith but who done it understand that no one knows who done it you dog said smith reaching for what he called his pants but if any one done it it was you and dont you forget it i hire you to do the work and ill see you does it dont get me mad or youll be runnin to the penitentiary howlin for ten years to get away from me and billy went back to tom hes fair luny thats what he is but if he reckons im goin to the calaboose for him hell run up agin a snag and presently smith came out to breakfast with a face as black as a near cyclone billy and tom jumped when he spoke and all those men in his house who were in a lee shore as regards dollars got away from him and adorned a neighbouring fence whats wrong wiv shangai asked a londoner es a black un but i never seed im so rorty as this and no one answered him they were a sick crowd at any time and now when their slaveowner roared their hearts were in their boots but smith was only trying to keep up his own courage not once but many times since he had got even with the man who had given him a thrashing he had regretted his method of revenge id best have bashed him and left him laying on the front said smith and heres tom and bill know the whole racket ive half a mind to have them put out of the way in such a place as this who can a man trust bah it sickens me it does it fair sickens me he was virtuously indignant with an ungrateful world even his revenge had been a failure how in the name of all that was holy and unholy had the admiral managed to rise from the focsle to the command of the california and i thought blaker and simpson was both men said smith with disgust there aint any trustin to appearances nor to reputation neither but how could the swine have done it an early evening paper had the whole story and as shanghai was still up town all his crowd of crimps and slaves roared over the yarn he fot the mate and was give is billet said one i say but old blaker was a sport thats real old western ocean packet law and then blaker went luny with psalm singing and the hadmiral locked im up strewth but it must ave bin a picnic id ave give a months wages to see the show but oo was it shangaied a hadmiral he spoke with bated breath whod it be but smith asked the speakers mate sulkily hes a devil a notorious devil as we know hed shanghai his father for a quarter if he was dry and a month back my own brother that shipped in the cyrus j brown told me as shanghai had a down on this very man then i wouldnt be smith for all is money thisll be a government business it would have been if the admiral had been any other kind of man but admiral sir richard dunn was one of those and they get rarer every day who prefer handling their own affairs he had a gift of humour too and was mightily pleased with himself whoever it was that laid for me he never meant to make me master of the california he said as he came west on the cars and whoever he was i will fix him the mate was pretty certain it was this shanghai smith if it was if it was it seemed a healthy thing for mr smith to leave san francisco and hide somewhere in the islands but all his interests kept him where he was even when hms triumphant came down again from esquimault and lay waiting for the admiral off goat island the crew of the triumphant being very proud of their own special admiral were in so furious a rage against any one connected with crimping in the city that no liberty was granted to any one of them its hall very fine said the triumphants unanimously but these ere americans are too smart by alf them and husll part brassrags one of these fine days but aint it fine to think that dicky went to sea as a man before the stick and come out right on top they chortled with exceeding pleasurewith pleasure founded on his achievements and on the unexpected experiences he had had of sealife to think of dicky bunking it among a crowd of merchant jacks said the crew wed give a lot to ave seen him shinning up aloft for dear life but all the same they loved him dearly and when he came alongside five days later not all their sense of discipline prevented their breaking into a storm of cheers that rang out across the bay and was almost heard at oakland hard as dicky dunn was he went to his cabin rather in a hurry for once in his life he could hardly trust himself to speak but he received the congratulations of the captain and officers including young selwyn who had been with him when he had been kidnapped with the greatest calm yes ive had some experience he said and i dont know that it has done me any harm i know more of the conditions on board merchant vessels than i did before and what do you propose to do sir richard asked selwyn an hour later the authorities and the police seemed very anxious to do what they could the admiral lighted one of his own cigars and found it more to his taste than the ships tobacco of the california i dont propose to trouble the police he said nor need there be any international correspondence so far as im concerned ill play my own game i think selwyn that i know who laid for us that night and from what i learnt in the california i learnt a lot by the way ive a notion that ordinary justice would never get hold of the man at least not in san francisco not even if i paid for it then what but dicky dunn interrupted him ive a notion he said significantly and that afternoon he sent selwyn ashore with a very polite note to the chief of the san francisco police saying that rearadmiral sir richard dunn would be very glad to see that gentleman on board the triumphant late that evening if he could make it convenient to come let the band begin to play said mr peter cartwright it looks as if id better face the music i wonder if he has any kinkle as to the man who did it its more than i have unless it was smith or sullivan as he drew his five thousand dollars a year and pickings partly through the grace of both the notorious boardinghouse keepers that he mentioned he did not relish running against them nevertheless it was better to do that than run against a mightier snag he looked with a groan at the pile of correspondence which had accumulated since the admirals disappearance and heres the british consul wants to see me tomorrow he cried theyll cinch me if they can get no one else and he went on board the triumphant feeling as if he was out of a job the admiral received him courteously and was alone this has been a bad business admiral sir said mr cartwright and as chief of police of this city i feel it as a personal slur your request to see me anticipated me by no more than twelve hours i proposed to seek an interview with you tomorrow morning i am obliged to you said the admiral will you have anything to drink it was rather cold on the water replied cartwright and when the chief of police had a tumbler of hot whiskey and water in both hands the admiral opened up ive sent for you mr cartwright he began to tell you that i dont want any proceedings taken about this matter cartwright opened his mouth and stared at the admiral in surprise then he began to imagine he understood sir richard dunn had evidently been somewhere on the night of his disappearance which would not suit him to have known ah i see said cartwright with a subtle smile ive my own notions as to the brand of justice dispensed in this state mr cartwright it is considerably milder than the native liquors i want your assistance in doing without the law and in administering justice myself have you any notion of the gentleman who shipped me in the california it was probably a boardinghouse master said cartwright of course it might have been sullivan or the sheeny or williams or smith is that the scoundrel they know here as shanghai smith asked the admiral and cartwright nodded the crew of the california put it down to him at once i dont know that it was necessary him said cartwright pensively though he has the worst name hes no worse than the others for my own part i reckon the sheenyhes a jew boy of courseis a deal tougher than smith and just then selwyn who knew the chief of police was on board put his head into the admirals cabin could i speak to you a moment sir richard and dicky dunn went outside i thought as you had this cartwright with you sir said selwyn that i ought to tell you a queer yarn that has just been brought me by one of the quartermasters it seems that one of the men has a story that you once had a fight with shanghai smith and hurt him badly it was in australia i believein melbourne stay a minute said the admiral let me think yes by jove i did have a row on sandridge pier years ago and i broke the man up so that he had to go to a hospital and his nameyes it was smith thanks selwyn ill see if this man ever was in australia he went back to cartwright now as to the sheeny admiral said cartwright who was beginning to feel comfortable never mind the sheeny mr cartwright said his host do you know smiths record where did he come from he came from melbourne replied the chief and the admiral slapped his leg thats the man i believe why never mind why said dunn but supposing it was could we prove it against him i doubt it said cartwright cheerfully probably no one would know it but his runner and bill haines would perjure himself as easy as drink lager but if we did prove it thered be an appeal and so on said the chief he indicated large and generous delay on the part of the merciful american law by a wave of his hand you see we couldnt prove anyhow that he knew you was you said cartwright and if i know my own business it would come down to a matter of assault and so many dollars thats what i imagined said the admiral so i propose to take the matter in hand myself and relieve you of it for though smith or the real man might come off easily if i choose to have it made an international business some one will have to pay who is not guilty thats likely enough said cartwright uneasily on the whole admiral id rather you took the job on yourself provided it was put through quietly what do you propose dunn put his hands in his pockets and quarterdecked his cabin i want to be sure its smithmorally sure how can i be made sure ill tell you now what i know about him he repeated what selwyn had said and told him the story of his having fought a man on sandridge pier at melbourne fifteen years before his name was smith it fits as neat as a pair of handcuffs said the chief of police ill think over it and let you know stay sirree ive got it now look here admiral now you mark me this is a scheme itll work or my names dennis ill have it put about in the right quarter that though there aint evidence to touch the real man who worked the racket on you it is known who actually corralled you and shoved you on the california ill get the proper man to give it away that a warrant is being made out and next day ill have all the runners of all the chief boardinghouses arrested do you see no i dont said the admiral oh come cried cartwright the man we dont arrest will be the man who done it yes but well said cartwright i understood you didnt particularly hanker to catch the understrapper ah said the admiral of course i see you mean i mean the boardinghouse boss will shove the runner that did it out of sight and then youll know him by reason of the very means he takes not to be given away for of course hed reckon that the runner on being held would squeal its a good plan said the admiral and when i know what kind of punishment would mr smith like least of all provided you remember hes an american citizen i dont care what you do replied the chief but if you asked me i should get him served the way hes served you shanghai smith among a crowd of sailormen in an american ship such as the harvester and the skipper of the harvester hates him like poisonand she sails in three dayswould have a picnic to recollect all his life for you see they know him ill think it over said the admiral your plan is excellent so it is said cartwright as he was rowed ashore for smith aint no favourite of mine and at the same time it will look as if i gave him the straight racket anyhow he sent an agent down to the water front that very night the man dropped casual hints at the boardinghouses and he dropped them on barren ground everywhere but at shanghai smiths jehoshaphat said smith so thats the game peter cartwright had in his own language reckoned him up to rights for the very first move that smith played was to make a break for billys room as the runner had been up most of the night before enticing sailormen off a liverpool ship just to keep his hand in he was as fast asleep as a bear on christmas day and he was mighty sulky when smith shook him out of sleep by the simple process of yanking his pillow from under his head aint a man to get no sleep that works for you he demanded whats up now hell is up and fizzling replied smith ive had word from peter cartwright that youll be arrested in the mornin if you dont skin out its the admiral i wish id never set eyes on him come dress and skip twont do for you to be gaoled mebbe theyd hold you on some charge till you forgot all you owe to me there aint no such thing as real gratitude left on earth billy rose and shuffled into his clothes sullenly enough and where am i to skip to to portland said smith the mendocino leaves in the mornin for crescent city and astoria dont she well then go with her and lie up with grant or sullivan in portland till i let you know the coast is clear and heres twenty dollars go easy with it he sighed to part with the money id sooner go down to los angeles grunted billy but smith explained to him with urgent and explosive blasphemy that he was to get into another state in order to complicate legal matters youve the brains of a flathead indian you have said smith as he turned billy into the street on his way to find the mendocino whats the use of havin law if you dont use it and in the morning when smith heard that ten runners at least had been urgently invited to interview mr peter cartwright he was glad to be able to declare that billy was not on hand hes gone east to see his old man he said drily and as his father is a millionaire and lives in the fifth avenue n york he couldnt afford to disregard his dyin desire to see him you are a daisy smith said the police officer who had come for billy between you and me what have you done with him smith shook his head i shot him last night and cut him up and pickled him in a cask he said with a wink and ive shipped him to the british ambassador at washington cod youre as close as a clam aint you smith but i tell you peter is havin a picnic this admirals game was playin it low down on peter whoever did it there are times when a man cant help his friends smith lied freely you can tell peter i had nothin to do with it yes i can tell him said the police officer and he did tell him as a result the chief of police wrote to the admiral sir i have interrogated all the runners but one belonging to the chief boardinghouses and have succeeded in obtaining no clue the one man missing was runner to mr william smith commonly known as shanghai smith under the circumstances and considering what you said to me i am inclined to wait developments if you will inform me what you wish me to do i shall be glad to accommodate you in any way yours truly peter cartwright psif you could write me a letter saying you are quite satisfied with the steps i have taken to bring the offender to justice i should be obliged psif you wish to meet mr john p sant captain of the harvester now lying in the bay and sailing the day after tomorrow i can arrange it but both the postscripts were written on separate pieces of paper mr cartwright was not chief of police in a land of justice for nothing he knew his way about dicky dunn on receiving peters letter called in his flaglieutenant when they shanghaied me they knocked you about rather badly didnt they selwyn selwyn instinctively put his hand to the back of his head yes sir richard they sandbagged me as they call it and kicked me too im pretty sure i know who did it said the admiral and im proposing to get even with the man myself it seems that it will be a difficult thing to prove besides im not built that way i dont want to prove it and send the man to gaol i like getting even in my own fashion what would you do if i could tell you who it was that laid the plot against us that night selwyn was a cleanskinned brighteyed closeshaven young fellow as typical an anglosaxon salted in the seas as one could meet his eyes sparkled now iid punch his head sir the admiral nodded i believe i did punch his head years ago selwyn but he was looking for a fight and found it and ought to have been satisfied between you and me and no one else the chief of police here and i have fixed this matter up between us he says that he has no evidence and the only man who might have given the affair away has been shipped off somewhere im going to show mr smith that he didnt make a bucko mate of me for nothing and i want you to help ive got a scheme he unfolded it to selwyn and the young lieutenant chuckled he used to be a seaman said the admiral but for twelve years hes been living comfortably on shore sucking the blood of sailors and if i know anything about american shipsand i dohell find three months in the focastle of this harvester worse than three years in a gaol now were going to invade the united states quite unofficially with the connivance of the police he lay back and laughed oh i tell you said the admiral he ran against something not laid down in his chart when he fell in with me you can come ashore with me now and well see this cartwright american ways suit me after all then i understand mr cartwright said the admiral an hour later that there wont be a policeman anywhere within hail of this smiths house tomorrow night ive got other business for them said peter and i can see mr sant here this afternoon ill undertake to have him here if you call along at three he spent the interval at lunch with the british consul i tell you what stanley said the admiral i dont care what they did to me for its done me no harm but after this you should be able to make them enforce the laws if they would only do that the pacific coast wouldnt stink so in the nostrils of shipmasters and shipowners the consul explained the local system of politics it appeared that every one with any business on the borders of crime insured against the results of accidents by being in politics and if the thieving politicians appoint the man to control them whats the result the result isshanghai smith said the admiral well ill see you later ive an appointment with mr sant of the harvester the consul stared what with sant why he got eighteen months hard labour for killing a man six months ago but hes not in prison of course not said the consul he was pardoned by the governor hes just the man i wish to see cried dicky dunn he found sant waiting at cartwrights office he was a hardbitted weatherbeaten gentleman and half his face was jaw that jaw had hold of a long cigar with his back teeth he continued smoking and chewing and did both savagely what peter had said to him did not come out but by agreement the admiral was introduced as mr dunn you have reason not to like shanghai smith said peter thats so nodded sant mr dunn does not like him either could you make any use of him on board the harvester i could said sant grinning hed be a useful man if you imagined you missed a man tomorrow morning just as you were getting up your anchor and some one hailed you and said they had picked one up you would take him aboard wet or dry said sant ill undertake he shall be wet said the admiral eh and he turned to selwyn yes sir replied the lieutenant that could be arranged very well mr sant said the admiral and its understood of course said peter that you gentlemen never saw each other and dont know each other when you meet it being a matter of mutual obligation i agree said sant and the admiral shook hands with a gentleman who had been pardoned by an amiable governor and of course cartwright added as he escorted the admiral and selwyn into the passage if there should be a shindy at smiths and any of your men are in it we shall all explain that it was owing to your having been put away and two wrongs then will make it right i guess the newspapers will call it square exactly so said the admiral and when he reached the triumphant he had very nearly worked out the plan by which the row at shanghai smiths was to occur ill just go over it with you selwyn he said when he reached his cabin again now you must remember i rely on your discretion a wrong step may land us in trouble with the authorities and the admiralty there never was a government department yet which wouldnt resent losing a fine chance of a paper row and if they catch me settling this matter out of hand my name is dennis as the americans say and i dont want your name to be dennis either well what do you propose sir richard asked selwyn this is rightly your show and mine said the admiral i wont have any one else in it that i can help i ought to speak to hamilton but i wont ill keep him out of the troublefor hamilton was the captain of the triumphant i suppose the men here are really fond of me said the admiral interrogatively they have no monopoly of that said selwyn is there any one of them you could drop a hint to that you could trust of course said selwyn theres benson whose father works for mine as gardener we used to fight in the toolhouse at home and now he would jump overboard if i asked him do you mean benson my coxsn yes sir hes the very man you might let him know that if he should get into any trouble he will be paid for it i leave the rest to you you can go ashore now with this note to stanley that will give you a chance to take benson with you and speak to him on the quiet i dont know that i care particularly to hear any more about it till the day after tomorrow unless i have to ultimately all the responsibility is mine of course and by that selwyn understood rightly enough that dicky dunn for all his cunning had no intention of shirking trouble if trouble came he went ashore and took benson up town with him do the men think it was shanghai smith that laid for us and put the admiral away benson he asked as they went up market street there aint the shadder of a doubt e done it sir said benson and they dont like it lord bless you sir its very ard avin all liberty stopped but between you and me it was wise to stop it they would ave rooted is ouse up and shied the wreckage into the bay its a pity that you and about twenty more couldnt do it said selwyn and if one could only catch hold of the man himself and put him on board an outwardbound ship it would do him good benson slapped his leg oh sir there aint a man on board the triumphant that wouldnt do six months with pleasure to ave the andlin of im no for sure sir i was lying awake last night thinking of it said selwyn at least i believe i was awakeperhaps i was dreaming but i seemed to think that a couple of boats crews were ashore and that you went to shanghais place for a drink ive done that same sir said benson and the liquor was cruel bad and i dreamedyes i suppose it was a dreamthat you started a row and made hay of his bar and collared him and took him in the cutter and rowed him round the bay till about four in the morning you always was very imaginary and dreamy as a boy sir begging your pardon sir said benson and i dreamed you came to the harvester her thats lying in the baythe ship with the bad name among sailormen thats the ship said selwyn and you hailed her and asked the captain if a man had tried to escape by swimming and he said yes and then you said youd picked him up benson looked at him quickly but he wouldnt be wet sir oh yes he would benson you could easily duck him overboard benson stared very hard at the lieutenant of course i could very easy duck himand love to do it too and did the captain of the harvester own to him sir selwyn nodded he would bensoni mean he did of course i suppose asked benson with his eyes on the pavement that it had been arranged so in the dream yes said the lieutenant was it for tomorrow evening sir i thought so said selwyn and the curious thing about it was that the whole thing was done as quietly as possible all you men went to work in silence without as much as a hurrah and one of the boats brought me ashore and the other brought the admiral and it was only after you had put the man on board the harvester that you came back for the admiral at five in the morning benson and what about the boat as brought you sir i came back at twelve and went on board with them after the fight and while you were rowing mr smith about the bay cheering him up was there anything else sir nothing said selwyn only that i forget whether it came out if it did the men said it was a game all of their own and i thinkno im surethat if any one got into trouble it paid him well after all of course it would sir said benson warmly i wish it could really come off you never know your luck sir i think mr smith doesnt said selwyn and when benson went on board again and had a long confabulation with two boats crews there was a unanimous opinion among them that mr smith had piled his ship up with a vengeance when he ran against a british admiral there aint to be no weepons said bensonnothin worse nor more cuttin than a staysail ank as a knuckleduster and even that i dont recommend an odd stretcher or two and the bottles there will do the job and the word is silence now and then mums the word said the men and like the children that they were they wrought the whole ships company into a frenzy of excitement by dropping hints about as heavy as a halfhundredweight on every one who was not in the game had there been much longer to wait than twentyfour hours they must have told or burst and if they had not burst the others would have finally reached the truth by the process of exhaustion it was nine oclock on the following evening that the admiral went on shore to dine with the british consul he told benson that he might be later than eleven and as benson touched his cap he took the liberty of believing he might be as late as five in the morning and just about eleven selwyn came ashore in another boat with papers which had to go to the admiral that is what he said to the first lieutenant captain hamilton was sleeping the night at the house of a cousin of his in san francisco i shall be back in an hour thomas said selwyn and the two coxsns were left in command of the cuttingout expedition the whole business was nearly wrecked at the outset by the settlement of the question as to who was to be left in charge of the boats finally thomas and benson ordered two men to stay and the defrauded men sat back and growled most horribly as the rest moved off towards shanghai smiths in loose order look ere said billings to graves as they were left alone its hobvious one must stay with the boats but ones enough and on an hexpedition like this horders aint worth a damn ill howe you a quid a whole quid and my grog for a month if youll be the man to stay no ill toss you the same terms both sides and the spin of coin sent billings running after the rest he was received by benson with curses but he stuck to the party all the same very well you report me you know you cant he said defiantly and ive give graves a thick un and my grog for a month to be let come this awful sacrifice appealed even to benson all right he said but if i cant report you for this i can the next time next time be damned cried billings oo cares about next time now and they hove in sight of shanghai smiths it was the first time a bluejacket had been near the place since a day or two before the admirals disappearance and at first when shanghai saw them come in he regretted that billy his best fighting man was by now well on his way to portland but for at least ten minutes the triumphants behaved very well benson had a good head and had arranged matters very neatly you look ere he had said the thing to look out for is the barman he keeps a gun as they calls it ere on a shelf under the bar smith ell ave one in his pocket so when i says this rum would poison a dog dont wait for no back answer but lay the barkeeper out quick with a stone matchbox or anything andy and the nearest to smith does the same to im hell likely not be beind but if e is bottle im too and not a word of jaw about it first or last they stood up to the bar and benson ordered drinks for himself and three particular pals of his aint this mr smiths he asked im smith said shanghai eres to you ive often heard of you said benson and three or four merchant seamen sitting about the room sniggered and passed a few sneering remarks among themselves about liberty jack smith who had taken enough that night to make him rash referred to the admiral so your admiral has come back has he he has said the triumphants and dicky dunn is lookin for the man that played that dirty game on him and smith shrugged his shoulders as he half turned away taint half so dirty as this rum said benson it would poison a dog and as the words left his mouth the ball opened with a sudden and tremendous crash two heavy matchboxes went for tom behind the bar one laid him out as quietly as if he had been hocussed the other smashed a bottle which held a liquor known on the barbary coast as brandy and starred the mirror behind the shelves thomas at the same moment stooped and caught shanghai smith by the ankles and pitched him on his head he never had time to reach for his gun the merchant seamen jumped to their feet and made for the door stop them said benson and half a dozen bluejackets hustled them back again no you dont johnnies you can stay and ave free drinks and look after the man behind the bar drag out that smith and get im in the open air and thomas dragged smith into the darkness by his collar theres to be no drinkin for us said benson smash what you like and taste nothin and in less than a minute shanghais place was a lamentable and ghastly spectacle sarves him right said one of the merchant seamen as he salved a bottle of poison oh aint he a sailorrobbing swine fetch him in and let him look at it said benson with a wink thomas had been primed hes come to and run like billyoh he cried but smith was incapable of running he was being carried by two bluejackets after im after im said benson and in another moment the whole house was dear when tom came to he found the place a wreck and four boarders too far gone in free liquor to offer any useful explanation of what had occurred since the rum had been pronounced fit to poison a dog all i know is said the soberest that he fit and we fit and fit and fit and then e run and when tom sought for the police it was very odd that there was not one to be found in the quarter of san francisco which most needs clubbing to keep it in order there was not even one to bear witness that a crowd of bluejackets and an american citizen had come along the water front at midnight but five minutes after midnight a british lieutenant could have taken his oath that both crews were in their boats and at least moderately sober ive seen the admiral benson said selwyn as he stepped into his boat and sat down and he may be later than he said very well sir replied benson and as soon as selwyn had disappeared into the darkness the boat with mr shanghai smith in followed suit and the bay of san francisco is not so well policed that they had any one inquiring what they were doing as they pulled across to saucelito and laid up quietly till three oclock he aint dead we hopes said the crew of the boat not e said benson is eart beats all to rights and is head is perfectly sound bar a lump the size of a ens egg that upendin dodge of thomass is very fatal in a rowoh its very fatal it was nearly two oclock before shanghai made any motion but when he did begin to get conscious he found his mind and his tongue with surprising rapidity that ead of yourn must be made of fiveeighths boilerplate mr smith said benson as smith sat up suddenly what am i doin here asked smith ow do we know asked the delighted crew you would come it warnt no good excusin of ourselves smith put his hand to his head who hit me he demanded savagely no one said the crew unanimously you tried to stand on your ead put me ashore said smith what are you goin to do were waitin to see the arvester yonder eave er anchor up replied benson were in the sailorsupplyin line we are same as you was he dont like to hear that said billings were cutting him out of a job and this time we aint supplyin admirals no we aint yah you manbuyin sailorrobbin swine and twas you dared touch our admiral oh you dog you they all took a turn at him and smith saw he was in the tightest corner he had ever occupied this was satisfactorily expressed for him say shanghai did you ever hear of barneys bull and when smith refused to answer they answered for him he was jammed in a clinch and so are you youre goin to ave the finest time of all your life did you ever ear of sant of the arvester and smith for all his brutal courage shook in his boots ill give you chaps a hundred dollars to put me ashore he cried i never touched sir richard dunn dry up said benson and dont lie we wouldnt part with you my jewel not for a thousand what made you desert from the arvester a comfortable ship like that with sich a duck of a skipper ill give you a thousand said smith desperately at four oclock youre goin on the arvesterand tis nigh on three now sant wouldnt miss a man like you so smart and andy for all the gold in californy own up as you shanghaied the admiral smith grasped at any chance of avoiding the harvester for sant had a dreadful name and both his mates were terrors if i own i put him away will you take me ashore and hand me over to the police he was almost in a state of collapse benson looked at the man and in the faint light of faroff day still below the horizon the boats crew saw him wink well vote on it if you owns up what dye say chaps aye well vote said the men say did you do it but smith saw how the voting would go and refused to speak they heard six bells come across the water from many ships and then they heard seven there was a grey glint in the east the sanddunes on the verge of the ocean park whitened as they pulled for the harvester they heard the clank of her windlass brakes and the bull voice of her mate as he encouraged his men to do their best by threatening them with three months of hell afloat smith offered benson two thousand dollars i wouldnt part with you except to sant for all you ever robbed men of said bensonand what that is ony you knows pull boys her cables up and down no hold on a moment he must be wet of course in spite of his struggles they put him over the side and soused him thoroughly when they pulled him on board again he sat cursing now boys bend your backs and when he came up alongside the harvester she was just moving under the draught of her loosed topsails harvester ahoy cried benson hallo said sant what is it you dont happen to have lost one of your crew tryin to desert by swimmin sir have you picked him up whats his name does he say its smith sir thats the man said sant i want him badly but smith cried out this is kidnappin mr sant i refuse to go oh smith said sant ill take all the chances of its bein anythin you like throw them a rope and the triumphants towed alongside up you go said benson i wont said smith wont you asked benson well see about that hook on there billings and the next moment smith was jammed in a running bowline round his waist sway him up said benson and the crew of the harvester hoisted the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they were likely to know till they reached new york and the triumphants pushed off as they heard the mate address mr smith in language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most ample justice theres talk and theres a foretopsailyardahoy voice for you said benson oh mr smith will be looked after he will now chaps pull for it or the admiral will be waitin and if that appens twill be stand from under the policy of the potluck concerning the permanent and immutable characteristics of ships the unhappy man who has never had his limited range of vision broadened by a trip in a sailing ship must of necessity know little he probably falls into the fallacy common even among those who follow the sea that a partial or entire clearance of her crowd will quite alter her nature whereas sailors being sailorsthat is people of certain fairly definite attributesany given environment makes them much the same as those who preceded them but entire changes in the personnel of a vessel rarely take place the officers change but the crew remains the crew goes but officers stay or more frequently some few men are favourites of one or two of the officers and they mingle with the new crew like yeast till the ancient fermentation is visible once more ships to speak thus of their companies talk of the same subjects over a million miles of changing seas they have a permanent stock of subjects these include all which are perennially of interest to seafaring men such as homes versus boardinghouses but they include also something more individual something more intimately connected with the essence of that particular vessel and the one unending topic of interest on board the potluck was foreign politics how this came about no one knew though many theories were set afloat and sunk again every sunday afternoon some said that the first captain of the potluck was called palmerstone and that he introduced the subject of england versus the world as soon as he came on board others swore that they had been told by a clerk in the employ of the firm that there had been a discussion over her very keel concerning the introduction into her frame of foreign oaks this was the way of it said jack hart who was the chief upholder of this particular theory and the son of a little shipbuilderthe lot that built her at liverpool was the mixedest crowd of forsaken cranks as ever handled timber so the clerk said and one had a hankerin for teak and another for hoak with odd leanins now and agin for hafrican and portugee and french hoak and another he said cuban sabicu and anothers word was hackmatack and chestnut hevery time so they shoved in bits here and bits there till she was a reglar junkshop o samples and thats the reason shes a foreign talking argument ship and a mighty good reason too the crowd listened in silence if you knew as much about arguin as you know seeminly about timbers as no man ever heerd of your argument might stand said mackenzie a withered old focsle man but it aint to reason as the natur of the woods in a ship should make us talk this way or that if so be a ship was built o teak dye think wed talk the jildy jow you black son of a gun lingo hart shook his head no ship aint never built all of teak as i ever heerd of and so your eyes out mac but a man with arf an eye could see the knowledge of her bein so built might lead right hup to talk about the strenths of the countries as well of the vally of their timbers so they might said the almost convinced crowd now jack hart as the gift so to speak of seein through things and once started whod stop it asked jack triumphantly i knowed a ship as ad fresh crowd after fresh crowd in her but she for ever ad a black cat aboard and they talked cat to make you sick and i knowed another as ad from launch to her hultimate pilin up in the bermudas the fashion of calling the skipper the guffin and hevery skipper was the guffin new and old go or stay but when we broke hoff to hargue why we was talkin about them french jossers and whether sallisbury was agoin to let em chip into our game and straddle the nile thats so said the crowd and the house was rough meanwhile the skipper or old man who henceforward by the way was called the guffin and his two mates were discussing the latest aspect of world politics as they drank whiskey and water whats wrong with salisbury said the guffin who was as stout as a barrel and as sturdy is that he aint got a backbone he just lets em blow him about like so much paper what he wants is stiffenin hes like a sprung spar thats what hes like the mate a toughlooking dog with hair like anmic tussac grass in patches on his face shook his head ive a greater opinion of him captain than you have all his double shuffle is cunning its getting back sos to lead them french on mark me hell play them yet a fair knockout the guffin sneered he may have cunnin lampert but he aint no real tact now diplomatic tact i take it is not givin way into the gutter but just showin as youre a nice pleasantspoken chap as dont mean to be put on its my good opinion as these foreigners dont yearn to fight us and men like you and me lampert gets to learn the way of handlin foreigners who has so much experience with em as them in command of english ships thats so said the second mate who had been listening now last vyge in the battleaxe there was a dago in my watch as come from the betwixt and between land where spain jines france and he was the dagoest dago i ever sailed with but i knew the breed and the first time he opens his garlicky mouth i hauled off and hit him and then i took his knife away and snapped the point off and i says to him now you black beggar every time at muster youll show me that knife and therell be peace in the land and he done so and there was peace the captain or guffin smote his thigh youre right simcox youre right and if salisbury was to take a leaf out of your logbook in respects of handlin dagoes twould be better for all concerned but no not him he goes on seein them french make a fleet and he lets em he actually sees em with their fleet sharpenin on the grindstone and never says from the poop chuck that overboard you swine or ill come and andle you sos youll be glad to die the second mate was much gratified as was obvious by his standing first on one foot and then on another but lampert was not so pleased why you talkyou captain and you simcoxas if they had a fleet why its my opinionand experts say ditto to me therethat a string o bandboxes with crackers in em and all on a mudflat would do as much harm as the french fleetunless they blows up when we takes em the guffin shook his head well you know lampert as i never ad no opinion of their fleet but that aint the question salisbury may have is reasons for not takin it away though i fails to see em but the real question is why we dont have a man with guts and go in command its my firm belief as theres many a merchant captain as could work the diplomatic game to better hadvantage look at the experience we has dealing with owners contrary as hell and with consignees and with arbourmasters and pilots where salisbury is wrong is in his not goin about and freshin up his mind and he works by rule o thumb and dead reckoning it aint no wonder we can see wheres his eyes out it aint said the compliant simcox well sighed lampert i owns freely as i dont feel that sure id like to run his show the guffin laughed but you aint ad my experience yet lampert now id hundertake to come right down into the harena and make them french and germans sit up like monkeys on a horgan while i played the tune i believe you said simcox rubbing his hard hands look at the difficulties we as to contend with said the skipper with a rapidly thickening utterance and an increasing loss of aspirateslook at the viglance we as to use rocks and shoals and hother ships its igh education to be a mastermariner and the board of trade knows itknows it well this ere crowds all english except that one dutchman but if so be wed english and dagoes and dutchmen and calashees id ave showed you and salisbury ow to andle mixed sweets viglance difficulties bright lookout and the rule o the road and look at the chart thats me and very shortly afterwards the triple conversation ceased for the captain lay snoring in his cabin the potluck was a barque of eleven hundred tons register and was bound for adelaide with a general cargo of all mixed things under heaven and on earth now she was engaged in running down her easting and as her skipper believed was somewhere about lat s long e and not far off the crozets the westerly winds were blowing hard but had the worst chill of winter off for the month was september nevertheless as old jones the skipper was on a composite track with a maximum latitude of s and was bound farther south still it might have been to the advantage of all concerned if he had drunk less talked little and minded his own business instead of arguing foreign politics but to each man fate often gives his chance of proving what he boasts to be his particular skill in the universe when lampert relieved simcox at midnight the weather was thick and neither mans temper was of the sweetest so they had a bit of a breeze what kind of a relief dye call this growled simcox i call it a very good relief replied lampert and a darned sight better one than you deserve you owe me ten minutes even now he looked down the scuttle at the clock why you owe me twenty simcox flew out with pretended politeness oh make it half an hour dont lets haggle about such a trifle whats it matter if i stand here waiting cant i keep the whole bloomin watch for you go to hell said lampert sulkily and simcox went below to be a sailor is to be a natural born fool said lampert addressing the bitter and unkindly elements at large and to be on board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd from the old man down to the cook is very trying its very trying the wind took off a little later but the weather was still thickish its like lookin through a haystack grunted lampert but there bar an island or so theres nothing to speak of in our way and if the skipper will crack on and it a week since we saw the sun its the owners look out not mine he spoke with a certain bitterness as though he would really enjoy being wrecked in the trust that the potluck was not insured and that old jones would get his certificate cancelled or at least suspended twould give the old ass time to study foreign politics sneered lampert as it breezed up again and five minutes later while lampert was lighting his pipe halfway down the cabin stairs he heard a bellow forward which made him drop thoughts of tobacco breakers ahead the watch came out on deck and ran aft and were followed by the watch below in various articles of attire not calculated to keep them very warm the potluck had been running with the wind nearly dead aft starboard starboard roared lampert oh steady hold her there the vessel ran off to port at a sharp angle to her wake up here some yelled the mate and set the spanker stand by the my god and as old jones and simcox came on deck the potluck was hard and fast ashore with one simultaneous crack the three topmasts went over the side and as the men and officers jumped under the shelter of the weather rail lampert and those of the watch who were with him came tumbling down from the poop they reckoned on a boiling sea coming after and sweeping them away but though the malignity native to matter had set the potluck ashore by good luck she was hard and fast in the one sheltered cove on the island when lampert by instinct altered her course to port as he heard the coast breakers at the starboard bow he had run her in between two ledges of rock of which the outer or more westerly one acted as a complete breakwater the skipper who had been lying flat when the others jumped for the main deck got up and crawled forward to the break of the poop he was halfparalysed with a mixture of funk and rage he addressed himself and his remarks to the sky the sea and the island but above all to lampert you mandrowning slopbuilt caricature of a sailorman what ave you bin and done with my ship he bellowed oh lord im a ruined man by gosh ill murder you he tumbled down on the main deck and made for lampert who easily dodged him shut up you old idiot said the mate contemptuously who but me told you that if you drove her in thick weather and no sun seen for a week youd pile her up simcox caught jones and held him good lord sir said the second greaser its no time to fight no it aint said jack hart boldly that a foremast hand should dare to shove his oar in almost cowed the poor old guffin it was something out of nature it aint no time for jawbation insisted hart about whom the others had gathered its time for thinkin out the politics of the situation and if im not mistaken we shall be able to walk ashore by the morning and there wont be no ship for any one to commandso whats the use of jaw i say get up stores eh mackenzie dont ask me said old mac i was thinkin that mighty soon wed be able to settle that question about the buildin of the potluck and as by this time jones was calming down and was rather inclined to cry lampert came up to the restive crowd you dry up hart he said roughly until the ships broken up youre on the articles say another word and ill break your jaw yes sir said hart respectfully until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and focsle discussing whether they were on one of the crozets or what and whether they would stay long there and if so what and so on and just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful surprise they saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level with the jagged splinters of the foretopmast where it had gone short in the cap the bloomin hislands inabited cried a foremast hand and every one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger wods the bloke say asked the crowd oh say it again and the stranger said it again but the crowd shook a unanimous head i believe the silly galoot dont talk english cried hart ere wheres dutchy they shoved their one dutchman forward and after some interchange of utter unintelligibilities listened to by every one with bated breath hermann turned round i not versteh captain i denk him ein french the frenchman was joined by two or three more and then by a dozen why theyre all french said the disgusted crowd whats frenchmen doin on any island of ours and until the sea went down which it did sufficiently to allow them to get ashore at about ten oclock they discussed the question as to whether the crozets were english or not it was settled by old mackenzie all islands as dont belong to any one belongs to us he said it was arranged so by disraeli they got ashore with some risk and were greeted by the frenchman in the most amiable way poor beggars said the crew it must be ard on a soft lot of things like them to be on a deslate hisland aint it a wonder froggies ever goes to sea but does they belong ere or was they piled hup sames hus hart found himself alongside a frenchman with a long red liberty cap on and a big pair of earrings in his ears goddam said the frenchman thats what we say cried hart here you chaps he speaks english hurrah said the crowd i spike engelish nodded the stranger howd you come ere asked the eager chorus the frenchman nodded goddam he said smiling ship porsmoutlondon i spick enlish well then said hart desperately just dry up with your mixed hogwash and spit it all out free as to ow you came ere and wot the name o this bally rock is and whos its inabitants now give it lip harts a nateral born speaker and as a clear ead said the crowd e puts it in a nutshell and dont run to waste in words but the frenchman looked puzzled comb wiz he said spik enlish besser and he pointed over the low rise steady said hart boys im not clear as to whether we haint bein led hinto a hambush it haint nateral for shipwrecked englishmen to find frenchies shipwrecked too it aint said the crew suspiciously and even if its all right we bein strangers might be led into makin a treaty without knowin all there is to know i vote waitin till the officers comes up they squatted down on rocks and on the lumps of tussac grass till the captain and the two mates came along with the rest of the frenchmen hart communicated his suspicions to the skipper who was decidedly under the influence of alcohol thats all right said the guffin thickly we can manage frenchmen they aint goin to make no french shore question on no more of our islands one newfoundlands enough for me ill show you ngotiationsgotiashuns is my forte and he led the way over the hill below them they saw the wreck of a french barquantine blimy said the crowd with a frown if they avent got the best part of our hisland it was not to be endured by any lot of englishmen under the sun that the best part of this rock should be occupied by their natural foes and soon there was evidence that in any attempt to turn the frenchmen out the british leader would have a united nation at his back the guffin and the two mates argued it and lampert was the opposition wy wots this youre sayin asked the disgusted skipper did i think to ave shipped a verning arcourt among my lot youre a little englander and nothin but it lampert they was here first said lampert obstinately but the hisland is british ground urged simcox and where our flag flies no frenchman can have the best we gives em liberty to trade and they can take whats left what for have we always beat em if were to give in now continuosity of foreign politics is my motter said the skipper with continuosity and joodishus firmness and a polite hout o this youll see em listen to reason and evacuate i shall send hin my hultimatum this very afternoon and you simcox shall be hambassador simcox looked anxious well captain i was thinking it would be judicious policy to send in the dutchman it will remind them that europe is more or less agin them and to have a dutchman here will make em think twice afore they elects for war the skipper shook his head no simcox it looks judicious on the surface but takin deeper thought it aint it would aggerawate them and that aint policy we fights if we must but dont start it by doin anythin unpleasin moren askin for our rights and in ngotiashuns it aint policy to remind em deliberate of the time the prooshians beat em and moreover its accordin to no tradition ive heard of to send a furriner as hambassador no simcox you shall go ill draw up the hultimatum at once he returned on board the wreck of the potluck and in company with a bottle of brandy strove with the situation while the crowd and their spokesman hart argued like a house of commons it aint any good talkin said jack and hevery one knows that give a frenchman the chance of hargument hell talk a government mules ind leg off hout of this is the ony hargument a frenchman hunderstands but they seems to be a good many more of em than us suggested the crowd come to that said hart its the ony just ground we as to go for em for if they was ony ekal numbers itd be cowardly to whack em and i for one would be on the side of just goin down there and shovin them out peaceful im for the hultimatum right off i wonder ow the guffin will put it say boys ere e comes the old man staggered up with a sheet of paper in his hand have you done it sir asked simcox lets hear it yes read it out said lampert with half a sneer which the skipper did not notice the crowd gathered round as the captain squatted on a rock on board the british barque potluck belonging to the british port liverpool owners mcwattie co captain abednego jones mr simcoxsir eh what said the astounded simcox its addressed to you simcox said the skipper blandly why asked simcox the skipper shook his head impatiently i thought youd ave knowed simcox youre the hambassador and youve to communicate this to em oh go on sir said the crowd the skipper resumed mr simcoxsir youll be so good as to be so kind as to communicate the contents of this ere letter to them french of the wreck we dont know the name of and tell them to clear for there aint no reasonable grounds for supposin this aint a british hisland seeing that mostly all hislands is and theyve by comin ere first got and taken possession of the best bit of it which cant be allowed as its contrary to law in such case made and purvided so youll inform em it aint goin to be put up with and they must evacuate immejit and resume the statues quo whats that asked simcox its latin you unutterable ass said the skipper with a look of withering contempt i dont know latin said the poor second mate and who expected it of you asked the skipper it means that things are to go on as they was afore they come resume the statues quo and dont stand no hargument you are to tell em it will be considered an unfriendly hact and that we as cleared for haction in consequence of not believing them such cowards as to quit but quit they must and no mistake or we resort without delay to the arbitrage and general haverage of war given this day on board the british barque potluck by me captain abednego jones first rate said the crew thatll give em the jumps and how am i to translate it asked the miserable simcox thats your lookout said the guffin with a hiccup shall i keep a dog and bark myself now urry and get it hover and let hevery one ave a weapon andspikes and belayin pins now go simcox hart come along with me said simcox and as the old man was engaged in keeping his balance he made no objection i think this is a herror of judgment sir said hart my hidea of a hultimatum was jumpin on em unexpected and givin em toko afore they knowd where they was my notion of fightin and it pays hevery time is to haggravate your man till hes ready to it but to it im fust an if i thinks a cove will it me in five minutes i lets no time go by in hanticipatin im but this will warn em but they have no one who really knows english hart groaned simcox and i dont know the first word of french never mind sir said hart encouragingly ive ad many a row with a frenchy and i never knowed my avin not the least notion of what e meant ever stopped the fight from comin off if so be i see you get stuck ill come in sir and they were met by the french sailor who thought he spoke english i spik enlish goddam said the frenchman leaverpool porsmout mais le capitaine spik besser goodmornin said simcox meekly to the french captain a long unhappy looking man who might have been the skipper of a chassemare for all the style he put on mais oui said the captain this ere paper is for you said simcox and by the powers i hope you cant read it he handed the ultimatum to the frenchman who studied it while his crew came round je ne peux pas le lire monsieur he said at length simcox turned to hart there now what the blazes am i to do when he talks that way just hexplain it said hart as he helped himself to a chew say hout o this it means youve got to go said simcox you cant be allowed to stay in the best part of our island goddam cried the frenchman with his hand in his hair i spik english two tree word pilote feesh shannel owaryo owaryo asked simcox thats his way o sayin how are you interjected hart who was contemptuously sizing up the french sailors ah how are you said simcox owaryo replied the french captain smiling very well thanks said simcox but im the ambassador ma foi ambassadeur you spik franais and youve just got to get added simcox march cried hart the frenchmen jabbered a bit among themselves quoi donc marcher asked their skipper we old son said hart marshay if you like just pack up and quit we gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage now do you understand whether the frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they did not like the tone with which hart spoke or the looks of evident disfavour he cast at them the captain turned away stop said hart and he went in for a dumb pantomime in which he vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of englishmen and we mean avin our rights he ended with and just then old jones appeared in sight are they jossers goin to evacuate or not he bellowed whats their captain say to the statues quo dont they know the first thing about diplomatics tell em that to prepare for peace we makes war war it is said hart and he launched himself at a crowd of frenchmen as his mates came tumbling down the hill the fight was short sharp and pretty decisive for the potlucks crowd numbered ten able seamen one ordinary seaman and two boys or with the captain and the two mates sixteen in all against this array there were twentyone frenchmen and though hart in his first onslaught knocked down two he was himself stretched out by a third armed with a broken handspike and simcox fled with the infuriated foreigners at his heels the true battle for this was but an affair of outposts joined on the crest of the rise and in five minutes the english were in flight for the shelter of the piledup potluck old jones was keeled over once but lampert and mackenzie dragged him away and got him down to the ship he swore most terribly eres a pretty kettle o fish said he at last a pretty lot i as to my back to let a few frenchies lick em this way whats the good o diplomatics if my men asnt the guts to support me wheres that simcox here sir said the ambassador who told you to start a row demanded the skipper dont you know your duty you was to give em the hultimatum and retire dignified do you call it retirin dignified to run and beller like a bullcalf simcox looked sulky and injured how was i to look dignified with six of em after meand two with knives and one with a meatchopper he asked and as for startin a rough house twas hart as done it wheres hart yelled the guffin ere art where are you said the crowd i believe hes a prisoner said lampert oh lord said the crowd but jack never ad no discretion we must ave him liberated said the skipper firmly no man of mine must be in the ands of them mutilatin french simcox youll ave to go to em again and open ngotiashuns no sir said simcox if youll excuse me ill do nothin of the sort ive had my fill up of bein ambassador this is mutny said the skipper but under the painful national circumstances i shant do nothin but order you to your cabin where youll consider yourself in custody simcox looked greatly relieved and went without delay mr lampert youll be hambassador said the old man after a drink of brandy the mate looked the skipper up and down ill see you further first he cried twas you that started the row and the trouble and you can get out of it as you like this is rank mutny said the skipper and you could be ung for refusin duty but under the painful nashnal circumstances you can retire to your cabin and be your own bloomin policeman till peace is restored when ill try you and sentence you you run and scuttle swine you oh thats all right said the mate contemptuously now men said the skipper thickly what i wants is earty support wholl volunteer for to be hambassador the crew looked at each other and shook their heads they scuffled with uneasy feet on the lopsided deck theyre standin upon the ill as thick as peasticks said one of the boys speak hup roared the skipper the crew shoved old mac in front weve revolved the notion up and over said mac and weve come to the conclusion sir there aint nothin to be got by sendin ignorant men like we on such errands the skipper hiccupped angrily who asted you to think but i aint the man to press unwilling lubbers into goin aloft i can lead the way go into the focastle you dogs and consider yourselves under arrest go blimy said the crowd but were all in our own custody so we are now whats the old man goin to do they watched him from the focastle as he staggered into his own part of the ship ill be my own hambassador said jones ill show em ow to work things with dignity ill show that ass lampert whats oclock what you wants in such cases made and provided is tact and go and innerds innerds is the chief need why fight if palaverll do where i was wrong was to send a galoot like simcox but what could i do but work the best with the tools i ad if id gone myself wed ave made peace afore there was a row he came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it on the after capstan i guess ill have a boy said jones ere you scum send me billy and billy came aft i releases you tempry without bail said the skipper fiercely so puckalow that case and foller me no you wait till i gets a tablecloth as a signal im willin to ave peace when he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the hill followed by the boy billy bearing the case of brandy he found the crew of the frenchmen lining the crest and heard them talk say johnny french said old jones if you wants war prepare for peace whos the captain sapristi said the french captain jones nodded give it up old son it warnt my fault if relyin on the discretion of ambassadors aint a fault and maybe you can swaller the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in and is your name sapristi nom de dieu began the frenchman but jones waved his hand with dignity call yourself what you like but ave you got anythin in the way of a marlinspike or a splice bar asll open this yer case the foreigners perceiving that the englishman was on an errand of peace gathered about the case and soon discovered from the stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from cognac goddam said the little redcapped frenchman who had first discovered them cognac i spik englishbrandee porsmout london jones made signs that he presented the case to them i aint above makin a concession or two he remarked confidentially to the french captain but if id listened to my lot on board it would ave been blood up to the neck the frenchman shook his head you bet it would ave bin said jones earnestly but what dye say to avin a drink billy gimme your knife and with it he started opening the case while the frenchmens eyes gleamed in pleasing anticipation they had not had a drink for weeks and as they carried the case down to the ship with jones and their own captain in the rear they concluded that the english were not such bad chaps after all but wheres my man art asked jones when he came to the french camp ere i be cried hart who was lashed hard and fast to a round rock lord captain but ive ad a time cant you cut me adrift sir jones shook his head you interferin galoot it serves you right and as for that the ole crews under arrest where i put em for mutny and i dont see as i should so pick and choose among em as to use my hinfluence to ave you let go at any rate bide a bit and ill see for it was obvious that the drinking was going to begin the french captain served the liquor out in a small glass to every one and presently some of his melancholy disappeared he gave an order to one of his men who brought two more glasses one for the english captain and one for himself i looks towards you said jones votre sant cried the frenchman monsieur vous tes un homme de coeur quand mne i dont savvy but i dessay you means well said the captain now if id thought to bring along the signal book we might ave ad quite a talk but time enough i dessay afore were took off i shall patter your lingo like blazes shall i cut my man loose there he pointed to hart and though two of the frenchmen who had black eyes remonstrated against the deed of mercy hart was unlashed and given a drink heres to you old cocklywax said hart with a scrape of his leg i bears no grudge not me and very soon the french and english skippers were talking to each other at the rate of knots while hart sat in a crowd of frenchmen and told them all about everything it was close on sundown when jones returned to the potluck he had to be helped up the side by some of the crew aint we under arrest they asked does we dare come out jones hiccupped i releases you on your own recognition he said so down you come and elp when he put his foot on the deck he mustered all hands aft and you lampert and you simcox the two mates came out of their cabins and wheres hart if you please sir hes drunk said billy arrest im said the skipper whats e mean by it now look ere you bally lot what does you think of yourselves the crew appeared uneasy i went all by my lone said the skipper hanging on to the poop ladder all by my lone i went and i brings back peace do you ear but when i sent you what use was you i released art whos repaid me by bein unable to see an ole in a ladder and ive concluded a treaty of peace and friendship with the french next time if so be a german ship comes ashore ill go out as my own hambassador no simcox never more no lampert never never more i just speaks to that french crowd and they are civil and drink fair they recognised theyd met their match their skipper says says he captain jones i owns fair and square im not your ekal at diplomatics he adds moreover captain jones damn me if i believe your match is to be found and i says with dignity with dignity simcox right you are thats what i says and as for you you ratty galoots youll treat em when you meets em just the same as if they wasnt french do you ear me thats my hultimatum now you can go thatll do the watch he turned to the mates i thought better of you two so i did he remarked sadly but there you avent ad my experience and when i gets ome i shall see as them that is in power at the furrin office ears ow i done it salisbury aint my stiffness of backbone and e aint my tact if so be as e was to invite them frenchmen to dinner it would be different they knows as the french captain owned to me fair and square e owned it they dont ave no natral right to hislands and colnies make the frenchmens omes appy and theyll stay at ome think it hout youll see ow it could be done there now thatll do you i disarrest you and the old man rolled cheerfully for his cabin by my lone i done it said the guffin the crew of the kamma funder the stars of european science who had been shining in a wonderful constellation over quebec were just about to leave canada in that wellknown comfortable liner the nipigon when a most annoying thing happened the cattleship abbitibbe never famous at any time for minding her helm got her steam steering gear jammed as she was passing the nipigon and took a wide sheer to port when she should have altered her course to starboard the peaceful preparations of the passenger boat were broken up and her crew received the wild charge of the abbitibbe with curses which though effectual in heating the atmosphere were no use as a fender the nipigon was cut down to the waters edge and the scientific lights of europe were much put out they hurried ashore in the most irregular and unscientific manner and having sent others for their baggage began to make preparations for going to new york as no other good passenger boat was leaving the st lawrence for a week but nature possibly out of revenge for the unseemly curiosity evinced by all men of science was beforehand with them misfortunes as was once observed by an intelligent if pessimistic anthropoid ape never come singly it was the twelfth of november and a sudden blizzard bringing all the snow it could carry broke up communication with the south if the men of science were to keep their appointments with their universities it was necessary to sail from canada at once they shipped themselves under protest upon the nemagosenda of tons register which was little better than a tramp and was commanded by captain joseph prowse immortal jehoshaphat said captain prowse heres a go what we with passengers oh get out youve got to take em said the agent philosophically maybe theyll teach you something and itll be a good advertisement gahn said prowse carryin scientific jossers wont bring better freight next season i wish youd get me chock up with cattle i cant stand scientists my sister married one that was an erbalist in the old kent roadand since he went to chokey ive lost conceit with science however if it must bewhy send em along captain prowse was not a popular skipper with sailors they said that he was a hard nut and a sailorrobber and that his american experience had made him nearly as deadly as any american captain with a belayingpin but sailors experience only works backward they are good at reminiscence only and the nemagosenda got a crew in spite of the captains reputation it is possible they would not have shipped if they had known that men of european light and leading were to come with them those who follow the sea have a great respect for knowledge but they despise men in soft hats and spectacles and it cannot be denied that scientific men are as a rule too simple and gentle to look as if they could take care of themselves according to jack that is the first duty of man though he premises naturally that even the toughest courage and the greatest skill may come to grief about women a thunderin measly lot said simpkins ab to his particular mate when the scientific passengers came on board why theyve all soft ats but one and long beards and three out of four with specs holy sailor what a gang harris nodded why theres twenty of em bill but ill bet a plug of the best to an old chew that me and you goin for em with belayinpins could do up the ole crowd in five minutes youve sized em up said simpkins with a sneer and then the captain roared aye aye sir said the mate let go all gone sir now then haul in and the nemagosenda went out into the stream it took some three days or so for the men of science to settle down for during the first few days the pathology of seasickness occupied all their attention they had no time for other things but when their last allnight session was over and they were seen again upon deck the affairs of the nemagosenda became interesting the mate and the port watch developed longthreatened divergencies and captain prowse came to the assistance of his chief officer with a brass belayingpin as the result of this the pathologist indulged in a little practical surgery and a division arose in the scientific ranks the political economist argued with the statistician statistics prove that the common sailor must be treated with sternness said the authority in figures and it is our duty to support authority the captain is a brute said the political economist and for two pins i would tell him so you cannot neglect the human factor says political economy sneered the statistician and then the geologist who was a man of sense said they were both talking rot the discussion on the poop was broken up by the captain who came on deck with a face like the northwest moon in a fog having demanded the presence of the crew aft he gave them an address on their duties to their superiors you think yourselves a fine lot of chaps said the captain fiercely but my opinion of you is that you are a scaly crowd of wharfrats and all your relations of both sexes are no better than they should be so look here you swine ill have you know im captain joseph prowse and the man that gives any slack jaw to any officer of mine gives it to me and the man that gives it to me will wish he was dead before he sees liverpool thats me im captain joseph prowse so i am and any crew under me has got to know it im king here and ill wade in blood before i get off my throne mr watts put this crawling lot to holy stoning the deck and captain joseph prowse rejoined his scientific passengers all crews is the same gentlemen he said thickly theres something deep and dark in the nature of things as makes em so those that do the rough work on board ships are just so necessarily and if i was to ship a crew of angels though they might be handy for going aloft theyd turn devils by the time theyd ate a pound of beef and biscuit have you ever tried kindness and persuasion asked the meteorologist the captain looked him up and down ever tried it he ejaculated scornfully ave i ever tried anything else its kindness to sailormen to let em know whos boss spare the belayinpin and the andspike and youll spoil the sailor oh solomon knowd his business when he used them words he didnt sail to ophir for nothin but captain prowse said the meek gentleman whose great subject was cannibalism isnt it very unpleasant work rubbing the decks with stones this cold weather unpleasant said the skipper and what do you think was i proposin to reward em i suppose not said the ethnologist but im sure its awful work i could never do it captain prowse snorted oh yes you could if you was in my crew he remarked if one of you gents was captain youd find this crowd couldnt do nothing but sit in the focsle and drink ot coffee its all accordin where you are and what kind of a mans on top in other words circumstance creates character said the statistician thats a ridiculous exaggeration said the authority on heredity a man is what he is born captain joseph prowse laughed scornfully not hehes what i makes of him and if you gents was under me id make you sailors long afore you suspected it by the way could you tell me what branch of science an erbalist belongs to and the conversation followed more pleasant lines the nemagosenda although little better than a tramp in her appearance could do her ten knots an hour on less than twenty tons of coal a day and she soon got out to the banks where the men of science discussed fishing and the colour of seawater and icebergs yes said the geologist an iceberg swims on an average seveneighths below and an eighth above gammon said captain prowse rudely why any sailor knows better im surprised at a scientific josser like you bein so ignorant its onethird above and two below you ask my mate if it isnt so ah thanks i will said the geologist pleasantly mr watts is a wellinformed man rather said prowse nodding theres not a den o thieves in any port in europe he cant find blindfold and e knows more about icebergs than me for he once went a trip in a dundee whaler he aint proud of it and dont talk of it much for whalers is no class as you may guess but hes keen on knowledge is watts ill say that for him you might do worse than ask him for some ackerate information hes a perfect whale on fogs too if mr watts was the authority on fogs that his captain made out he soon had an opportunity of showing it for halfway across the banks it was impossible to see farther than one could throw half a hundredweight and the nemagosenda went tooting in darkness but every now and again in this dim world the men of science were alarmed and entertained by sudden battles in blasphemy between captain prowse or the wellinformed mr watts and the crew of a bank fisherman for fog blankets sound in the oddest most erratic way and the throb of a screw cannot always be heard even in the calmest foggy weather such swearing matches between the nemagosenda and a smack were when apparently good for three minutes or so sometimes sliced right in two by the sudden dropping down of what the meteorologist called an anacoustic wall of fog like the last words of don whiskerandos in a tragedy rehearsed a speech was cut off in the very flower of its youth where the blue blinding blazes are you coming to asked a faint nocturne and when captain prowse had expended his last carefully prepared oration the right of maritime reply only conferred an audible oh you dog we have to thank the anacoustic properties of that fogbank for the sudden conclusion said the meteorologist for if im any judge of human nature that smacksman is still firing redhot words into space yes sir said prowse indignantly theyre a foulmouthed lot its as much as i can do to keep even with em but ill slow down no more he telegraphed full speed ahead and left mr watts with awfully worded instructions to sink anything from a battleship to the meanest brig afloat in the saloon he sat at the head of the table and drank rum hot science proves that rum ot is the sailors drink said captain prowse and the correct drink for we all drink it and flourish on it and the reason is that it goes by contraries its cold work bein at sea and so we takes it ot and the sea is salt so we takes it sweet and it comes from the west indies and that proves it said the geologist warmly what a head you have captain prowse the skipper nodded you may well say so he affirmed a phrenologist gave me a chart of my ead once a scientific chart with the soundings wrote out plain and what proved him right was his sayin that ere and there i was too deep for him and i paid him a guinea well worth it it was for he said you get married and i done so and mrs prowse hasnt her living equal i wish id brought that chart with me it would ave interested you gents to know what a brother scientist thought of me it would indeed said the pathologist but there ill tell you what i am said prowse im a downrighter thats me im captain of my boat i am and if i was afloat on a hencoop with all its crew id like to see the cock as would crow before i gave him orders authority comes natral to me ill be boss wherever i amhancocks more rumand i would have succeeded in whatsoever i took hold of phrenology told me so wrote out plain and ive a kind of leanin towards science ever since that phrenologist put is and on my ead and said with a start of surprise captain youre a wonder but ive always wondered what it was made scientific chaps look so elplesshancocks more rumbut dont you fret gents im captain joseph prowse and ill put you safe ashore or die in the attempt and as he again ejaculated hancocks more rum he fell asleep upon the table gentlemen said the geologist as our interests are now secure i vote we go to bed but it was still a heavy fog and the nemagosenda was doing her ten knots an hour other steamers were doing the same or even more some twentyknot liners slowed down in order that they might say that they had slowed down to about nineteen knots and a half and some acting on the theory that the sooner they went through the fogbelt the better for every one gave their engines all the steam they could make and stepped out for america or england at the pace of an indolent torpedoboat and the result of this was that at about four bells in the middle watch when the mates aching eyes could see forty imaginary steamers where there were none he omitted to observe that there was a real one coming for him till it was too late the nemagosenda uttered one long horrid wail which was answered in vain and the next minute the men of science were shot out of their bunks and their steamer was taking in the atlantic through a hole about the size of a dock gate what became of the lucky or unlucky boat which got her blow in first the crew of the sinking steamer did not inquire they heard her toot in the distance and in answer they blew their whistle for help but though a whistle in a fog may be evidence of good faith it is not necessarily for wide publication and it is quite possible that the stranger if she did not sink lost her bearings in the fog and went off in the wrong direction at any rate the crew and passengers of the nemagosenda found themselves adrift in three boats and in less than a quarter of an hour they heard though they could not see their steamer blow her deck out and disappear all up with the gooseender said the crew sulkily and now of course it will blow as illluck and hurry would have it in the last rush for life most of the crew had tumbled into the mates and second mates boats with the lights of science were the captain and simpkins ab immortal jehoshaphat said mr joseph prowse this is a pretty state of affairs that mandrowning swine of a liner i ope shes gone down i hope the codfish are sizing her captain up and sayin what they think of him simpkins keep holloaing wheres them other boats i cant holler no more sir whispered simpkins hoarsely my throats give out and as the wind rose the three boats drifted apart four eminent scientific persons at the oars kept their boat head on to sea and six other eminent persons lay on the bottom boards and wished they were dead until the dawn crawled into the east and showed them that they were alone it was a chill and watery dawn and as the boat topped the cold green waves on the edge of the bank the prospect was eminently unkind the wind was not heavy but it blew hard enough to bring the spray of each curling wave inboard and every one was soaked to the skin the sky was lowering and overcast and though the fog was dissipated a mist covered the sun till it looked as simpkins remarked about as warm as a new tin plate it must be said for captain joseph prowse that he retained in some measure those characteristics of authority which he claimed for himself and by a forced optimism which the nature of his crew made him adopt he endeavoured to cheer them up my lucks temporary out he declared with some show of cheerfulness but it aint the first time ive been run down and with gods elp gents it wont be the last and its clean against the nature of things for so many learnd men to come to grief at one fell blow ere or there a scientific josser may come to grief in a crowd but so many bein together is the best of insurances ill pull you through you mind me all i ask you to remember is that im captain and what i says goes now and always its all very well said the meteorologist whose temper was going with the skin of his hands but we all thought you had no right to run so fast in a fog captain prowse gasped and then recovered himself didnt i tell you i was captain here same as on the steamer you did said the sulky man of science then hold your jaw said captain prowse when you or the likes of you is asked for criticism itll be time for you to give it till then youll give your captain no lectures on the running of his vessel god and the queens enemies as sunk my ship but neither one nor the other has took away my natural gift of authority so shut up and though the meteorologist choked with rage he said no more simpkins and the captain consulted were right in the track of steamers more or less said captain prowse and it bein so damp we can hang out without much drink for a day or so and biscuit we ave plenty simpkins nodded yes sir but this eres a sulky useless lot sir so they are said prowse but theyll ave to shape themselves as i bid em the first crooked word and therell be a man of science missing out of this bright galacksy of talent i dont care where i am but there ill be captain i dont care if they was my owners id run em all the same they aint passengers no more theyre my crew he took a drink out of a flask and sank back in the sternsheets i want you men to keep your eyes skinned he said presently which of you is the astronomer i am answered the bow oar who was a long thin man in a wideawake and spectacles then keep a bright lookout or youll see stars said prowse and while im on it i want you jossers to know that you aint passengers no more but a boats crew and my boats crew and youll have to look lively when i sing out so the sooner we get a bit farther south the better it will be that will do and muttering that he meant being captain whether he was on an icefloe or a mudbarge he fell asleep and snored this brute is coming out in his true colours said the astronomer what did he mean by saying i should see stars begging your pardon sir said simpkins he meant hed plug you plug me bung your eye up explained simpkins and lor bless you hed do it oh a rare chap is the captain why some years half his money goes in fines i wish to heaven i was ashore said the poor astronomer and when i get there ill see he never gets another job simpkins eyed the sleeping skipper in alarm best not let him ear you matey he cried hed haze you to death haze me work you up explained the seaman whats that and i thot you was all learnd said simpkins with great contempt i mean hed just sock it to you till you was fair broke up the day passed without any incident of vital importance it is true they sighted the smoke of a steamer hull down on the southern horizon but they saw nothing else across the waste of heaving water every now and again the captain woke up and made a few remarks on the nature of authority and what he proposed doing to those who did not knuckle under but the night fell without any signs of mutiny on the part of the scientific crew in the very early dawn the astronomer who had slept in uneasy snatches woke up for the tenth time and changed his position simpkins and the geologist were keeping the boat before the sea which was running southeast and they were both halfblind with fatigue i believe i see something out there said the astronomer feebly you are always seein suthin said simpkins crossly but as he spoke he looked round and almost dropped his oar wake up captain he shouted heres a barque almost so near we could touch her the skipper roused up and with him the rest they jumped to their feet sit down sit down you gang of idiots said the captain dye want to capsize us oh we are saved we are saved said the ethnologist for within half a mile of them a vessel lay with her maintopsail aback there was nothing odd about her to the uneducated eye but the skipper looked at simpkins and simpkins looked at the skipper derelict said both for with such a light breeze it was absurd to see a barque with nothing set but a close reefed maintopsail and a foretopmast staysail hanging in hanks like a wet duster she has seen us said the geologist seen your grandmother said the skipper rudely there aint a soul aboard her and shes waterlogged and loaded with lumber out of halifax and shes a northerner and about six hundred tons register get the oars out if her decks are awash shell be better than this boat by the time they came within a cables length of her it was broad daylight and the least maritime member of any european scientific society was able to form an opinion as to her being derelict as she rolled the water came out of her scuppers for her maindeck was almost level with the sea part of the gear was let go and most of the yards were chafing through their parrals the maintopgallant yard indeed was only hanging by the tie and the lifts and came crash against the mast every time the sea lifted the vessels bows half the bulwarks were gone and the remains of the displaced deck cargo showed through the gaps as they got up to her she went right aback and came round slowly on her heel row up close sir said simpkins and ill jump no said captain prowse not with this lot i wouldnt go near her with a crew of misfits like these not for money well go a bit closer and you must swim and in ten minutes simpkins was on board he threw the end of a vang across the boat and they brought her astern thank heaven said the men of science as they trod the slippery decks of the kamma funder belonging to copenhagen but their troubles were only just beginning the skipper walked aft on the slippery deck and climbed upon the poop by way of the rail for some of the loose lumber had dislodged and smashed the poop ladder when he found his foot upon his native heath he was once more captain joseph prowse in all his glory and turning about he addressed his crew simpkins he said you are chief officer second officer and boson and dont you forget it as for you others ill have you know that youre the crew just drop any kind of heightened notion that you are passengers and well get along easy but if you dont look out for squalls simpkins turn this useless lot to throwin the remains of the deck cargo overboard and try a couple of em at the pumps maybe her seams may have closed up again by now and going aft to the scuttle he disappeared from view well said the geologist of all the infernal oh stow that cried simpkins and turn to youre here aint you and lucky you should consider yourself and the captains a man of his word as i know so look slippy and pass this bloomin truck over the side the miserable crew looked at each other in despair come now said simpkins impatiently do you want me to report you chaps as refusin duty the geologist who was the youngest and sturdiest man in the crowd said that he did but the astronomer and the entomologist remonstrated with him i think wed better said the unhappy insect man this prowse seems a regular brute he is said the astronomer and i pray to heaven that he doesnt find any rum on board but heaven did not listen and the captain presently came on deck with a flushed face simpkins roared prowse as his head appeared over the edge of the scuttle yes sir said the new mate is that lumber over the side yet quick for gawds sake said simpkins and the reluctant men of science commenced sliding the boards over its going sir answered simpkins goin said prowse when he got his hands on the after poop rail goin i should say so what a crowd oh you miserable things ill shape you ill get you into condition ill make sailors of you get two of these hoosiers on to the pumps and see if shes leakin very bad and then well make sail this ere kamma funder wont make a quick passage but by the time were picked up or sail er ome ill make you chaps fit to ship in the worst cape horner that ever sailed he turned away but stopped and when the decks clear simpkins you can let em eat what they can get theres plenty of biscuit but mighty little else now then you stars pump and the astronomer and entomologist pumped for their lives while the sea round about the waterlogged barque was whitening rapidly with many thousand feet of nova scotian lumber for when the captain was out of sight simpkins was encouraging and talked what he told them was horse sense you wants to get back ome to your families dont you he asked and to your instruments and your usual ways of livin why of course you does then buck up and pitch in and learn to do your dooty im not a hard man i can make allowances i know you didnt ship to do this but its your luck and you must now then thatll do the deck just lay into this pump all of you and ill sound er again and as good luck would have it there soon appeared some reason for hoping that the leaks in the kamma funder had closed blimy said simpkins well ave er sailin like a witch yet chuck yerselves into it and ill call the captain but the captain was fast asleep in the bunk of the late skipper whats become of her crew asked the new crew as they sat round the deck and ate their biscuit took off by a steamer said simpkins you see theyve left their boats and the captain says the ships papers as gone so they was took off for sure i wish we were taken off said the weary astronomer thatll come i dessay replied the consolatory simpkins but if we sails er ome well get salvage and your time wont be wasted so cheer up and lets make sail while a couple of you keeps the pumps agoin the wind by now was a light northwesterly breeze and though the barque worked heavily and wallowed in the sea simpkins took her as she went round and put the geologist at the helm keep the wind in the back o your neck said simpkins to the nervous helmsman and ill loose the foresail he jumped up aloft and loosed the foresail and two foretopsails coming down he got the scientific crew to work here you ketch hold of this and pull there that will do belay tie the thing up i mean on that thing you silly ass and the member of the royal society who was thus addressed for the first time since he had left school made the starboard foresheet fast to the cleat you aint such an ass as you wants to make out said simpkins as he watched him critically me and the captain will soon put you chaps in shape now then all of you foretopsail alliards stretch it out and lay back which of you can sing they declared that none of them could then i must said simpkins and he gave them the chanty handily boys so handy until he had the topsail well up and just as the crew were looking aloft with a strange new feeling of actual pleasure in seeing results grow under their hands a sudden row arose aft the captain was interviewing the geologist steer small said captain prowse dont work the bally wheel as if you was workin a chaffcutter im doin my best said the furious man of science and i beg you will speak to me civilly ill speak to you how i like said prowse didnt i tell you a while back as you wasnt a passenger no more but one of my crew sir said the geologist i beg that you will be so good as to refrain from speaking to me i am not accustomed to be talked to in that tone captain prowse gasped and walking hurriedly to the side endeavoured to pull a fixed belayingpin from the rail after three or four trials he came to a loose one by this time the kamma funder was yawing all abroad and when captain prowse came towards the wheel again the geologist let go and in his turn sought for a weapon the captain caught the wheel in time to prevent the vessel getting right aback and roared mutiny mutiny simpkins and the scientific association came running aft simpkins shrieked prowse ketch hold of that geological chap i dare either of you to touch me said the geologist the first one that does ill brain him he held the iron pin firmly and looked desperate come and ketch hold of the wheel said prowse in a choking voice no dont let him said the offender and a violent argument arose this is perfectly scandalous said the meek astronomer and we wont put up with it cried the entomologist i must obey orders said simpkins or ill murder you screamed the skipper if he lets go shell be took aback said simpkins and itll be a lot of trouble we dont care said the men of science and then the captain let go and rushed for the geologist simpkins broke from the astronomer and caught the spinning wheel just as the geologist knocked the captain down oh cried the pathologist i believe youve killed him i hope so said the hero of the occasion with rather a pale face im not going to be bullied by any coarse brute of a sailor but hes the captain said simpkins but mutiny was in their hearts they all talked at once and the pathologist felt the captains skull to see whether it was still sound will he die no said the doctor he has a skull like a rams take him below and lock him in said the astronomer and we can argue with him through the door it was a happy thought and even simpkins in spite of his ingrained respect for the lawful authority of the most lawless skipper approved the suggestion you aint all so soft as you look said simpkins but the sea does bring the devil out in a man if so be hes got any and they carried captain joseph prowse down below as his cabin door would not lock they jammed short pieces of sawed lumber between it and the other side of the alley way its mutiny said simpkins but its done and maybe hell cool off when he comes to and finds his ead aching but nevertheless the situation was not pleasant and no one was quite certain as to what should be done hold a committee meeting said the entomologist the others said that was nonsense simpkins who now looked on the geologist as captain of the mutineers touched his hat to him and begged leave to speak well said the geologist what is it aint some of you gents good at instruments asked simpkins for if you are and if you could get hold of a sextant it would be doin things regular if you was to take a sight of the sun the ethnologist turned to the astronomer how humanity yearns for a certain regularity he said it would really comfort simpkins if you would squint at the sun through a gaspipe you find me the sextant said the astronomer and ill do it what you said simpkins id never ha thought it though he could not be induced to say in public why he would never have thought it in private he revealed to the inquisitive ethnologist that the astronomer looked the measliest of the whole gang sir the discussion which had been held on deck with simpkins at the wheel was broken up by the captain hammering furiously on his jammed door go down and soothe him said simpkins nervously and mind you tell him i done nothin but give in to superior overwhelmin odds for so i did gentlemen so i did as you know bein those as done it the committee went below with the geologist leading he carried his belayingpin in his pocket as they marched the uproar was tremendous what a skull he must have said the ethnologist i wish i had it in my collection so do i said the pathologist and the authority on philology pressed to the front rank for captain joseph prowse was doing his best lemme out he roared oh when i do get out ill show you what i am shut up said the young geologist with firmness the captain gave an audible gasp shut up he inquired weakly yes said the leader and give us your sextant if you have one well im damned said prowse after a long and striking pause may i inquire if youve took command for if so and you require my services to peel pertaters and sweep the deck just say so and let me out will you be civil if we let you out asked the astronomer kindly civil said prowse choking what do you think we dont think you will be replied the astronomer from the tone of your voice im sure he wont be said the geologist i think wed better keep him where he is said the rest anxiously why the mans nothing but a raging lunatic oh said prowse from within look here you mutineers is simpkins in this no said the geologist who showed a little humour occasionally hes out of it he tried to rescue you so we hung him but he came to again and is now at the wheel what about that sextant i aint got no sextant said prowse sulkily he recognised it was no use kicking and the rum was dying out of his aching head then lets go on deck said the men of science whats the use of talking to him oh please said the subdued skipper but they paid no attention and returned to simpkins at various intervals during the day prowse made more and more pitiful appeals to be let out but as the weather was clear and bright simpkins and his overwhelming odds were at work on deck and paid little or no attention simpkins now did not take his line from the skipper but feeling that the command was in commission adopted the manner of the sergeantinstructor at a gymnasium now if a couple or four of you gentlemen would keep the pumps going he urged from his station at the wheel we should get along a deal better and if you sir would come and take the wheel agin for two shakes of a lambs tail i dont see no reason i shouldnt loose the upper maintopsail so the geologist took the wheel while simpkins went aloft and loosed the upper maintopsail supposing you wanted to have less sail presently said the astronomer to simpkins when the topsail was set what would you do you gents would ave to elp stow it said simpkins what go aloft asked the astronomer and why not demanded simpkins its easy going aloftas easy as fallin from the side of an ouse so i should think cried the astronomer shivering i hope the weather will remain fine you know its really remarkable how useful such an uneducated man can be he said presently to some of the others now what use am i simpkins was passing and heard this he paused and eyed the astronomer well to speak the truth sir he said sympathetically you aint much but you do what you can at the end of a rope and i shouldnt be surprised if youre all right at ome all of which is good against vanity said the astronomer as the barque under most of her plain sail steered eastsoutheast into the track of the atlantic liners and do you know absurd as it may seem i am beginning to feel very well indeedbetter than i have done for years as the night fell the captain who had by that time lost all his alcoholic courage appealed for mercy he shouted his petition to those on deck through the cabin porthole but he tried simpkins first simpkins he yelled yes sir said simpkins with his head over the rail come and let me out i darnt sir said simpkins theyre all very fierce and savage agin you especial about your using bad language and each of em as a belayinpin and is awatchin of me its more than my lifes worth to let you out and yes said the skipper its moren yours is worth too you must ask em civil and give your word of honour suggested the ferocious geologist in a whisper and give your word of honour to act civilly and quietly to every one to act civil and quiet sir said simpkins and not to talk too much about authority or drink any more rum prompted the savage astronomer and not to be too rumbumptious or to get squiffy again said simpkins for said the brutal geologist if you will agree to these terms we shall be glad of your advice and assistance captain prowse ill think of it returned the skipper sulkily all right said the rude geologist take a day or two to think it over oh lord said prowse hastily ive thought of it and i agree and when he came on deck the savage and ferocious scientific captains remarked in a friendly manner that it was a fine evening damme said the onetime skipper im blowed if i aint the crew of the kamma funder the rehabilitation of the vigia the mate or the palembang walked the weather side of the poop and felt just then that he was full up to the back teeth of the mighty sea and all its works he yearned for leith walk or wapping to lie on a hot dry beach would be heaven for the hot wet southwest monsoon was blowing the palembang towards bombay and the maldivhs were on the starboard beam jack wilson propped his eyes open and cursed the slow passage of time towards midnight as he peered down below at the lighted clock he was inclined to swear that the second mate had come out and stopped it but presently it was five minutes to twelve and to his disgust sleepiness passed away as his relief stumbled up the poop ladder and came aft jerusalem but its dark said the second greaser as he looked up aloft and round about him have the gas lit growled wilson as he was going forward sulky devil replied the second when do you have a civil word for any one this was all in the nights work and no one was a penny the worse civility at midnight is often too dear to be bought from any one but an inferior and wilson and green knew each other very well the palembang was running with the wind on the port quarter and for a quiet life the old lady was under shortened canvas she went at it like an old dame in wind and snow a reefed foresail represented pickedup petticoats the stowed royals and topgallantsails suggested that a hat with feathers had been replaced by a handkerchief for the monsoon was blowing stiff that july night seven degrees to the north of the line and threatened to blow stiffer yet as it was getting towards two oclock or four bells the captain came on deck and nodded at the binnacle when green said goodmorning sir then he spread his legs out and considered the dark universe for awhile it has waked up a bit since i went below mr green he said presently and wanting no answer he got none the song of the wind in the rigging and the draught under the foot of the foresail were answer sufficient there was a pleasing hiss alongside as the palembang shoved through the indian ocean and left a lighter wake behind theres a vigia marked on the chart for hereabouts said captain spiller presently it got there through that old fool banks of the simoom he reported it years ago but it warnt never confirmed rocks he said and one like cleopatras needle then you dont credit it either sir asked green presently i know banks replied spiller snorting and never was such a man for imagination and want of judgment id take it as proof positive as nothing was if he said it stood to reason it must be and im a man as likes a clean and decent chart a chart is the character give to an ocean by them as has employed it a bundle of chits as the hindoo beggars say and to go an lump in a suspicion agin the character of an ocean on the word of a man like banks why ive no patience ive a notion that the law of libel ought to have a say in it aye sir said green the indian ocean versus banks and id believe it of banks that he done it just to get his name mentioned and to rise a bit of a palaver about him hes a most conceited chap is banks and not by any means the seaman hed like to be thought and they actually sent a manowar down to look up his simoom rocks and they came back and never seen em and nobody else ever did sir of course not said spiller they might as well set traps to catch the rats that a man sees when hes got the jimjams and nothing makes banks angrier than to throw out a hint you dont believe in them rocks i always gets him on it by asking for a clean chart and proved shoals and what not and giving it him hot and heavy on vigias and the like bah i aint no patience and spiller tramped the deck for a bit presently he came back to where green stood hell be in bombay before us he said gloomily i have to own the simooms faster than the palembang but if she was sailed by a better man shed make quicker passages why an engineer in a steamer can pass a thorough sailor in a scow his heart was bitter but the thought that her majestys cruiser amphion had discredited the simoom vigia was balm to his inmost soul as he turned to go below keep a bright lookout he growled and he left green to consider the matter of vigias in general and the simoom vigia in particular for these vigias the terror of seamen are like malicious spirits some man has seen them or has imagined them and for ever after they bear sway in the minds of those who sail upon the great deep perhaps they are but a floating mass of wreck on which the sea breaks in the south what was seen was it may be a drifting berg on the shores of west africa perchance a river has sent out a floating island any accident of imagination may create them alcohol bears them on its tide they are the rats and ghosts and terrible creeping things of the delirium of the sea that is born of rum a heavy heeled spar as it floats becomes a pinnacle of rock the boat that bears dead men in it is for ever after to be avoided here a rip of currents and there a heavy overfall become fixed terrors and are given names for this is the sea that is unknown yet and shall for ever be unknown it works upon the mind of man very subtly and yet again with tremendous strength under the sea are earthquakes and in it volcanoes of these islands are born and again they pass away while the little creature man skims upon the surface of the ocean like a waterbeetle and may be seen no more when green was left alone upon the poop of the palembang save for the presence of the man at the wheel something of the wonderful majesty of the sea came down upon him and for a moment touched his nerves trust in the captain he had none for spiller was of the usual alcoholic order so he got out the chart and looked at it there stood the vigia marked simoom rock perhaps it existed after all he remembered the history of the aurora islands to the cast of the falklands even now some old sailors believe there are such islands real land not ice grounded on deep soundings and the simoom vigia was close at hand if it existed at all allowing for sufficient uncertainty in its supposed position it might be anywhere within a degree he stared out into the darkness and imagined he saw it it was here it was there it was nowhere it was a wraith of the mind and dissolved he put back his nightglasses and whistled till he remembered there was quite enough wind and that he had no desire to turn the hands up to shorten sail jerusalem it is dark he said again and he recalled wilsons reply have the gas lit aye that would be pleasant for a moment he saw the streets of london town with a diminuendo in lamps and then he pulled himself together it breezed up a bit and was four bells he hove the log and went along the lee side to go below to enter it on the slate she made a biggish weather roll and the decks being slippery he steadied himself and put his head outside the rail to take a look ahead and at that moment as he says he saw the simoom vigia his heart stood still and then thumped furiously in spite of the hiss of the seas and the windy roar of the rigging the sound of his pulse in his ears was like the sound of a pump he was paralysed and yet he knew that the palembang was rushing on destruction hard a starboard he said coolly but in a choking voice sir said the astounded man at the wheel hard a starboard damn you said green fiercely and the helmsman ground the wheel hard down with the air of a surprised martyr as the palembang bowed and came round almost at right angles to her former course green swears he saw broken water though he lost the sharp pinnacle of rock he had seen at first old spiller who was not asleep came up on deck in a hurry whats she off her course for green told him and spiller swore you saw nothing you damn fool i did you didnt you imaginative ass green wanted to plant his fist between spillers eyes but did not for he was a married man and hated to lose a job he ground his teeth and turned away the palembang was put on her course again and after interrogating the man on the lookout and the man at the wheel who acknowledged they had seen nothing the skipper swore promiscuously at everything and went below to lay his soul in soak what one man sees anotherll look for and what a fool looks for a fool will see he cried without knowing what a neat addition he had made to the subject of suggestion and by the time that wilson relieved him at four oclock green was curiously uncertain as to whether he had seen straight or not now did you asked wilson two hours ago id have sworn to it said the second mate scratching his head well ive a notion you did cried wilson between you and me and the mizzenmast i think banks is a right smart man i believe i can swear i saw it said young green much encouraged yes there were at least three rocks one of them a pinnacle like an obelisk and with wilson secretly on his side he was quite sure of it before they reached bombay though spiller was for ever jeering at him and making the ship as uncomfortable as he could mebbe you can see ghosts too he was constantly suggesting ill quit at bombay if hell give me my discharge said green and sure enough spiller did when he met green on the apollo bunda in a confidential yarn with banks who for a seaman of the old class was a very gentlemanly man with neat white whiskers youve been encouraging him about that vigia roared spiller and when he wrote out greens discharge he offered to give him a special character for seeing ghosts but not rats said green nastily as he put his discharge into his pocket for the last time spiller overdrank himself he had a very bad time with rodents it was the best of luck for green that he got out of the palembang for bankss mate fell ill and the second had no mates ticket so green being in great favour through having seen the poor discredited simoom vigia got the job for he had passed for mate just before signing as second in the palembang banks took him round with him and again tackled the captain of the amphion about that vigia showing his new witness but captain melville shook his head the old man is crazy about those rocks was all he said as he refused to discuss the matter but banks and spiller went at it hammer and tongs when they met ashore he saw nothing said spiller only what i saw i told the fool about it and he imagined the rest as you did banks fumed lucky you didnt run the palembang on my imagination slow as she goes shed have slammed herself into matchwood spiller choked with rage look here ill sail all over your blooming rocks as i have done afore you just made this up to get notoriety and have your ships name on the chart and be put in the directory i know you banks and i dont think much of you and never did to get yourself talked about youd report that youd seen the flying dutchman vigias indeed a disfigurement on any chart youll have the chart of the indian ocean as big a disgrace as the north atlantic if you have your way didnt you find nothing new to report this time banks rose up in a towering rage youre no gentleman captain spiller and ill speak no more with you not till you own that the simoom rocks are real and may you never have occasion to rue finding them out as such ill let you know ive as great a respect for the chart as you have and if you ever run your old tub on my rocks you can call em spillers reef for all i care so there and he perspired off to his vessel in shipping circles opinion was divided between the master of the simoom and the master of the palembang and it being the fashion of the sailorman or for that matter of humankind in general to decide matters that admit of doubt according to personal prejudice and ancient opinion there were more on spillers side than on bankss for one thing it is the perpetual ambition of all true sons of the ocean to discover something new and have his ships name tagged on to it and every one was jealous of banks when the amphion looked for the rocks without success they threw out dark hints about a dead whale or a tree stump having been seen and some said rum just as others said rats contemptuously others with a very fine contempt for the navy were of opinion that captain melville of hms amphion considered he owned half the indian ocean and all the arabian sea and would be as much put out at finding an unmarked rock or shoal in either as if he slipped upon an old chew on his own quarterdeck these were on bankss side of course and some who disliked spiller said they believed in this new set of rocks to annoy him ending very naturally in holding the opinion they argued for when old banks got on the high horse and swore he would not speak again to the disbeliever in the vigia he meant it and added details to his statement not if i found him in a boat in the middle of the indian ocean he swore excitedly the quarrel was as bitter as polemic theology spiller was a rank atheist a scorner a scoffer a pagan a heathen if banks had written a new creed he would have begun it i believe in the simoom rocks to the west of the maldivhs he clung to their existence pathetically and when an impecunious skipper of a stormdisgruntled tramp wanted to borrow a couple of hundred rupees from him and remarked incidentally that he had seen broken water in the supposed position of the discredited reef banks forked out with enthusiasm and took down a lying statement joyfully but when the simoom was ready for sea again that same tramp skipper who was a wild disgrace to the respectable mystery of the sea executed a few manoeuvres which let the palembang get ahead of her for the tramp julius csar was her name had engines of an obstinate and eccentric character sometimes they worked and sometimes they didnt and on this particular occasion they refused to be reversed at any price as the julius csar wouldnt go astern her captain shoved her at the crowded shipping ahead and put her through whooping on the bridge like a maniac he grazed three other steamers took a bumpkin off a sailing vessel slipped between two others and in one last complicated evolution smashed the jibboom of the simoom brought down her foretopgallnmast and escaped to sea in a cyclone of curses of which the calm centre was the palembang ill report you said spiller to banks when he left bombay go to hell cried banks who rarely swore save in a gale of wind after you said spiller with what is popularly known as truly oriental politeness and as a parting taunt he sang out what about them rocks youre an ungrammatical uneducated man screamed banks dancing furiously but green and wilson waved their caps to each other for all their way of passing compliments when one gave the other a western ocean relief at midnight they were good friends the simoom got to sea inside of fortyeight hours for banks lost no time he had made up his mind to waste some on the next chance he had of looking for his blessed rocks unless the monsoon blew too hard they had a fairly decent show running down the coast on the inside of the laccadivhs and taking the usual circumbendibus to the eastward between keeling and the chagos archipelago picked up beautiful passage winds and southeast trades and went home booming green found banks a firstclass old man and the simoom as comfortable as a good bar parlour compared with the sorry old bughaunted palembang where a mans toes got sore with the pedicuring work of cockroaches he made up his mind to stick to her as he evidently suited banks they both got cracked a little on the simoom rocks and gradually talked themselves into the belief of a sharkstooth reef a mile long with one special fang that rivalled a young peak of teneriffe the palembang came into liverpool river about three weeks after the simoom and green back at work after ten days at home had a high time with wilson but the skippers passed each other with their noses in the air as high as squirrels tails and never swopped a word in a fortnight as luck would have it they were both for bombay again only to give spiller a chance of getting there first the simoom was to call at the cape just before the palembang cleared banks and spiller fell up against each other on the landing stage and as spiller was full up to his backteeth and uvula he broke silence and went for the upholder of the vigia in high style he could have taken a firstclass in bad language at any australian backblocks academy of cursingand what they dont know in blasphemy there can only be learnt from a lowclass spaniard so the air was blue from liverpool to manchester and to the isle of man and banks got up and left for when he was ashore he was very religious even at sea he carried a prayerbook and an odd volume of virulent sermons of the kind which indicate that no man need forgive any enemy who is not of the same persuasion but to tell the truth banks could have forgiven anything but an insult to his beloved rocks such a man oughtnt to live he cried angrily as he went off in a tremulous rage hes predestined to the pit and he trusted that providence might one day yield him a chance of getting even his prayers were fervent towards that end and if providence works as it sometimes appears to do through rum and ignorance and a good conceit in a man there was a chance of his appeals being attended to on the passage out to the cape they saw nothing of the palembang but there she was heard of as having being seen somewhere in the neighbourhood of the agulhas bank having a real good time in that native home of the god of the winds where fifty per cent of all the breezes that do blow are gales that dance in and out and about like a cooper round a cask but the simoom had luck and slipped through as if olus never spotted her and old banks chortled happily and sang an extra hymn on sunday compensating the men otherwise disposed to growl at the innovation with an extra lot of grog for your true sailorman is the real conservative and things that dont happen in the first week of a new ship have no business to happen afterwardswhich is a hint some young second mates may find handy to remember and remembering this will enable you to see why no true old shellback will ship in a steamboat any more than the guard of a coach would let himself to any beastly new railroad the southwest monsoon had backed down to the line about the time they crossed it and the simoom sweated up to the maldivhs very comfortably weve made a good passagea ripping good passage said old banks rubbing his hands and im condemned if i dont shape a course for my rocks mr green as he had been shaping for them ever since he had deliberately gone out of his way to take the route east of madagascar instead of the inner or mozambique route green winked the other eye and said nothing to tell the truth he himself had a hankering to set his mind at rest on the subject for he felt his credit involved with the skippers the man at the wheel overheard what banks said and when he stumped forard the whole crew knew that the simoom was looking for a needle in the indian ocean a lifes job my bullies said their informant well be like the crew of the flying dutchman yet im wondering whether spiller came up this way now said old banks presently with an interrogative cock of his head and not by the channel asked green banks turned about mr green may the lord forgive me but i just hate that spiller with an unholy hatred every time he gets a show he brags hes run right over where i located my rocks and not only that but crisscross in the latitude where they might be and he set about that hed herringboned a course on the chart on the longitude going back and forth on it like a dog in a turnip field so now hell be up here again to have another shy for it if he saw em hed swear he never and why he hates me so i cant tell unless it was i did my duty once and let him know what a godfearing man thought of a blasphemer green nodded thats likely it sir so it is so it is cried banks pensively he has no grace in him and he set it about i know that i soak at sea if im sober ashore he said my rocks were delirium tremens and im a discredited man wounded in a tender spot it was just four bells in the forenoon watch then and soon after they snugged her down as the wind was very heavy in puffs and the sky low and dark just before eight bells green spotted a vessel on the starboard bow and called the old man he came on deck like a whiteheaded jackinthebox keep her away he cried ill bet shes the palembang shake out them reefs and hoist the maintgallnsl again his grammar failed in excitement were overhauling her hand over hand anyhow suggested green if i can pass him going two foot for his one id run the simoom under screamed the skipper and when we come up with him if my voice in a trumpet can carry ill tell him what i think of him he thinks im soft because i sing hymns on sunday ill let him know before i sang hymns i was the biggest tough on the australian coast gods truth i was and i wish i was nowoh how i wish it and him ashore with me and green believed it because he had to there was something in the old mans eye as he walked to and fro an unregenerate bloodthirsty snap that was very convincing so the reefs were shaken out of the topsails and even that did not satisfy the skipper ill let him know that a saved and repentant christian isnt necessary a worm said banks mr green set the mainsail the simoom was snoring through it now and green stared what she cant carry she may drag said the skipper with flashing eyes and the simoom lost her courtesy with the sea under the influence of the mainsail for the monsoon was a stiff one she shouldered the indian ocean aside like a policeman shoving through a crowd she scooped up tons of it as a scraper team scoops sand and ran at any extra sea like a bull at a hedge the men were under the break of the tgallant focsle sheltering from the cataract they knew the palembang was ahead and were as eager as the skipper to overhaul her through the boson and his mate it had leaked out that the old man was keen for a palaver with spiller hes like a bull whale in a flurry said one who had been whaling now my notion is that the skipper kin blaspheme if he wants to the palembang was visibly herself and no other vessel by this time and she carried all she could stand ive half a notion to have the tgallnsails set said banks looking up aloft and if we werent overhauling her twentythree to the dozen damme but i would for the palembang showed nothing above her reefed topsails and the foresail had a reef in it and the simoom came after her like the inside edge of a cyclone gimme my trumpet cried banks mr green take the wheel and run her as close as maybe and the second mate stood at the maintopsail halliards palembang ahoy yelled banks through his trumpet as he came tearing up on the weather side of his enemys ship where the blue blazes are you coming to shrieked spiller who was both drunk and angry passing you as if you was standing still you low uneducated swine said banks and i could do it under jury rig what about them rocks jeered spiller through his trumpet whats the price of vigias you notorious old liar you disgrace to the perfession they were close alongside now not half a cables length apart a good cricketer could have shied a cricket ball the distance easily leggo the maintopsail halliards said banks and then to the surprise of his crew and the utter astonishment of spiller he poured out a torrent of the most bloodcurdling abuse which had ever defiled the indian or any other ocean you think im soft you dog he boomed through his spurt of blasphemy and reckon because ive got notions of decency im to be trod on run on my rocks and sink and burn his voice rose to a scream and cracked he tried to speak but tried in vain mr green here he whispered and leaving the wheel to the man he had displaced the mate jumped to the lee poop rail tell him hes no sailor my voice is gone say hes aoh tell him anything you feel green did so and satisfied himself and banks and the entire crew and then seeing wilson he gave him a friendly bellow what cheer wilson and hoisting the topsails they ran on leaving spiller choking with helpless rage as it grew darker and they dropped the palembang they picked up the mainsail and shortened down for the night we aint in no hurry whispered banks and tomorrow well be up with my rocks if ive hit it off right he was now sombre and dignified and spoke with particular grammatical and moral accuracy not the ghost of a damn issued from his lips he reproved green for swearing and held a service in the cabin much to the disgust of the entire ship as it wasnt sunday perhaps to punish himself for he always liked to stand well with the crowd he gave them no grog after it in the morning he sent a man on the foretopgallantyard looking for his rocks and as he gave notice that any one who sighted them first should have five pounds the entire watch which should have been below snoring sat like crows up aloft and strained their eyes all round the horizon at ten banks was jovial and got his voice back at noon he was anxious by four oclock he shortened sail again weve overrun em he said sadly if theyre still about were to the west of em mr green during the night well stand under easy sail to the eastward im set on seeing those rocks again if i lose a week and the night fell darkly no matter whose watch it was mates or second mates the whitewhiskered skipper was on deck every ten minutes peering into the black darkness with his glasses the old chaps nerves were on edge his imagination flamed he saw reefs and pinnacles of islands every moment and heard the boom of breakers when green relieved his subordinate at midnight the second mate whispered to him the old mans as nervous as a cat to hear him jaw youd think the bottom of the sea was rising up mind you aint high and dry on a new continent by daylight well whack it out fair among the lot of us said green jeewhillikins whats that he spoke suddenly in an altered voice and milton jumped what i thought i saw a flare to the southward lordy youve got them too said milton lets go ashore and have a walk on the apollo bunda stow it cried green and holding on to the mizzentopgallant backstay he jumped upon the rail look look he cried and milton looking saw a faint glow to the southwardor fancied he saw it call the old man said green and in two and threefifths seconds by any mans chronometer banks was on deck and saw nothing but did ye see it man he yelled and if so whats it mean some one struck a match in colombo said the second mate irreverently for he had sailed with banks for years and at times took liberties i only trust to providence that it isnt that wicked mans ship in any trouble said the skipper viciously mr green well stand to the southard for a while lay aft the watch sang out milton and they braced her up to within two points of the wind both watches stayed on deck in the little excitement and in the course of the next hour they reported all kinds of nonexistent things rocks on the starboard bow were varied by a vessel on the port bow and a planet low down in a break of cloud was a steamers headlight sir collision with venus cried milton but just in the twixt and tween of earliest dawn when the grey ghost of day walked in the east a man up aloft sang out with startling energy two dark rocks right ahead sir the maindeck hummed suddenly and a patter of bare feet told that the entire crew had run for the focsle head the skipper nipped into the mizzen rigging quick as a chipmunk keep her away a point or two he cried away a point or two sir echoed the helmsman i see em mr green yelled the old chap and just where i figured them out to be therell be three therell be three he paused and looked down on green butbut two will do me he added cautiously i never pinned my faith to three green climbed alongside him and even a bit higher lord sir theyre boats he cried no rocks said the skipper boats repeated the mate obstinately so they are damn cried the skipper and then the same verdict came from aloft and was confirmed by the entire sea jury the disappointed captain dropped back on deck now if they were the palembangs boats suggested green no such luck said the skipper is there any one in em and do they see us by the same token they see us now shouted green and in a quarter of an hour the boats were alongside and the simoom lay to what boats are those squealed banks the palembangs replied a voice from the tumbling cockleshells the skipper and the mates said whew and banks was fairly dancing and wheres your ship bottom of the indian ocean said a voice that banks recognised as spillers is that you captain spiller he inquired with much exaggerated courtesy it is growled spiller did you by any chance come across my rocks as you sailed along so pleasant spiller swore in a muffled voice not by your description of em far from it he replied at last well see about that said banks now then come under the lee quarter and well have some of you aboard the captain of the palembang last whad yer mean cried spiller sulkily what i say said banks softly and when every one was out of the boats but spiller he stood by the line now captain were they my rocks or not no said spiller then stay in your damned boat cried banks cast that line off spiller you wont then cut it mr green green smiled but didnt move the skipper borrowed a knife from the nearest seaman by taking it out of its sheath now was they or not no cried spiller one two and at three i cut said banks onetwo very well they was then shrieked spiller and the next minute he was on deck ill have you sign a paper to that effect said banks and if you dont the whole of your crew will including your mate wilson who was standing by green said that he would willingly and when spiller scowled he scowled back and now mr green cried banks cheerfully since we know where they are and can find em any time you may put her on her course again and well have a little thanksgiving service for all this he did not explain whether the service was for the established character of the simoom rocks or for the rescue of the shipwrecked crew but when he got them all below he handed round hymn books first of all we will sing hymn no of hymns ancient and modern he said softly and when spiller looked it up he was very much annoyed three in a game things were quiet in san franciscothat is to say though the usual blackguards spouted on the sandlot on sundays there was no great political row on the president of the united states had still three years to run before any chance of a second term and local politics had quietened the governor of the state though an angel to one side and a devil to the other had been let up on at last and the reporters for the daily papers had to invent stories to keep themselves going that only kept their hand in it was a blessing to them without any disguise when the rivalry between young jack hunt and sibley gawthrop for the hand and the money and the affections of edith atherton became public property it was most of all a blessing to gardiner the smartest new man on the san francisco chronicle who knew both of the boys well for how could any story fail to pay dividends when two of the swagger anglofrancocalifornians the most beautiful girl on the coast and shanghai smith the most scoundrelly boardinghouse keeper on the pacific played leading parts in the drama and when one reflects that san francisco the pacific itself and the atlantic and the sailors home in well street london came into the newspaper play quite naturally it seems obvious there was meat for any reporters teeth gardiner of course was not in the hightoned gang to which hunt and gawthrop belonged but he knew them both very well although he had only been in california a short year he knew every one in san francisco from the biggest toughs on telegraph hill and the political bosses to the big pots and their womankind he knew miss atherton too he wanted to know her better though he was on the staff of the chronicle it was his own fault if he could have only got on with his father in new york he might have been as rich as hunt himself but the boy who cannot differ on vital points with his father before he is sixteen is no true american and gardiner was us to his fingertips ill get there yet said gardiner his chance was coming there are more ways of succeeding than one how is it you bow to a reporter on the chronicle my dear asked a friend of edith athertons i understand that is what he is i do it because he might have been my brother said edith atherton what do you mean i mean that his father nearly married my mother said edith but he was too autocratic and he married an englishwoman i dont wonder george gardiner could not hit it off with him poor boy i wish he could certainly he was far finerlooking than either hunt or gawthropthat is the way her friend interpreted the girls sigh and hes cleverer too said the older woman acutely nevertheless and nevertheless was very easy to interpret which will it be i wonder said her friend the solution lay on the knees of the gods and in the hands of shanghai smith that night hunt met gardiner at the club by chance and stayed with him all the evening what are you looking so down about asked the newspaper man you are drinking too much ease up on it indeed hunt was drinking too much he drank enough to loosen his tongue damn that gawthrop he said ah i see cried gardiner is that it and hunt nodded sulkily then he wept if he was only out of the way he moaned i believe i could work the racket with her gardiner shrugged his shoulders ah well buck up come on im going to the office they walked into kearney street and turned east towards the chronicle offices as they passed bush street a very hardlooking citizen nodded to gardiner whos that asked hunt dont you know him thats shanghai smith the biggest scoundrel unhung hes a sailors crimp and a daylight robber and a man with a pull certainly smith had some political power in the united states it is impossible to avoid politics and the police at the same time except by lavish bribery and why do they call him shanghai asked hunt because he shanghais men answered gardiner and nowadays that means drugging a man and putting him aboard some ship oh hes a daisy hed ship your dad to new york round the horn if there was money in it when a man disappears in this city we look first in the morgue and then make inquiries at smiths i wish gawthrop was in the morgue i do said hunt and here ill say goodnight youre a good chap gardiner if you are a newspaper man and its been a relief to talk to you so it has they shook hands and parted but gardiner had not walked ten yards before he turned and came back his eyes glittered curiously hunts were blurred and fishy he had certainly taken a little too much gardiner wondered if he had taken too much to remember in the morning what happened now you wish he was in the morgue eh i do said hunt firmly i do why not get him shanghaied asked gardiner and he walked away very swiftly and did not return when hunt called to him by the great horn spoon and the tail of the sacred bull ill not give her up said gardiner certainly not to a man like hunt or to a dude like gawthrop sooner than that ill write to the old man and squeal hell rub it in but after all he is the dad and she ah she was everything let the best man win im in the game after all said gardiner and to think if she hadnt recognised me today id have thrown it up he was not surprised to see hunt the next afternoon though every one else in the office was astonished to see him looking for a mere reporter do you remember what you said to me last night asked hunt rather nervously about what about somebody called shanghai smith he stared out of the window as he spoke i remember hunt can it be done can what be done could i get rid of that gawthrop for a month or two i shouldnt be surprised if you put up the dollars will you help me and get myselfdisliked he was going to sayget myself in the penitentiary but on reflection he did not desire to frighten hunt after all the affair would cause so much laughter that legal proceedings were not likely to rise out of it i dont want you to show only give me a pointer could you bring this smith to me gardiner stabbed his desk with a penknife and considered the matter for a moment look here he said i want to deal as squarely as i can with you i dont want either you or gawthrop to marry this particular lady hunt stared at him you dont oh i say gardiner and he burst into laughter which gardiner apparently did not resent yes i know im a newspaper dog and so on let that be if i chose to crawl down and go east i could stack dollar for dollar with half of you in time what im telling you is this i think gawthrop has more show than you and id be glad to get him out of the way just as hed no doubt be glad to get you out ill help if youll hold your tongue about me whatever happens very well said hunt i give you my word whatever happens whatever happens of course i shall do everything i can to win thats only natural said hunt but ill bet you a thousand dollars that if i get gawthrop out of the way ill marry miss atherton inside of three months whatever happens whatever happens then i take that bet said gardiner and tomorrow you shall meet shanghai but when hunt had gone gardiner winked steadily at nothing and stroked his chin great scott this is a game he said i wonder where gawthrop is but before he found out he sat down and wrote a letter to the elder gardiner in new york it was late that evening before he went down to that undesirable quarter of san francisco known as the barbary coast where shanghai smith had his sailorrobbing den located as he went along the waterfront and saw the ships lying at the wharves it was plumb dark though he knew every tough in the city he walked some way from the edge of the wharves and kept his hand on his sixshooter in the righthand pocket of his coat there is never any knowing what may happen in the low quarters of that sink of the pacific where all the scum of the world gathers and it is well to keep ones eyes skinned lest worse may befall gardiner had no desire to turn up on a trestle at the morgue as his next public appearance but though he was careful he went cheerfully and could not help laughing great scott to think of sibley gawthrop as an able seaman on board the harvester or the wanderer but wont it do him good these young californians are a rotten crowd he came at last to smiths house and stepped upon the verandah floor boldly why its mr gardiner of the chronicle so it is said billy who was smiths runner and next to his boss and a few politicians the hardest case in california is it mr smith you want to see sir im only just doing a run around and thought id look in billy said gardiner carelessly ay just a cultus nannitch as they say in chinook replied billy but were always glad to see you gardiner doubted that but smith was always civil to newspaper men he hadnt gardiner bought as he had the police and he knew that a true column and a bit on his doings might bring down an avalanche any day and here is mr smith said billy how are you makin it asked smith and whatll you drink but gardiner was not drinking it was so notoriously unhealthy to drink at shanghais place that few sober men were reckless enough to take a cocktail there how are you off for men asked gardiner is business good smith shook his head men there are too many of em now hell aint fuller of devils mr gardiner than what san francisco is of sailors and you know as well as me that with sailormen a drug in the market i dont come out on top to be sure said gardiner but i was thinking as i came along that you might get a ship for a young friend of mine ill be glad to do anythin for any friend of yours said smith but as im tellin you tis as easy to be president of the united states as to do business with the streets full of men that lets on to be sailors what kind of a job is your friend lookin for gardiner laughed i want him to go a voyage before the mast it will do him good ah said smith quickly whats the game but whatever it is with you im on say it and mean itthats me gardiner edged him up to the quiet end of the verandah smith can you hold your tongue and earn a thousand dollars can i do what asked smith look here so help me id cut my tongue out for a thousand i tell you things are tough whats the game and gardiner after looking round whispered in his ear whew whistled smith you dont mean it young sibley gawthrop holy sailor id rather not touch him his father is a power in the land gardiner shrugged his shoulders oh very well there are others and in any case who need know you took a hand in it now will you or wont you yes or no or i quit right here you dont quit ill do it said smith ill do it for you cod it can be judged how much he did it for gardiner when cod is translated cash on delivery right said gardiner and pick him a nice easy ship a good old english limejuicer will be the thing i want him to go to europe he went up town and curiously enough found himself having supper in the swagger restaurant of the city at the next table to hunts victim gawthrop i want to have a talk with you on very special business he said can you spare me half an hour tomorrow morning if i call on you and when they parted next morning after their talk on very special business sibley gawthrop was in a high state of excitement if i can only get that hunt out of the way for three months i believe i can work the racket with her but what i cant understand is gardiners notion that he has any chance i suppose thats what he meant by keeping on saying dont think i do this for you im not in it for friendship or for my health ill do you if i can poor beggar he hasnt the least show oh but isnt this a game to think of old hunt turning up in the london docks he actually drove along the waterfront that morning in order to gloat over the ships in the harbour and when he saw men working up aloft he burst into laughter the notion was splendid whatever motive gardiner had in putting him up to it it was odd that he had never taken any interest in the seafaring trade of the city before gawthrop eyed the very loafers on the wharves with new feelings though he did not know it he saw shanghai smith and his runner billy at the bottom of spear street jehoshaphat said smith now this is a queer coincdence billy thats the young feller ive been telling you about see him rather growled bill when do you want him shipped and how am i to get him ill tell you when its fixed up said smith ive got to see the chap thats runnin the show therell be a holy row on about it grunted bill it aint exackly legitimate business mr smith its all mighty well doin what i know i can get a crew out of a ship in the bay with any man but shanghain sons of millionaires youre a forsaken fool said smith if you do it neatly whos to know till he comes back and who knows then you or i done it and aint i reckonin to allow you a bonus of ten dollars extra with times as they is now ten dollars is ten dollars lemme tell you and youve taken to growlin lately in a way im not goin to stand bill i dont want any slackjaw from you so there whos givin any slackjaw expostulated the runner i suppose a man can hev an opinion and he can keep it till called for too said his boss i can lick you any time and bill growled who says you cant would i be workin for you if you couldnt the inference was not exactly obvious that afternoon gardiner came down again to the barbary coast and had another talk with shanghai smith what another of em asked shanghai i say mr gardiner this is a bit thick yes its two thousand dollars thick said gardiner if you could only ship a whole crew on such terms you might retire and go in for politics and whos the man this time its jack hunt him as is payin for gawthrop gardiner nodded and whos payin for hunt gardiner took him by the greasy lapel of his coat ill tell youits gawthrop gardiner who was doing the dramatic criticism for the chronicle that night saw gawthrop and hunt in miss athertons box at the opera house they appeared to be on very good terms and were both in an excellent humour for all that he had planned george gardiner was in no great good temper when he imagined that edith showed more favour to sibley than to his rival hes not a bad sort but hes not the sort to marry a girl like that said gardiner if she only knew the life he has led shed give him the mitten right off and i could let her know its doing him a favour to send him to sea and as for hunt hes really mean life wont be all pie to him as hes laid it out to be shell think theyve shied off and will be mad and more ready to listen to a man who has loved her for years as she knows if shed only take me while im poor id be the proudest man in california and wouldnt it make all california sick though he did not know it both gawthrop and hunt played into his hands each was quite convinced that he was the favoured lover and as they both had a secret they used it when they got a chance gawthrop is a very nice fellow said jack hunt condescendingly but he never knows his own mind miss atherton i should never be surprised to hear he had gone to europe hes fond of travel and very very inconstant indeed said edith she had found him fairly persevering it was strange when hunt was called outside for a few minutes that gawthrop who this night had shown no jealousy threw out a dark hint that hunt was no true californian i shouldnt be in the least surprised to hear he had gone to europe he said hes very flighty i suppose that is the reason he didnt marry while he was young hunt was thirty and his rival was twentysix and dont you want to see europe asked edith who wondered what was in the wind ah some day but not alone answered sibley i shall never go without a companion you should go with jack hunt said edith mischievously i certainly wonder none of you travel more now mr gardiner down there has been all over the world ah poor gardiner said sibley how is it so clever and goodnatured a man should be doing what he is and much to sibleys astonishment edith atherton turned on him with an odd question welland what are you doing perhaps if gardiner had heard her ask that question he might have considered that shanghai smith need not intervene after all but smith did intervene that night when gawthrop left the theatre he went straight down market street to the waterfront and found his way to shanghai smiths without any difficulty he had plenty of pluck and plenty of ignorance of the real conditions of life in san francisco what he heard and what he read about the matter did not touch him he lived in security in quite another world from the scoundrels at the bottom of clay street and the toughs of the coast life there was a theatrical representation he sat in the stalls and said poor devils do they really live that way he was sibley gawthrop the son of a big man he was a power himself he had no fear and went into the trap smiling if he carried in his hip pocket what westerners call a gun it was on account of western traditions he showed no caution though he walked whistling in the middle of the road he had no chance to use any weapon and he never saw smith he never even saw billy smiths runner till billy sandbagged him on the back of the head for smith was not to be found at his house he was with gardiner and they were both waiting till they heard from the runner that gawthrop was safely disposed of i aint goin to show in it said smith and why should i the hampshire is short of two hands as i shipped in her myself they dont go aboard when they should and they turns up drunk at my house and billy puts them on board can i help it if he puts the wrong ones on her of course i caynt and if billy finds the cash agreed on on em and hands it to me why ill keep it till its claimed by the owners of it he winked his eye at gardiner and the journalist burst into laughter theyll not touch me he said and if they do i shall either have the laugh on them or shant care as he spoke there was a message sent up from the street a boy wanted to see mr gardiner a printers devil of course said gardiner but he knew the word came from billy billy mr smiths runner gimme a quarter to run up to you sir and say its all right said the young hoodlum and he said you was to gimme another quarter billy had said nothing of the kind but the boy got it all the same and half an hour later jack hunt interviewed billy the runner in about the same place in the dark road that gawthrop had met him the runner went through his pockets eagerly two thousand in the one night said billy oh aint smith doin well and two firstclass guns as belongs to me ill shove em on board the hampshire bright and early oh i done it clean and neat he had great professional pride and when he came alongside the hampshire at four oclock in the morning and found all hands getting up the anchor he felt that the thing was going to finish itself without a hitch once at sea and the jobs complete hallo there send down a whip into the boat he cried ive got them two as skipped and good men too when theyre sober he heard the first mate bellow mr jones get these swine on board quick drunk are they well sober em up aloft and loose the topsails and the two lights of san francisco society were carried into the focsle blimy but id give sumfink to be as blind speechless as this said one cockney and there aint no chance of it till we gets to london but the mate was roaring overhead they dropped hunt and gawthrop into two empty bunks and went on deck cant you turn those men to asked the chief mate mr ladd of jones and jones went into the focsle and punched both of these gentlemen in the ribs wake up you drunken galoots said jones in answer they both sighed and snored and turned peaceably to rest jones who knew a bit unhooked the lamp from the sweating beam overhead and lifting hunts eyelid with his thumb saw that the mans pupil was down to a pinpoint it was the same with gawthrop hocussed of course he said and he reported aft that not even putting them under the hose would wake them for some hours confound all california and its manners and customs said ladd but the manners and customs of shanghai smith at any rate saved hunt and gawthrop from eight hours of the finest education in the world it was noon and the hampshires crowd was at dinner when gawthrop showed signs of animation ah humph said gawthrop and without opening his eyes he reached out and pressed the head of a small bolt with his thumb whats the josser doin of asked tom the cockney who had sighed over the fact that there was no chance of getting intoxicated until they reached london johnson give me some tea said gawthrop he believed that his man had answered the electric bell but there was a johnson or more properly a johanssen among the crew here dutchy give him some tea gawthrop opened his eyes and yawned he shut his eyes again but did not shut his mouth in time to prevent bill yardley who was the joker of the crowd dropping a piece of soaked biscuit into it gawthrop spluttered coughed violently and sat up as he did so he of course hit his head a smart crack on the deck above him he sat up again on his elbow and stared about him stupidly ere come out matey and ave yer grub cried the kindly crew with one voice youve ad a rare good caulk said tom encouragingly eh eh what asked gawthrop he blinked at the men and with a fallen jaw wagged his head from side to side where am i he asked on board the ampshire sonny said tom come show a leg humph said gawthrop and he rolled a dry tongue against his teeth am i asleep ill lay odds you wont be in ten minutes said tom whats the game youre playin gawthrop stared at him and rolled his eyes round the focsle he saw fifteen grinning faces in the light from the scuttle above outside the open focsle door he beheld the foremast with its rail and the gear coiled on the pins its a ship said gawthrop its obviously a ship the men looked at each other dye think hes a greenhorn hocussed shanghaied the word shanghai fetched gawthrop clean out of his dream it hit him fair and square and though it halfstunned him it woke him all the same where am i in the hampshire and at sea said all hands eagerly they saw what had happened quicker than he did for reasons which he did not yet understand they believed him a seaman but they saw he had been shipped against his will dye think it was shanghai smith as done it ah said gawthrop why wheres hunt dye mean your mate as come aboard wid you asked tom there e is ard and fast asleep wake im up chaps i say eres a game gawthrop put a leg out and dropped on deck just as tom got hunt by the hair and gave it a yank that nearly raised his scalp but did not wake him is this im in the halflight gawthrop saw a face which was the colour of dark mahogany and did not recognise his rival no he said he did not know that billy with a professional ardour that did him credit had coloured hunt and himself with walnut juice on their faces and hands till they appeared to have been tanned the three skins deep and just as gawthrop denied that he knew hunt the bosons whistle blew youd best come on deck theyre goin to pick the watches said tom and gawthrop still in a maze followed the rest when the fresh air blew on him his mind cleared as suddenly as if a fog had rolled up by the lord ive been done he said and he knew it was gardiner who had done him all right he said ill get even the captain must put back ill pay him to do it his knowledge of the sea was limited though he was the citizen of a republic he had been accustomed to deference that was when he was sibley gawthrop he was now a nameless man in dungaree trousers and a blue shirt in a ship bound for london with a fine fair wind he walked aft with the defiant yet shamed air of a man who has been at a fancy ball and finds himself surprised by daylight i want to see the captain he said to the first man whom he met aft it happened to be jones the second greaser thats him on the poop said jones staring at him take a good look at him you drunken swab why the blue blazes didnt you come on board before my good fellow said gawthrop haughtily there has been a mistake i must be put on shore immediately oh said jones oh indeed there has been a fatal error has there and im your good fellow am i take that you swine and what gawthrop took caused him to sit down very suddenly on a hard teak deck whats the matter mr jones asked the captain coming to the break of the poop nothing sir nothing said jones foaming at the mouth only this ratty hoodlum isnt sober yet ill have him in my watch if mr ladd hasnt any fancy for him sir said gawthrop still in a sitting position im not a sailor and have been put on board against my will my names gawthropsibley gawthrop of menlo park im well known in san francisco dry up said jones known to the police i should say and your names either fisher or bates and wheres that other josser ill soon see if hes one of the same sort he shot forward and was presently seen emerging from the focsle holding the astounded hunt by the nape of the neck he ran him aft and discharged him like a catapult right among the men he fell down alongside gawthrop mr jones mr jones said the skipper mildly but if he was going to remonstrate with jones on his american methods the two hands who had caused the fuss put him off for hunt and gawthrop on recognising each other as they did now in spite of their high colouring lost no time in speech but went for each other without a word they locked together and rolled headlong into the starboard scuppers for though the ship was on an even keel with a fine northerly breeze the deck had a big camber to it then captain singleton lost all his mildness at this outrageous insult to his high authority pull them apart he roared as jones dived for gawthrops ankle and two of the crew got hunt by the legs what the devil does this mean it means hes had me shanghaied said hunt i know it and youoh ill kill you spluttered gawthrop send them both up here said the captain he stared at them like a fury when they stood before him no two harder looking cases ever had an interview with a skipper for gawthrop was bleeding from the nose and hunt had lost all his shirt but the neckband they glared at each other and jones stood between them ready now then said singleton before i put you in irons id like to know what you mean by daring it was paralysing to both gawthrop and hunt to be looked at as the captain looked at them they felt like the scum of the earth its a mistake a dreadful mistake said hunt if you will put me ashore ill give you five thousand dollars and the eager crowd on the maindeck sniggered lord hes very big in drink aint e said tom the skipper frowned and shook his fist right against hunts face you hound dont joke with me whats this mans name mr jones its either bates or fisher said jones no my names hunt cried hunt and one of the men on deck an insinuating beggar who liked to curry favour with the powers cried his names fisher sir ive seed him often about the front its not its not said hunt furiously im a man well known in san francisco shut up said jones the other joskin said that i wont shut up roared hunt quite losing his temper i warn you all to put me ashore or ill ruin the lot of you oh said the captain indeed well well see mr jones you can have the one therebates i think mr ladd look after this sailorman with the five thousand dollars now if theres another word comes out of either of you or if you start fighting again and i hear of it ill make the pair of you wish youd died before you saw me and jones shoved both of them down on the maindeck the two unfortunates recognised that their only chance and that the faintest lay in speaking together but were neither of us sailors sir they said piteously this is where we manufacture sailors said captain singleton who was not without humour mr jones mr ladd you hear that i hope they wont be able to say as much for themselves this day three months and the crew laughed as in duty bound but hunt and gawthrop did not laugh dye think theres any truth in what those two men said asked captain singleton of his mate likely enough sir replied ladd arent we out of san francisco i certainly dont seem to remember their faces said the skipper but theyll have to do make what you can of them if its any ways true its no good telling them we think so certainly not sir said ladd but whats their remedy he knew perfectly well that there was no practical remedy against the ship and hunt and gawthrop were well aware they had none against their friend shanghai smith or against gardiner they had no chance of speaking to each other till the second dogwatch and then only in the presence of the whole crowd who were very anxious to get to the bottom of the mystery they aint sailormen not they growled the oldest man on board who came from brook street shadwell and was known as shadwell though his real name was shaw and a nice thing for hus two less to take the wheel i calls it a bally shime he looked at hunt with an air of unutterable contempt and sniffed every time the man spoke gawthrop who was younger and more elastic sat on the other side of the focsle and presently addressed hunt i suppose we must make the best of it hunt dont speak to me sir said hunt and the crew roared tell us ow it appened do said tom oh aint your friend aughty tell us as e got that five thousand dollars not on him replied gawthrop look ere said tom if youll tell us the troof ill stand you a drop of rum ive a nip left and this is a teetotal ship this is he could not conceive any man refusing such a bribe and gawthrop in spite of everything could hardly help laughing at hunts face he took the rum partly to have an excuse for telling the story it was the wisest thing to be friends with every one and after all if he was out of the running for a time so was hunt well said gawthrop i and my cheerful friend over there are very great friends indeed but i wanted him out of san francisco for a time for reasons and i got shanghai smith to arrange it we know him said the crowd eagerly oh yes we know him i stayed in is ouse so did i shut up and let him tell us and hunt by now was all alone on the starboard side even old shadwell came across to hear the yarn another friend of mine suggested it said gawthrop and fixed it up for me that was gardiner said hunt it was said gawthrop and i paid a thousand dollars to have mr hunt put here thats what i paid to have you put here said hunt a friend of mine put me up to it that was gardiner said gawthrop it was said hunt and thats why were both here said gawthrop and his aspect was at once so melancholy and so comic that all hands shrieked with laughter old shadwell creaked like the cheep of a block but whatd this hyer gardiner to do with the show asked the only american in the crew it looks like as if he played the pair of you for suckers you hear that hunt i hear said hunt sulkily wait till i see him you aint told us hall said shadwell with a gloomy air of suspicion i knows somethin of life and somethin about women and there was a woman in this mr shadwell is right said gawthrop i was to have taken her for a drive this morning said hunt and a pretty sort of a man i shall look not turning up never mind said gawthrop i was to have taken her out this afternoon old shadwell nodded gloomily what ave i often told you about em boys he said this proves it a womans like a cat with nine lives and nine sorts of dispositions and if she dont satisfy em with nine sort of man fool she aint happy ive know them as nine wouldnt satisfy and theyre all the same theres different nations of men but women is all one nation you can bet your boots you two fellers that your girl is out with some one else this here vyge will do you good if it rams that into you he turned to the others dye believe what this young feller has told you they said they did shadwell turned again to gawthrop its ard lines on men as is sailormen and ships so shortanded as they always is with greedy owners to ave shipmates as cant do their work but you look bright young feller and if you skips quick and does your best there aint no reason as you shouldnt be some kind of use in the world before were off the horn and i say the same to you over there go to the devil replied hunt sulkily sailormen dont go there they goes to fidlers green said shadwell and mark me put the girl out of your minds this was a putup job and she was in it shell marry this here gardiner he hasnt a cent said gawthrop contemptuously it dont follow said shadwell stubbornly that because woman is wicked by nature they aint silly by choice i tell you gardiner as gone to windard of you hes laughin this very minute and so he was but edith atherton was by no means amused at the sudden disappearance of the two men who were supposed to stand highest in her favour whether she cared much or little for either of them or not it was unpleasant to have them fail to keep their appointments and to leave san francisco without a word of explanation her first and very natural impulse was to let every one infer that she had rejected both of them but when old mr gawthrop called on her during the second day she had to own that she understood the mystery as little as the newspapers did and all the papers were very keen on any scent but mr gawthrop they both said something that i could not understand mr hunt said that he was sure that your son would soon go to europe and not ten minutes after sibley said the same of mr hunt the explanation seemed easy to the old man both of them imagined that his rejected rival would travel the rest must be a coincidence he went away to the police and the police invented many hypotheses they were learned in the matter of disappearances in san francisco but none of the hypotheses seemed to fit both the young men were wealthy and it seemed certain that one or the other of them was bound to succeed with the lady in question nevertheless old gawthrop learnt some things about his son which surprised him there was one newspaper which suggested that they might have been shanghaied it was the chronicle on which gardiner worked for though he had made up his mind to do very little more work on any paper he was loyal to his flag so long as he hoisted it and meant that the chronicle should be able to sail in at the last and say we told you so and when every one else on the paper failed in getting an interview with miss atherton he volunteered to try you must understand however he said to his editor that even if i see her i dont promise to write anything about it you see i knew her a little when she was in new york two years ago and though im not in the giltedged crowd she adorns here i owe her something and edith atherton saw him although she did consider a man on a newspaper little if anything higher than a deckhand in a bay ferryboat she had never understood what he was doing in california at all he went to interview her and she interviewed him im here as a man from the chronicle miss atherton said gardiner he spoke almost timidly it was the first time he had ever been alone with her you are not here as a man from the chronicle said edith you mean said gardiner eagerly i mean that said edithjust that you are here as the mr gardiner i met in new york gardiners eyes sparkled he looked at her smiled and then laughed but maynt i ask you anything about themystery he asked i dont see what it has to do with me replied edith but i see your paper says they have been shanghaied tell me what that means he explained no man knew better you mean they have gone to sea as common sailors she exclaimed that is the theory of the chronicle said gardiner drily if we are right it will do them both good im rather sorry for sibley gawthrop she said but gardiner was not so young as to be discouraged by her sympathy for sibley may i be sorry for him too asked gardiner boldly edith atherton stared at him and dropped her eyes how is your father she asked irrelevantly he was a very nice old man so he is replied gardiner the only trouble was that he believed he owned me he came from the south and was one of the few southerners who on losing their slaves played their own game on the men from the north he and i quarrelled about a subject in which i considered he had no right to interfere there were no obvious implications in the way he spoke and edith atherton saw none what was that she asked innocently enough his view was that i shouldnt marry until he let me i wanted to marry you edith gasped a little and took hold of her chair as she bent forward indeed mr gardiner and i still want to miss atherton and as the lady whom he wished me to marry was married a month ago i think he will forgive me if i ask him it was always understood even when we parted that he would reinstate me as his partner if i succeeded for myself and have you succeeded asked edith with bent head gardiner rose from his chair and went towards her that is for you to say he cried and when he returned to the office he handed in no more than a paragraph it was considered in some quarters an adequate explanation of the disappearance of hunt and gawthrop yet it was not adequate for edith it was only when she became mrs gardiner and they were on their way east that her husband told her the truth im really very sorry now said gardiner nevertheless it will do them lots of good they required it you never really liked either of them edith noo not that way said his wife but she said to herself next day i should have accepted mr gawthrop they ran into laramie junction that horrible centre of sagebrush and alkali a bitter wind drove dust against the windows of their car its a ghastly prospect said gardiner as he looked out on the prairie it would have been replied his wife absently it would have been asked her husband in surprise i mean it is of course said edith hastily the man from abo william or as he was usually called bill noyes was a citizen of the united states and like most citizens of that part of the western continent he was accustomed to do as he darned pleased but besides being an american citizen he was an american shipmaster and such are accustomed to having their own way and giving no one else a chance he explained this to the crowd in the state of oregon bound from san francisco to bordeaux with wine which was going to be converted into claret for this was some time ago before the winegrowers there had it all their own way in the french republic youre dogs and im the man with the whip youre hogs and im your driver im boss and captain and governor and congress and the senate and the president and dont any of you forget it if i hadnt been brought up religious id go a step farther still let me hear a growl out of you and ill make you wish you were in hell do your duty and ill make this ship paradise it shall be as sweet to you as a full roost of chickens to a buck nigger on a dark night im a good man i am and i know it youll know it too ill see to that now then mr bragg start them to dye see that damned dutchman he looks as if he didnt understand united states jolt him on the jaw for me and the unfortunate dutchman who was really a finn from abo got a crack with a closed fist that made him see more stars than even the american flag of liberty can boast what for i done nuttin he yelled as he put his hand to his head but never another man opened his mouth say another word said bragg and ill ram a belayingpin crossways down your throat and this was the beginning very good indeed said noyes now every one understands mr bragg and no one can say everything warnt explained to them clearly work the drink out of em im for a holy healthy happy crew and noyes went below for a drink he was as he often said a sober man one tot every time the bell strikes and two at eightbells and as a man cant sleep and drink i take what i should take before i turn in but none of the men forard got as much as a teaspoonful even after shortening sail or on saturday nights weve struck it rich said the crowd when they got together in the second dogwatch weve struck it rich theres no fatal error about that you can see it with half an eye a mile off the skippers a holy terror ya ya weve got to yoomp said a real dutchman and he was put in the place proper to a dutchman at once speak when you are spoken to said the english and american seamen all at once these dutchmen are getting past a joke bullies so they are said old mackenzie a shellback of the briniest description when i was a boy if one of them opened his mouth too wide we used to put something in it what did you put in asked the eager anglosaxons oh anything as he couldnt eat said mac a ball o twine or a swab i remember one dutchy as would talk but just then the man from abo came in and though the crowd was not really sympathetic they asked him how his jaw felt it appeared after all that he understood united states sufficiently well when it was to the point that is when it concerned his duty or the talk that goes on in a focsle a word beyond these limits opened his eyes and shut his mouth he was then like a waiter fresh from the continent who can talk in english about food and food only never you mind dutchy said one of his own watch mebbe after all itll do you good if bragg hammers you we wont even such consolation was better than none and dutchy was truly grateful the lot of a dutchman at sea is not always beer and skittles but even an angloamerican crowd can have sympathy when they are like to want it themselves they certainly found that billy noyess notion of a paradise made tophet look cool even as depicted to a sad and sober sailor in a waterside bethel they wanted bordeaux badly and under the influence of that desire and the stimulation supplied by the officers they lost no time in getting there and as they were a fine lot as men go few of them came in for actual hammering the slowest got that always and the man from abo was the man to get it it was marvellous to observe how much he got and how little it seemed to hurt him he was knocked down once a day and twice on sundays even when he got a chance to be first up aloft he never seemed to know it the only way he had of getting down first was to fall and once when he did so without seriously damaging himself bragg hammered him for doing it what youre after is to be laid up i see that said bragg but let me catch you at it and hans shook his head under braggs heavy hand till he forgot he had bruises on him the size of a soupplate dutchys a fair wonder said the crowd rejoicing in their own freedom hes taking the whack of all us and never turns a hair well have to get up a subscription for him aint he just tough say dutchy suppose you and bragg or you and the old man was to have a fair setto dye think you could down either of em ya said hans from abo very soberly neider of em cant hurt me mooch hes made of teak said the admiring crowd now there aint one of us wouldnt be bunged up if wed been hit about like him and he aint got a mark it reminds me of a chinky i fot once said one of the men i knocked him down seven times and then two other chaps chucked him out and next morning he was as cheerful as you please and never fazed not a mark to him i give him ten cents for a drink to let me look at him close dutchys just such another hes a real tough so he is hanss marvellous capacity for being hammered was soon noted aft why dont you take a pillow to him said noyes with a sneer to see you hit him bragg makes me tired and you used to be a hard man too the mate was injured in his tenderest point i done my best he said suddenly i carnt help it if the swine is made of injyrubber i pretty near skinned my knuckles on him yesterday and hes as fresh as paint today try him yourself sir i hired you retorted noyes but if i do get at him youll see something fly they were well to the norard and eastward of the horn before noyes happened to try and it was blowing a snorter from the southwest as the men came down on the poop after stowing the lower mizzentopsail hans having gumboots on slipped and fell against the skipper the next moment hans was on his back and noyes had his knuckles to his own mouth great scott said noyes with a face like a comic doorknocker or a japanese grotesque and he turned about and went below it serves him right said hans oh no i aint hurt it is nuttin and though he showed nothing not even a slight puffiness on his high cheekbone the skipper wore a mitten on his right hand for days noyes even conceived a certain respect for the finn i thought id hit a bollard he said i ought to have hit him on the jaw or where he keeps his wind by dint of these objectlessons hans gradually got an easier time if bragg ever went for him he kicked him and the marks he made if he made any did not show for hans came on board clothed and never undressed till they reached the line in the atlantic there he took a bath as he said he always made a point of having some buckets of water thrown over him every time he crossed the equator homeward bound perhaps he thought it kept him fresh but by then bragg was even tired of kicking him nothing made him go slower or faster he went at the pace he had been born to and he never learnt anything more than he had known at seventeen if there is any truth in the transmigration of souls hans must have been a tortoise and was destined to jump up again as a sloth but once after a long slow month of provocation he hit the real dutchman from amsterdam and that native of holland went to sleep for two hours hes the ony dutchman i ever had any real respect for said the crowd each for himself but of course he was a finn and as every one knows a finn triumphs over his disabilities as a dutchman by virtue of strange gifts no i dont believe none of that jaw about finns and witchcraft said old mackenzie but i own theres always somethin strange about a finn now all hanss nature seems to ave run to ardness what a saddle is skin would make for mac had spent two years in the australian bush and was never tired of relating his strange experiences on horseback and presently the state of oregon began as the men said to smell land it was off finisterre that noyes proved the man from abo could bleed for the skipper never forgot that he had been knocked out in one round by knocking down a dutchman the thought rankled and when hans was at the wheel when the wind was light out of the northeast the skippers temper ragged at a contrary wind when he had made a record passage so far led him a little astray for as he often said its all right marking men when ones bound home and when theyve time to get well bound to yewrope but i like to leave em without no visible sign to say youve larrupped em when im bound east in the united states there is very little respect for a man who cant take care of himself but some europeans have silly notions its not uncommon even to find a consul who doesnt understand that sailors are no good unless they are in a state of mutiny or near it there is no end to the foolishness of some consuls as captain noyes often complained with natural bitterness so when after he had cursed hans twice for his steering he jammed the brass end of his telescope right between the mans eyes and cut him badly he was quite sorry for it you see he had almost got to believe that the man from abo couldnt be hurt but a brass telescope properly applied makes four neat little cuts one on the forehead one on the bridge of the nose and one on each eyebrow as a little consideration of the human race and the nature of a circle will show the blood ran down into hanss eyes and bragg had to walk to the break of the poop and bellow relieve the wheel and two days afterwards the state of oregon owing to a favourable change of wind lay at bordeaux as soon as she did the entire crew got too much to drink and not even noyes and bragg could handle them though the skipper was as he had averred at the beginning of the passage captain and congress and president all rolled in one the only people who could handle them were the french police and they had their work cut out the next day as it is the habit of frenchmen and spaniards and the like to let the consuls fix up all difficulties with foreign crews if they can the american consul was called on to arbitrate in the matter and for the nonce the american consul was the english one for mr schuyler had gone to paris on what he described as business but what no puritan would have called such and this is where the man from abo came home as one may say mr johnson then british consul at bordeaux was a fine man with a clear skin a merry eye a knowledge of the world and a hard fist as a young man he had been amateur champion of the middleweights in england and though he was now a heavyweight he was almost as quick as he had been at twentytwo he had a sense of fair play which was almost disgusting to masters of merchantmen and a sense of humour which sometimes got him into trouble with the foreign office for it may have been noticed that among the english civil service the only humour which is one has to own rather sardonic is to be found in that part of it which deals with the income tax the very moment the consul had the shamefaced crew before him and saw the officers he knew where the trouble lay and he thought of the boxing gloves with which he often whiled away an idle hour when the viceconsul felt good well now well whats the trouble asked the consul and noyes told him where he thought it lay noyes was as smooth as bad butter and had a heartiness about him which would have made a child cry for its mother all the time he was talking and the men were muttering that he was a liar the consul was taking the crowd in he spotted many marks and bruises on them all come by honestly among themselves or given them without malice by the gensdarmes but when his eye lighted on the man from abo it stayed there a comfortable ship yes yes said the consul of course of course and a tough crowd to be sure here you come here and as the others saw that he meant hans they shoved him forward thats a nice face youve got said mr johnson god bless my soul youve been running against something now i should sayi should sayyes by jove youve been running against a telescope and hans nodded who gave you that noyes looked as black as his coat but the finn pointed at him with his finger the capen sir the consul looked at them both he noted that they were both of a size both probably of the same weight and both looked as hard as nickel steel his eye sparkled with a certain joy did you mr noyes it enraged noyes to be given his proper handle and he deserved it he said angrily if you wanted to hit him you should have done it with your hand but perhaps he would have been too much for you without a weapon suggested the consul suavely not he retorted noyes incautiously mr johnson looked at them both and shrugged his shoulders i believe he would lick you in a fair fight he said with a slight sniff and noyes exploded i could pound him to almighty smash in two minutes he roared and the crowd began to see fun sticking out a foot they edged up closer and lost their shamefaced look he could knock hell out of you said one of them from behind and the consul said hush hush then he turned to hans could he lick you my man not mooch said hans defiantly and a subdued cheer rose from the men behind do you hear that mr noyes asked the consul oh yes you hear it well its all highly irregular of course but you understand you did wrong to hit him with a telescope or with anything for the matter of that and as the ship seems to have been anything but a comfortable one i suggest that you apologise to this man at any rate and pay him off ya ya said hans who at any rate understood the last three words i apologise gasped noyes by god ill lick him first and do that after apologise either that or i shall back him up in proceeding against you unless you would like to settle it with him now in my courtyard with a couple of pairs of boxing gloves said mr johnson persuasively and the crowd behind hummed applause lick him said bragg and lick him good he was not anxious for the job himself but was as eager to see the scrap as the consul it is so seldom that an officer gets a chance of seeing a real fight and besides he did not love noyes at all and inside of two minutes the inner court saw the skipper of the state of oregon and the man from abo stripped to their waists and singlets pick your own seconds said the consul gleefully and ill be referee and timekeeper he forgot there was such a thing as the foreign office but he did not forget some of the habits and customs of western america theres to be no biting or gouging or kicking he said and when a man goes down hell have ten seconds to get up in the next moment noyes sailed in he was not a bad fighter he could hit hard at any rate and sometimes stopped a blow his previous acquaintance with hanss head led him to go for his body and that was perhaps a little in his favour for the finn was all abroad all the time at first hans hit so slowly that when he first got there noyes was gone but he gradually got a little quicker when i was eleven stone weight i used sometimes to box with a man who weighed seventeen in the first round i used to hit him when and where i pleased in the second i had to look out in the third he used to get there once and finish me for the day like hans he grew quicker as he grew warmer and yet hans never touched the skipper at all in the first round he was knocked all over the place and to any outsider it looked a thousand to one on authority but the odd thing was that hanss ribs seemed as hard as his head and his wind was invulnerable twice he went down but he rose quick enough and when time was called no one puffed but the skipper in the second round they clinched and when the consul called on them to break away hans fairly threw noyes from him hell lick him yet said johnson and now noyes had to defend himself any one of hanss blows would have killed a cow if it had fairly landed the skipper half in despair hit at his opponents head and got there he stopped hans but was jarred to the shoulder when he recovered he landed and hans went down to rise again like a fives ball on a hard court and though noyes jabbed him again and again straight in the face he never left any mark or blood behind him and every blow of the finns came nearer quicker more fiercely time was called in time to save the captain i believe hell do me said noyes i believe it too said bragg it was not an encouraging remark to get from ones second and noyes felt hurt while he was sitting on braggs knee hans was walking round feeling his arms and talking ya ya i lick him goot he said i lick him goot and now he was warm and like a flail both arms were equally good he went at his man round arm and missed him ten times by a mere shave in the middle of the round noyes who knew he was going worked his glove off in a close rally and before the consul could intervene he struck hans full in the face with his bare fist it was a timed blow that ought to have stopped a rhinoceros and hans threw his head up as the consul jumped in nein nein cried hans take de oder off i fight him so i fight goot now and so he did for though the glove was put on again there was no sign of his having been hit and noyess right hand was useless a lefthander finished it and noyes went off his feet when he came to he was tired and weary and found himself in the hospital with a bandaged jaw i tell you theres always suthin queer about a finn said the crowd it took brass to draw blood from him now didnt it and the man from abo was paid off i fights goot that day he said when he got his money and the consul who is now a magistrate at home says there wasnt a bruise on him the scuttling of the pandora there are ships with good and evil reputations independent of the men who own or sail them some it would seem had their keels laid on a lucky day others were assuredly built i th eclipse and rigged with curses dark many have furrowed all the seas of ocean and have lost no lives and have cost neither owner nor underwriters money but some there are and those who follow the sea will know them which have never achieved a single passage without being nearly cast away without killing or maiming men for such a ship the very shoals themselves decrease in depth through the unlucky set of some abnormal tide for them the trades spring up far south and die in premature calm ten degrees from the line they are well built and highly classed and yet spring leaks derelicts lie in wait for them they are chased through every sea by cyclones and tornadoes in them the luck of lucky men is finally of no avail seamen fall from aloft in calms the gear gives without notice stores rot in spite of care they break the heart of all who have to do with them in them blood is suddenly spilt in them strong men waste and die such a ship was the pandora and as she lay off sandridge at anchor in hobsons bay there was not a sailorman in australia who would have shipped in her from choice ive heerd the skipper of one ship i was in talk about the nature of vessels said jack marchmont as he sat with his mate on the end of the pier and he allowed that ships was like men launched with natral dispositions he talked a lot of scientific guff about deviation and what he said was as ships had this or that deviation all according how their heads was pinted on the stocks if she pinted souwest she played quite a different game with the compass to what she would have done if she had laid noreast and i believe him the pandora must have pinted straight for hell joe she is a bad un i own said his mate but it aint a matter of chice ships is few and men is plenty and its a case of john get up and let jack sit down with you and me if she was a wuss ship than she is and a wetter though this aint a wetter and if she killed as many as the plague i aint goin to work tom coxs traverse ashore any more and there aint no beer in the scuttlebutt neither and bailey looks at us as black as black im goin to ship and joe rennet rose i aint got a farden to jingle of a tombstone he said mark me said jack gloomily youll never have no tombstone if we ships in the pandora taint her way to run any mans relatives into that expense but joe shrugged his shoulders mebbe this tripll break her luck and youve got to ship along cause why weve ony one chest atween the two of us cheer up old son why id ship in the leander and they say she killed and drownded seventy men in five years blow me ive got to the pint that id ship in a blooming divingbell and three days later the two men with twelve others who were just as deep in debt to the boardinghouse keepers signed on for the pandora bound for london they went on board that very night the mates kept a keen eye on them they knew the ships reputation and more than once men who had come on board at night had disappeared by the morning the first few hours in any ship as in any other kind of work are the most trying and the first sight of a damp and empty focsle is for ever discouraging for all the pandoras crowd from london had skipped in melbourne and right they was said more than one of the new crowd for one of them was killed and two was drowned and another will walk lame for the rest of his life but when the sun came up over the low brown hills to the eastward and the daylight danced upon the landlocked waters of the great bay they turned to with more cheerful hearts the summer had spent two of its golden months but the sky was clear and a warm north wind blew the ship was clean and yet not too clean it did not suggest the interminable intolerable labour of an american ship all brass and brightwork and as the new crew hove up the anchor they found the windlass was no heartbreaker give it her boys said the mate and they slapped the brakes up and down with a will i reckon the crowd aft are pretty decent said joe as he jumped up aloft to loosen the foretopsail oh i dessay she aint arf bad and as the crew allowed there was little to complain of about the way the pandora was found she aint like our last ship was joes comment every time she it a sea out o the common shed shake shearpoles off of er as a dog shakes water but jack marchmont was not consoled i aint denyin that the owners and the old man do their best he said but if they rove silk gear and bent silk sails theyd not alter the nature of her ill feel safe when i grinds gravel under my heels and not till then they told each other dolorous tales of the ship when they ate and in the second dogwatch which was all their own and yet the wind was fair and put them through basss strait and well to the south and east day by day its too good to last said jack aft much the same feeling existed though no one knew it forard yet captain rayner was a melancholy man and seemed very soft to those whom luck had ever sent to sea with american shipmasters he had sailed three voyages in the pandora and had read the burial service every passage once he had read it to the devouring sea as a grave when five men had gone at once from the focsle head but he never spoke of the ship and her ways even if he always came on deck with the air of a man who expects bad news though he never knew it his look at last got upon the mens nerves but their nerve was shaken from the first superstition had hold of them they called him jonah its a black look out with such a skipper said some and though the evil history of the pandora ran far back beyond rayners time they attributed her present illluck to him the mind of the seaman is a limited mind he is a child a creature of arrested development the infinite sameness of the sea its dull and at times appalling lack of interest do not move him to growth the romance of it is for those who know it not or for those who pass beyond the borders of its great roads of travel for the merchant seaman the ocean is a method of toil only disaster or the fear of it gives it savour and the work is the same for ever they dwell on little things are easily pleased easily hurt in such minds grows superstition in such panic fears flourish if they are not held in a strong hand though both the mates were good men they were young and rayner was weak the very fairness of the weather though fair weather is common enough off the horn in summer got on the crews minds when they came in sight of the diego ramirez islands and presently hauled up for the north none of us ever passed these ere daggarammarines in weather like this they said as they shook their heads why it might be a millpond and when three days later a change of weather sent a southwest gale howling after them they shook their heads again ah shes goin to get it now thisll make up for it whos goin first they found out now what the pandora could do to make their lives unhappy she was both weatherly and fast but her lines forard were such that she never rose to any sea she struck till green water poured over the topgallant focsle two feet deep she shipped one sea at midnight that ripped off the scuttlehatch and poured solid water into the focsle that washed the men out of the lower bunks the hatch went overboard and it was morning before any one dared go on the focsle head to spike planks down in place of it all night long a cataract poured down on them and water spurted in through the plugged hawse pipes soon there was not a dry blanket in their den steam rose from the wetpacked sleepers it was all hands at four bells in the middle watch and they went on deck to shorten sail not a man wore oilskins they had nothing to keep from getting wet even joe who was the most cheerful man forard fell to growling call this a ship he said shes scared of the top of the sea and wants to dive sos to get out o the wet stow the foresail is it i reckon the old man is goin to heave her to while he can he cant have much heart to do it with a fair wind and perhaps rayner had little heart but if he had little the mate was cheery enough he bellowed loudly and the men jumped now then haul taut the lifts he roared thatll do weather clewgarner ease off the sheet a bit they slacked away the tack and hauled up the weathergear now then leegear and jump aloft and furl it the night was black and the wind heavy in increasing squalls even with the foresail hanging in the gear and bellying out in great white bladders she still cut the seas like a knife and scooped the seas in over her head blankets and bags washed out on deck for there was no door to the mens quarters only a heavy canvas screen from the break of the focsle and from aloft dull foam gleamed as the pandora drove the seas asunder the men sprang into the weatherrigging with the second mate leading as he came to the futtock shrouds he laid hold of the foremost shroud with his right hand and jumped for the band of the yardtruss his foot slipped and his handhold gave he snatched with a yell at the topgallant sheet leading through the top but was too late to grasp and hold it by god the pandoras luck said the men in the rigging as they heard him reach the deck and when the foresail was stowed and they went down they heard the man was dead they found the pandora made heavy weather still when she was brought to the wind and she only lay to decently when she was stripped to the goosewinged maintopsail the men went into their wet and devastated den in gloomy silence eres a bloomin pretty general average said joe as he found his chest which was also his chums staved in by the impact of an ironbound one which had fetched away from its lashings but no one growled and no one answered him the young second greaser had been liked by them they sat and smoked in gloomy silence and only half of the watch below turned into the driest bunks they thought that the pandora had begun and though she lay to easily enough few slept they were afraid of their ship she was unlucky accursed an evil personality about her was the odour of death case was a good boy they said and would have been a fine officer byandby well our turn next every time the pandora bowed a wave the hawseholes still spurted the focsle deck ran wet and glimmered darkly in the feeble light from the stinking lanterns swinging on both port and starboard sides the air was saturated with moisture rank sweat ran down the beams dripping blankets swayed from the edges of unoccupied bunks the men were damp subdued unhappy now as the ship lay to the wind no longer swept into the focsle under the flapping screen by the windlass but still eddies of swift cold air shook it and the men shivered under their oilskins that they wore now for warmth i wish id never seed her said jack marchmont and joe did not answer his mate not ten words were spoken till the wheel and lookout were relieved at four oclock both were idle jobs for the night was still as dark as death and the wheel with a grummet over its spokes looked after itself oh its all solid comfort this is said jack i wonder whose wet clothes will be for sale next they buried the second mate in the grey waste of sea before they put the pandora before the moderating gale the mate read the burial service for captain rayner stayed below the steward told the men in a whisper that he was ill hes all broke up he said i seed him cryin like a child and no wonder this is a wicked ship i wish id left her in melbourne and some of the men frowned they did not like to hear him call the pandora wicked for the ship was in its way alive it was possessed they wished to propitiate it superstition had them by the throat but they were easier when the body was committed to the deep and the mate assumed a more cheerful air when he had carried the prayer book into his berth and came on deck again they put the ship before the wind and loosed the foresail but though the wind had taken off the sea was very heavy and the pandora wallowed riotously she took in seas over both rails thrice that day she filled the maindeck and but for the lifelines rigged right from the focsle to the poop many men would have been washed overboard as she ran with the wind on the port quarter she sometimes dived as if she would never come up the galley fire was out and could not be lighted the men drank water and ate biscuit hogs dogs and sailors they said every time the vessel dived they held their breath the mate had a hard time for rayner was incapable of work and she carried no apprentices forward there was no one capable of an officers work there was no broken skipper whom drink had destroyed no young fellow with a second mates ticket so mr gamgee practically slept on deck in snatches till he slept almost as he stood under the weathercloth in the mizzen rigging he prayed for moderate weather for a sight of the sun but though the gale was less it still blew hard and the sky was black and the racing scud low and the sun was not seen by day or a star by night on the third day gamgee staggered as he walked if the old man cant come on deck soon ill have to cave in he thought he shook his fist at the ship i wish id never seen her shes a mankiller that night when the starboard watch was called at twelve the wind took off suddenly and the pandora pounded in the wallow of the sea like a bullbuffalo in a bog she shipped seas over both rails the racing waves astern came and slapped their crests at the man at the wheel she scooped up the sea forward every stagger she made she had been running under the reefed foresail and the fore and main topsails close reefed now they shook the reefs out gamgee was alert and alive but his nerves halfbetrayed him he jumped from the poop to the maindeck and back again he wanted to be mate and second mate and skipper too and as the fresh canvas took hold of her she slapped at the rising sea dived into it and as the wind bellowed almost as keen as ever the man at the wheel lost his nerve gave her too much helm snatched at her gave her too much again and almost broached her to and then the mate was again on the maindeck some one heard him say o god as the atlantic fell on board but no one ever heard him say anything again the water filled her from rail to rail she shuddered and then lifted slowly and as she ran once more before the wind and rolled she poured out the sea on either side the maindeck ports were burst outward the gear floated in inextricable tangles a fourhundredgallon tank lashed under the poop ladders broke from its lashings and took charge of the deck in the black darkness and the imminent danger men cried out some cried to their mates and were answered some were not answered with the mate three other men had gone and then she cleared herself once more and the men came together under the break of the poop joe asked for jack marchmont but jack had saved any one from the expense of a tombstone and i overpersuaded im to ship in her oh shes a bloody ship then one man said wheres mr gamgee joe ran up to the poop mr gamgee sir he aint here said the man at the wheel oh joe what is it twas your doin cried joe theres two gone and jack with em and mr gamgee and the man at the wheel fell all ashake his face was ashy in the feeble glimmer of the binnacle light come and take her joe he implored oh the swine she is im in a tremble joe shes too much for me and tragedy heaped itself on tragedy the steward came on deck and heard that the mate was gone he lost his head and ran in to the captain crying he was ludicrous horrible speechless and rayner sat up in his bunk and fell back without knowing what had happened he never knew for though the steward shook him feebly his failing heart had failed and brandy never brought him to the steward ran on deck blubbering i believe the captains dead he sobbed and the two boldest of the men took off their caps and went into the cabin humbly a greater than their commander was there they stood in silence fiddling with their caps and stared at the quiet white face upon its pillow oh yes hes dead they whispered they backed out respectfully they were stunned and were adrift they were all masterless men authority had been removed they faced the unknown with dread they saw now that they had rested on others knowledge what did they know of the sea after all they gathered on the poop what said joe who was at the wheel him gone too and we they all understood they were in peculiar isolation in danger and what would be said if they saved themselves and the ship twill look as if wed mutinied said joe but he had a touch of natural authority in him as soon as it gets light well write out a true account of it and sign it all of us and well make for the nearest port they were all quiet men englishmen and dutchmen and there was no more drink in the ship than that in the medicine chest the steward drank what remained of it and in the morning all the remainder of the crew met on the poop at first they had a certain natural reluctance to use that portion of the ship but if they did not meet there the steersman could not take his share in the talk but joe did most of the talking i reckon the nearest port is buenos ayres he said this mornin i took the liberty of lookin at the chart and there aint nothin andier as is common talk with sailormen if we stand north well about it it off or any ways well it on the track of steamers makin for it and we might get the lend of a hofficer to take us in what do you say mates some nodded some shrugged their shoulders and some said buenos ayres oh yes thatll do as well as another and ive took the liberty said joe solemnly of borrowin the logbook from down below and ive wrote out a plain account of all this ere as i said last night for its best put down and its ships law as everythin serious should be wrote out in the logbook and nowheres else shall i read it and he read out what he had written three days back as told in the log mr case the second mate fell from the foreyard as we was goin to take in the foresail and was killed he was buried accordin the next day while we was ove to and last night in the middle watch as all ands was makin sail the wind avin fallen light sudden and the sea bein very eavy we shipped an eavy sea over the port rail as washed mr gamjy overboard with jack marchmont ab andrew anderson ab and thomas griggs boy and the captain bein ill as the log says died sudden on earing it and is now lyin dead in is cabin whereas there bein no officer in the ship all ands assembled as aforesaid declares this is the truth the ole truth and nothin but the truth so elp us gawd and we intends makin for bonus airs or monty vidyo and one by one the crew signed this simple statement as it was held down on the top of the signal locker by its author those who could not writeand there were three who could notmade their marks when joe signed for them whatever appens to this blasted ooker we must keep old of this log said joe for supposin any hother disaster befell us as seems likely enough and we took to the boats it would look very bad for us without a single officer it was a cold and unhappy day for them as they drove to the northeast still under short canvas but the weather broke a little and they set the topgallantsails at last so long as we dont pile her up on the falklands we should do said the one other man on board beside joe who seemed capable of taking responsibility he was from newcastle and was of course known as geordie naturally enough he and joe divided the watches between them and the remainder of the crowd sheltered their uneasy minds under their strength i suppose if we bring her in we might get something extra said geordie the day they buried the captain but joe took him by the arm and led him forard from the wheel at which a patient swede stood geordie old man do you want to bring her in he asked why yes i suppose so said geordie he stared at joe what do you mean joe broke out strangely and struck his fist upon the rail i want to see er sink he said savagely i want to see er go where shes put so many good men what right as we to save er to do more arm it aint alone as shes drownded my chum or the others but she as a black record that aint finished unless we finish it shes strong and will go on killin for twenty years geordie shell make money for them as doesnt care but what of the likes of us he was greatly moved shes caulked with mens lives and painted with their blood he cried passionately id rather she sunk with me than sailed the seas any more and geordie fidgeted uneasily thats true mate but aye said joe i know if we scuttled er twould look bad and its bad enough as it is but tis a good deed if we done it and it should be done and ill tell you ow to do it he leant upon the rail and spoke earnestly in a low voice it wont do i own to scuttle er at sea not even if we let on she leaked and logged it day by day but if we sunk er in the plate or in the bay at monte video twould do right enough and ive a plan for that i made it out in the morning watch tis as easy as eatin and easier a deal than eatin ships biscuit down below in the lazareet ill bore oles in her three or four and plug em on the inside about a foot below the waterline and ill over the side and plug em outside then ill draw the inside plugs dye see and geordie saw you neednt know it i can do it my lone said joe and do it i will if we gets off er safe she shant kill no more when were out of herand none of us will stay as you knowshell lie at anchor waitin for a new crowd and ill come out to her in a boat and sink the murderin old ooker right there therell be a shipkeeper on her said geordie as like as not ell ony be a spaniard replied joe simply and even if not even if not one more was but one the next day the weather moderated and the pandora being then as they reckoned well clear of the falklands stood due north for cape corrientes with the wind almost on the port beam that night joe went down into the lazaret with an auger and bored three holes in her weather side good stuff and sound he said as he sweated over his task she might ave floated for hever when he drew out his auger he found that the sea raced past the hole and sometimes flipped water into it on a level keel shell have em about two foot under he said he plugged that hole and bored two others when he had plugged these he went on deck again there was not a soul awake on her but geordie and the man at the wheel she was going now very sweetly and making ten knots they were running into fair weather but she lay over far enough to make it easy for joe to go over the side while geordie slacked him down from a pin in the rail its done said joe as he came on board shell kill no more it seemed to him that he was doing a good deed for the pandora was cruel and a week later though they had sighted no land the colour of the water had changed curiously and looked a little reddish when they drew some on board it was evidently not so salt as the sea and they knew they were in the flood of the mighty plate the airs were now light and westerly they hauled their wind and stood for the northwest but still the man on the lookout on the mainroyalyard saw no land in the afternoon they sighted the smoke of a steamer heading about west by south on their starboard beam they laid their maintopsail to the mast and hoisted the jack union down that night they were at anchor off monte video and in the morning they told their story to the british consul but one and all refused at any price and at all costs to go on board of the pandora again joe spoke for all of them well go to gaol sooner sir he said as he stepped in front of his mates twiddling his cap nervously though we wishes to say so respectfully sir shes a mankiller and its better a sight to be in the jug or on the beach than to be drownded shes killed my own mate and more than im and so far back as hany of us ever eard of er shes been at the same job if you please sir wed rather go to gaol they slept that night ashore but not in gaol and next day the owners cabled from england for a new crew to be shipped in her at any price but no price could induce men to go in her and on the third night she sank at her moorings in fifteen fathoms of water and carried her shipkeeper to the bottom i told you shed kill another man yet said geordie but joe shook his head i done what was right and after all e was ony a spaniard as i said

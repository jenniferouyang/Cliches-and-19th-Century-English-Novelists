fifteen also by children aged from fifteen to twentyfive yet again by children aged from twentyfive to thirtyfive and even by childrenfor there are suchchildren in whom no waning of health and strength no weariness of the solemn mockery and the gaudy glitter and the hopeless misery of life has availed to parch the pure fountain of joy that wells up in all childlike heartschildren of a certain age whose tale of years must be left untold and buried in respectful silence and my ambition now is is it a vain one to be read by children aged from nought to five to be read nay not so say rather to be thumbed to be cooed over to be dogseared to be rumpled to be kissed by the illiterate ungrammatical dimpled darlings that fill your nursery with merry uproar and your inmost heart of hearts with a restful gladness such for instance as a child i once knew whohaving been carefully instructed that one of any earthly thing was enough for any little girl and that to ask for two buns

upon a time there was a little girl called alice and she had a very curious dream would you like to hear what it was that she dreamed about well this was the first thing that happened a white rabbit came running by in a great hurry and just as it passed alice it stopped and took its watch out of its pocket wasnt that a funny thing did you ever see a rabbit that had a watch and a pocket to put it in of course when a rabbit has a watch it must have a pocket to put it in it would never do to carry it about in its mouthand it wants its hands sometimes to run about with hasnt it got pretty pink eyes i think all white rabbits have pink eyes and pink ears and a nice brown coat and you can just see its red pockethandkerchief peeping out of its coatpocket and what with its blue necktie and its yellow waistcoat it really is very nicely dressed oh dear oh dear said the rabbit i shall be too late what would it be too late for i wonder well you see it had to go and visit the duchess youll see a picture of the duchess soon sitting in her kitchen and the duchess was a very cross old lady and the rabbit knew shed be very angry indeed if he kept her waiting so the poor thing was as frightened as frightened could be dont you see how hes trembling just shake the book a little from side to side and youll soon see him tremble because he thought the duchess would have his head cut off for a punishment that was what the queen of hearts used to do when she was angry with people youll see a picture of her soon at least she used to order their heads to be cut off and she always thought it was done though they never really did it and so when the white rabbit ran away alice wanted to see what would happen to it so she ran after it and she ran and she ran till she tumbled right down the rabbithole and then she had a very long fall indeed down and down and down till she began to wonder if she was going right through the world so as to come out on the other side it was just like a very deep well only there was no water in it if anybody really had such a fall as that it would kill them most likely but you know it doesnt hurt a bit to fall in a dream because all the time you think youre falling you really are lying somewhere safe and sound and fast asleep however this terrible fall came to an end at last and down came alice on a heap of sticks and dry leaves but she wasnt a bit hurt and up she jumped and ran after the rabbit again and so that was the beginning of alices curious dream and next time you see a white rabbit try and fancy youre going to have a curious dream just like dear little alice illustration ii how alice grew tall and so after alice had tumbled down the rabbithole and had run a long long way underground all of a sudden she found herself in a great hall with doors all round it but all the doors were locked so you see poor alice couldnt get out of the hall and that made her very sad however after a little while she came to a little table all made of glass with three legs there are two of the legs in the picture and just the beginning of the other leg do you see and on the table was a little key and she went round the hall and tried if she could unlock any of the doors with it poor alice the key wouldnt unlock any of the doors but at last she came upon a tiny little door and oh how glad she was when she found the key would fit it so she unlocked the tiny little door and she stooped down and looked through it and what do you think she saw oh such a beautiful garden and she did so long to go into it but the door was far too small she couldnt squeeze herself through any more than you could squeeze yourself into a mousehole so poor little alice locked up the door and took the key back to the table again and this time she found quite a new thing on it now look at the picture again and what do you think it was it was a little bottle with a label tied to it with the words drink me on the label so she tasted it and it was very nice so she set to work and drank it up and then such a curious thing happened to her youll never guess what it was so i shall have to tell you she got smaller and smaller till at last she was just the size of a little doll then she said to herself now im the right size to get through the little door and away she ran but when she got there the door was locked and the key was on the top of the table and she couldnt reach it wasnt it a pity she had locked up the door again well the next thing she found was a little cake and it had the words eat me marked on it so of course she set to work and ate it up and then what do you think happened to her no youll never guess i shall have to tell you again she grew and she grew and she grew taller than she was before taller than any child taller than any grownup person taller and taller and taller just look at the picture and youll see how tall she got illustration which would you have liked the best do you think to be a little tiny alice no larger than a kitten or a great tall alice with your head always knocking against the ceiling iii the pool of tears perhaps you think alice must have been very much pleased when she had eaten the little cake to find herself growing so tremendously tall because of course it would be easy enough now to reach the little key off the glass table and to open the little tiny door well of course she could do that but what good was it to get the door open when she couldnt get through she was worse off than ever poor thing she could just manage by putting her head down close to the ground to look through with one eye but that was all she could do no wonder the poor tall child sat down and cried as if her heart would break so she cried and she cried and her tears ran down the middle of the hall like a deep river and very soon there was quite a large pool of tears reaching halfway down the hall and there she might have staid till this very day if the white rabbit hadnt happened to come through the hall on his way to visit the duchess he was dressed up as grand as grand could be and he had a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a little fan in the other hand and he kept on muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting but he didnt see alice you know so when she began to say if you please sir her voice seemed to come from the top of the hall because her head was so high up and the rabbit was dreadfully frightened and he dropped the gloves and the fan and ran away as hard as he could go then a very curious thing indeed happened alice took up the fan and began to fan herself with it and lo and behold she got quite small again and all in a minute she was just about the size of a mouse illustration now look at the picture and youll soon guess what happened next it looks just like the sea doesnt it but it really is the pool of tearsall made of alices tears you know and alice has tumbled into the pool and the mouse has tumbled in and there they are swimming about together doesnt alice look pretty as she swims across the picture you can just see her blue stockings far away under the water but why is the mouse swimming away from alice in such a hurry well the reason is that alice began talking about cats and dogs and a mouse always hates talking about cats and dogs suppose you were swimming about in a pool of your own tears and suppose somebody began talking to you about lessonbooks and bottles of medicine wouldnt you swim away as hard as you could go iv the caucusrace when alice and the mouse had got out of the pool of tears of course they were very wet and so were a lot of other curious creatures that had tumbled in as well there was a dodo thats the great bird in front leaning on a walkingstick and a duck and a lory thats just behind the duck looking over its head and an eaglet thats on the lefthand side of the lory and several others well and so they didnt know how in the world they were to get dry again but the dodowho was a very wise birdtold them the right way was to have a caucusrace and what do you think that was you dont know well you are an ignorant child now be very attentive and ill soon cure you of your ignorance first you must have a racecourse it ought to be a sort of circle but it doesnt much matter what shape it is so long as it goes a good way round and joins on to itself again then you must put all the racers on the course here and there it doesnt matter where so long as you dont crowd them too much together then you neednt say one two three and away but let them all set off running just when they like and leave off just when they like so all these creatures alice and all went on running round and round till they were all quite dry again and then the dodo said everybody had won and everybody must have prizes of course alice had to give them their prizes and she had nothing to give them but a few comfits she happened to have in her pocket and there was just one apiece all round and there was no prize for alice so what do you think they did alice had nothing left but her thimble now look at the picture and youll see what happened illustration hand it over here said the dodo then the dodo took the thimble and handed it back to alice and said we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and then all the other creatures cheered wasnt that a curious sort of present to give her suppose they wanted to give you a birthdaypresent would you rather they should go to your toycupboard and pick out your nicest doll and say here my love heres a lovely birthdaypresent for you or would you like them to give you something new something that didnt belong to you before v bill the lizard now im going to tell you about alices adventures in the white rabbits house do you remember how the rabbit dropped his gloves and his fan when he was so frightened at hearing alices voice that seemed to come down from the sky well of course he couldnt go to visit the duchess without his gloves and his fan so after a bit he came back again to look for them by this time the dodo and all the other curious creatures had gone away and alice was wandering about all alone so what do you think he did actually he thought she was his housemaid and began ordering her about mary ann he said go home this very minute and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now perhaps he couldnt see very clearly with his pink eyes for im sure alice doesnt look very like a housemaid does she however she was a very goodnatured little girl so she wasnt a bit offended but ran off to the rabbits house as quick as she could it was lucky she found the door open for if she had had to ring i suppose the real mary ann would have come to open the door and she would never have let alice come in and im sure it was very lucky she didnt meet the real mary ann as she trotted upstairs for im afraid she would have taken alice for a robber so at last she found her way into the rabbits room and there was a pair of gloves lying on the table and she was just going to take them up and go away when she happened to see a little bottle on the table and of course it had the words drink me on the label and of course alice drank some well i think that was rather lucky too dont you for if she hadnt drunk any all this wonderful adventure that im going to tell you about wouldnt have happened at all and wouldnt that have been a pity youre getting so used to alices adventures that i daresay you can guess what happened next if you cant ill tell you she grew and she grew and she grew and in a very short time the room was full of alice just in the same way as a jar is full of jam there was alice all the way up to the ceiling and alice in every corner of the room illustration the door opened inwards so of course there wasnt any room to open it so when the rabbit got tired of waiting and came to fetch his gloves for himself of course he couldnt get in so what do you think he did now we come to the picture he sent bill the lizard up to the roof of the house and told him to get down the chimney but alice happened to have one of her feet in the fireplace so when she heard bill coming down the chimney she just gave a little tiny kick and away went bill flying up into the sky poor little bill dont you pity him very much how frightened he must have been vi the dear little puppy well it doesnt look such a very little puppy does it but then you see alice had grown very small indeed and thats what makes the puppy look so large when alice had eaten one of those little magic cakes that she found in the white rabbits house it made her get quite small directly so that she could get through the door or else she could never have got out of the house again wouldnt that have been a pity because then she wouldnt have dreamed all the other curious things that were going to read about so it really was a little puppy you see and isnt it a little pet and look at the way its barking at the little stick that alice is holding out for it you can see she was a little afraid of it all the time because shes got behind that great thistle for fear it should run over her that would have been just about as bad for her as it would be for you to be run over by a waggon and four horses have you got a little pet puppy at your home if you have i hope youre always kind to it and give it nice things to eat once upon a time i knew some little children about as big as you and they had a little pet dog of their own and it was called dash and this is what they told me about its birthdaytreat do you know one day we remembered it was dashs birthday that day so we said lets give dash a nice birthdaytreat like what we have on our birthdays so we thought and we thought now what is it we like best of all on our birthdays and we thought and we thought and at last we all called out together why its oatmealporridge of course so of course we thought dash would be quite sure to like it very much too illustration so we went to the cook and we got her to make a saucerful of nice oatmealporridge and then we called dash into the house and we said now dash youre going to have your birthdaytreat we expected dash would jump for joy but it didnt one bit so we put the saucer down before it and we said now dash dont be greedy eat it nicely like a good dog so dash just tasted it with the tip of its tongue and then it made oh such a horrid face and then do you know it did hate it so it wouldnt eat a bit more of it so we had to put it all down its throat with a spoon i wonder if alice will give this little puppy some porridge i dont think she can because she hasnt got any with her i cant see any saucer in the picture vii the blue caterpillar would you like to know what happened to alice after she had got away from the puppy it was far too large an animal you know for her to play with i dont suppose you would much enjoy playing with a young hippopotamus would you you would always be expecting to be crushed as flat as a pancake under its great heavy feet so alice was very glad to run away while it wasnt looking well she wandered up and down and didnt know what in the world to do to make herself grow up to her right size again of course she knew that she had to eat or drink something that was the regular rule you know but she couldnt guess what thing illustration however she soon came to a great mushroom that was so tall that she couldnt see over the top of it without standing on tiptoe and what do you think she saw something that im sure you never talked to in all your life it was a large blue caterpillar ill tell you soon what alice and the caterpillar talked about but first let us have a good look at the picture that curious thing standing in front of the caterpillar is called a hookah and its used for smoking the smoke comes through that long tube that winds round and round like a serpent and do you see its long nose and chin at least they look exactly like a nose and chin dont they but they really are two of its legs you know a caterpillar has got quantities of legs you can see some more of them further down what a bother it must be to a caterpillar counting over such a lot of legs every night to make sure it hasnt lost any of them and another great bother must be having to settle which leg it had better move first i think if you had forty or fifty legs and if you wanted to go a walk youd be such a time in settling which leg to begin with that youd never go a walk at all and what did alice and the caterpillar talk about i wonder well alice told it how very confusing it was being first one size and then another and the caterpillar asked her if she liked the size she was just then and alice said she would like to be just a little bit largerthree inches was such a wretched height to be just mark off three inches on the wall about the length of your middle finger and youll see what size she was and the caterpillar told her one side of the mushroom would make her grow taller and the other side would make her grow shorter so alice took two little bits of it with her to nibble and managed to make herself quite a nice comfortable height before she went on to visit the duchess illustration viii the pigbaby would you like to hear about alices visit to the duchess it was a very interesting visit indeed i can assure you of course she knocked at the door to begin with but nobody came so she had to open it for herself now if you look at the picture youll see exactly what alice saw when she got inside the door led right into the kitchen you see the duchess sat in the middle of the room nursing the baby the baby was howling the soup was boiling the cook was stirring the soup the catit was a cheshire catwas grinning as cheshire cats always do all these things were happening just as alice went in the duchess has a beautiful cap and gown hasnt she but im afraid she hasnt got a very beautiful face the babywell i daresay youve seen several nicer babies than that and more goodtempered ones too however take a good look at it and well see if you know it again next time you meet it the cookwell you may have seen nicer cooks once or twice but im nearly sure youve never seen a nicer cat now have you and wouldnt you like to have a cat of your own just like that one with lovely green eyes and smiling so sweetly the duchess was very rude to alice and no wonder why she even called her own baby pig and it wasnt a pig was it and she ordered the cook to chop off alices head though of course the cook didnt do it and at last she threw the baby at her so alice caught the baby and took it away with her and i think that was about the best thing she could do so she wandered away through the wood carrying the ugly little thing with her and a great job it was to keep hold of it it wriggled about so but at last she found out that the proper way was to keep tight hold of its left foot and its right ear but dont you try to hold on to a baby like that my child there are not many babies that like being nursed in that way well and so the baby kept grunting and grunting so that alice had to say to it quite seriously if youre going to turn into a pig my dear ill have nothing more to do with you mind now and at last she looked down into its face and what do you think had happened to it look at the picture and see if you can guess illustration why thats not the baby that alice was nursing is it ah i knew you wouldnt know it again though i told you to take a good look at it yes it is the baby and its turned into a little pig so alice put it down and let it trot away into the wood and she said to herself it was a very ugly baby but it makes rather a handsome pig i think dont you think she was right ix the cheshirecat all alone all alone poor alice no baby not even a pig to keep her company so you may be sure she was very glad indeed when she saw the cheshirecat perched up in a tree over her head the cat has a very nice smile no doubt but just look what a lot of teeth its got isnt alice just a little shy of it well yes a little but then it couldnt help having teeth you know and it could have helped smiling supposing it had been cross so on the whole she was glad doesnt alice look very prim holding her head so straight up and with her hands behind her just as if she were going to say her lessons to the cat illustration and that reminds me theres a little lesson i want to teach you while were looking at this picture of alice and the cat now dont be in a bad temper about it my dear child its a very little lesson indeed do you see that foxglove growing close to the tree and do you know why its called a foxglove perhaps you think its got something to do with a fox no indeed foxes never wear gloves the right word is folksgloves did you ever hear that fairies used to be called the good folk now weve finished the lesson and well wait a minute till youve got your temper again well do you feel quite goodnatured again no temperache no crossness about the corners of the mouth then well go on cheshire puss said alice wasnt that a pretty name for a cat would you tell me which way i ought to go from here and so the cheshirecat told her which way she ought to go if she wanted to visit the hatter and which way to go to visit the march hare theyre both mad said the cat and then the cat vanished away just like the flame of a candle when it goes out so alice set off to visit the march hare and as she went along there was the cat again and she told it she didnt like it coming and going so quickly illustration so this time the cat vanished quite slowly beginning with the tail and ending with the grin wasnt that a curious thing a grin without any cat would you like to see one if you turn up the corner of this leaf youll have alice looking at the grin and she doesnt look a bit more frightened than when she was looking at the cat does she x the mad teaparty this is the mad teaparty you see alice had left the cheshirecat and had gone off to see the march hare and the hatter as the cheshirecat had advised her and she found them having tea under a great tree with a dormouse sitting between them there were only those three at the table but there were quantities of teacups set all along it you cant see all the table you know and even in the bit you can see there are nine cups counting the one the march hare has got in his hand thats the march hare with the long ears and straws mixed up with his hair the straws showed he was madi dont know why never twist up straws among your hair for fear people should think youre mad there was a nice green armchair at the end of the table that looked as if it was just meant for alice so she went and sat down in it then she had quite a long talk with the march hare and the hatter the dormouse didnt say much you see it was fast asleep generally and it only just woke up for a moment now and then as long as it was asleep it was very useful to the march hare and the hatter because it had a nice round soft head just like a pillow so they could put their elbows on it and lean across it and talk to each other quite comfortably you wouldnt like people to use your head for a pillow would you but if you were fast asleep like the dormouse you wouldnt feel it so i suppose you wouldnt care about it illustration im afraid they gave alice very little to eat and drink however after a bit she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter only i dont quite see where she got the breadandbutter and she had no plate for it nobody seems to have a plate except the hatter i believe the march hare must have had one as well because when they all moved one place on that was the rule at this curious teaparty and alice had to go into the place of the march hare she found he had just upset the milkjug into his plate so i suppose his plate and the milkjug are hidden behind that large teapot the hatter used to carry about hats to sell and even the one that hes got on his head is meant to be sold you see its got its price marked on ita and a that means ten shillings and sixpence wasnt that a funny way of selling hats and hasnt he got a beautiful necktie on such a lovely yellow tie with large red spots he has just got up to say to alice your hair wants cutting that was a rude thing to say wasnt it and do you think her hair does want cutting i think its a very pretty lengthjust the right length xi the queens garden this is a little bit of the beautiful garden i told you about you see alice had managed at last to get quite small so that she could go through the little door i suppose she was about as tall as a mouse if it stood on its hindlegs so of course this was a very tiny rosetree and these are very tiny gardeners illustration what funny little men they are but are they men do you think i think they must be live cards with just a head and arms and legs so as to look like little men and what are they doing with that red paint i wonder well you see this is what they told alice the queen of hearts wanted to have a red rosetree just in that corner and these poor little gardeners had made a great mistake and had put in a white one instead and they were so frightened about it because the queen was sure to be angry and then she would order all their heads to be cut off she was a dreadfully savage queen and that was the way she always did when she was angry with people off with their heads they didnt really cut their heads off you know because nobody ever obeyed her but that was what she always said now cant you guess what the poor little gardeners are trying to do theyre trying to paint the roses red and theyre in a great hurry to get it done before the queen comes and then perhaps the queen wont find out it was a white rosetree to begin with and then perhaps the little men wont get their heads cut off you see there were five large white roses on the treesuch a job to get them all painted red but theyve got three and a half done now and if only they wouldnt stop to talkwork away little men do work away or the queen will be coming before its done and if she finds any white roses on the tree do you know what will happen it will be off with their heads oh work away my little men hurry hurry illustration the queen has come and isnt she angry oh my poor little alice xii the lobsterquadrille did you ever play at croquet there are large wooden balls painted with different colours that you have to roll about and arches of wire that you have to send them through and great wooden mallets with long handles to knock the balls about with now look at the picture and youll see that alice has just been playing a game of croquet but she couldnt play with that great red whatsitsname in her arms why how could she hold the mallet illustration why my dear child that great red whatsitsname its real name is a flamingo is the mallet in this croquetgame the balls were live hedgehogsyou know a hedgehog can roll itself up into a balland the mallets were live flamingos so alice is just resting from the game for a minute to have a chat with that dear old thing the duchess and of course she keeps her mallet under her arm so as not to lose it but i dont think she was a dear old thing one bit to call her baby a pig and to want to chop off alices head oh that was only a joke about chopping off alices head and as to the babywhy it was a pig you know and just look at her smile why its wider than all alices head and yet you can only see half of it well theyd only had a very little chat when the queen came and took alice away to see the gryphon and the mock turtle you dont know what a gryphon is well do you know anything thats the question however look at the picture that creature with a red head and red claws and green scales is the gryphon now you know and the others the mock turtle its got a calfshead because calfs head is used to make mock turtle soup now you know but what are they doing going round and round alice like that why i thought of course youd know that theyre dancing a lobsterquadrille illustration and next time you meet a gryphon and a mock turtle i daresay theyll dance it for you if you ask them prettily only dont let them come quite close or theyll be treading on your toes as they did on poor alices xiii who stole the tarts did you ever hear how the queen of hearts made some tarts and can you tell me what became of them why of course i can doesnt the song tell all about it the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away well yes the song says so but it would never do to punish the poor knave just because there was a song about him they had to take him prisoner and put chains on his wrists and bring him before the king of hearts so that there might be a regular trial now if you look at the big picture at the beginning of this book youll see what a grand thing a trial is when the judge is a king the king is very grand isnt he but he doesnt look very happy i think that big crown on the top of his wig must be very heavy and uncomfortable but he had to wear them both you see so that people might know he was a judge and a king and doesnt the queen look cross she can see the dish of tarts on the table that she had taken such trouble to make and she can see the bad knave do you see the chains hanging from his wrists that stole them away from her so i dont think its any wonder if she does feel a little cross the white rabbit is standing near the king reading out the song to tell everybody what a bad knave he is and the jury you can just see two of them up in the jurybox the frog and the duck have to settle whether hes guilty or not guilty now ill tell you about the accident that happened to alice you see she was sitting close by the jurybox and she was called as a witness you know what a witness is a witness is a person who has seen the prisoner do whatever hes accused of or at any rate knows something thats important in the trial but alice hadnt seen the queen make the tarts and she hadnt seen the knave take the tarts and in fact she didnt know anything about it so why in the world they wanted her to be a witness im sure i cant tell you anyhow they did want her and the white rabbit blew his big trumpet and shouted out alice and so alice jumped up in a great hurry and then and then what do you think happened why her skirt caught against the jurybox and tipped it over and all the poor little jurors came tumbling out of it illustration lets try if we can make out all the twelve you know there ought to be twelve to make up a jury i see the frog and the dormouse and the rat and the ferret and the hedgehog and the lizard and the bantamcock and the mole and the duck and the squirrel and a screaming bird with a long beak just behind the mole but that only makes eleven we must find one more creature oh do you see a little white head coming out behind the mole and just under the ducks beak that makes up the twelve mr tenniel says the screaming bird is a storkling of course you know what that is and the little white head is a mouseling isnt it a little darling alice picked them all up again very carefully and i hope they werent much hurt xiv the shower of cards oh dear oh dear what is it all about and whats happening to alice well ill tell you all about it as well i can the way the trial ended was this the king wanted the jury to settle whether the knave of hearts was guilty or not guiltythat means that they were to settle whether he had stolen the tarts or if somebody else had taken them but the wicked queen wanted to have his punishment settled first of all that wasnt at all fair was it because you know supposing he never took the tarts then of course he oughtnt to be punished would you like to be punished for something you hadnt done illustration so alice said stuff and nonsense so the queen said off with her head just what she always said when she was angry so alice said who cares for you youre nothing but a pack of cards so they were all very angry and flew up into the air and came tumbling down again all over alice just like a shower of rain and i think youll never guess what happened next the next thing was alice woke up out of her curious dream and she found that the cards were only some leaves off the tree that the wind had blown down upon her face wouldnt it be a nice thing to have a curious dream just like alice the best plan is this first lie down under a tree and wait till a white rabbit runs by with a watch in his hand then shut your eyes and pretend to be dear little alice goodbye alice dear goodbye the end an easter greeting to every child who loves alice my dear child please to fancy if you can that you are reading a real letter from a real friend whom you have seen and whose voice you can seem to yourself to hear wishing you as i do now with all my heart a happy easter do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a summer morning with the twitter of birds in the air and the fresh breeze coming in at the open windowwhen lying lazily with eyes half shut one sees as in a dream green boughs waving or waters rippling in a golden light it is a pleasure very near to sadness bringing tears to ones eyes like a beautiful picture or poem and is not that a mothers gentle hand that undraws your curtains and a mothers sweet voice that summons you to rise to rise and forget in the bright sunlight the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was darkto rise and enjoy another happy day first kneeling to thank that unseen friend who sends you the beautiful sun are these strange words from a writer of such tales as alice and is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense it may be so some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn things at all except in church and on a sunday but i thinknay i am surethat some children will read this gently and lovingly and in the spirit in which i have written it for i do not believe god means us thus to divide life into two halvesto wear a grave face on sunday and to think it outofplace to even so much as mention him on a weekday do you think he cares to see only kneeling figures and to hear only tones of prayerand that he does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight and to hear the merry voices of the children as they roll among the hay surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in his ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the dim religious light of some solemn cathedral and if i have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children i love so well it is surely something i may hope to look back upon without shame and sorrow as how much of life must then be recalled when my turn comes to walk through the valley of shadows this easter sun will rise on you dear child feeling your life in every limb and eager to rush out into the fresh morning airand many an easterday will come and go before it finds you feeble and greyheaded creeping wearily out to bask once more in the sunlightbut it is good even now to think sometimes of that great morning when the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you will one day see a brighter dawn than thiswhen lovelier sights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waterswhen angelhands shall undraw your curtains and sweeter tones than ever loving mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious dayand when all the sadness and the sin that darkened life on this little earth shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past your affectionate friend

magazine no entitled the land of idleness by lewis carroll this story was really written by a lady frulein ida lackowitz acting on her behalf mr carroll forwarded it to the editor and this led to the mistake of naming him as its author in october the writer of an article on literature for the little ones in the nineteenth century stated that in tom hood was delighting the world with such works as from nowhere to the north pole between tom hood and mr lewis carroll there is more than a suspicion of resemblance in some particulars alices adventures in wonderland narrowly escapes challenging a comparison with from nowhere to the north pole the idea of both is so similar that mr carroll can hardly have been surprised if some people have believed he was inspired by hood the date is a mistake

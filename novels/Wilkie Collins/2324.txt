a house to let full text by charles dickens wilkie collins elizabeth gaskell adelaide ann procter contents over the way the manchester marriage going into society three evenings in the house trottles report let at last over the way i had been living at tunbridge wells and nowhere else going on for ten years when my medical manvery clever in his profession and the prettiest player i ever saw in my life of a hand at long whist which was a noble and a princely game before short was heard ofsaid to me one day as he sat feeling my pulse on the actual sofa which my poor dear sister jane worked before her spine came on and laid her on a board for fifteen months at a stretchthe most upright woman that ever livedsaid to me what we want maam is a fillip good gracious goodness gracious doctor towers says i quite startled at the man for he was so christened himself dont talk as if you were alluding to peoples names but say what you mean i mean my dear maam that we want a little change of air and scene bless the man said i does he mean we or me i mean you maam then lard forgive you doctor towers i said why dont you get into a habit of expressing yourself in a straightforward manner like a loyal subject of our gracious queen victoria and a member of the church of england towers laughed as he generally does when he has fidgetted me into any of my impatient waysone of my states as i call themand then he began tone maam tone is all you require he appealed to trottle who just then came in with the coal scuttle looking in his nice black suit like an amiable man putting on coals from motives of benevolence trottle whom i always call my right hand has been in my service two and thirty years he entered my service far away from england he is the best of creatures and the most respectable of men but opinionated what you want maam says trottle making up the fire in his quiet and skilful way is tone lard forgive you both says i bursting out a laughing i see you are in a conspiracy against me so i suppose you must do what you like with me and take me to london for a change for some weeks towers had hinted at london and consequently i was prepared for him when we had got to this point we got on so expeditiously that trottle was packed off to london next day but one to find some sort of place for me to lay my troublesome old head in trottle came back to me at the wells after two days absence with accounts of a charming place that could be taken for six months certain with liberty to renew on the same terms for another six and which really did afford every accommodation that i wanted could you really find no fault at all in the rooms trottle i asked him not a single one maam they are exactly suitable to you there is not a fault in them there is but one fault outside of them and whats that they are opposite a house to let o i said considering of it but is that such a very great objection i think it my duty to mention it maam it is a dull object to look at otherwise i was so greatly pleased with the lodging that i should have closed with the terms at once as i had your authority to do trottle thinking so highly of the place in my interest i wished not to disappoint him consequently i said the empty house may let perhaps o dear no maam said trottle shaking his head with decision it wont let it never does let maam mercy me why not nobody knows maam all i have to mention is maam that the house wont let how long has this unfortunate house been to let in the name of fortune said i ever so long said trottle years is it in ruins its a good deal out of repair maam but its not in ruins the long and the short of this business was that next day i had a pair of post horses put to my chariotfor i never travel by railway not that i have anything to say against railways except that they came in when i was too old to take to them and that they made ducks and drakes of a few turnpike bonds i hadand so i went up myself with trottle in the rumble to look at the inside of this same lodging and at the outside of this same house as i say i went and saw for myself the lodging was perfect that i was sure it would be because trottle is the best judge of comfort i know the empty house was an eyesore and that i was sure it would be too for the same reason however setting the one thing against the other the good against the bad the lodging very soon got the victory over the house my lawyer mr squares of crown office row temple drew up an agreement which his young man jabbered over so dreadfully when he read it to me that i didnt understand one word of it except my own name and hardly that and i signed it and the other party signed it and in three weeks time i moved my old bones bag and baggage up to london for the first month or so i arranged to leave trottle at the wells i made this arrangement not only because there was a good deal to take care of in the way of my school children and pensioners and also of a new stove in the hall to air the house in my absence which appeared to me calculated to blow up and burst but likewise because i suspect trottle though the steadiest of men and a widower between sixty and seventy to be what i call rather a philanderer i mean that when any friend comes down to see me and brings a maid trottle is always remarkably ready to show that maid the wells of an evening and that i have more than once noticed the shadow of his arm outside the room door nearly opposite my chair encircling that maids waist on the landing like a table cloth brush therefore i thought it just as well before any london philandering took place that i should have a little time to look round me and to see what girls were in and about the place so nobody stayed with me in my new lodging at first after trottle had established me there safe and sound but peggy flobbins my maid a most affectionate and attached woman who never was an object of philandering since i have known her and is not likely to begin to become so after nine and twenty years next march it was the fifth of november when i first breakfasted in my new rooms the guys were going about in the brown fog like magnified monsters of insects in table beer and there was a guy resting on the door steps of the house to let i put on my glasses partly to see how the boys were pleased with what i sent them out by peggy and partly to make sure that she didnt approach too near the ridiculous object which of course was full of sky rockets and might go off into bangs at any moment in this way it happened that the first time i ever looked at the house to let after i became its opposite neighbour i had my glasses on and this might not have happened once in fifty times for my sight is uncommonly good for my time of life and i wear glasses as little as i can for fear of spoiling it i knew already that it was a ten roomed house very dirty and much dilapidated that the area rails were rusty and peeling away and that two or three of them were wanting or half wanting that there were broken panes of glass in the windows and blotches of mud on other panes which the boys had thrown at them that there was quite a collection of stones in the area also proceeding from those young mischiefs that there were games chalked on the pavement before the house and likenesses of ghosts chalked on the street door that the windows were all darkened by rotting old blinds or shutters or both that the bills to let had curled up as if the damp air of the place had given them cramps or had dropped down into corners as if they were no more i had seen all this on my first visit and i had remarked to trottle that the lower part of the black board about terms was split away that the rest had become illegible and that the very stone of the door steps was broken across notwithstanding i sat at my breakfast table on that please to remember the fifth of november morning staring at the house through my glasses as if i had never looked at it before all at oncein the first floor window on my rightdown in a low corner at a hole in a blind or a shutteri found that i was looking at a secret eye the reflection of my fire may have touched it and made it shine but i saw it shine and vanish the eye might have seen me or it might not have seen me sitting there in the glow of my fireyou can take which probability you prefer without offencebut something struck through my frame as if the sparkle of this eye had been electric and had flashed straight at me it had such an effect upon me that i could not remain by myself and i rang for flobbins and invented some little jobs for her to keep her in the room after my breakfast was cleared away i sat in the same place with my glasses on moving my head now so and now so trying whether with the shining of my fire and the flaws in the window glass i could reproduce any sparkle seeming to be up there that was like the sparkle of an eye but no i could make nothing like it i could make ripples and crooked lines in the front of the house to let and i could even twist one window up and loop it into another but i could make no eye nor anything like an eye so i convinced myself that i really had seen an eye well to be sure i could not get rid of the impression of this eye and it troubled me and troubled me until it was almost a torment i dont think i was previously inclined to concern my head much about the opposite house but after this eye my head was full of the house and i thought of little else than the house and i watched the house and i talked about the house and i dreamed of the house in all this i fully believe now there was a good providence but you will judge for yourself about that bye and bye my landlord was a butler who had married a cook and set up housekeeping they had not kept house longer than a couple of years and they knew no more about the house to let than i did neither could i find out anything concerning it among the trades people or otherwise further than what trottle had told me at first it had been empty some said six years some said eight some said ten it never did let they all agreed and it never would let i soon felt convinced that i should work myself into one of my states about the house and i soon did i lived for a whole month in a flurry that was always getting worse towerss prescriptions which i had brought to london with me were of no more use than nothing in the cold winter sunlight in the thick winter fog in the black winter rain in the white winter snow the house was equally on my mind i have heard as everybody else has of a spirits haunting a house but i have had my own personal experience of a houses haunting a spirit for that house haunted mine in all that months time i never saw anyone go into the house nor come out of the house i supposed that such a thing must take place sometimes in the dead of the night or the glimmer of the morning but i never saw it done i got no relief from having my curtains drawn when it came on dark and shutting out the house the eye then began to shine in my fire i am a single old woman i should say at once without being at all afraid of the name i am an old maid only that i am older than the phrase would express the time was when i had my love trouble but it is long and long ago he was killed at sea dear heaven rest his blessed head when i was twenty five i have all my life since ever i can remember been deeply fond of children i have always felt such a love for them that i have had my sorrowful and sinful times when i have fancied something must have gone wrong in my lifesomething must have been turned aside from its original intention i meanor i should have been the proud and happy mother of many children and a fond old grandmother this day i have soon known better in the cheerfulness and contentment that god has blessed me with and given me abundant reason for and yet i have had to dry my eyes even then when i have thought of my dear brave hopeful handsome bright eyed charley and the trust meant to cheer me with charley was my youngest brother and he went to india he married there and sent his gentle little wife home to me to be confined and she was to go back to him and the baby was to be left with me and i was to bring it up it never belonged to this life it took its silent place among the other incidents in my story that might have been but never were i had hardly time to whisper to her dead my own or she to answer ashes to ashes dust to dust o lay it on my breast and comfort charley when she had gone to seek her baby at our saviours feet i went to charley and i told him there was nothing left but me poor me and i lived with charley out there several years he was a man of fifty when he fell asleep in my arms his face had changed to be almost old and a little stern but it softened and softened when i laid it down that i might cry and pray beside it and when i looked at it for the last time it was my dear untroubled handsome youthful charley of long ago i was going on to tell that the loneliness of the house to let brought back all these recollections and that they had quite pierced my heart one evening when flobbins opening the door and looking very much as if she wanted to laugh but thought better of it said mr jabez jarber maam upon which mr jarber ambled in in his usual absurd way saying sophonisba which i am obliged to confess is my name a pretty one and proper one enough when it was given to me but a good many years out of date now and always sounding particularly high flown and comical from his lips so i said sharply though it is sophonisba jarber you are not obliged to mention it that i see in reply to this observation the ridiculous man put the tips of my five right hand fingers to his lips and said again with an aggravating accent on the third syllable sophonisba i dont burn lamps because i cant abide the smell of oil and wax candles belonged to my day i hope the convenient situation of one of my tall old candlesticks on the table at my elbow will be my excuse for saying that if he did that again i would chop his toes with it i am sorry to add that when i told him so i knew his toes to be tender but really at my time of life and at jarbers it is too much of a good thing there is an orchestra still standing in the open air at the wells before which in the presence of a throng of fine company i have walked a minuet with jarber but there is a house still standing in which i have worn a pinafore and had a tooth drawn by fastening a thread to the tooth and the door handle and toddling away from the door and how should i look now at my years in a pinafore or having a door for my dentist besides jarber always was more or less an absurd man he was sweetly dressed and beautifully perfumed and many girls of my day would have given their ears for him though i am bound to add that he never cared a fig for them or their advances either and that he was very constant to me for he not only proposed to me before my love happiness ended in sorrow but afterwards too not once nor yet twice nor will we say how many times however many they were or however few they were the last time he paid me that compliment was immediately after he had presented me with a digestive dinner pill stuck on the point of a pin and i said on that occasion laughing heartily now jarber if you dont know that two people whose united ages would make about a hundred and fifty have got to be old i do and i beg to swallow this nonsense in the form of this pill which i took on the spot and i request to hear no more of it after that he conducted himself pretty well he was always a little squeezed man was jarber in little sprigged waistcoats and he had always little legs and a little smile and a little voice and little round about ways as long as i can remember him he was always going little errands for people and carrying little gossip at this present time when he called me sophonisba he had a little old fashioned lodging in that new neighbourhood of mine i had not seen him for two or three years but i had heard that he still went out with a little perspective glass and stood on door steps in saint jamess street to see the nobility go to court and went in his little cloak and goloshes outside williss rooms to see them go to almacks and caught the frightfullest colds and got himself trodden upon by coachmen and linkmen until he went home to his landlady a mass of bruises and had to be nursed for a month jarber took off his little fur collared cloak and sat down opposite me with his little cane and hat in his hand let us have no more sophonisbaing if you please jarber i said call me sarah how do you do i hope you are pretty well thank you and you said jarber i am as well as an old woman can expect to be jarber was beginning say not old sophon but i looked at the candlestick and he left off pretending not to have said anything i am infirm of course i said and so are you let us both be thankful its no worse is it possible that you look worried said jarber it is very possible i have no doubt it is the fact and what has worried my soph soft hearted friend said jarber something not easy i suppose to comprehend i am worried to death by a house to let over the way jarber went with his little tip toe step to the window curtains peeped out and looked round at me yes said i in answer that house after peeping out again jarber came back to his chair with a tender air and asked how does it worry you s arah it is a mystery to me said i of course every house is a mystery more or less but something that i dont care to mention for truly the eye was so slight a thing to mention that i was more than half ashamed of it has made that house so mysterious to me and has so fixed it in my mind that i have had no peace for a month i foresee that i shall have no peace either until trottle comes to me next monday i might have mentioned before that there is a lone standing jealousy between trottle and jarber and that there is never any love lost between those two trottle petulantly repeated jarber with a little flourish of his cane how is trottle to restore the lost peace of sarah he will exert himself to find out something about the house i have fallen into that state about it that i really must discover by some means or other good or bad fair or foul how and why it is that that house remains to let and why trottle why not putting his little hat to his heart why not jarber to tell you the truth i have never thought of jarber in the matter and now i do think of jarber through your having the kindness to suggest himfor which i am really and truly obliged to youi dont think he could do it sarah i think it would be too much for you jarber sarah there would be coming and going and fetching and carrying jarber and you might catch cold sarah what can be done by trottle can be done by me i am on terms of acquaintance with every person of responsibility in this parish i am intimate at the circulating library i converse daily with the assessed taxes i lodge with the water rate i know the medical man i lounge habitually at the house agents i dine with the churchwardens i move to the guardians trottle a person in the sphere of a domestic and totally unknown to society dont be warm jarber in mentioning trottle i have naturally relied on my right hand who would take any trouble to gratify even a whim of his old mistresss but if you can find out anything to help to unravel the mystery of this house to let i shall be fully as much obliged to you as if there was never a trottle in the land jarber rose and put on his little cloak a couple of fierce brass lions held it tight round his little throat but a couple of the mildest hares might have done that i am sure sarah he said i go expect me on monday evening the sixth when perhaps you will give me a cup of teamay i ask for no green adieu this was on a thursday the second of december when i reflected that trottle would come back on monday too i had my misgivings as to the difficulty of keeping the two powers from open warfare and indeed i was more uneasy than i quite like to confess however the empty house swallowed up that thought next morning as it swallowed up most other thoughts now and the house quite preyed upon me all that day and all the saturday it was a very wet sunday raining and blowing from morning to night when the bells rang for afternoon church they seemed to ring in the commotion of the puddles as well as in the wind and they sounded very loud and dismal indeed and the street looked very dismal indeed and the house looked dismallest of all i was reading my prayers near the light and my fire was growing in the darkening window glass when looking up as i prayed for the fatherless children and widows and all who were desolate and oppressedi saw the eye again it passed in a moment as it had done before but this time i was inwardly more convinced that i had seen it well to be sure i had a night that night whenever i closed my own eyes it was to see eyes next morning at an unreasonably and i should have said but for that railroad an impossibly early hour comes trottle as soon as he had told me all about the wells i told him all about the house he listened with as great interest and attention as i could possibly wish until i came to jabez jarber when he cooled in an instant and became opinionated now trottle i said pretending not to notice when mr jarber comes back this evening we must all lay our heads together i should hardly think that would be wanted maam mr jarbers head is surely equal to anything being determined not to notice i said again that we must all lay our heads together whatever you order maam shall be obeyed still it cannot be doubted i should think that mr jarbers head is equal if not superior to any pressure that can be brought to bear upon it this was provoking and his way when he came in and out all through the day of pretending not to see the house to let was more provoking still however being quite resolved not to notice i gave no sign whatever that i did notice but when evening came and he showed in jarber and when jarber wouldnt be helped off with his cloak and poked his cane into cane chair backs and china ornaments and his own eye in trying to unclasp his brazen lions of himself which he couldnt do after all i could have shaken them both as it was i only shook the tea pot and made the tea jarber had brought from under his cloak a roll of paper with which he had triumphantly pointed over the way like the ghost of hamlets father appearing to the late mr kemble and which he had laid on the table a discovery said i pointing to it when he was seated and had got his tea cupdont go trottle the first of a series of discoveries answered jarber account of a former tenant compiled from the water rate and medical man dont go trottle i repeated for i saw him making imperceptibly to the door begging your pardon maam i might be in mr jarbers way jarber looked that he decidedly thought he might be i relieved myself with a good angry croak and saidalways determined not to notice have the goodness to sit down if you please trottle i wish you to hear this trottle bowed in the stiffest manner and took the remotest chair he could find even that he moved close to the draught from the keyhole of the door firstly jarber began after sipping his tea would my sophon begin again jarber said i would you be much surprised if this house to let should turn out to be the property of a relation of your own i should indeed be very much surprised then it belongs to your first cousin i learn by the way that he is ill at this time george forley then that is a bad beginning i cannot deny that george forley stands in the relation of first cousin to me but i hold no communication with him george forley has been a hard bitter stony father to a child now dead george forley was most implacable and unrelenting to one of his two daughters who made a poor marriage george forley brought all the weight of his band to bear as heavily against that crushed thing as he brought it to bear lightly favouringly and advantageously upon her sister who made a rich marriage i hope that with the measure george forley meted it may not be measured out to him again i will give george forley no worse wish i was strong upon the subject and i could not keep the tears out of my eyes for that young girls was a cruel story and i had dropped many a tear over it before the house being george forleys said i is almost enough to account for there being a fate upon it if fate there is is there anything about george forley in those sheets of paper not a word i am glad to hear it please to read on trottle why dont you come nearer why do you sit mortifying yourself in those arctic regions come nearer thank you maam i am quite near enough to mr jarber jarber rounded his chair to get his back full to my opinionated friend and servant and beginning to read tossed the words at him over his jabez jarbers own ear and shoulder he read what follows the manchester marriage mr and mrs openshaw came from manchester to london and took the house to let he had been what is called in lancashire a salesman for a large manufacturing firm who were extending their business and opening a warehouse in london where mr openshaw was now to superintend the business he rather enjoyed the change of residence having a kind of curiosity about london which he had never yet been able to gratify in his brief visits to the metropolis at the same time he had an odd shrewd contempt for the inhabitants whom he had always pictured to himself as fine lazy people caring nothing but for fashion and aristocracy and lounging away their days in bond street and such places ruining good english and ready in their turn to despise him as a provincial the hours that the men of business kept in the city scandalised him too accustomed as he was to the early dinners of manchester folk and the consequently far longer evenings still he was pleased to go to london though he would not for the world have confessed it even to himself and always spoke of the step to his friends as one demanded of him by the interests of his employers and sweetened to him by a considerable increase of salary his salary indeed was so liberal that he might have been justified in taking a much larger house than this one had he not thought himself bound to set an example to londoners of how little a manchester man of business cared for show inside however he furnished the house with an unusual degree of comfort and in the winter time he insisted on keeping up as large fires as the grates would allow in every room where the temperature was in the least chilly moreover his northern sense of hospitality was such that if he were at home he could hardly suffer a visitor to leave the house without forcing meat and drink upon him every servant in the house was well warmed well fed and kindly treated for their master scorned all petty saving in aught that conduced to comfort while he amused himself by following out all his accustomed habits and individual ways in defiance of what any of his new neighbours might think his wife was a pretty gentle woman of suitable age and character he was forty two she thirty five he was loud and decided she soft and yielding they had two children or rather i should say she had two for the elder a girl of eleven was mrs openshaws child by frank wilson her first husband the younger was a little boy edwin who could just prattle and to whom his father delighted to speak in the broadest and most unintelligible lancashire dialect in order to keep up what he called the true saxon accent mrs openshaws christian name was alice and her first husband had been her own cousin she was the orphan niece of a sea captain in liverpool a quiet grave little creature of great personal attraction when she was fifteen or sixteen with regular features and a blooming complexion but she was very shy and believed herself to be very stupid and awkward and was frequently scolded by her aunt her own uncles second wife so when her cousin frank wilson came home from a long absence at sea and first was kind and protective to her secondly attentive and thirdly desperately in love with her she hardly knew how to be grateful enough to him it is true she would have preferred his remaining in the first or second stages of behaviour for his violent love puzzled and frightened her her uncle neither helped nor hindered the love affair though it was going on under his own eyes franks step mother had such a variable temper that there was no knowing whether what she liked one day she would like the next or not at length she went to such extremes of crossness that alice was only too glad to shut her eyes and rush blindly at the chance of escape from domestic tyranny offered her by a marriage with her cousin and liking him better than any one in the world except her uncle who was at this time at sea she went off one morning and was married to him her only bridesmaid being the housemaid at her aunts the consequence was that frank and his wife went into lodgings and mrs wilson refused to see them and turned away norah the warm hearted housemaid whom they accordingly took into their service when captain wilson returned from his voyage he was very cordial with the young couple and spent many an evening at their lodgings smoking his pipe and sipping his grog but he told them that for quietness sake he could not ask them to his own house for his wife was bitter against them they were not very unhappy about this the seed of future unhappiness lay rather in franks vehement passionate disposition which led him to resent his wifes shyness and want of demonstration as failures in conjugal duty he was already tormenting himself and her too in a slighter degree by apprehensions and imaginations of what might befall her during his approaching absence at sea at last he went to his father and urged him to insist upon alices being once more received under his roof the more especially as there was now a prospect of her confinement while her husband was away on his voyage captain wilson was as he himself expressed it breaking up and unwilling to undergo the excitement of a scene yet he felt that what his son said was true so he went to his wife and before frank went to sea he had the comfort of seeing his wife installed in her old little garret in his fathers house to have placed her in the one best spare room was a step beyond mrs wilsons powers of submission or generosity the worst part about it however was that the faithful norah had to be dismissed her place as housemaid had been filled up and even had it not she had forfeited mrs wilsons good opinion for ever she comforted her young master and mistress by pleasant prophecies of the time when they would have a household of their own of which in whatever service she might be in the meantime she should be sure to form part almost the last action frank wilson did before setting sail was going with alice to see norah once more at her mothers house and then he went away alices father in law grew more and more feeble as winter advanced she was of great use to her step mother in nursing and amusing him and although there was anxiety enough in the household there was perhaps more of peace than there had been for years for mrs wilson had not a bad heart and was softened by the visible approach of death to one whom she loved and touched by the lonely condition of the young creature expecting her first confinement in her husbands absence to this relenting mood norah owed the permission to come and nurse alice when her baby was born and to remain to attend on captain wilson before one letter had been received from frank who had sailed for the east indies and china his father died alice was always glad to remember that he had held her baby in his arms and kissed and blessed it before his death after that and the consequent examination into the state of his affairs it was found that he had left far less property than people had been led by his style of living to imagine and what money there was was all settled upon his wife and at her disposal after her death this did not signify much to alice as frank was now first mate of his ship and in another voyage or two would be captain meanwhile he had left her some hundreds all his savings in the bank it became time for alice to hear from her husband one letter from the cape she had already received the next was to announce his arrival in india as week after week passed over and no intelligence of the ships arrival reached the office of the owners and the captains wife was in the same state of ignorant suspense as alice herself her fears grew most oppressive at length the day came when in reply to her inquiry at the shipping office they told her that the owners had given up hope of ever hearing more of the betsy jane and had sent in their claim upon the underwriters now that he was gone for ever she first felt a yearning longing love for the kind cousin the dear friend the sympathising protector whom she should never see againfirst felt a passionate desire to show him his child whom she had hitherto rather craved to have all to herselfher own sole possession her grief was however noiseless and quietrather to the scandal of mrs wilson who bewailed her step son as if he and she had always lived together in perfect harmony and who evidently thought it her duty to burst into fresh tears at every strange face she saw dwelling on his poor young widows desolate state and the helplessness of the fatherless child with an unction as if she liked the excitement of the sorrowful story so passed away the first days of alices widowhood bye and bye things subsided into their natural and tranquil course but as if this young creature was always to be in some heavy trouble her ewe lamb began to be ailing pining and sickly the childs mysterious illness turned out to be some affection of the spine likely to affect health but not to shorten lifeat least so the doctors said but the long dreary suffering of one whom a mother loves as alice loved her only child is hard to look forward to only norah guessed what alice suffered no one but god knew and so it fell out that when mrs wilson the elder came to her one day in violent distress occasioned by a very material diminution in the value the property that her husband had left hera diminution which made her income barely enough to support herself much less alicethe latter could hardly understand how anything which did not touch health or life could cause such grief and she received the intelligence with irritating composure but when that afternoon the little sick child was brought in and the grandmotherwho after all loved it wellbegan a fresh moan over her losses to its unconscious earssaying how she had planned to consult this or that doctor and to give it this or that comfort or luxury in after yearn but that now all chance of this had passed awayalices heart was touched and she drew near to mrs wilson with unwonted caresses and in a spirit not unlike to that of ruth entreated that come what would they might remain together after much discussion in succeeding days it was arranged that mrs wilson should take a house in manchester furnishing it partly with what furniture she had and providing the rest with alices remaining two hundred pounds mrs wilson was herself a manchester woman and naturally longed to return to her native town some connections of her own at that time required lodgings for which they were willing to pay pretty handsomely alice undertook the active superintendence and superior work of the household norah willing faithful norah offered to cook scour do anything in short so that she might but remain with them the plan succeeded for some years their first lodgers remained with them and all went smoothlywith the one sad exception of the little girls increasing deformity how that mother loved that child is not for words to tell then came a break of misfortune their lodgers left and no one succeeded to them after some months they had to remove to a smaller house and alices tender conscience was torn by the idea that she ought not to be a burden to her mother in law but ought to go out and seek her own maintenance and leave her child the thought came like the sweeping boom of a funeral bell over her heart bye and bye mr openshaw came to lodge with them he had started in life as the errand boy and sweeper out of a warehouse had struggled up through all the grades of employment in the place fighting his way through the hard striving manchester life with strong pushing energy of character every spare moment of time had been sternly given up to self teaching he was a capital accountant a good french and german scholar a keen far seeing tradesman understanding markets and the bearing of events both near and distant on trade and yet with such vivid attention to present details that i do not think he ever saw a group of flowers in the fields without thinking whether their colours would or would not form harmonious contrasts in the coming spring muslins and prints he went to debating societies and threw himself with all his heart and soul into politics esteeming it must be owned every man a fool or a knave who differed from him and overthrowing his opponents rather by the loud strength of his language than the calm strength if his logic there was something of the yankee in all this indeed his theory ran parallel to the famous yankee mottoengland flogs creation and manchester flogs england such a man as may be fancied had had no time for falling in love or any such nonsense at the age when most young men go through their courting and matrimony he had not the means of keeping a wife and was far too practical to think of having one and now that he was in easy circumstances a rising man he considered women almost as incumbrances to the world with whom a man had better have as little to do as possible his first impression of alice was indistinct and he did not care enough about her to make it distinct a pretty yea nay kind of woman would have been his description of her if he had been pushed into a corner he was rather afraid in the beginning that her quiet ways arose from a listlessness and laziness of character which would have been exceedingly discordant to his active energetic nature but when he found out the punctuality with which his wishes were attended to and her work was done when he was called in the morning at the very stroke of the clock his shaving water scalding hot his fire bright his coffee made exactly as his peculiar fancy dictated for he was a man who had his theory about everything based upon what he knew of science and often perfectly originalthen he began to think not that alice had any peculiar merit but that he had got into remarkably good lodgings his restlessness wore away and he began to consider himself as almost settled for life in them mr openshaw had been too busy all his life to be introspective he did not know that he had any tenderness in his nature and if he had become conscious of its abstract existence he would have considered it as a manifestation of disease in some part of his nature but he was decoyed into pity unawares and pity led on to tenderness that little helpless childalways carried about by one of the three busy women of the house or else patiently threading coloured beads in the chair from which by no effort of its own could it ever move the great grave blue eyes full of serious not uncheerful expression giving to the small delicate face a look beyond its years the soft plaintive voice dropping out but few words so unlike the continual prattle of a childcaught mr openshaws attention in spite of himself one dayhe half scorned himself for doing sohe cut short his dinner hour to go in search of some toy which should take the place of those eternal beads i forget what he bought but when he gave the present which he took care to do in a short abrupt manner and when no one was by to see him he was almost thrilled by the flash of delight that came over that childs face and could not help all through that afternoon going over and over again the picture left on his memory by the bright effect of unexpected joy on the little girls face when he returned home he found his slippers placed by his sitting room fire and even more careful attention paid to his fancies than was habitual in those model lodgings when alice had taken the last of his tea things awayshe had been silent as usual till thenshe stood for an instant with the door in her hand mr openshaw looked as if he were deep in his book though in fact he did not see a line but was heartily wishing the woman would be gone and not make any palaver of gratitude but she only said i am very much obliged to you sir thank you very much and was gone even before he could send her away with a there my good woman thats enough for some time longer he took no apparent notice of the child he even hardened his heart into disregarding her sudden flush of colour and little timid smile of recognition when he saw her by chance but after all this could not last for ever and having a second time given way to tenderness there was no relapse the insidious enemy having thus entered his heart in the guise of compassion to the child soon assumed the more dangerous form of interest in the mother he was aware of this change of feeling despised himself for it struggled with it nay internally yielded to it and cherished it long before he suffered the slightest expression of it by word action or look to escape him he watched alices docile obedient ways to her stepmother the love which she had inspired in the rough norah roughened by the wear and tear of sorrow and years but above all he saw the wild deep passionate affection existing between her and her child they spoke little to any one else or when any one else was by but when alone together they talked and murmured and cooed and chattered so continually that mr openshaw first wondered what they could find to say to each other and next became irritated because they were always so grave and silent with him all this time he was perpetually devising small new pleasures for the child his thoughts ran in a pertinacious way upon the desolate life before her and often he came back from his days work loaded with the very thing alice had been longing for but had not been able to procure one time it was a little chair for drawing the little sufferer along the streets and many an evening that ensuing summer mr openshaw drew her along himself regardless of the remarks of his acquaintances one day in autumn he put down his newspaper as alice came in with the breakfast and said in as indifferent a voice as he could assume mrs frank is there any reason why we two should not put up our horses together alice stood still in perplexed wonder what did he mean he had resumed the reading of his newspaper as if he did not expect any answer so she found silence her safest course and went on quietly arranging his breakfast without another word passing between them just as he was leaving the house to go to the warehouse as usual he turned back and put his head into the bright neat tidy kitchen where all the women breakfasted in the morning youll think of what i said mrs frank this was her name with the lodgers and let me have your opinion upon it to night alice was thankful that her mother and norah were too busy talking together to attend much to this speech she determined not to think about it at all through the day and of course the effort not to think made her think all the more at night she sent up norah with his tea but mr openshaw almost knocked norah down as she was going out at the door by pushing past her and calling out mrs frank in an impatient voice at the top of the stairs alice went up rather than seem to have affixed too much meaning to his words well mrs frank he said what answer dont make it too long for i have lots of office work to get through to night i hardly know what you meant sir said truthful alice well i should have thought you might have guessed youre not new at this sort of work and i am however ill make it plain this time will you have me to be thy wedded husband and serve me and love me and honour me and all that sort of thing because if you will i will do as much by you and be a father to your childand thats more than is put in the prayer book now im a man of my word and what i say i feel and what i promise ill do now for your answer alice was silent he began to make the tea as if her reply was a matter of perfect indifference to him but as soon as that was done he became impatient well said he how long sir may i have to think over it three minutes looking at his watch youve had two alreadythat makes five be a sensible woman say yes and sit down to tea with me and well talk it over together for after tea i shall be busy say no he hesitated a moment to try and keep his voice in the same tone and i shant say another word about it but pay up a years rent for my rooms to morrow and be off times up yes or no if you please siryou have been so good to little ailsie there sit down comfortably by me on the sofa and let us have our tea together i am glad to find you are as good and sensible as i took you for and this was alice wilsons second wooing mr openshaws will was too strong and his circumstances too good for him not to carry all before him he settled mrs wilson in a comfortable house of her own and made her quite independent of lodgers the little that alice said with regard to future plans was in norahs behalf no said mr openshaw norah shall take care of the old lady as long as she lives and after that she shall either come and live with us or if she likes it better she shall have a provision for lifefor your sake missus no one who has been good to you or the child shall go unrewarded but even the little one will be better for some fresh stuff about her get her a bright sensible girl as a nurse one who wont go rubbing her with calfs foot jelly as norah does wasting good stuff outside that ought to go in but will follow doctors directions which as you must see pretty clearly by this time norah wont because they give the poor little wench pain now im not above being nesh for other folks myself i can stand a good blow and never change colour but set me in the operating room in the infirmary and i turn as sick as a girl yet if need were i would hold the little wench on my knees while she screeched with pain if it were to do her poor back good nay nay wench keep your white looks for the time when it comesi dont say it ever will but this i know norah will spare the child and cheat the doctor if she can now i say give the bairn a year or twos chance and then when the pack of doctors have done their bestand maybe the old lady has gonewell have norah back or do better for her the pack of doctors could do no good to little ailsie she was beyond their power but her father for so he insisted on being called and also on alices no longer retaining the appellation of mama but becoming henceforward mother by his healthy cheerfulness of manner his clear decision of purpose his odd turns and quirks of humour added to his real strong love for the helpless little girl infused a new element of brightness and confidence into her life and though her back remained the same her general health was strengthened and alicenever going beyond a smile herselfhad the pleasure of seeing her child taught to laugh as for alices own life it was happier than it had ever been mr openshaw required no demonstration no expressions of affection from her indeed these would rather have disgusted him alice could love deeply but could not talk about it the perpetual requirement of loving words looks and caresses and misconstruing their absence into absence of love had been the great trial of her former married life now all went on clear and straight under the guidance of her husbands strong sense warm heart and powerful will year by year their worldly prosperity increased at mrs wilsons death norah came back to them as nurse to the newly born little edwin into which post she was not installed without a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father who declared that if he found out that norah ever tried to screen the boy by a falsehood or to make him nesh either in body or mind she should go that very day norah and mr openshaw were not on the most thoroughly cordial terms neither of them fully recognising or appreciating the others best qualities this was the previous history of the lancashire family who had now removed to london and had come to occupy the house they had been there about a year when mr openshaw suddenly informed his wife that he had determined to heal long standing feuds and had asked his uncle and aunt chadwick to come and pay them a visit and see london mrs openshaw had never seen this uncle and aunt of her husbands years before she had married him there had been a quarrel all she knew was that mr chadwick was a small manufacturer in a country town in south lancashire she was extremely pleased that the breach was to be healed and began making preparations to render their visit pleasant they arrived at last going to see london was such an event to them that mrs chadwick had made all new linen fresh for the occasion from night caps downwards and as for gowns ribbons and collars she might have been going into the wilds of canada where never a shop is so large was her stock a fortnight before the day of her departure for london she had formally called to take leave of all her acquaintance saying she should need all the intermediate time for packing up it was like a second wedding in her imagination and to complete the resemblance which an entirely new wardrobe made between the two events her husband brought her back from manchester on the last market day before they set off a gorgeous pearl and amethyst brooch saying lunnon should see that lancashire folks knew a handsome thing when they saw it for some time after mr and mrs chadwick arrived at the openshaws there was no opportunity for wearing this brooch but at length they obtained an order to see buckingham palace and the spirit of loyalty demanded that mrs chadwick should wear her best clothes in visiting the abode of her sovereign on her return she hastily changed her dress for mr openshaw had planned that they should go to richmond drink tea and return by moonlight accordingly about five oclock mr and mrs openshaw and mr and mrs chadwick set off the housemaid and cook sate below norah hardly knew where she was always engrossed in the nursery in tending her two children and in sitting by the restless excitable ailsie till she fell asleep bye and bye the housemaid bessy tapped gently at the door norah went to her and they spoke in whispers nurse theres some one down stairs wants you wants me who is it a gentleman a gentleman nonsense well a man then and he asks for you and he rung at the front door bell and has walked into the dining room you should never have let him exclaimed norah master and missus out i did not want him to come in but when he heard you lived here he walked past me and sat down on the first chair and said tell her to come and speak to me there is no gas lighted in the room and supper is all set out hell be off with the spoons exclaimed norah putting the housemaids fear into words and preparing to leave the room first however giving a look to ailsie sleeping soundly and calmly down stairs she went uneasy fears stirring in her bosom before she entered the dining room she provided herself with a candle and with it in her hand she went in looking round her in the darkness for her visitor he was standing up holding by the table norah and he looked at each other gradual recognition coming into their eyes norah at length he asked who are you asked norah with the sharp tones of alarm and incredulity i dont know you trying by futile words of disbelief to do away with the terrible fact before her am i so changed he said pathetically i daresay i am but norah tell me he breathed hard where is my wife is sheis she alive he came nearer to norah and would have taken her hand but she backed away from him looking at him all the time with staring eyes as if he were some horrible object yet he was a handsome bronzed good looking fellow with beard and moustache giving him a foreign looking aspect but his eyes there was no mistaking those eager beautiful eyesthe very same that norah had watched not half an hour ago till sleep stole softly over them tell me norahi can bear iti have feared it so often is she dead norah still kept silence she is dead he hung on norahs words and looks as if for confirmation or contradiction what shall i do groaned norah o sir why did you come how did you find me out where have you been we thought you dead we did indeed she poured out words and questions to gain time as if time would help her norah answer me this question straight by yes or nois my wife dead no she is not said norah slowly and heavily o what a relief did she receive my letters but perhaps you dont know why did you leave her where is she o norah tell me all quickly mr frank said norah at last almost driven to bay by her terror lest her mistress should return at any moment and find him thereunable to consider what was best to be done or saidrushing at something decisive because she could not endure her present state mr frank we never heard a line from you and the shipowners said you had gone down you and every one else we thought you were dead if ever man was and poor miss alice and her little sick helpless child o sir you must guess it cried the poor creature at last bursting out into a passionate fit of crying for indeed i cannot tell it but it was no ones fault god help us all this night norah had sate down she trembled too much to stand he took her hands in his he squeezed them hard as if by physical pressure the truth could be wrung out norah this time his tone was calm stagnant as despair she has married again norah shook her head sadly the grasp slowly relaxed the man had fainted there was brandy in the room norah forced some drops into mr franks mouth chafed his hands andwhen mere animal life returned before the mind poured in its flood of memories and thoughtsshe lifted him up and rested his head against her knees then she put a few crumbs of bread taken from the supper table soaked in brandy into his mouth suddenly he sprang to his feet where is she tell me this instant he looked so wild so mad so desperate that norah felt herself to be in bodily danger but her time of dread had gone by she had been afraid to tell him the truth and then she had been a coward now her wits were sharpened by the sense of his desperate state he must leave the house she would pity him afterwards but now she must rather command and upbraid for he must leave the house before her mistress came home that one necessity stood clear before her she is not here that is enough for you to know nor can i say exactly where she is which was true to the letter if not to the spirit go away and tell me where to find you to morrow and i will tell you all my master and mistress may come back at any minute and then what would become of me with a strange man in the house such an argument was too petty to touch his excited mind i dont care for your master and mistress if your master is a man he must feel for me poor shipwrecked sailor that i amkept for years a prisoner amongst savages always always always thinking of my wife and my homedreaming of her by night talking to her though she could not hear by day i loved her more than all heaven and earth put together tell me where she is this instant you wretched woman who salved over her wickedness to her as you do to me the clock struck ten desperate positions require desperate measures if you will leave the house now i will come to you to morrow and tell you all what is more you shall see your child now she lies sleeping up stairs o sir you have a child you do not know that as yeta little weakly girlwith just a heart and soul beyond her years we have reared her up with such care we watched her for we thought for many a year she might die any day and we tended her and no hard thing has come near her and no rough word has ever been said to her and now you come and will take her life into your hand and will crush it strangers to her have been kind to her but her own fathermr frank i am her nurse and i love her and i tend her and i would do anything for her that i could her mothers heart beats as hers beats and if she suffers a pain her mother trembles all over if she is happy it is her mother that smiles and is glad if she is growing stronger her mother is healthy if she dwindles her mother languishes if she dieswell i dont know it is not every one can lie down and die when they wish it come up stairs mr frank and see your child seeing her will do good to your poor heart then go away in gods name just this one nightto morrow if need be you can do anythingkill us all if you will or show yourselfa great grand man whom god will bless for ever and ever come mr frank the look of a sleeping child is sure to give peace she led him up stairs at first almost helping his steps till they came near the nursery door she had almost forgotten the existence of little edwin it struck upon her with affright as the shaded light fell upon the other cot but she skilfully threw that corner of the room into darkness and let the light fall on the sleeping ailsie the child had thrown down the coverings and her deformity as she lay with her back to them was plainly visible through her slight night gown her little face deprived of the lustre of her eyes looked wan and pinched and had a pathetic expression in it even as she slept the poor father looked and looked with hungry wistful eyes into which the big tears came swelling up slowly and dropped heavily down as he stood trembling and shaking all over norah was angry with herself for growing impatient of the length of time that long lingering gaze lasted she thought that she waited for full half an hour before frank stirred and theninstead of going awayhe sank down on his knees by the bedside and buried his face in the clothes little ailsie stirred uneasily norah pulled him up in terror she could afford no more time even for prayer in her extremity of fear for surely the next moment would bring her mistress home she took him forcibly by the arm but as he was going his eye lighted on the other bed he stopped intelligence came back into his face his hands clenched his child he asked her child replied norah god watches over him said she instinctively for franks looks excited her fears and she needed to remind herself of the protector of the helpless god has not watched over me he said in despair his thoughts apparently recoiling on his own desolate deserted state but norah had no time for pity to morrow she would be as compassionate as her heart prompted at length she guided him downstairs and shut the outer door and bolted itas if by bolts to keep out facts then she went back into the dining room and effaced all traces of his presence as far as she could she went upstairs to the nursery and sate there her head on her hand thinking what was to come of all this misery it seemed to her very long before they did return yet it was hardly eleven oclock she so heard the loud hearty lancashire voices on the stairs and for the first time she understood the contrast of the desolation of the poor man who had so lately gone forth in lonely despair it almost put her out of patience to see mrs openshaw come in calmly smiling handsomely dressed happy easy to inquire after her children did ailsie go to sleep comfortably she whispered to norah yes her mother bent over her looking at her slumbers with the soft eyes of love how little she dreamed who had looked on her last then she went to edwin with perhaps less wistful anxiety in her countenance but more of pride she took off her things to go down to supper norah saw her no more that night beside the door into the passage the sleeping nursery opened out of mr and mrs openshaws room in order that they might have the children more immediately under their own eyes early the next summer morning mrs openshaw was awakened by ailsies startled call of mother mother she sprang up put on her dressing gown and went to her child ailsie was only half awake and in a not uncommon state of terror who was he mother tell me who my darling no one is here you have been dreaming love waken up quite see it is broad daylight yes said ailsie looking round her then clinging to her mother said but a man was here in the night mother nonsense little goose no man has ever come near you yes he did he stood there just by norah a man with hair and a beard and he knelt down and said his prayers norah knows he was here mother half angrily as mrs openshaw shook her head in smiling incredulity well we will ask norah when she comes said mrs openshaw soothingly but we wont talk any more about him now it is not five oclock it is too early for you to get up shall i fetch you a book and read to you dont leave me mother said the child clinging to her so mrs openshaw sate on the bedside talking to ailsie and telling her of what they had done at richmond the evening before until the little girls eyes slowly closed and she once more fell asleep what was the matter asked mr openshaw as his wife returned to bed ailsie wakened up in a fright with some story of a man having been in the room to say his prayersa dream i suppose and no more was said at the time mrs openshaw had almost forgotten the whole affair when she got up about seven oclock but bye and bye she heard a sharp altercation going on in the nursery norah speaking angrily to ailsie a most unusual thing both mr and mrs openshaw listened in astonishment hold your tongue ailsie let me hear none of your dreams never let me hear you tell that story again ailsie began to cry mr openshaw opened the door of communication before his wife could say a word norah come here the nurse stood at the door defiant she perceived she had been heard but she was desperate dont let me hear you speak in that manner to ailsie again he said sternly and shut the door norah was infinitely relieved for she had dreaded some questioning and a little blame for sharp speaking was what she could well bear if cross examination was let alone down stairs they went mr openshaw carrying ailsie the sturdy edwin coming step by step right foot foremost always holding his mothers hand each child was placed in a chair by the breakfast table and then mr and mrs openshaw stood together at the window awaiting their visitors appearance and making plans for the day there was a pause suddenly mr openshaw turned to ailsie and said what a little goosy somebody is with her dreams waking up poor tired mother in the middle of the night with a story of a man being in the room father im sure i saw him said ailsie half crying i dont want to make norah angry but i was not asleep for all she says i was i had been asleepand i awakened up quite wide awake though i was so frightened i kept my eyes nearly shut and i saw the man quite plain a great brown man with a beard he said his prayers and then he looked at edwin and then norah took him by the arm and led him away after they had whispered a bit together now my little woman must be reasonable said mr openshaw who was always patient with ailsie there was no man in the house last night at all no man comes into the house as you know if you think much less goes up into the nursery but sometimes we dream something has happened and the dream is so like reality that you are not the first person little woman who has stood out that the thing has really happened but indeed it was not a dream said ailsie beginning to cry just then mr and mrs chadwick came down looking grave and discomposed all during breakfast time they were silent and uncomfortable as soon as the breakfast things were taken away and the children had been carried up stairs mr chadwick began in an evidently preconcerted manner to inquire if his nephew was certain that all his servants were honest for that mrs chadwick had that morning missed a very valuable brooch which she had worn the day before she remembered taking it off when she came home from buckingham palace mr openshaws face contracted into hard lines grew like what it was before he had known his wife and her child he rang the bell even before his uncle had done speaking it was answered by the housemaid mary was any one here last night while we were away a man sir came to speak to norah to speak to norah who was he how long did he stay im sure i cant tell sir he cameperhaps about nine i went up to tell norah in the nursery and she came down to speak to him she let him out sir she will know who he was and how long he stayed she waited a moment to be asked any more questions but she was not so she went away a minute afterwards openshaw made as though he were going out of the room but his wife laid her hand on his arm do not speak to her before the children she said in her low quiet voice i will go up and question her no i must speak to her you must know said he turning to his uncle and aunt my missus has an old servant as faithful as ever woman was i do believe as far as love goesbut at the same time who does not always speak truth as even the missus must allow now my notion is that this norah of ours has been come over by some good for nothin chap for shes at the time o life when they say women pray for husbandsany good lord any and has let him into our house and the chap has made off with your brooch and mappen many another thing beside its only saying that norah is soft hearted and does not stick at a white liethats all missus it was curious to notice how his tone his eyes his whole face changed as he spoke to his wife but he was the resolute man through all she knew better than to oppose him so she went up stairs and told norah her master wanted to speak to her and that she would take care of the children in the meanwhile norah rose to go without a word her thoughts were these if they tear me to pieces they shall never know through me he may comeand then just lord have mercy upon us all for some of us are dead folk to a certainty but he shall do it not me you may fancy now her look of determination as she faced her master alone in the dining room mr and mrs chadwick having left the affair in their nephews hands seeing that he took it up with such vehemence norah who was that man that came to my house last night man sir as if infinitely surprised but it was only to gain time yes the man whom mary let in whom she went up stairs to the nursery to tell you about whom you came down to speak to the same chap i make no doubt whom you took into the nursery to have your talk out with whom ailsie saw and afterwards dreamed about thinking poor wench she saw him say his prayers when nothing ill be bound was farther from his thoughts who took mrs chadwicks brooch value ten pounds now norah dont go off i am as sure as that my names thomas openshaw that you knew nothing of this robbery but i do think youve been imposed on and thats the truth some good for nothing chap has been making up to you and youve been just like all other women and have turned a soft place in your heart to him and he came last night a lovyering and you had him up in the nursery and he made use of his opportunities and made off with a few things on his way down come now norah its no blame to you only you must not be such a fool again tell us he continued what name he gave you norah ill be bound it was not the right one but it will be a clue for the police norah drew herself up you may ask that question and taunt me with my being single and with my credulity as you will master openshaw youll get no answer from me as for the brooch and the story of theft and burglary if any friend ever came to see me which i defy you to prove and deny hed be just as much above doing such a thing as you yourself mr openshaw and more so too for im not at all sure as everything you have is rightly come by or would be yours long if every man had his own she meant of course his wife but he understood her to refer to his property in goods and chattels now my good woman said he ill just tell you truly i never trusted you out and out but my wife liked you and i thought you had many a good point about you if you once begin to sauce me ill have the police to you and get out the truth in a court of justice if youll not tell it me quietly and civilly here now the best thing you can do is quietly to tell me who the fellow is look here a man comes to my house asks for you you take him up stairs a valuable brooch is missing next day we know that you and mary and cook are honest but you refuse to tell us who the man is indeed youve told one lie already about him saying no one was here last night now i just put it to you what do you think a policeman would say to this or a magistrate a magistrate would soon make you tell the truth my good woman theres never the creature born that should get it out of me said norah not unless i choose to tell ive a great mind to see said mr openshaw growing angry at the defiance then checking himself he thought before he spoke again norah for your missuss sake i dont want to go to extremities be a sensible woman if you can its no great disgrace after all to have been taken in i ask you once moreas a friendwho was this man whom you let into my house last night no answer he repeated the question in an impatient tone still no answer norahs lips were set in determination not to speak then there is but one thing to be done i shall send for a policeman you will not said norah starting forwards you shall not sir no policeman shall touch me i know nothing of the brooch but i know this ever since i was four and twenty i have thought more of your wife than of myself ever since i saw her a poor motherless girl put upon in her uncles house i have thought more of serving her than of serving myself i have cared for her and her child as nobody ever cared for me i dont cast blame on you sir but i say its ill giving up ones life to any one for at the end they will turn round upon you and forsake you why does not my missus come herself to suspect me maybe she is gone for the police but i dont stay here either for police or magistrate or master youre an unlucky lot i believe theres a curse on you ill leave you this very day yes i leave that poor ailsie too i will no good will ever come to you mr openshaw was utterly astonished at this speech most of which was completely unintelligible to him as may easily be supposed before he could make up his mind what to say or what to do norah had left the room i do not think he had ever really intended to send for the police to this old servant of his wifes for he had never for a moment doubted her perfect honesty but he had intended to compel her to tell him who the man was and in this he was baffled he was consequently much irritated he returned to his uncle and aunt in a state of great annoyance and perplexity and told them he could get nothing out of the woman that some man had been in the house the night before but that she refused to tell who he was at this moment his wife came in greatly agitated and asked what had happened to norah for that she had put on her things in passionate haste and had left the house this looks suspicious said mr chadwick it is not the way in which an honest person would have acted mr openshaw kept silence he was sorely perplexed but mrs openshaw turned round on mr chadwick with a sudden fierceness no one ever saw in her before you dont know norah uncle she is gone because she is deeply hurt at being suspected o i wish i had seen herthat i had spoken to her myself she would have told me anything alice wrung her hands i must confess continued mr chadwick to his nephew in a lower voice i cant make you out you used to be a word and a blow and oftenest the blow first and now when there is every cause for suspicion you just do nought your missus is a very good woman i grant but she may have been put upon as well as other folk i suppose if you dont send for the police i shall very well replied mr openshaw surlily i cant clear norah she wont clear herself as i believe she might if she would only i wash my hands of it for i am sure the woman herself is honest and shes lived a long time with my wife and i dont like her to come to shame but she will then be forced to clear herself that at any rate will be a good thing very well very well i am heart sick of the whole business come alice come up to the babies theyll be in a sore way i tell you uncle he said turning round once more to mr chadwick suddenly and sharply after his eye had fallen on alices wan tearful anxious face ill have none sending for the police after all ill buy my aunt twice as handsome a brooch this very day but ill not have norah suspected and my missus plagued theres for you he and his wife left the room mr chadwick quietly waited till he was out of hearing and then aid to his wife for all toms heroics im just quietly going for a detective wench thou needst know nought about it he went to the police station and made a statement of the case he was gratified by the impression which the evidence against norah seemed to make the men all agreed in his opinion and steps were to be immediately taken to find out where she was most probably as they suggested she had gone at once to the man who to all appearance was her lover when mr chadwick asked how they would find her out they smiled shook their heads and spoke of mysterious but infallible ways and means he returned to his nephews house with a very comfortable opinion of his own sagacity he was met by his wife with a penitent face o master ive found my brooch it was just sticking by its pin in the flounce of my brown silk that i wore yesterday i took it off in a hurry and it must have caught in it and i hung up my gown in the closet just now when i was going to fold it up there was the brooch im very vexed but i never dreamt but what it was lost her husband muttering something very like confound thee and thy brooch too i wish id never given it thee snatched up his hat and rushed back to the station hoping to be in time to stop the police from searching for norah but a detective was already gone off on the errand where was norah half mad with the strain of the fearful secret she had hardly slept through the night for thinking what must be done upon this terrible state of mind had come ailsies questions showing that she had seen the man as the unconscious child called her father lastly came the suspicion of her honesty she was little less than crazy as she ran up stairs and dashed on her bonnet and shawl leaving all else even her purse behind her in that house she would not stay that was all she knew or was clear about she would not even see the children again for fear it should weaken her she feared above everything mr franks return to claim his wife she could not tell what remedy there was for a sorrow so tremendous for her to stay to witness the desire of escaping from the coming event was a stronger motive for her departure than her soreness about the suspicions directed against her although this last had been the final goad to the course she took she walked away almost at headlong speed sobbing as she went as she had not dared to do during the past night for fear of exciting wonder in those who might hear her then she stopped an idea came into her mind that she would leave london altogether and betake herself to her native town of liverpool she felt in her pocket for her purse as she drew near the euston square station with this intention she had left it at home her poor head aching her eyes swollen with crying she had to stand still and think as well as she could where next she should bend her steps suddenly the thought flashed into her mind that she would go and find out poor mr frank she had been hardly kind to him the night before though her heart had bled for him ever since she remembered his telling her as she inquired for his address almost as she had pushed him out of the door of some hotel in a street not far distant from euston square thither she went with what intention she hardly knew but to assuage her conscience by telling him how much she pitied him in her present state she felt herself unfit to counsel or restrain or assist or do ought else but sympathise and weep the people of the inn said such a person had been there had arrived only the day before had gone out soon after his arrival leaving his luggage in their care but had never come back norah asked for leave to sit down and await the gentlemans return the landladypretty secure in the deposit of luggage against any probable injuryshowed her into a room and quietly locked the door on the outside norah was utterly worn out and fell asleepa shivering starting uneasy slumber which lasted for hours the detective meanwhile had come up with her some time before she entered the hotel into which he followed her asking the landlady to detain her for an hour or so without giving any reason beyond showing his authority which made the landlady applaud herself a good deal for having locked her in he went back to the police station to report his proceedings he could have taken her directly but his object was if possible to trace out the man who was supposed to have committed the robbery then he heard of the discovery of the brooch and consequently did not care to return norah slept till even the summer evening began to close in then up some one was at the door it would be mr frank and she dizzily pushed back her ruffled grey hair which had fallen over her eyes and stood looking to see him instead there came in mr openshaw and a policeman this is norah kennedy said mr openshaw o sir said norah i did not touch the brooch indeed i did not o sir i cannot live to be thought so badly of and very sick and faint she suddenly sank down on the ground to her surprise mr openshaw raised her up very tenderly even the policeman helped to lay her on the sofa and at mr openshaws desire he went for some wine and sandwiches for the poor gaunt woman lay there almost as if dead with weariness and exhaustion norah said mr openshaw in his kindest voice the brooch is found it was hanging to mrs chadwicks gown i beg your pardon most truly i beg your pardon for having troubled you about it my wife is almost broken hearted eat norahor stay first drink this glass of wine said he lifting her head pouring a little down her throat as she drank she remembered where she was and who she was waiting for she suddenly pushed mr openshaw away saying o sir you must go you must not stop a minute if he comes back he will kill you alas norah i do not know who he is but some one is gone away who will never come back someone who knew you and whom i am afraid you cared for i dont understand you sir said norah her masters kind and sorrowful manner bewildering her yet more than his words the policeman had left the room at mr openshaws desire and they two were alone you know what i mean when i say some one is gone who will never come back i mean that he is dead who said norah trembling all over a poor man has been found in the thames this morning drowned did he drown himself asked norah solemnly god only knows replied mr openshaw in the same tone your name and address at our house were found in his pocket that and his purse were the only things that were found upon him i am sorry to say it my poor norah but you are required to go and identify him to what asked norah to say who it is it is always done in order that some reason may be discovered for the suicideif suicide it was i make no doubt he was the man who came to see you at our house last night it is very sad i know he made pauses between each little clause in order to try and bring back her senses which he feared were wanderingso wild and sad was her look master openshaw said she at last ive a dreadful secret to tell youonly you must never breathe it to any one and you and i must hide it away for ever i thought to have done it all by myself but i see i cannot yon poor manyes the dead drowned creature is i fear mr frank my mistresss first husband mr openshaw sate down as if shot he did not speak but after a while he signed to norah to go on he came to me the other nightwhengod be thankedyou were all away at richmond he asked me if his wife was dead or alive i was a brute and thought more of our all coming home than of his sore trial spoke out sharp and said she was married again and very content and happy i all but turned him away and now he lies dead and cold god forgive me said mr openshaw god forgive us all said norah yon poor man needs forgiveness perhaps less than any one among us he had been among the savagesshipwreckedi know not whatand he had written letters which had never reached my poor missus he saw his child he saw heryes i took him up to give his thoughts another start for i believed he was going mad on my hands i came to seek him here as i more than half promised my mind misgave me when i heard he had never come in o sir i it must be him mr openshaw rang the bell norah was almost too much stunned to wonder at what he did he asked for writing materials wrote a letter and then said to norah i am writing to alice to say i shall be unavoidably absent for a few days that i have found you that you are well and send her your love and will come home to morrow you must go with me to the police court you must identify the body i will pay high to keep name and details out of the papers but where are you going sir he did not answer her directly then he said norah i must go with you and look on the face of the man whom i have so injuredunwittingly it is true but it seems to me as if i had killed him i will lay his head in the grave as if he were my only brother and how he must have hated me i cannot go home to my wife till all that i can do for him is done then i go with a dreadful secret on my mind i shall never speak of it again after these days are over i know you will not either he shook hands with her and they never named the subject again the one to the other norah went home to alice the next day not a word was said on the cause of her abrupt departure a day or two before alice had been charged by her husband in his letter not to allude to the supposed theft of the brooch so she implicitly obedient to those whom she loved both by nature and habit was entirely silent on the subject only treated norah with the most tender respect as if to make up for unjust suspicion nor did alice inquire into the reason why mr openshaw had been absent during his uncle and aunts visit after he had once said that it was unavoidable he came back grave and quiet and from that time forth was curiously changed more thoughtful and perhaps less active quite as decided in conduct but with new and different rules for the guidance of that conduct towards alice he could hardly be more kind than he had always been but he now seemed to look upon her as some one sacred and to be treated with reverence as well as tenderness he throve in business and made a large fortune one half of which was settled upon her long years after these eventsa few months after her mother died ailsie and her father as she always called mr openshaw drove to a cemetery a little way out of town and she was carried to a certain mound by her maid who was then sent back to the carriage there was a head stone with f w and a date that was all sitting by the grave mr openshaw told her the story and for the sad fate of that poor father whom she had never seen he shed the only tears she ever saw fall from his eyes a most interesting story all through i said as jarber folded up the first of his series of discoveries in triumph a story that goes straight to the heartespecially at the end buti stopped and looked at trottle trottle entered his protest directly in the shape of a cough well i said beginning to lose my patience dont you see that i want you to speak and that i dont want you to cough quite so maam said trottle in a state of respectful obstinacy which would have upset the temper of a saint relative i presume to this story maam yes yes said jarber by all means let us hear what this good man has to say well sir answered trottle i want to know why the house over the way doesnt let and i dont exactly see how your story answers the question thats all i have to say sir i should have liked to contradict my opinionated servant at that moment but excellent as the story was in itself i felt that he had hit on the weak point so far as jarbers particular purpose in reading it was concerned and that is what you have to say is it repeated jarber i enter this room announcing that i have a series of discoveries and you jump instantly to the conclusion that the first of the series exhausts my resources have i your permission dear lady to enlighten this obtuse person if possible by reading number two my work is behindhand maam said trottle moving to the door the moment i gave jarber leave to go on stop where you are i said in my most peremptory manner and give mr jarber his fair opportunity of answering your objection now you have made it trottle sat down with the look of a martyr and jarber began to read with his back turned on the enemy more decidedly than ever going into society at one period of its reverses the house fell into the occupation of a showman he was found registered as its occupier on the parish books of the time when he rented the house and there was therefore no need of any clue to his name but he himself was less easy to be found for he had led a wandering life and settled people had lost sight of him and people who plumed themselves on being respectable were shy of admitting that they had ever known anything of him at last among the marsh lands near the rivers level that lie about deptford and the neighbouring market gardens a grizzled personage in velveteen with a face so cut up by varieties of weather that he looked as if he had been tattooed was found smoking a pipe at the door of a wooden house on wheels the wooden house was laid up in ordinary for the winter near the mouth of a muddy creek and everything near it the foggy river the misty marshes and the steaming market gardens smoked in company with the grizzled man in the midst of this smoking party the funnel chimney of the wooden house on wheels was not remiss but took its pipe with the rest in a companionable manner on being asked if it were he who had once rented the house to let grizzled velveteen looked surprised and said yes then his name was magsman that was it toby magsmanwhich lawfully christened robert but called in the line from a infant toby there was nothing agin toby magsman he believed if there was suspicion of suchmention it there was no suspicion of such he might rest assured but some inquiries were making about that house and would he object to say why he left it not at all why should he he left it along of a dwarf along of a dwarf mr magsman repeated deliberately and emphatically along of a dwarf might it be compatible with mr magsmans inclination and convenience to enter as a favour into a few particulars mr magsman entered into the following particulars it was a long time ago to begin withafore lotteries and a deal more was done away with mr magsman was looking about for a good pitch and he see that house and he says to himself ill have you if youre to be had if moneyll get you ill have you the neighbours cut up rough and made complaints but mr magsman dont know what they would have had it was a lovely thing first of all there was the canvass representin the picter of the giant in spanish trunks and a ruff who was himself half the heighth of the house and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole on the roof so that his ed was coeval with the parapet then there was the canvass representin the picter of the albina lady showing her white air to the army and navy in correct uniform then there was the canvass representin the picter of the wild indian a scalpin a member of some foreign nation then there was the canvass representin the picter of a child of a british planter seized by two boa constrictorsnot that we never had no child nor no constrictors neither similarly there was the canvass representin the picter of the wild ass of the prairiesnot that we never had no wild asses nor wouldnt have had em at a gift last there was the canvass representin the picter of the dwarf and like him too considerin with george the fourth in such a state of astonishment at him as his majesty couldnt with his utmost politeness and stoutness express the front of the house was so covered with canvasses that there wasnt a spark of daylight ever visible on that side magsmans amusements fifteen foot long by two foot high ran over the front door and parlour winders the passage was a arbour of green baize and gardenstuff a barrel organ performed there unceasing and as to respectabilityif threepence aint respectable what is but the dwarf is the principal article at present and he was worth the money he was wrote up as major tpschoffki of the imperial bulgraderian brigade nobody couldnt pronounce the name and it never was intended anybody should the public always turned it as a regular rule into chopski in the line he was called chops partly on that account and partly because his real name if he ever had any real name which was very dubious was stakes he was a uncommon small man he really was certainly not so small as he was made out to be but where is your dwarf as is he was a most uncommon small man with a most uncommon large ed and what he had inside that ed nobody ever knowed but himself even supposin himself to have ever took stock of it which it would have been a stiff job for even him to do the kindest little man as never growed spirited but not proud when he travelled with the spotted babythough he knowed himself to be a natral dwarf and knowed the babys spots to be put upon him artificial he nursed that baby like a mother you never heerd him give a ill name to a giant he did allow himself to break out into strong language respectin the fat lady from norfolk but that was an affair of the art and when a mans art has been trifled with by a lady and the preference giv to a indian he aint master of his actions he was always in love of course every human natral phenomenon is and he was always in love with a large woman i never knowed the dwarf as could be got to love a small one which helps to keep em the curiosities they are one singler idea he had in that ed of his which must have meant something or it wouldnt have been there it was always his opinion that he was entitled to property he never would put his name to anything he had been taught to write by the young man without arms who got his living with his toes quite a writing master he was and taught scores in the line but chops would have starved to death afore hed have gained a bit of bread by putting his hand to a paper this is the more curious to bear in mind because he had no property nor hope of property except his house and a sarser when i say his house i mean the box painted and got up outside like a reglar six roomer that he used to creep into with a diamond ring or quite as good to look at on his forefinger and ring a little bell out of what the public believed to be the drawing room winder and when i say a sarser i mean a chaney sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end of every entertainment his cue for that he took from me ladies and gentlemen the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain when he said anything important in private life he mostly wound it up with this form of words and they was generally the last thing he said to me at night afore he went to bed he had what i consider a fine minda poetic mind his ideas respectin his property never come upon him so strong as when he sat upon a barrel organ and had the handle turned arter the wibration had run through him a little time he would screech out toby i feel my property cominggrind away im counting my guineas by thousands tobygrind away toby i shall be a man of fortun i feel the mint a jingling in me toby and im swelling out into the bank of england such is the influence of music on a poetic mind not that he was partial to any other music but a barrel organ on the contrary hated it he had a kind of a everlasting grudge agin the public which is a thing you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of it what riled him most in the nater of his occupation was that it kep him out of society he was continiwally saying toby my ambition is to go into society the curse of my position towards the public is that it keeps me hout of society this dont signify to a low beast of a indian he ant formed for society this dont signify to a spotted baby he ant formed for societyi am nobody never could make out what chops done with his money he had a good salary down on the drum every saturday as the day came round besides having the run of his teethand he was a woodpecker to eatbut all dwarfs are the sarser was a little income bringing him in so many halfpence that hed carry em for a week together tied up in a pocket handkercher and yet he never had money and it couldnt be the fat lady from norfolk as was once supposed because it stands to reason that when you have a animosity towards a indian which makes you grind your teeth at him to his face and which can hardly hold you from goosing him audible when hes going through his war danceit stands to reason you wouldnt under them circumstances deprive yourself to support that indian in the lap of luxury most unexpected the mystery come out one day at egham races the public was shy of bein pulled in and chops was ringin his little bell out of his drawing room winder and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as he kneeled down with his legs out at the back doorfor he couldnt be shoved into his house without kneeling down and the premises wouldnt accommodate his legswas snarlin heres a precious public for you why the devil dont they tumble up when a man in the crowd holds up a carrier pigeon and cries out if theres any person here as has got a ticket the lotterys just drawed and the number as has come up for the great prize is three seven forty two three seven forty two i was givin the man to the furies myself for calling off the publics attentionfor the public will turn away at any time to look at anything in preference to the thing showed em and if you doubt it get em together for any indiwidual purpose on the face of the earth and send only two people in late and see if the whole company ant far more interested in takin particular notice of them two than of youi say i wasnt best pleased with the man for callin out and wasnt blessin him in my own mind when i see chopss little bell fly out of winder at a old lady and he gets up and kicks his box over exposin the whole secret and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me carry me into the wan toby and throw a pail of water over me or im a dead man for ive come into my property twelve thousand odd hundred pound was chopss winnins he had bought a half ticket for the twenty five thousand prize and it had come up the first use he made of his property was to offer to fight the wild indian for five hundred pound a side him with a poisoned darnin needle and the indian with a club but the indian being in want of backers to that amount it went no further arter he had been mad for a weekin a state of mind in short in which if i had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes i believe he would have bustbut we kep the organ from himmr chops come round and behaved liberal and beautiful to all he then sent for a young man he knowed as had a wery genteel appearance and was a bonnet at a gaming booth most respectable brought up father havin been imminent in the livery stable line but unfortnate in a commercial crisis through paintin a old gray ginger bay and sellin him with a pedigree and mr chops said to this bonnet who said his name was normandy which it wasnt normandy im a goin into society will you go with me says normandy do i understand you mr chops to hintimate that the ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself correct says mr chops and you shall have a princely allowance too the bonnet lifted mr chops upon a chair to shake hands with him and replied in poetry with his eyes seemingly full of tears my boat is on the shore and my bark is on the sea and i do not ask for more but ill goalong with thee they went into society in a chay and four grays with silk jackets they took lodgings in pall mall london and they blazed away in consequence of a note that was brought to bartlemy fair in the autumn of next year by a servant most wonderful got up in milk white cords and tops i cleaned myself and went to pall mall one evening appinted the gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner and mr chopss eyes was more fixed in that ed of his than i thought good for him there was three of em in company i mean and i knowed the third well when last met he had on a white roman shirt and a bishops mitre covered with leopard skin and played the clarionet all wrong in a band at a wild beast show this gent took on not to know me and mr chops said gentlemen this is a old friend of former days and normandy looked at me through a eye glass and said magsman glad to see youwhich ill take my oath he wasnt mr chops to git him convenient to the table had his chair on a throne much of the form of george the fourths in the canvass but he hardly appeared to me to be king there in any other pint of view for his two gentlemen ordered about like emperors they was all dressed like may daygorgeousand as to wine they swam in all sorts i made the round of the bottles first separate to say i had done it and then mixed em all together to say i had done it and then tried two of em as half and half and then tother two altogether i passed a pleasin evenin but with a tendency to feel muddled until i considered it good manners to get up and say mr chops the best of friends must part i thank you for the wariety of foreign drains you have stood so ansome i looks towards you in red wine and i takes my leave mr chops replied if youll just hitch me out of this over your right arm magsman and carry me down stairs ill see you out i said i couldnt think of such a thing but he would have it so i lifted him off his throne he smelt strong of maideary and i couldnt help thinking as i carried him down that it was like carrying a large bottle full of wine with a rayther ugly stopper a good deal out of proportion when i set him on the door mat in the hall he kep me close to him by holding on to my coat collar and he whispers i aint appy magsman whats on your mind mr chops they dont use me well they ant grateful to me they puts me on the mantel piece when i wont have in more champagne wine and they locks me in the sideboard when i wont give up my property get rid of em mr chops i cant were in society together and what would society say come out of society says i i cant you dont know what youre talking about when you have once gone into society you mustnt come out of it then if youll excuse the freedom mr chops were my remark shaking my head grave i think its a pity you ever went in mr chops shook that deep ed of his to a surprisin extent and slapped it half a dozen times with his hand and with more wice than i thought were in him then he says youre a good fellow but you dont understand good night go along magsman the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain the last i see of him on that occasion was his tryin on the extremest werge of insensibility to climb up the stairs one by one with his hands and knees theyd have been much too steep for him if he had been sober but he wouldnt be helped it warnt long after that that i read in the newspaper of mr chopss being presented at court it was printed it will be recollectedand ive noticed in my life that it is sure to be printed that it will be recollected whenever it wontthat mr chops is the individual of small stature whose brilliant success in the last state lottery attracted so much attention well i says to myself such is life he has been and done it in earnest at last he has astonished george the fourth on account of which i had that canvass new painted him with a bag of money in his hand a presentin it to george the fourth and a lady in ostrich feathers fallin in love with him in a bag wig sword and buckles correct i took the house as is the subject of present inquiriesthough not the honour of bein acquaintedand i run magsmans amusements in it thirteen monthssometimes one thing sometimes another sometimes nothin particular but always all the canvasses outside one night when we had played the last company out which was a shy company through its raining heavens hard i was takin a pipe in the one pair back along with the young man with the toes which i had taken on for a month though he never drawedexcept on paper and i heard a kickin at the street door halloa i says to the young man whats up he rubs his eyebrows with his toes and he says i cant imagine mr magsmanwhich he never could imagine nothin and was monotonous company the noise not leavin off i laid down my pipe and i took up a candle and i went down and opened the door i looked out into the street but nothin could i see and nothin was i aware of until i turned round quick because some creetur run between my legs into the passage there was mr chops magsman he says take me on the old terms and youve got me if its done say done i was all of a maze but i said done sir done to your done and double done says he have you got a bit of supper in the house bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as wed guzzled away at in pall mall i was ashamed to offer him cold sassages and gin and water but he took em both and took em free havin a chair for his table and sittin down at it on a stool like hold times i all of a maze all the while it was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages beef and to the best of my calculations two pound and a quarter that the wisdom as was in that little man began to come out of him like prespiration magsman he says look upon me you see afore you one as has both gone into society and come out o you are out of it mr chops how did you get out sir sold out says he you never saw the like of the wisdom as his ed expressed when he made use of them two words my friend magsman ill impart to you a discovery ive made its wallable its cost twelve thousand five hundred pound it may do you good in lifethe secret of this matter is that it aint so much that a person goes into society as that society goes into a person not exactly keepin up with his meanin i shook my head put on a deep look and said youre right there mr chops magsman he says twitchin me by the leg society has gone into me to the tune of every penny of my property i felt that i went pale and though natrally a bold speaker i couldnt hardly say wheres normandy bolted with the plate said mr chops and tother one meaning him as formerly wore the bishops mitre bolted with the jewels said mr chops i sat down and looked at him and he stood up and looked at me magsman he says and he seemed to myself to get wiser as he got hoarser society taken in the lump is all dwarfs at the court of st jamess they was all a doing my old businessall a goin three times round the cairawan in the hold court suits and properties elsewheres they was most of em ringin their little bells out of make believes everywheres the sarser was a goin round magsman the sarser is the uniwersal institution i perceived you understand that he was soured by his misfortunes and i felt for mr chops as to fat ladies he says giving his head a tremendious one agin the wall theres lots of them in society and worse than the original hers was a outrage upon tastesimply a outrage upon tasteawakenin contemptcarryin its own punishment in the form of a indian here he giv himself another tremendious one but theirs magsman theirs is mercenary outrages lay in cashmeer shawls buy bracelets strew em and a lot of andsome fans and things about your rooms let it be known that you give away like water to all as come to admire and the fat ladies that dont exhibit for so much down upon the drum will come from all the pints of the compass to flock about you whatever you are theyll drill holes in your art magsman like a cullender and when youve no more left to give theyll laugh at you to your face and leave you to have your bones picked dry by wulturs like the dead wild ass of the prairies that you deserve to be here he giv himself the most tremendious one of all and dropped i thought he was gone his ed was so heavy and he knocked it so hard and he fell so stoney and the sassagerial disturbance in him must have been so immense that i thought he was gone but he soon come round with care and he sat up on the floor and he said to me with wisdom comin out of his eyes if ever it come magsman the most material difference between the two states of existence through which your unhappy friend has passed he reached out his poor little hand and his tears dropped down on the moustachio which it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow but it is not in mortals to command successthe difference this when i was out of society i was paid light for being seen when i went into society i paid heavy for being seen i prefer the former even if i wasnt forced upon it give me out through the trumpet in the hold way to morrow arter that he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been iled all over but the organ was kep from him and no allusions was ever made when a company was in to his property he got wiser every day his views of society and the public was luminous bewilderin awful and his ed got bigger and bigger as his wisdom expanded it he took well and pulled em in most excellent for nine weeks at the expiration of that period when his ed was a sight he expressed one evenin the last company havin been turned out and the door shut a wish to have a little music mr chops i said i never dropped the mr with him the world might do it but not me mr chops are you sure as you are in a state of mind and body to sit upon the organ his answer was this toby when next met with on the tramp i forgive her and the indian and i am it was with fear and trembling that i began to turn the handle but he sat like a lamb i will be my belief to my dying day that i see his ed expand as he sat you may therefore judge how great his thoughts was he sat out all the changes and then he come off toby he says with a quiet smile the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain when we called him in the morning we found him gone into a much better society than mine or pall malls i giv mr chops as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power followed myself as chief and had the george the fourth canvass carried first in the form of a banner but the house was so dismal arterwards that i giv it up and took to the wan again i dont triumph said jarber folding up the second manuscript and looking hard at trottle i dont triumph over this worthy creature i merely ask him if he is satisfied now how can he be anything else i said answering for trottle who sat obstinately silent this time jarber you have not only read us a delightfully amusing story but you have also answered the question about the house of course it stands empty now who would think of taking it after it had been turned into a caravan i looked at trottle as i said those last words and jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same direction let this excellent person speak said jarber you were about to say my good man i only wished to ask sir said trottle doggedly if you could kindly oblige me with a date or two in connection with that last story a date repeated jarber what does the man want with dates i should be glad to know with great respect persisted trottle if the person named magsman was the last tenant who lived in the house its my opinionif i may be excused for giving itthat he most decidedly was not with those words trottle made a low bow and quietly left the room there is no denying that jarber when we were left together looked sadly discomposed he had evidently forgotten to inquire about dates and in spite of his magnificent talk about his series of discoveries it was quite as plain that the two stories he had just read had really and truly exhausted his present stock i thought myself bound in common gratitude to help him out of his embarrassment by a timely suggestion so i proposed that he should come to tea again on the next monday evening the thirteenth and should make such inquiries in the meantime as might enable him to dispose triumphantly of trottles objection he gallantly kissed my hand made a neat little speech of acknowledgment and took his leave for the rest of the week i would not encourage trottle by allowing him to refer to the house at all i suspected he was making his own inquiries about dates but i put no questions to him on monday evening the thirteenth that dear unfortunate jarber came punctual to the appointed time he looked so terribly harassed that he was really quite a spectacle of feebleness and fatigue i saw at a glance that the question of dates had gone against him that mr magsman had not been the last tenant of the house and that the reason of its emptiness was still to seek what i have gone through said jarber words are not eloquent enough to tell o sophonisba i have begun another series of discoveries accept the last two as stories laid on your shrine and wait to blame me for leaving your curiosity unappeased until you have heard number three number three looked like a very short manuscript and i said as much jarber explained to me that we were to have some poetry this time in the course of his investigations he had stepped into the circulating library to seek for information on the one important subject all the library people knew about the house was that a female relative of the last tenant as they believed had just after that tenant left sent a little manuscript poem to them which she described as referring to events that had actually passed in the house and which she wanted the proprietor of the library to publish she had written no address on her letter and the proprietor had kept the manuscript ready to be given back to her the publishing of poems not being in his line when she might call for it she had never called for it and the poem had been lent to jarber at his express request to read to me before he began i rang the bell for trottle being determined to have him present at the new reading as a wholesome check on his obstinacy to my surprise peggy answered the bell and told me that trottle had stepped out without saying where i instantly felt the strongest possible conviction that he was at his old tricks and that his stepping out in the evening without leave meantphilandering controlling myself on my visitors account i dismissed peggy stifled my indignation and prepared as politely as might be to listen to jarber three evenings in the house number one i yes it lookd dark and dreary that long and narrow street only the sound of the rain and the tramp of passing feet the duller glow of the fire and gathering mists of night to mark how slow and weary the long days cheerless flight ii watching the sullen fire hearing the dreary rain drop after drop run down on the darkening window pane chill was the heart of bertha chill as that winter day for the star of her life had risen only to fade away iii the voice that had been so strong to bid the snare depart the true and earnest will and the calm and steadfast heart were now weighd down by sorrow were quivering now with pain the clear path now seemd clouded and all her grief in vain iv duty right truth who promised to help and save their own seemd spreading wide their pinions to leave her there alone so turning from the present to well known days of yore she calld on them to strengthen and guard her soul once more v she thought how in her girlhood her life was given away the solemn promise spoken she kept so well to day how to her brother herbert she had been help and guide and how his artist nature on her calm strength relied vi how through lifes fret and turmoil the passion and fire of art in him was soothed and quickend by her true sister heart how future hopes had always been for his sake alone and now what strange new feeling possessd her as its own vii her home each flower that breathed there the winds sigh soft and low each trembling spray of ivy the rivers murmuring flow the shadow of the forest sunset or twilight dim dear as they were were dearer by leaving them for him viii and each year as it found her in the dull feverish town saw self still more forgotten and selfish care kept down by the calm joy of evening that brought him to her side to warn him with wise counsel or praise with tender pride ix her heart her life her future her genius only meant another thing to give him and be therewith content to day what words had stirrd her her soul could not forget what dream had filld her spirit with strange and wild regret x to leave him for another could it indeed be so could it have cost such anguish to bid this vision go was this her faith was herbert the second in her heart did it need all this struggle to bid a dream depart xi and yet within her spirit a far off land was seen a home which might have held her a love which might have been and life not the mere being of daily ebb and flow but life itself had claimd her and she had let it go xii within her heart there echod again the well known tune that promised this bright future and askd her for its own then words of sorrow broken by half reproachful pain and then a farewell spoken in words of cold disdain xiii where now was the stern purpose that nerved her soul so long whence came the words she utterd so hard so cold so strong what right had she to banish a hope that god had given why must she choose earths portion and turn aside from heaven xiv to day was it this morning if this long fearful strife was but the work of hours what would be years of life why did a cruel heaven for such great suffering call and whyo still more cruel must her own words do all xv did she repent o sorrow why do we linger still to take thy loving message and do thy gentle will see her tears fall more slowly the passionate murmurs cease and back upon her spirit flow strength and love and peace xvi the fire burns more brightly the rain has passed away herbert will see no shadow upon his home to day only that bertha greets him with doubly tender care kissing a fonder blessing down on his golden hair number two i the studio is deserted palette and brush laid by the sketch rests on the easel the paint is scarcely dry and silencewho seems always within her depths to bear the next sound that will utter now holds a dumb despair ii so bertha feels it listening with breathless stony fear waiting the dreadful summons each minute brings more near when the young life now ebbing shall fail and pass away into that mighty shadow who shrouds the house to day iii but whywhen the sick chamber is on the upper floor why dares not bertha enter within the close shut door if heher allher brother lies dying in that gloom what strange mysterious power has sent her from the room iv it is not one weeks anguish that can have changed her so joy has not died here lately struck down by one quick blow but cruel months have needed their long relentless chain to teach that shrinking manner of helpless hopeless pain v the struggle was scarce over last christmas eve had brought the fibres still were quivering of the one wounded thought when herbertwho unconscious had guessed no inward strife bade her in pride and pleasure welcome his fair young wife vi bade her rejoice and smiling although his eyes were dim thankd god he thus could pay her the care she gave to him this fresh bright life would bring her a new and joyous fate o bertha check the murmur that cries too late too late vii too late could she have known it a few short weeks before that his life was completed and needing hers no more she mighto sad repining what might have been forget it was not should suffice us to stifle vain regret viii he needed her no longer each day it grew more plain first with a startled wonder then with a wondering pain love why his wife best gave it comfort durst bertha speak counsel when quick resentment flushd on the young wifes cheek ix no more long talks by firelight of childish times long past and dreams of future greatness which he must reach at last dreams where her purer instinct with truth unerring told where was the worthless gilding and where refind gold x slowly but surely ever doras poor jealous pride which she calld love for herbert drove bertha from his side and spite of nervous effort to share their alterd life she felt a check to herbert a burden to his wife xi this was the least for bertha feard dreaded knew at length how much his nature owed her of truth and power and strength and watchd the daily failing of all his nobler part low aims weak purpose telling in lower weaker art xii and now when he is dying the last words she could hear must not be hers but given the bride of one short year the last care is anothers the last prayer must not be the one they learnt together beside their mothers knee xiii summond at last she kisses the clay cold stiffening hand and reading pleading efforts to make her understand answers with solemn promise in clear but trembling tone to doras life henceforward she will devote her own xiv now all is over bertha dares not remain to weep but soothes the frightened dora into a sobbing sleep the poor weak child will need her o who can dare complain when god sends a new duty to comfort each new pain number three i the house is all deserted in the dim evening gloom only one figure passes slowly from room to room and pausing at each doorway seems gathering up again within her heart the relics of bygone joy and pain ii there is an earnest longing in those who onward gaze looking with weary patience towards the coming days there is a deeper longing more sad more strong more keen those know it who look backward and yearn for what has been iii at every hearth she pauses touches each well known chair gazes from every window lingers on every stair what have these months brought bertha now one more year is past this christmas eve shall tell us the third one and the last iv the wilful wayward dora in those first weeks of grief could seek and find in bertha strength soothing and relief and berthalast sad comfort true woman heart can take had something still to suffer and do for herberts sake v spring with her western breezes from indian islands bore to bertha news that leonard would seek his home once more what was itjoy or sorrow what were theyhopes or fears that flushd her cheeks with crimson and filld her eyes with tears vi he came and who so kindly could ask and hear her tell herberts last hours for leonard had known and loved him well daily he came and bertha poor wear heart at length weighd down by others weakness could rest upon his strength vii yet not the voice of leonard could her true care beguile that turnd to watch rejoicing doras reviving smile so from that little household the worst gloom passd away the one bright hour of evening lit up the livelong day viii days passed the golden summer in sudden heat bore down its blue bright glowing sweetness upon the scorching town and sights and sounds of country came in the warm soft tune sung by the honeyd breezes borne on the wings of june ix one twilight hour but earlier than usual bertha thought she knew the fresh sweet fragrance of flowers that leonard brought through opend doors and windows it stole up through the gloom and with appealing sweetness drew bertha from her room x yes he was there and pausing just near the opend door to check her hearts quick beating she heardand paused still more his low voice doras answers his pleadingyes she knew the tonethe wordsthe accents she once had heard them too xi would bertha blame her leonards low tender answer came bertha was far too noble to think or dream of blame and was he sure he loved her yes with the one love given once in a lifetime only with one soul and one heaven xii then came a plaintive murmur dora had once been told that he and bertha dearest bertha is far too cold to love and i my dora if once i fancied so it was a brief delusion and overlong ago xiii between the past and present on that bleak moments height she stood as some lost traveller by a quick flash of light seeing a gulf before him with dizzy sick despair reels to clutch backward but to find a deeper chasm there xiv the twilight grew still darker the fragrant flowers more sweet the stars shone out in heaven the lamps gleamd down the street and hours passd in dreaming over their new found fate ere they could think of wondering why bertha was so late xv she came and calmly listend in vain they strove to trace if herberts memory shadowd in grief upon her face no blame no wonder showd there no feeling could be told her voice was not less steady her manner not more cold xvi they could not hear the anguish that broke in words of pain through that calm summer midnight my herbertmine again yes they have once been parted but this day shall restore the long lost one she claims him my herbertmine once more xvii now christmas eve returning saw bertha stand beside the altar greeting dora again a smiling bride and now the gloomy evening sees bertha pale and worn leaving the house for ever to wander out forlorn xviii forlornnay not so anguish shall do its work at length her soul passd through the fire shall gain still purer strength somewhere there waits for bertha an earnest noble part and meanwhile god is with her god and her own true heart i could warmly and sincerely praise the little poem when jarber had done reading it but i could not say that it tended in any degree towards clearing up the mystery of the empty house whether it was the absence of the irritating influence of trottle or whether it was simply fatigue i cannot say but jarber did not strike me that evening as being in his usual spirits and though he declared that he was not in the least daunted by his want of success thus far and that he was resolutely determined to make more discoveries he spoke in a languid absent manner and shortly afterwards took his leave at rather an early hour when trottle came back and when i indignantly taxed him with philandering he not only denied the imputation but asserted that he had been employed on my service and in consideration of that boldly asked for leave of absence for two days and for a morning to himself afterwards to complete the business in which he solemnly declared that i was interested in remembrance of his long and faithful service to me i did violence to myself and granted his request and he on his side engaged to explain himself to my satisfaction in a weeks time on monday evening the twentieth a day or two before i sent to jarbers lodgings to ask him to drop in to tea his landlady sent back an apology for him that made my hair stand on end his feet were in hot water his head was in a flannel petticoat a green shade was over his eyes the rheumatism was in his legs and a mustard poultice was on his chest he was also a little feverish and rather distracted in his mind about manchester marriages a dwarf and three evenings or evening partieshis landlady was not sure whichin an empty house with the water rate unpaid under these distressing circumstances i was necessarily left alone with trottle his promised explanation began like jarbers discoveries with the reading of a written paper the only difference was that trottle introduced his manuscript under the name of a report trottles report the curious events related in these pages would many of them most likely never have happened if a person named trottle had not presumed contrary to his usual custom to think for himself the subject on which the person in question had ventured for the first time in his life to form an opinion purely and entirely his own was one which had already excited the interest of his respected mistress in a very extraordinary degree or to put it in plainer terms still the subject was no other than the mystery of the empty house feeling no sort of objection to set a success of his own if possible side by side with a failure of mr jarbers trottle made up his mind one monday evening to try what he could do on his own account towards clearing up the mystery of the empty house carefully dismissing from his mind all nonsensical notions of former tenants and their histories and keeping the one point in view steadily before him he started to reach it in the shortest way by walking straight up to the house and bringing himself face to face with the first person in it who opened the door to him it was getting towards dark on monday evening the thirteenth of the month when trottle first set foot on the steps of the house when he knocked at the door he knew nothing of the matter which he was about to investigate except that the landlord was an elderly widower of good fortune and that his name was forley a small beginning enough for a man to start from certainly on dropping the knocker his first proceeding was to look down cautiously out of the corner of his right eye for any results which might show themselves at the kitchen window there appeared at it immediately the figure of a woman who looked up inquisitively at the stranger on the steps left the window in a hurry and came back to it with an open letter in her hand which she held up to the fading light after looking over the letter hastily for a moment or so the woman disappeared once more trottle next heard footsteps shuffling and scraping along the bare hall of the house on a sudden they ceased and the sound of two voicesa shrill persuading voice and a gruff resisting voiceconfusedly reached his ears after a while the voices left off speakinga chain was undone a bolt drawn backthe door openedand trottle stood face to face with two persons a woman in advance and a man behind her leaning back flat against the wall wish you good evening sir says the woman in such a sudden way and in such a cracked voice that it was quite startling to hear her chilly weather aint it sir please to walk in you come from good mr forley dont you sir dont you sir chimes in the man hoarsely making a sort of gruff echo of himself and chuckling after it as if he thought he had made a joke if trottle had said no the door would have been probably closed in his face therefore he took circumstances as he found them and boldly ran all the risk whatever it might be of saying yes quite right sir says the woman good mr forleys letter told us his particular friend would be here to represent him at dusk on monday the thirteenthor if not on monday the thirteenth then on monday the twentieth at the same time without fail and here you are on monday the thirteenth aint you sir mr forleys particular friend and dressed all in blackquite right sir please to step into the dining roomits always kep scoured and clean against mr forley comes hereand ill fetch a candle in half a minute it gets so dark in the evenings now you hardly know where you are do you sir and how is good mr forley in his health we trust he is better benjamin dont we we are so sorry not to see him as usual benjamin aint we in half a minute sir if you dont mind waiting ill be back with the candle come along benjamin come along benjamin chimes in the echo and chuckles again as if he thought he had made another joke left alone in the empty front parlour trottle wondered what was coming next as he heard the shuffling scraping footsteps go slowly down the kitchen stairs the front door had been carefully chained up and bolted behind him on his entrance and there was not the least chance of his being able to open it to effect his escape without betraying himself by making a noise not being of the jarber sort luckily for himself he took his situation quietly as he found it and turned his time while alone to account by summing up in his own mind the few particulars which he had discovered thus far he had found out first that mr forley was in the habit of visiting the house regularly second that mr forley being prevented by illness from seeing the people put in charge as usual had appointed a friend to represent him and had written to say so third that the friend had a choice of two mondays at a particular time in the evening for doing his errand and that trottle had accidentally hit on this time and on the first of the mondays for beginning his own investigations fourth that the similarity between trottles black dress as servant out of livery and the dress of the messenger whoever he might be had helped the error by which trottle was profiting so far so good but what was the messengers errand and what chance was there that he might not come up and knock at the door himself from minute to minute on that very evening while trottle was turning over this last consideration in his mind he heard the shuffling footsteps come up the stairs again with a flash of candle light going before them he waited for the womans coming in with some little anxiety for the twilight had been too dim on his getting into the house to allow him to see either her face or the mans face at all clearly the woman came in first with the man she called benjamin at her heels and set the candle on the mantel piece trottle takes leave to describe her as an offensively cheerful old woman awfully lean and wiry and sharp all over at eyes nose and chindevilishly brisk smiling and restless with a dirty false front and a dirty black cap and short fidgetty arms and long hooked finger nailsan unnaturally lusty old woman who walked with a spring in her wicked old feet and spoke with a smirk on her wicked old facethe sort of old woman as trottle thinks who ought to have lived in the dark ages and been ducked in a horse pond instead of flourishing in the nineteenth century and taking charge of a christian house youll please to excuse my son benjamin wont you sir says this witch without a broomstick pointing to the man behind her propped against the bare wall of the dining room exactly as he had been propped against the bare wall of the passage hes got his inside dreadful bad again has my son benjamin and he wont go to bed and he will follow me about the house up stairs and downstairs and in my ladys chamber as the song says you know its his indisgestion poor dear that sours his temper and makes him so agravatingand indisgestion is a wearing thing to the best of us aint it sir aint it sir chimes in agravating benjamin winking at the candle light like an owl at the sunshine trottle examined the man curiously while his horrid old mother was speaking of him he found my son benjamin to be little and lean and buttoned up slovenly in a frowsy old great coat that fell down to his ragged carpet slippers his eyes were very watery his cheeks very pale and his lips very red his breathing was so uncommonly loud that it sounded almost like a snore his head rolled helplessly in the monstrous big collar of his great coat and his limp lazy hands pottered about the wall on either side of him as if they were groping for a imaginary bottle in plain english the complaint of my son benjamin was drunkenness of the stupid pig headed sottish kind drawing this conclusion easily enough after a moments observation of the man trottle found himself nevertheless keeping his eyes fixed much longer than was necessary on the ugly drunken face rolling about in the monstrous big coat collar and looking at it with a curiosity that he could hardly account for at first was there something familiar to him in the mans features he turned away from them for an instant and then turned back to him again after that second look the notion forced itself into his mind that he had certainly seen a face somewhere of which that sots face appeared like a kind of slovenly copy where thinks he to himself where did i last see the man whom this agravating benjamin here so very strongly reminds me of it was no time just thenwith the cheerful old womans eye searching him all over and the cheerful old womans tongue talking at him nineteen to the dozenfor trottle to be ransacking his memory for small matters that had got into wrong corners of it he put by in his mind that very curious circumstance respecting benjamins face to be taken up again when a fit opportunity offered itself and kept his wits about him in prime order for present necessities you wouldnt like to go down into the kitchen would you says the witch without the broomstick as familiar as if she had been trottles mother instead of benjamins theres a bit of fire in the grate and the sink in the back kitchen dont smell to matter much to day and its uncommon chilly up here when a persons flesh dont hardly cover a persons bones but you dont look cold sir do you and then why lord bless my soul our little bit of business is so very very little its hardly worth while to go downstairs about it after all quite a game at business aint it sir give and take thats what i call itgive and take with that her wicked old eyes settled hungrily on the region round about trottles waistcoat pocket and she began to chuckle like her son holding out one of her skinny hands and tapping cheerfully in the palm with the knuckles of the other agravating benjamin seeing what she was about roused up a little chuckled and tapped in imitation of her got an idea of his own into his muddled head all of a sudden and bolted it out charitably for the benefit of trottle i say says benjamin settling himself against the wall and nodding his head viciously at his cheerful old mother i say look out shell skin you assisted by these signs and warnings trottle found no difficulty in understanding that the business referred to was the giving and taking of money and that he was expected to be the giver it was at this stage of the proceedings that he first felt decidedly uncomfortable and more than half inclined to wish he was on the street side of the house door again he was still cudgelling his brains for an excuse to save his pocket when the silence was suddenly interrupted by a sound in the upper part of the house it was not at all loudit was a quiet still scraping soundso faint that it could hardly have reached the quickest ears except in an empty house do you hear that benjamin says the old woman hes at it again even in the dark aint he praps youd like to see him sir says she turning on trottle and poking her grinning face close to him only name it only say if youd like to see him before we do our little bit of businessand ill show good forleys friend up stairs just as if he was good mr forley himself my legs are all right whatever benjamins may be i get younger and younger and stronger and stronger and jollier and jollier every daythats what i do dont mind the stairs on my account sir if youd like to see him him trottle wondered whether him meant a man or a boy or a domestic animal of the male species whatever it meant here was a chance of putting off that uncomfortable give and take business and better still a chance perhaps of finding out one of the secrets of the mysterious house trottles spirits began to rise again and he said yes directly with the confidence of a man who knew all about it benjamins mother took the candle at once and lighted trottle briskly to the stairs and benjamin himself tried to follow as usual but getting up several flights of stairs even helped by the bannisters was more with his particular complaint than he seemed to feel himself inclined to venture on he sat down obstinately on the lowest step with his head against the wall and the tails of his big great coat spreading out magnificently on the stairs behind him and above him like a dirty imitation of a court ladys train dont sit there dear says his affectionate mother stopping to snuff the candle on the first landing i shall sit here says benjamin agravating to the last till the milk comes in the morning the cheerful old woman went on nimbly up the stairs to the first floor and trottle followed with his eyes and ears wide open he had seen nothing out of the common in the front parlour or up the staircase so far the house was dirty and dreary and close smellingbut there was nothing about it to excite the least curiosity except the faint scraping sound which was now beginning to get a little clearerthough still not at all loudas trottle followed his leader up the stairs to the second floor nothing on the second floor landing but cobwebs above and bits of broken plaster below cracked off from the ceiling benjamins mother was not a bit out of breath and looked all ready to go to the top of the monument if necessary the faint scraping sound had got a little clearer still but trottle was no nearer to guessing what it might be than when he first heard it in the parlour downstairs on the third and last floor there were two doors one which was shut leading into the front garret and one which was ajar leading into the back garret there was a loft in the ceiling above the landing but the cobwebs all over it vouched sufficiently for its not having been opened for some little time the scraping noise plainer than ever here sounded on the other side of the back garret door and to trottles great relief that was precisely the door which the cheerful old woman now pushed open trottle followed her in and for once in his life at any rate was struck dumb with amazement at the sight which the inside of the room revealed to him the garret was absolutely empty of everything in the shape of furniture it must have been used at one time or other by somebody engaged in a profession or a trade which required for the practice of it a great deal of light for the one window in the room which looked out on a wide open space at the back of the house was three or four times as large every way as a garret window usually is close under this window kneeling on the bare boards with his face to the door there appeared of all the creatures in the world to see alone at such a place and at such a time a mere mite of a childa little lonely wizen strangely clad boy who could not at the most have been more than five years old he had a greasy old blue shawl crossed over his breast and rolled up to keep the ends from the ground into a great big lump on his back a strip of something which looked like the remains of a womans flannel petticoat showed itself under the shawl and below that again a pair of rusty black stockings worlds too large for him covered his legs and his shoeless feet a pair of old clumsy muffetees which had worked themselves up on his little frail red arms to the elbows and a big cotton nightcap that had dropped down to his very eyebrows finished off the strange dress which the poor little man seemed not half big enough to fill out and not near strong enough to walk about in but there was something to see even more extraordinary than the clothes the child was swaddled up in and that was the game which he was playing at all by himself and which moreover explained in the most unexpected manner the faint scraping noise that had found its way down stairs through the half opened door in the silence of the empty house it has been mentioned that the child was on his knees in the garret when trottle first saw him he was not saying his prayers and not crouching down in terror at being alone in the dark he was odd and unaccountable as it may appear doing nothing more or less than playing at a charwomans or housemaids business of scouring the floor both his little hands had tight hold of a mangy old blacking brush with hardly any bristles left in it which he was rubbing backwards and forwards on the boards as gravely and steadily as if he had been at scouring work for years and had got a large family to keep by it the coming in of trottle and the old woman did not startle or disturb him in the least he just looked up for a minute at the candle with a pair of very bright sharp eyes and then went on with his work again as if nothing had happened on one side of him was a battered pint saucepan without a handle which was his make believe pail and on the other a morsel of slate coloured cotton rag which stood for his flannel to wipe up with after scrubbing bravely for a minute or two he took the bit of rag and mopped up and then squeezed make believe water out into his make believe pail as grave as any judge that ever sat on a bench by the time he thought he had got the floor pretty dry he raised himself upright on his knees and blew out a good long breath and set his little red arms akimbo and nodded at trottle there says the child knitting his little downy eyebrows into a frown drat the dirt ive cleaned up wheres my beer benjamins mother chuckled till trottle thought she would have choked herself lord ha mercy on us says she just hear the imp you would never think he was only five years old would you sir please to tell good mr forley you saw him going on as nicely as ever playing at being me scouring the parlour floor and calling for my beer afterwards thats his regular game morning noon and nighthes never tired of it only look how snug weve been and dressed him thats my shawl a keepin his precious little body warm and benjamins nightcap a keepin his precious little head warm and benjamins stockings drawed over his trowsers a keepin his precious little legs warm hes snug and happy if ever a imp was yet wheres my beersay it again little dear say it again if trottle had seen the boy with a light and a fire in the room clothed like other children and playing naturally with a top or a box of soldiers or a bouncing big india rubber ball he might have been as cheerful under the circumstances as benjamins mother herself but seeing the child reduced as he could not help suspecting for want of proper toys and proper childs company to take up with the mocking of an old woman at her scouring work for something to stand in the place of a game trottle though not a family man nevertheless felt the sight before him to be in its way one of the saddest and the most pitiable that he had ever witnessed why my man says he youre the boldest little chap in all england you dont seem a bit afraid of being up here all by yourself in the dark the big winder says the child pointing up to it sees in the dark and i see with the big winder he stops a bit and gets up on his legs and looks hard at benjamins mother im a good un says he aint i i save candle trottle wondered what else the forlorn little creature had been brought up to do without besides candle light and risked putting a question as to whether he ever got a run in the open air to cheer him up a bit o yes he had a run now and then out of doors to say nothing of his runs about the house the lively little cricketa run according to good mr forleys instructions which were followed out carefully as good mr forleys friend would be glad to hear to the very letter as trottle could only have made one reply to this namely that good mr forleys instructions were in his opinion the instructions of an infernal scamp and as he felt that such an answer would naturally prove the death blow to all further discoveries on his part he gulped down his feelings before they got too many for him and held his tongue and looked round towards the window again to see what the forlorn little boy was going to amuse himself with next the child had gathered up his blacking brush and bit of rag and had put them into the old tin saucepan and was now working his way as well as his clothes would let him with his make believe pail hugged up in his arms towards a door of communication which led from the back to the front garret i say says he looking round sharply over his shoulder what are you two stopping here for im going to bed nowand so i tell you with that he opened the door and walked into the front room seeing trottle take a step or two to follow him benjamins mother opened her wicked old eyes in a state of great astonishment mercy on us says she havent you seen enough of him yet no says trottle i should like to see him go to bed benjamins mother burst into such a fit of chuckling that the loose extinguisher in the candlestick clattered again with the shaking of her hand to think of good mr forleys friend taking ten times more trouble about the imp than good mr forley himself such a joke as that benjamins mother had not often met with in the course of her life and she begged to be excused if she took the liberty of having a laugh at it leaving her to laugh as much as she pleased and coming to a pretty positive conclusion after what he had just heard that mr forleys interest in the child was not of the fondest possible kind trottle walked into the front room and benjamins mother enjoying herself immensely followed with the candle there were two pieces of furniture in the front garret one an old stool of the sort that is used to stand a cask of beer on and the other a great big ricketty straddling old truckle bedstead in the middle of this bedstead surrounded by a dim brown waste of sacking was a kind of little island of poor beddingan old bolster with nearly all the feathers out of it doubled in three for a pillow a mere shred of patchwork counter pane and a blanket and under that and peeping out a little on either side beyond the loose clothes two faded chair cushions of horsehair laid along together for a sort of makeshift mattress when trottle got into the room the lonely little boy had scrambled up on the bedstead with the help of the beer stool and was kneeling on the outer rim of sacking with the shred of counterpane in his hands just making ready to tuck it in for himself under the chair cushions ill tuck you up my man says trottle jump into bed and let me try i mean to tuck myself up says the poor forlorn child and i dont mean to jump i mean to crawl i doand so i tell you with that he set to work tucking in the clothes tight all down the sides of the cushions but leaving them open at the foot then getting up on his knees and looking hard at trottle as much as to say what do you mean by offering to help such a handy little chap as me he began to untie the big shawl for himself and did it too in less than half a minute then doubling the shawl up loose over the foot of the bed he says i say look here and ducks under the clothes head first worming his way up and up softly under the blanket and counterpane till trottle saw the top of the large nightcap slowly peep out on the bolster this over sized head gear of the childs had so shoved itself down in the course of his journey to the pillow under the clothes that when he got his face fairly out on the bolster he was all nightcap down to his mouth he soon freed himself however from this slight encumbrance by turning the ends of the cap up gravely to their old place over his eyebrowslooked at trottlesaid snug aint it good byepopped his face under the clothes againand left nothing to be seen of him but the empty peak of the big nightcap standing up sturdily on end in the middle of the bolster what a young limb it is aint it says benjamins mother giving trottle a cheerful dig with her elbow come on you wont see no more of him to night and so i tell you sings out a shrill little voice under the bedclothes chiming in with a playful finish to the old womans last words if trottle had not been by this time positively resolved to follow the wicked secret which accident had mixed him up with through all its turnings and windings right on to the end he would have probably snatched the boy up then and there and carried him off from his garret prison bed clothes and all as it was he put a strong check on himself kept his eye on future possibilities and allowed benjamins mother to lead him down stairs again mind them top bannisters says she as trottle laid his hand on them they are as rotten as medlars every one of em when people come to see the premises says trottle trying to feel his way a little farther into the mystery of the house you dont bring many of them up here do you bless your heart alive says she nobody ever comes now the outside of the house is quite enough to warn them off mores the pity as i say it used to keep me in spirits staggering em all one after another with the frightful high rentspecially the women drat em whats the rent of this househundred and twenty pound a yearhundred and twenty why there aint a house in the street as lets for more than eightylikely enough maam other landlords may lower their rents if they please but this here landlord sticks to his rights and means to have as much for his house as his father had before himbut the neighbourhoods gone off since thenhundred and twenty pound maamthe landlord must be madhundred and twenty pound maamopen the door you impertinent woman lord what a happiness it was to see em bounce out with that awful rent a ringing in their ears all down the street she stopped on the second floor landing to treat herself to another chuckle while trottle privately posted up in his memory what he had just heard two points made out he thought to himself the house is kept empty on purpose and the way its done is to ask a rent that nobody will pay ah deary me says benjamins mother changing the subject on a sudden and twisting back with a horrid greedy quickness to those awkward money matters which she had broached down in the parlour what weve done one way and another for mr forley it isnt in words to tell that nice little bit of business of ours ought to be a bigger bit of business considering the trouble we take benjamin and me to make the imp upstairs as happy as the day is long if good mr forley would only please to think a little more of what a deal he owes to benjamin and me thats just it says trottle catching her up short in desperation and seeing his way by the help of those last words of hers to slipping cleverly through her fingers what should you say if i told you that mr forley was nothing like so far from thinking about that little matter as you fancy you would be disappointed now if i told you that i had come to day without the moneyher lank old jaw fell and her villainous old eyes glared in a perfect state of panic at thatbut what should you say if i told you that mr forley was only waiting for my report to send me here next monday at dusk with a bigger bit of business for us two to do together than ever you think for what should you say to that the old wretch came so near to trottle before she answered and jammed him up confidentially so close into the corner of the landing that his throat in a manner rose at her can you count it off do you think on more than that says she holding up her four skinny fingers and her long crooked thumb all of a tremble right before his face what do you say to two hands instead of one says he pushing past her and getting down stairs as fast as he could what she said trottle thinks it best not to report seeing that the old hypocrite getting next door to light headed at the golden prospect before her took such liberties with unearthly names and persons which ought never to have approached her lips and rained down such an awful shower of blessings on trottles head that his hair almost stood on end to hear her he went on down stairs as fast as his feet would carry him till he was brought up all standing as the sailors say on the last flight by agravating benjamin lying right across the stair and fallen off as might have been expected into a heavy drunken sleep the sight of him instantly reminded trottle of the curious half likeness which he had already detected between the face of benjamin and the face of another man whom he had seen at a past time in very different circumstances he determined before leaving the house to have one more look at the wretched muddled creature and accordingly shook him up smartly and propped him against the staircase wall before his mother could interfere leave him to me ill freshen him up says trottle to the old woman looking hard in benjamins face while he spoke the fright and surprise of being suddenly woke up seemed for about a quarter of a minute to sober the creature when he first opened his eyes there was a new look in them for a moment which struck home to trottles memory as quick and as clear as a flash of light the old maudlin sleepy expression came back again in another instant and blurred out all further signs and tokens of the past but trottle had seen enough in the moment before it came and he troubled benjamins face with no more inquiries next monday at dusk says he cutting short some more of the old womans palaver about benjamins indisgestion ive got no more time to spare maam to night please to let me out with a few last blessings a few last dutiful messages to good mr forley and a few last friendly hints not to forget next monday at dusk trottle contrived to struggle through the sickening business of leave taking to get the door opened and to find himself to his own indescribable relief once more on the outer side of the house to let let at last there maam said trottle folding up the manuscript from which he had been reading and setting it down with a smart tap of triumph on the table may i venture to ask what you think of that plain statement as a guess on my part and not on mr jarbers at the riddle of the empty house for a minute or two i was unable to say a word when i recovered a little my first question referred to the poor forlorn little boy to day is monday the twentieth i said surely you have not let a whole week go by without trying to find out something more except at bed time and meals maam answered trottle i have not let an hour go by please to understand that i have only come to an end of what i have written and not to an end of what i have done i wrote down those first particulars maam because they are of great importance and also because i was determined to come forward with my written documents seeing that mr jarber chose to come forward in the first instance with his i am now ready to go on with the second part of my story as shortly and plainly as possible by word of mouth the first thing i must clear up if you please is the matter of mr forleys family affairs i have heard you speak of them maam at various times and i have understood that mr forley had two children only by his deceased wife both daughters the eldest daughter married to her fathers entire satisfaction one mr bayne a rich man holding a high government situation in canada she is now living there with her husband and her only child a little girl of eight or nine years old right so far i think maam quite right i said the second daughter trottle went on and mr forleys favourite set her fathers wishes and the opinions of the world at flat defiance by running away with a man of low origina mate of a merchant vessel named kirkland mr forley not only never forgave that marriage but vowed that he would visit the scandal of it heavily in the future on husband and wife both escaped his vengeance whatever he meant it to be the husband was drowned on his first voyage after his marriage and the wife died in child bed right again i believe maam again quite right having got the family matter all right we will now go back maam to me and my doings last monday i asked you for leave of absence for two days i employed the time in clearing up the matter of benjamins face last saturday i was out of the way when you wanted me i played truant maam on that occasion in company with a friend of mine who is managing clerk in a lawyers office and we both spent the morning at doctors commons over the last will and testament of mr forleys father leaving the will business for a moment please to follow me first if you have no objection into the ugly subject of benjamins face about six or seven years ago thanks to your kindness i had a weeks holiday with some friends of mine who live in the town of pendlebury one of those friends the only one now left in the place kept a chemists shop and in that shop i was made acquainted with one of the two doctors in the town named barsham this barsham was a first rate surgeon and might have got to the top of his profession if he had not been a first rate blackguard as it was he both drank and gambled nobody would have anything to do with him in pendlebury and at the time when i was made known to him in the chemists shop the other doctor mr dix who was not to be compared with him for surgical skill but who was a respectable man had got all the practice and barsham and his old mother were living together in such a condition of utter poverty that it was a marvel to everybody how they kept out of the parish workhouse benjamin and benjamins mother exactly maam last thursday morning thanks to your kindness again i went to pendlebury to my friend the chemist to ask a few questions about barsham and his mother i was told that they had both left the town about five years since when i inquired into the circumstances some strange particulars came out in the course of the chemists answer you know i have no doubt maam that poor mrs kirkland was confined while her husband was at sea in lodgings at a village called flatfield and that she died and was buried there but what you may not know is that flatfield is only three miles from pendlebury that the doctor who attended on mrs kirkland was barsham that the nurse who took care of her was barshams mother and that the person who called them both in was mr forley whether his daughter wrote to him or whether he heard of it in some other way i dont know but he was with her though he had sworn never to see her again when she married a month or more before her confinement and was backwards and forwards a good deal between flatfield and pendlebury how he managed matters with the barshams cannot at present be discovered but it is a fact that he contrived to keep the drunken doctor sober to everybodys amazement it is a fact that barsham went to the poor woman with all his wits about him it is a fact that he and his mother came back from flatfield after mrs kirklands death packed up what few things they had and left the town mysteriously by night and lastly it is also a fact that the other doctor mr dix was not called in to help till a week after the birth and burial of the child when the mother was sinking from exhaustionexhaustion to give the vagabond barsham his due not produced in mr dixs opinion by improper medical treatment but by the bodily weakness of the poor woman herself burial of the child i interrupted trembling all over trottle you spoke that word burial in a very strange wayyou are fixing your eyes on me now with a very strange look trottle leaned over close to me and pointed through the window to the empty house the childs death is registered at pendlebury he said on barshams certificate under the head of male infant still born the childs coffin lies in the mothers grave in flatfield churchyard the child himselfas surely as i live and breathe is living and breathing nowa castaway and a prisoner in that villainous house i sank back in my chair its guess work so far but it is borne in on my mind for all that as truth rouse yourself maam and think a little the last i hear of barsham he is attending mr forleys disobedient daughter the next i see of barsham he is in mr forleys house trusted with a secret he and his mother leave pendlebury suddenly and suspiciously five years back and he and his mother have got a child of five years old hidden away in the house wait please to waiti have not done yet the will left by mr forleys father strengthens the suspicion the friend i took with me to doctors commons made himself master of the contents of that will and when he had done so i put these two questions to him can mr forley leave his money at his own discretion to anybody he pleases no my friend says his father has left him with only a life interest in it suppose one of mr forleys married daughters has a girl and the other a boy how would the money go it would all go my friend says to the boy and it would be charged with the payment of a certain annual income to his female cousin after her death it would go back to the male descendant and to his heirs consider that maam the child of the daughter whom mr forley hates whose husband has been snatched away from his vengeance by death takes his whole property in defiance of him and the child of the daughter whom he loves is left a pensioner on her low born boy cousin for life there was goodtoo good reasonwhy that child of mrs kirklands should be registered stillborn and if as i believe the register is founded on a false certificate there is better still better reason why the existence of the child should be hidden and all trace of his parentage blotted out in the garret of that empty house he stopped and pointed for the second time to the dim dust covered garret windows opposite as he did so i was startleda very slight matter sufficed to frighten me nowby a knock at the door of the room in which we were sitting my maid came in with a letter in her hand i took it from her the mourning card which was all the envelope enclosed dropped from my hands george forley was no more he had departed this life three days since on the evening of friday did our last chance of discovering the truth i asked rest with him has it died with his death courage maam i think not our chance rests on our power to make barsham and his mother confess and mr forleys death by leaving them helpless seems to put that power into our hands with your permission i will not wait till dusk to day as i at first intended but will make sure of those two people at once with a policeman in plain clothes to watch the house in case they try to leave it with this card to vouch for the fact of mr forleys death and with a bold acknowledgment on my part of having got possession of their secret and of being ready to use it against them in case of need i think there is little doubt of bringing barsham and his mother to terms in case i find it impossible to get back here before dusk please to sit near the window maam and watch the house a little before they light the street lamps if you see the front door open and close again will you be good enough to put on your bonnet and come across to me immediately mr forleys death may or may not prevent his messenger from coming as arranged but if the person does come it is of importance that you as a relative of mr forleys should be present to see him and to have that proper influence over him which i cannot pretend to exercise the only words i could say to trottle as he opened the door and left me were words charging him to take care that no harm happened to the poor forlorn little boy left alone i drew my chair to the window and looked out with a beating heart at the guilty house i waited and waited through what appeared to me to be an endless time until i heard the wheels of a cab stop at the end of the street i looked in that direction and saw trottle get out of the cab alone walk up to the house and knock at the door he was let in by barshams mother a minute or two later a decently dressed man sauntered past the house looked up at it for a moment and sauntered on to the corner of the street close by here he leant against the post and lighted a cigar and stopped there smoking in an idle way but keeping his face always turned in the direction of the house door i waited and waited still i waited and waited with my eyes riveted to the door of the house at last i thought i saw it open in the dusk and then felt sure i heard it shut again softly though i tried hard to compose myself i trembled so that i was obliged to call for peggy to help me on with my bonnet and cloak and was forced to take her arm to lean on in crossing the street trottle opened the door to us before we could knock peggy went back and i went in he had a lighted candle in his hand it has happened maam as i thought it would he whispered leading me into the bare comfortless empty parlour barsham and his mother have consulted their own interests and have come to terms my guess work is guess work no longer it is now what i felt it wastruth something strange to mesomething which women who are mothers must often knowtrembled suddenly in my heart and brought the warm tears of my youthful days thronging back into my eyes i took my faithful old servant by the hand and asked him to let me see mrs kirklands child for his mothers sake if you desire it maam said trottle with a gentleness of manner that i had never noticed in him before but pray dont think me wanting in duty and right feeling if i beg you to try and wait a little you are agitated already and a first meeting with the child will not help to make you so calm as you would wish to be if mr forleys messenger comes the little boy is safe up stairs pray think first of trying to compose yourself for a meeting with a stranger and believe me you shall not leave the house afterwards without the child i felt that trottle was right and sat down as patiently as i could in a chair he had thoughtfully placed ready for me i was so horrified at the discovery of my own relations wickedness that when trottle proposed to make me acquainted with the confession wrung from barsham and his mother i begged him to spare me all details and only to tell me what was necessary about george forley all that can be said for mr forley maam is that he was just scrupulous enough to hide the childs existence and blot out its parentage here instead of consenting at the first to its death or afterwards when the boy grew up to turning him adrift absolutely helpless in the world the fraud has been managed maam with the cunning of satan himself mr forley had the hold over the barshams that they had helped him in his villany and that they were dependent on him for the bread they eat he brought them up to london to keep them securely under his own eye he put them into this empty house taking it out of the agents hands previously on pretence that he meant to manage the letting of it himself and by keeping the house empty made it the surest of all hiding places for the child here mr forley could come whenever he pleased to see that the poor lonely child was not absolutely starved sure that his visits would only appear like looking after his own property here the child was to have been trained to believe himself barshams child till he should be old enough to be provided for in some situation as low and as poor as mr forleys uneasy conscience would let him pick out he may have thought of atonement on his death bed but not beforei am only too certain of itnot before a low double knock startled us the messenger said trottle under his breath he went out instantly to answer the knock and returned leading in a respectable looking elderly man dressed like trottle all in black with a white cravat but otherwise not at all resembling him i am afraid i have made some mistake said the stranger trottle considerately taking the office of explanation into his own hands assured the gentleman that there was no mistake mentioned to him who i was and asked him if he had not come on business connected with the late mr forley looking greatly astonished the gentleman answered yes there was an awkward moment of silence after that the stranger seemed to be not only startled and amazed but rather distrustful and fearful of committing himself as well noticing this i thought it best to request trottle to put an end to further embarrassment by stating all particulars truthfully as he had stated them to me and i begged the gentleman to listen patiently for the late mr forleys sake he bowed to me very respectfully and said he was prepared to listen with the greatest interest it was evident to meand i could see to trottle alsothat we were not dealing to say the least with a dishonest man before i offer any opinion on what i have heard he said earnestly and anxiously after trottle had done i must be allowed in justice to myself to explain my own apparent connection with this very strange and very shocking business i was the confidential legal adviser of the late mr forley and i am left his executor rather more than a fortnight back when mr forley was confined to his room by illness he sent for me and charged me to call and pay a certain sum of money here to a man and woman whom i should find taking charge of the house he said he had reasons for wishing the affair to be kept a secret he begged me so to arrange my engagements that i could call at this place either on monday last or to day at dusk and he mentioned that he would write to warn the people of my coming without mentioning my name dalcott is my name as he did not wish to expose me to any future importunities on the part of the man and woman i need hardly tell you that this commission struck me as being a strange one but in my position with mr forley i had no resource but to accept it without asking questions or to break off my long and friendly connection with my client i chose the first alternative business prevented me from doing my errand on monday lastand if i am here to day notwithstanding mr forleys unexpected death it is emphatically because i understood nothing of the matter on knocking at this door and therefore felt myself bound as executor to clear it up that on my word of honour is the whole truth so far as i am personally concerned i feel quite sure of it sir i answered you mentioned mr forleys death just now as unexpected may i inquire if you were present and if he has left any last instructions three hours before mr forleys death said mr dalcott his medical attendant left him apparently in a fair way of recovery the change for the worse took place so suddenly and was accompanied by such severe suffering to prevent him from communicating his last wishes to any one when i reached his house he was insensible i have since examined his papers not one of them refers to the present time or to the serious matter which now occupies us in the absence of instructions i must act cautiously on what you have told me but i will be rigidly fair and just at the same time the first thing to be done he continued addressing himself to trottle is to hear what the man and woman down stairs have to say if you can supply me with writing materials i will take their declarations separately on the spot in your presence and in the presence of the policeman who is watching the house to morrow i will send copies of those declarations accompanied by a full statement of the case to mr and mrs bayne in canada both of whom know me well as the late mr forleys legal adviser and i will suspend all proceedings on my part until i hear from them or from their solicitor in london in the present posture of affairs this is all i can safely do we could do no less than agree with him and thank him for his frank and honest manner of meeting us it was arranged that i should send over the writing materials from my lodgings and to my unutterable joy and relief it was also readily acknowledged that the poor little orphan boy could find no fitter refuge than my old arms were longing to offer him and no safer protection for the night than my roof could give trottle hastened away up stairs as actively as if he had been a young man to fetch the child down and he brought him down to me without another moment of delay and i went on my knees before the poor little mite and embraced him and asked him if he would go with me to where i lived he held me away for a moment and his wan shrewd little eyes looked sharp at me then he clung close to me all at once and said im a going along with you i amand so i tell you for inspiring the poor neglected child with this trust in my old self i thanked heaven then with all my heart and soul and i thank it now i bundled the poor darling up in my own cloak and i carried him in my own arms across the road peggy was lost in speechless amazement to behold me trudging out of breath up stairs with a strange pair of poor little legs under my arm but she began to cry over the child the moment she saw him like a sensible woman as she always was and she still cried her eyes out over him in a comfortable manner when he at last lay fast asleep tucked up by my hands in trottles bed and trottle bless you my dear man said i kissing his hand as he looked on the forlorn baby came to this refuge through you and he will help you on your way to heaven trottle answered that i was his dear mistress and immediately went and put his head out at an open window on the landing and looked into the back street for a quarter of an hour that very night as i sat thinking of the poor child and of another poor child who is never to be thought about enough at christmas time the idea came into my mind which i have lived to execute and in the realisation of which i am the happiest of women this day the executor will sell that house trottle said i not a doubt of it maam if he can find a purchaser ill buy it i have often seen trottle pleased but i never saw him so perfectly enchanted as he was when i confided to him which i did then and there the purpose that i had in view to make short of a long storyand what story would not be long coming from the lips of an old woman like me unless it was made short by main forcei bought the house mrs bayne had her fathers blood in her she evaded the opportunity of forgiving and generous reparation that was offered her and disowned the child but i was prepared for that and loved him all the more for having no one in the world to look to but me i am getting into a flurry by being over pleased and i dare say i am as incoherent as need be i bought the house and i altered it from the basement to the roof and i turned it into a hospital for sick children never mind by what degrees my little adopted boy came to the knowledge of all the sights and sounds in the streets so familiar to other children and so strange to him never mind by what degrees he came to be pretty and childish and winning and companionable and to have pictures and toys about him and suitable playmates as i write i look across the road to my hospital and there is the darling who has gone over to play nodding at me out of one of the once lonely windows with his dear chubby face backed up by trottles waistcoat as he lifts my pet for grandma to see many an eye i see in that house now but it is never in solitude never in neglect many an eye i see in that house now that is more and more radiant every day with the light of returning health as my precious darling has changed beyond description for the brighter and the better so do the not less precious darlings of poor women change in that house every day in the year for which i humbly thank that gracious being whom the restorer of the widows son and of the rulers daughter instructed all mankind to call their father

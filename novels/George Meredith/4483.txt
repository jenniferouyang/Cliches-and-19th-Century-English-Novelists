requested to bear in mind what wild creature he was in his youth while the female should marvel credulously ix concerning the black goddess fortune and the worship of her together with an introduction of some of her votaries chapter i enter dame gossip as chorus everybody has heard of the beautiful countess of cressett who was one of the lights of this country at the time when crowned heads were running over europe crying out for charitys sake to be amused after their tiresome work of slaughter and you know what a dread they have of moping she was famous for her fun and high spirits besides her good looks which you may judge of for yourself on a walk down most of our great noblemens collections of pictures in england where you will behold her as the goddess diana fitting an arrow to a bow and elsewhere an amazon holding a spear or a lady with dogs in the costume of the day and in one place she is a nymph if not diana herself gazing at her naked feet before her attendants loosen her tunic for her to take the bath and her hounds are pricking their ears and you see antlers of a stag behind a block of stone she was a wonderful swimmer among other things and one early morning when she was a girl she did really swim they say across the shannon and back to win a bet for her brother lord levellier the colonel of cavalry who left an arm in egypt and changed his way of life to become a wizard as the common people about his neighbourhood supposed because he foretold the weather and had cures for aches and pains without a doctors diploma but we know now that he was only a mathematician and astronomer all for inventing military engines the brother and sister were great friends in their youth when he had his right arm to defend her reputation with and she would have done anything on earth to please him there is a picture of her in an immense flat white silk hat trimmed with pale blue like a pavilion the broadest brim ever seen and she simply sits on a chair and venus the queen of beauty would have been extinguished under that hat i am sure and only to look at countess fannys eye beneath the brim she has tipped ever so slightly in her artfulness makes the absurd thing graceful and suitable oh she was a cunning one but you must be on your guard against the scandalmongers and collectors of anecdotes and worst of any the critic of our galleries of art for she being in almost all of them the principal painters of the day were on their knees for the favour of a sitting they have to speak of her pretty frequently and they season their dish the coxcombs do by hinting a knowledge of her history here we come to another portrait of the beautiful but we fear naughty countess of cressett you are to imagine that they know everything and they are so indulgent when they drop their blot on a ladys character they can boast of nothing more than having read nymrieys letters and correspondence published fortunately for him when he was no longer to be called to account below for his malicious insinuations pretending to decency in initials and dashes that man was a hater of women and the clergy he was one of the horrid creatures who write with a wink at you which sets the wicked part of us on fire i have known it myself and i own it to my shame and if i happened to be ignorant of the history of countess fanny i could not refute his wantonness he has just the same benevolent leer for a bishop give me if we are to make a choice the beggars breech for decency i say i like it vastly in preference to a nymney who leads you up to the curtain and agitates it and bids you to retire on tiptoe you cannot help being angry with the man for both reasons but he is the writer society delights in to show what it is composed of a man brazen enough to declare that he could hold us in suspense about the adventures of a broomstick with the aid of a yashmak and an ankle may know the world you had better not know himthat is my remark and do not trust him he tells the story of the old buccaneer in fear of the public for it was general property but of course he finishes with a nymney touch so the old buccaneer is the doubloon she takes in exchange for a handful of silver pieces there is no such handful to exchangenot of the kind he sickeningly nudges at you i will prove to you it was not countess fannys naughtiness though she was indeed very blamable women should walk in armour as if they were born to it for these cold sneerers will never waste their darts on cuirasses an independent brave young creature exposing herself thoughtlessly in her reckless innocence is the victim for them they will bring all society down on her with one of their explosive sly words appearing so careless the cowards i say without hesitation her conduct with regard to kirby the old buccaneer as he was called however indefensible in itself warrants her at heart an innocent young woman much to be pitied only to think of her i could sometimes drop into a chair for a good cry and of him too and their daughter carinthia jane was the pair of them as to that and so was chillon john the son those critics quoting nymney should look at the portrait of her in the long saloon of cresset castle where she stands in blue and white completely dressed near a table supporting a couple of holster pistols and then let them ask themselves whether they would speak of her so if her little hand could move well and so the tale of her swim across the shannon river and back drove the young earl of cresset straight over to ireland to propose for her he saying that she was the girl to suit his book not allowing her time to think of how much he might be the man to suit hers the marriage was what is called a good one both full of frolic and he wealthy and rather handsome and she quite lovely and spirited no wonder the whole town was very soon agog about the couple until at the end of a year people began to talk of them separately she going her way and he his she could not always be on the top of a coach which was his throne of happiness plenty of stories are current still of his fame as a fourinhand coachman they say he once drove an emperor and a king a prince chancellor and a pair of field marshals and some ladies of the day from the metropolis to richmond hill in fifty or sixty odd minutes having the ground cleared all the way by bell and summons and only a donkeycart and man and a deaf old woman to pay for and went as you can imagine at such a tearing gallop that those grand highnesses had to hold on for their lives and lost their hats along the road and a publican at kew exhibits one above his bar to the present hour and countess fanny was up among them they say she was equal to it and some say that was the occasion of her meeting the old buccaneer she met him at richmond in surrey we know for certain it was on richmond hill where the old king met his lass they say countess fanny was parading the hill to behold the splendid view always admired so much by foreigners with their achs and hechs and surrounded by her crowned courtiers in frogged uniforms and moustachioed like seahorses a little before dinner time when kirby passed her and the emperor made a remark on him for kirby was a magnificent figure of a man and used to be compared to a threedecker entering harbour after a victory he stood six feet four and was broadshouldered and deepchested to match and walked like a king who has humbled his enemy you have seen big dogs and so countess fanny looked round kirby was doing the same but he had turned right about and appeared transfixed and like a royal beast angry with his wound if ever there was love at first sight and a dreadful love like a runaway mailcoach in a storm of wind and lightning at black midnight by the banks of a flooded river which was formerly our comparison for terrible situations it was when those two met and what you exclaim buccaneer kirby full sixtyfive and countess fanny no more than three and twenty a young beauty of the world of fashion courted by the highest and she in love with him go and gaze at one of our big ships coming out of an engagement home with all her flags flying and her crew manning the yards that will give you an idea of a young womans feelings for an old warrior never beaten down an inch by anything he had to endure matching him i dare say in her womans heart with the mighty highnesses who had only smelt the outside edge of battle she did rarely admire a valiant man old as methuselah he would have made her kneel to him she was all heart for a real hero the story goes that countess fanny sent her husband to captain kirby at the emperors request to inquire his name and on hearing it she struck her hands on her bosom telling his majesty he saw there the bravest man in the kings dominions which the emperor scarce crediting and observing that the man must be then a superhuman being to be so distinguished in a nation of the brave countess fanny related the well known tale of captain kirby and the shipful of mutineers and how when not a man of them stood by him and he in the service of the first insurgent state of spanish america to save his ship from being taken over to the enemyhe blew her up fifteen miles from land and so he got to shore swimming and floating alternately and was called old sky high by english sailors any number of whom could always be had to sail under buccaneer kirby he fought on shore as well and once he came down from the tops of the andes with a black beard turned white and went into action with the title of kirbys ghost but his heart was on salt water he was never so much at home as in a ship foundering or splitting into the clouds we are told that he never forgave the admiralty for striking him off the list of english naval captains which is no doubt why in his old age he nursed a grudge against his country ours i am sure was the loss and many have thought so since he was a mechanician a master of stratagems and would say that brains will beat grim death if we have enough of them he was a standing example of the lessons of his own maxims for men a very curious book that fetches a rare price now wherever a copy is put up for auction i shudder at them as if they were muzzles of firearms pointed at me but they were not addressed to my sex and still they give me an interest in the writer who would declare that he had never failed in an undertaking without stripping bare to expose to himself where he had been wanting in intention and determination there you may see a truly terrible man so the emperor being immensely taken with kirbys method of preserving discipline on board ship because as we say to the madman your strait waistcoat is my easychair monarchs have a great love of discipline he begged countess fannys permission that he might invite captain kirby to his table and countess fanny she had the name from the ballad i am the star of prince and czar my light is shed on many but i wait here till my bold buccaneer makes prize of countess fanny for the popular imagination was extraordinarily roused by the elopement and there were songs and ballads out of number countess fanny despatched her husband to captain kirby again meaning no harm though the poor man is laughed at in the songs for going twice upon his mission none of the mighty people repented of having the old buccaneerfor that night at all events he sat in the midst of them you may believe like the lord of that table with his great white beard and hairnot a lock of it shedand his bronze lionface and a resolute but a merry eye that he had he was no deep drinker of wine but when he did drink and the wine champagne he drank to show his disdain of its powers and the emperor wishing for a narrative of some of his exploits particularly the blowing up of his ship kirby paid his majesty the compliment of giving it him as baldly as an official report to the admiralty so disengaged and calm was he with his bottles of champagne in him where another would have been sparkling and laying on the colours that he was then and there offered admirals rank in the imperial navy and the old buccaneer like a courtier of our best days bows to countess fanny and asks her if he is a free man to go and no says she we cannot spare you and there was a pretty wrangle between countess fanny and the emperor each pulling at the old buccaneer to have possession of him he was rarely out of her sight after their first meeting and the ridiculous excuse she gave to her husbands family was she feared he would be kidnapped and made a cossack of and young lord cressett her husband began to grumble concerning her intimacy with a man old enough to be her grandfather as if the age were the injury he seemed to think it so and vowed he would shoot the old depredator dead if he found him on the grounds of cressett like vermin he said and it was considered that he had the right and no jury would have convicted him you know what those days were he had his opportunity one moonlight night not far from the castle and peppered kirby with shot from a fowlingpiece at some say five paces distance if not pointblank but kirby had a maxim steady shakes them and he acted on it to receive his enemys fire and the young lords hand shook and the old buccaneer stood out of the smoke not much injured except in the coatcollar with a pistol cocked in his hand and he said many would take that for a declaration of war but i know it s only your lordships diplomacy and then he let loose to his mad fun astounding lord cressett and his gamekeeper and vowed as the young lord tried to relate subsequently as well as he could recollect the words here i have it in printthat he was a man pickled in saltpetre when an infant like achilles and proof against powder and shot not marked with cross and key and fetched up from the square magazine in the central depot of the infernal factory third turning to the right off the grand arcade in kingdomcome where the nightporter has to wear wet petticoats like a highland chief to make short work of the sparks flying about otherwise this world and many another would not have to wait long for combustion kirby had the wildest way of talking when he was not issuing orders under fire best understood by sailors i give it you as it stands here printed i do not profess to understand so lord cressett said diplomacy and infernal factories be hanged have your shot at me its only fair and kirby discharged his pistol at the top twigs of an old oak tree and called the young lord a briton and proposed to take him in hand and make a man of him as nigh worthy of his wife as any one not an alexander of macedon could be so they became friendly and the young lord confessed it was his family that had urged him to the attack and kirby abode at the castle and all three were happy in perfect honour i am convinced but such was not the opinion of the cressetts and levelliers down they trooped to cressett castle with a rush and a roar crying on the disgrace of an old desperado like kirby living there dukes marchionesses cabinet ministers leaders of fashion and fireeating colonels of the kings bodyguard one of whom captain john peter kirby laid on his heels at ten paces on an april morning when the duel was fought as early as the blessed heavens had given them light to see to do it such days those were there was talk of shutting up the infatuated lady if not incarcerated she was rigidly watched the earl her husband fell altogether to drinking and coaching and other things the ballad makes her say my family my gaolers be my husband is a zany naught see i clear save my bold buccaneer to rescue countess fanny and it goes on o little lass at play on the grass come earn a silver penny and youll be dear to my bold buccaneer for news of his countess fanny in spite of her bravery that poor woman suffered we used to learn by heart the ballads and songs upon famous events in those old days when poetry was worshipped but captain kirby gave provocation enough to both families when he went among the taverns and clubs and vowed before providence over his big fist that they should rue their interference and he would carry off the lady on a day he named he named the hour as well they say and that was midnight of the month of june the levelliers and cressetts foamed at the mouth in speaking of him so enraged they were on account of his age and his passion for a young woman as to blood the kirbys of lincolnshire were quite equal to the cressetts of warwick the old buccaneer seems to have had money too but you can see what her people had to complain of his insolent contempt of them was unexampled and their tyranny had roused my ladys high spirit not a bit less and she said right out when he comes i am ready and will go with him there was boldness for you on both sides all the town was laughing and betting on the event of the night in june and the odds were in favour of kirby for though lord cressett was quite the popular young english nobleman being a capital whip and free of his coin in those days men who had smelt powder were often prized above titles and the feeling out of society was very strong for kirby even previous to the fight on the heath and the age of the indomitable adventurer must have contributed to his popularity he was the hero of every song whats age to me cries kirby why young and fresh let her be but it s mighty better reasoned for a man to be well seasoned and a man she has in me cries kirby as to his exact age write me down sixtythree cries kirby i have always maintained that it was an understatement we must remember it was not kirby speaking but the songwriter kirby would not in my opinion have numbered years he was proud of below their due quantity he was more if he died at ninetyone and chillon switzer john kirby born eleven months after the elopement was we know twenty three years old when the old man gave up the ghost and bequeathed him little besides a lawsuit with the austrian government and the care of carinthia jane the second child of this extraordinary union both children born in wedlock as you will hear sixtythree or sixtyseven near upon seventy when most men are reaping and stacking their sins with groans and weak knees kirby was a match for his juniors which they discovered captain john peter avason kirby son of a lincolnshire squire of an ancient stock was proud of his blood and claimed descent from a chief of the danish rovers whats rank to me cries kirby a titled lass let her be but unless my plans miscarry ill show her when we marry as brave a pedigree cries kirby that was the songwriters answer to the charge that the countess had stooped to a degrading alliance john peter was fourth of a family of seven children all males and hard at the bottle early in life for want of proper occupation he says in his memoirs and applauds his brother stanson the clergyman for being ahead of him in renouncing strong dunks because he found that he cursed better upon water water however helped stanson kirby to outlive his brothers and inherit the lincolnshire property and at the period of the great scandal in london he was palsied and waited on by his grandson and heir ralph thorkill kirby the hero of an adventure celebrated in our law courts and on the english stage for he took possession of his coachmans wife and was accused of compassing the death of the husband he was not hanged for it so we are bound to think him not guilty the stagepiece is called saturday night and it had an astonishing run but is only remembered now for the song of saturday sung by the poor coachman and labourers at the village alehouse before he starts to capture his wife from the clutches of her seducer and meets his fate never was there a more popular song you heard it everywhere i recollect one verse o saturday money is slippery metal and saturday ale it is tipsy stuff at home the old woman is boiling her kettle she thinks we dont know when weve tippled enough we drink and of never a man are we jealous and never a man against us will he speak for who can be hard on a set of poor fellows who only see saturday once a week you chorus the last two lines that was the very song the unfortunate coachman of kirby hall joined in singing before he went out to face his end for the woman he loved he believed in her virtue to the very last the ravished wife of my bosom he calls her all through the latter half of the play it is a real tragedy the songs of that day have lost their effect now i suppose they will ever remain pathetic to me and to hear the poor coachman william martin invoking the name of his dear stolen wife elizabeth jug in hand so tearfully while he joins the song of saturday was a most moving thing you saw nothing but handkerchiefs out all over the theatre what it is that has gone from our drama i cannot tell i am never affected now as i was then and people in a low station of life could affect me then without being flung at me for i dislike an entire dish of them i own we were simpler in our habits and ways of thinking elizabeth martin according to report was a woman to make better men than ralph thorkill act evillyas to good looks i mean she was not entirely guiltless i am afraid though in the last scene mrs kempson who played the part as alas she could do to the very life so threw herself into the pathos of it that there were few to hold out against her and we felt that elizabeth had been misled so much for morality in those days and now for the elopement chapter ii mistress gossip tells of the elopement of the countess of cressett with the old buccaneer and of charles dump the postillion conducting them and of a great county family the twentyfirst of june was the day appointed by captain kirby to carry off countess fanny and the time midnight and ten minutes to the stroke of twelve countess fanny as if she scorned to conceal that she was in a conspiracy with her greyhaired lover notwithstanding that she was watched and guarded left the marchioness of arpingtons ballroom and was escorted downstairs by her brother lord levellier sworn to baffle kirby present with him in the street and witness to the shutting of the carriagedoor on countess fanny were brother officers of his general abrane colonel jack potts and sir upton tomber the door fast shut countess fanny kissed her hand to them and drew up the window seeming merry and as they had expected indignation and perhaps resistance for she could be a spitfire in a temper and had no fear whatever of firearms they were glad to have her safe on such good terms and so general abrane jumped up on the box beside the coachman jack potts jumped up between the footmen and sir upton tomber and the onearmed lord as soon as the carriage was disengaged from the ruck two deep walked on each side of it in the road all the way to lord cressetts town house no one thought of asking where that silly young man wasprobably under some table their numbers were swelled by quite a host going along for heavy bets were on the affair dozens having backed kirby and it must have appeared serious to them with the lady in custody and constables on the look out and kirby and his men nowhere in sight they expected an onslaught at some point of the procession and it may be believed they wished it if only that they might see something for their money a beautiful bright moonlight night it happened to be arm in arm among them were lord pitscrew and russett earl of fleetwood a great friend of kirbys for it was a device of the old buccaneers that helped the earl to win the great welsh heiress who made him even before he took to hoarding and buyingone of the wealthiest noblemen in england but she was crazed by her marriage or the wild scenes leading to it she never presented herself in society she would sit on the top of estlemont towersas they formerly spelt itall day and half the night in midwinter often looking for the mountains down in her native west country covered with an old white flannel cloak and on her head a tall hat of her welsh womenfolk and she died of it leaving a son in her likeness of whom you will hear lord fleetwood had lost none of his faith in kirby and went on booking bets giving him huge odds thousands he accepted fifty to one when the carriage came to a stop at the steps of lord cressetts mansion but he was anxious and well he might be seeing countess fanny alight and pass up between two lines of gentlemen all bowing low before her not a sign of the old buccaneer anywhere to right or left heads were on the look out and vows offered up for his appearance she was at the door and about to enter the house then it was that with a shout of the name of some dreadful heathen god colonel jack potts roared out shes half a foot short o the mark he was on the pavement and it seems he measured her as she slipped by him and one thing and another caused him to smell a cheat and general abrane standing beside her near the door cried where art flying now jack but jack potts grew more positive and bellowed peel her wig were done and she did not speak a word but stood huddledup and hooded and lord levellier caught her up by the arm as she was trying a dash into the hall and sir upton tomber plucked at her veil and raised it and whistled phewwhich struck the rabble below with awe of the cunning of the old buccaneer and there was no need for them to hear general abrane say right jack weve a dead one in hand or jack potts reply its ten thousand pounds clean winged away from my pocket like a string of wild geese the excitement of the varletry in the square they say was fearful to hear so the principal noblemen and gentlemen concerned thought it prudent to hurry the young woman into the house and bar the door and there she was very soon stripped of veil and blonde false wig with long curls the whole framing of her artificial resemblance to countess fanny and she proved to be a goodlooking foreign maid a dark one powdered trembling very much but not so frightened upon hearing that her penalty for the share she had taken in the horrid imposture practised upon them was to receive and return a salute from each of the gentlemen in rotation which the hussy did with proper submission and jack potts remarked that it was an honest buss but dear at ten thousand when you have been the victim of a deceit the explanation of the simplicity of the trick turns all the wonder upon yourself you know and the backers of the old buccaneer and the wagerers against him crowed and groaned in chorus at the maids narrative of how the moment countess fanny had thrown up the window of her carriage she sprang out to a carriage on the off side containing kirby and how she this little french jade sprang in to take her place one snap of the fingers and the transformation was accomplished so for another kiss all round they let her go free and she sat at the suppertable prepared for countess fanny and the party by order of lord levellier and amused the gentlemen with stories of the ladies she had served english and foreign and that is how men are taught to think they know our sex and may despise it i could preach them a lesson those men might as well not believe in the steadfastness of the very stars because one or two are reported lost out of the firmament and now and then we behold a whole shower of fragments descending the truth is they have taken a stain from the life they lead and are troubled puddles incapable of clear reflection to listen to the tattle of a chatting little slut and condemn the whole sex upon her testimony is a nice idea of justice many of the gentlemen present became notorious as womanscorners whether owing to countess fanny or other things lord levellier was and lord fleetwood the wicked man and certainly the hearing of naughty stories of us by the light of a grievous and vexatious instance of our misconduct must produce an impression countess fannys desperate passion for a man of the age of kirby struck them as out of nature they talked of it as if they could have pardoned her a younger lover all that lord cressett said on the announcement of the flight of his wife was ah fan she never would run in my ribbons he positively declined to persue lord levellier would not attempt to follow her up without him as it would have cost money and he wanted all that he could spare for his telescopes and experiments who then was the gentleman who stopped the chariot with his three mounted attendants on the road to the sea on the heath by the great punchbowl that has been the question for now longer than half a century in fact approaching seventy mortal years no one has ever been able to say for certain it occurred at six oclock on the summer morning countess fanny must have known himand not once did she open her mouth to breathe his name yet she had no objection to talk of the adventure and how simon fettle captain kirbys old ships steward in south america seeing horsemen stationed on the ascent of the high road bordering the bowl which is miles round and deep made the postillion cease jogging and sang out to his master for orders and kirby sang back to him to look to his priming and then the postillion was bidden proceed and he did not like it but he had to deal with pistols behind where men feel weak and he went bobbing on the saddle in dejection as if upon his very heart he jogged and soon the fray commenced there was very little parleying between determined men simon fettle was a plain kindly creature without a thought of malice who kept his masters accounts he fired the first shot at the foremost man as he related in after days to reduce the odds kirby said to countess fanny just to comfort her never so much as imagining she would be afraid the worst will be a bloody shirt for simon to mangle for they had been arranging to live cheaply in a cottage on the continent and simon fettle to do the washing she could not help laughing outright but when the old buccaneer was down striding in the battle she took a pistol and descended likewise and she used it too and loaded again she had not to use it a second time kirby pulled the gentleman off his horse wounded in the thigh and while dragging him to countess fanny to crave her pardon a shot intended for kirby hit the poor gentleman in the breast and kirby stretched him at his length and simon and he disarmed the servant who had fired one was insensible one flying and those two on the ground all in broad daylight but so lonely is that spot nothing might have been heard of it if at the end of the week the postillion who had been bribed and threatened with terrible threats to keep his tongue from wagging had not begun to talk so the scene of the encounter was examined and on one spot carefully earthed over blood marks were discovered in the green sand people in the huts on the hill top a quarter of a mile distant spoke of having heard sounds of firing while they were at breakfast and a little boy named tommy wedger said he saw a dead body go by in an open coach that morning all bloody and mournful he had to appear before the magistrates crying terribly but did not know the nature of an oath and was dismissed time came when the boy learned to swear and he did and that he had seen a beautiful lady firing and killing men like pigeons and partridges but that was after charles dump the postillion had been telling the story those who credited charles dumps veracity speculated on dozens of great noblemenand gentlemen known to be dying in love with countess fanny and this brings us to another family i do not say i know anything i do but lay before you the evidence we have to fix suspicion upon a notorious character perfectly capable of trying to thwart a man like kirby and with good reason to try if she had bewitched him to a consuming passion as we are told about eleven miles distant as the crow flies and a bold huntsman will ride in that heath country from the punchbowl right across the mounds and the broad water lies the estate of the fakenhams who intermarried with the coplestones of the iron mines and were the wealthiest of the old county families until curtis fakenham entered upon his inheritance money with him was like the farmwifes dish of grain she tosses in showers to her fowls he was more than what you call a ladykiller he was a womaneater his pride was in it as well as his taste and when men are like that indeed they are devourers curtis was the elder brother of commodore baldwin fakenham whose offspring like his own were so strangely mixed up with captain kirbys children by countess fanny as you will hear and these two brothers were sons of geoffrey fakenham celebrated for his devotion to the french countess jules dandreuze or some such name a courtly gentleman who turned papist on his deathbed in france in brittany somewhere not to be separated from her in the next world as he solemnly left word wickedly many think to show the oddness of things and how opposite to one another brothers may be his elder the uncle of curtis and baldwin was the renowned old admiral fakenham better known along our seacoasts and ports among sailors as old showery because of a remark he once made to his flag captain when cannonballs were coming thick on them in a hardfought action hot work sir his captain said showery replied the admiral as his cockedhat was knocked off by the wind of a cannonball he lost both legs before the war was over and said merrily stumps for life while they were carrying him below to the cockpit in my girlhood the boys were always bringing home anecdotes of old admiral showery not all of them true ones perhaps but they fitted him he was a rough seaman fond as they say of his glass and his girl and utterly despising his brother geoffrey for the airs he gave himself and crawling on his knees to a female parleyvoo and when geoffrey died the admiral drank to his rest in the grave theres to my brother jeff he said and flinging away the dregs of his glass there s to the frog and flinging away the glass to shivers theres to the turncoat he salted his language in a manner i cannot repeat no epithet ever stood by itself when i was young the boys relished these dreadful words because they seemed to smell of tar and battlesmoke when every english boy was for being a sailor and daring the black gentleman below in all truth the bad words came from him though an excellent scholar has assured me they should be taken for aspirates and mean no harm and so it may be but heartily do i rejoice that aspirates have been dropped by people of birth for you might once hear titled ladies guilty of them in polite society i do assure you we have greatly improved in that respect they say the admirals reputation as a british sailor of the old school made him rather his name a great favourite at court but to court he could not be got to go and if the tale be true their majesties paid him a visit on board his ship in harbour one day and sailors tell you that old showery gave his liege lord and lady a common dish of boiled beef with carrots and turnips and a plain dumpling for their dinner with ale and port wine the merit of which he swore to and he became so elate that after the cloth was removed he danced them a hornpipe on his pair of wooden legs whistling his tune and holding his full tumbler of hot grog in his hand all the while without so much as the spilling of a dropso earnest was he in everything he did they say his limit was two bottles of port wine at a sitting with his glass of hot grog to follow and not a soul could induce him to go beyond that in addition to being a great seaman he was a very religious man and a stout churchman well now the curtis fakenham of captain kirbys day had a good deal of his uncle as well as his father in him the spirit of one and the outside of the other and favoured or not he had been distinguished among countess fannys adorers she certainly chose to be silent about the name of the assailant and it has been attested on oath that two days and a night subsequent to the date furnished by charles dump curtis fakenham was brought to his house hollis grange lame of a leg with a shot in his breast that he carried to the family vault and his head gamekeeper john wiltshire a resolute fellow was missing from that hour some said they had a quarrel and curtis was wounded and john wiltshire killed curtis was known to have been extremely attached to the man yet when wiltshire was inquired for he let fall a word of having more of wiltshire than was agreeable to hampshirehis county people asked what that meant yet according to the tale it was the surviving servant by whom he or whoever it may have been was accidentally shot we are in a perfect tangle on the other hand it was never denied that curtis and john wiltshire were in london together at the time of countess fannys flight and curtis fakenham was one of the procession of armed gentleman conducting her in her carriage as they supposed and he was known to have started off on the discovery of the cheat with horrible imprecations against frenchwomen it became known too that horses of his were standing saddled in his innyard at midnight and more charles dump the postillion was taken secretly to set eyes on him as they wheeled him in his gardenwalk and he vowed it was the identical gentleman but this coming by and by to the ear of curtis he had charles dump fetched over to confront him and then the man made oath that he had never seen mr curtis fakenham anywhere but there in his own house at hollis one does not really know what to think of it this postillion made a small fortune he was everywhere in request people were never tired of asking him how he behaved while the fight was going on and he always answered that he sat as close to his horse as he could and did not dream of dismounting for he said he was a figure on a horse and naught when off it his repetition of the story with some adornments and that same remark made him the popular man of the county people said he might enter parliament and i think at one time it was possible but a great success is full of temptations after being hired at inns to fill them with his account of the battle and tipped by travellers from london to show the spot he set up for himself as innkeeper and would have flourished only he had contracted habits on his rounds and he fell to contradicting himself so that he came to be called lying charley and the people of the country said it was he who drained the punchbowl for though he helped to put the capital into it he took all the interest out of it yet we have the doctor of the village of ipley dr cawthorne a noted botanist assuring us of the absolute credibility of charles dump whom he attended in the poor creatures last illness when charles dump confessed he had lived in mortal terror of squire curtis and had got the trick of lying through fear of telling the truth hence his ruin so he died delirious and contrite cawthorne the great turf man inherited a portrait of him from his father the doctor it was often the occasion of the story being told over again and used to hang in the patients reception room next to an oilpainting of the punchbowl an admired landscape picture by a local artist highlytoned and true to every particular of the scene with the bright yellow road winding uphill and the banks of brilliant purple heath and a white thorn in bloom quite beautiful and the green fir trees and the big bowl black as a cauldronindeed a perfect feast of harmonious contrasts in colours and now you know how it is that the names of captain kirby and curtis fakenham are alive to the present moment in the district we lived a happy domestic life in those old coaching days when county affairs and county people were the topics of firesides and the country enclosed us to make us feel snug in our own importance my opinion is that men and women grow to their dimensions only where such is the case we had our alarms from the outside now and again but we soon relapsed to dwell upon our private business and our pleasant little hopes and excitements the courtships and the crosses and the scandals the tea parties and the dances and how the morning looked after the stormy night had passed and the coach coming down the hill with a box of news and perhaps a curious passenger to drop at the inn i do believe we had a liking for the very highwaymen if they had any reputation for civility what i call human events things concerning you and me instead of the deafening catastrophes now afflicting and taking all conversation out of us had their natural interest then we studied the face of each morning as it came and speculated upon the secret of the thing it might have in store for us or our heroes and heroines we thought of them more than of ourselves long after the adventures of the punchbowl our county was anxious about countess fanny and the old buccaneer wondering where they were and whether they were prospering whether they were just as much in love as ever and which of them would bury the other and what the foreign people abroad thought of that strange pair chapter iii continuation of the introductory meanderings of dame gossip together with her sudden extinction i have still time before me according to the terms of my agreement with the person to whom i have i fear foolishly entrusted the letters and documents of a story surpassing ancient as well as modern in the wonderment it causes that would make the law courts bless their hearts judges no less than the barristers to have it running through them day by day with every particular to wrangle over and many to serve as a text for the pulpit so to proceed it should be mentioned that the postillion charles dump is not represented and i have no conception of the reason why not sitting on horseback in the portrait in the possession of the cawthorne family i have not seen it i am bound to admit we had offended dr cawthorne by once in an urgent case calling in another doctor who he would have it was a quack that ought to have killed us and we ceased to visit but a gentleman who was an established patient of dr cawthornes and had frequent opportunities of judging the portrait in the course of a chronic malady describes charles dump on his legs as a small man looking diminished from a very much longer one by shrinkage in thickish wrinkles from the shoulders to the shanks his hat is enormous and very gay he is rather of sad countenance an elevation of his collar behind the ears and pointed at the neck gives you notions of his having dropped from some hook he stands with his forefinger extended like a disused semaphorepost that seems tumbling and desponding on the hill by the highroad in his attitude while telling the tale if standing it may be called where the whole figure appears imploring for a seat that was his natural position as one would suppose any artist must have thought and a horse beneath him but it has been suggested that the artist in question was no painter of animals then why did he not get a painter of animals to put in the horse it is vain to ask though it is notorious that artists combine without bickering to do these things and one puts his name on the animal the other on the human being or landscape my informant adds that the prominent feature telling a melancholy tale of its own is of sanguine colour and while plainly in the act of speaking charles dump might be fancied about to drop off to sleep he was impressed by the dreaminess of the face and i must say i regard him as an interesting character during my girlhood napoleon bonaparte alone would have been his rival for filling an inn along our roads i have known our boys go to bed obediently and get up at night to run three miles to the wheatsheaf only to stand on the bench or travellersrest outside the window and look in at charles dump reciting with just room enough in the crowd to point his finger as his way was he left a child mary dump who grew up to become ladys maid to livia fakenham daughter of curtis the beauty of hampshire equalled by no one save her cousin henrietta fakenham the daughter of commodore baldwin and they were two different kinds of beauties not to be compared and different were their fortunes for this lady was likened to the sun going down on a cloudy noon and that lady to the moon riding through a stormy night livia was the young widow of lord duffield when she accepted the earl of fleetwood and was his third countess and again a widow at eightandtwenty and stepmother to young croesus the earl of fleetwood of my story mary dump testifies to her kindness of heart to her dependents if we are to speak of goodness i am afraid there are other witnesses i resent being warned that my time is short and that i have wasted much of it over the attractive charles what i have done i have done with a purpose and it must be a storyteller devoid of the rudiments of his art who can complain of my dwelling on charles dump for the world to have a pause and pin its faith to him which it would not do to a grander personthat is as a peg wonderful events however true they are must be attached to something common and familiar to make them credible charles dump i say is like a frontpage picture to a history of those old quiet yet exciting days in england and when once you have seized him the whole period is alive to you as it was to me in the delicious dulness i loved that made us thirsty to hear of adventures and able to enjoy to the utmost every thing occurring the man is no more attractive to me than a lump of clay how could he be but supposing i took up the lump and told you that there where i found it that lump of clay had been rolled over and flung off by the left wheel of the prophets chariot of fire before it mounted aloft and disappeared in the heavens above you would examine it and cherish it and have the scene present with you you may be sure and magnificent descriptions would not be onehalf so persuasive and that is what we call in my profession art if you please so to continue the earl of cressett fell from his coachbox in a fit and died of it a fortnight after the flight of his wife and the people said she might as well have waited kirby and countess fanny were at lucerne or lausanne or some such place in switzerland when the news reached them and kirby without losing an hour laid hold of an english clergyman of the established church and put him through the ceremony of celebrating his lawful union with the beautiful young creature he adored and this he did he said for the world to guard his fan in a wider circle than his two arms could compass if not quite so well so the old buccaneer was ever after that her lawful husband and as his wedded wife not wedded to a fool she was an example to her sex like many another woman who has begun badly with a lightheaded mate it is hard enough for a man to be married to a fool but a man is only half cancelled by that burden it has been said whereas a woman finds herself on board a rudderless vessel and often the desperate thing she does is to avoid perishing ten months or eleven some say following the proclamation of the marriagetie a son was born to countess fanny close by the castle of chillononthelake and he had the name of chillon switzer john kirby given to him to celebrate the fact two years later the girl was born and for the reason of her first seeing the light in that austrian province she was christened carinthia jane she was her old fathers pet but countess fanny gloried in the boy she had fancied she would be a childless woman before he gave sign of coming and they say she wrote a little volume of meditations in prospect of approaching motherhood for the guidance of others in a similar situation i have never been able to procure the book or pamphlet but i know she was the best of mothers and of wives too and she with her old husband growing like a rose out of a weatherbeaten rock proved she was that among those handsome foreign officers poorly remarkable for their morals not once had the old buccaneer to teach them a lesson think of it and you will know that her feet did not straynor did her pretty eyes her heart was too full for the cravings of vanity innocent ladies who get their husbands into scrapes are innocent perhaps but knock you next door in their bosoms where the soul resides and ask for information of how innocence and uncleanness may go together kirby purchased a mine in carinthia on the borders of styria and worked it himself his native land displeased him so that he would not have been unwilling to see chillon enter the austrian service which the young man was inclined for subsequent to his return to his parents from one of the english public schools notwithstanding his passionate love for old england but lord levellier explained the mystery in a letter to his halfforgiven sister praising the boy for his defence of his mothers name at the school where a big brutal fellow sneered at her and chillon challenged him to sword or pistol and then he walked down to the boys home in staffordshire to force him to fight and the father of the boy made him offer an apology that was not much balm to master chillons wound he returned to his mother quite heavy unlike a young man and the unhappy lady though she knew him to be bitterly sensitive on the point of honour and especially as to everything relating to her saw herself compelled to tell him the history of her life to save him as she thought from these chivalrous vindications of her good name she may have even painted herself worse than she was both to excuse her brothers miserliness to her son and the worlds evil speaking of her wisely or not she chose this course devotedly to protect him from the perils she foresaw in connection with the name of the once famous countess fanny in the british isles and thus are we stricken by the days of our youth it is impossible to moralize conveniently when one is being hurried by a person at ones elbow so the young man heard his mother out and kissed her and then he went secretly to vienna and enlisted and served for a year as a private in the regiment of hussars called my papers tell me liechtenstein and what with his good conduct and the help of kirbys friends he would have obtained a commission from the emperor when at the right moment to keep a sprig of kirbys growth for his country lord levellier sent word that he was down for a cornetcy in a british regiment of dragoons chillon came home from a garrison town and there was a consultation about his future career shall it be england shall it be austria countess fannys voice was for england and she carried the vote knowing though she did that it signified separation and it might be alienationwhere her son would chance to hear things he could not refute she believed that her son by such a man as kirby would be of use to his country and her voice against herself was for england it broke her heart if she failed to receive the regular letter she pined and was disconsolate he has heard more of me was in her mind her husband sat looking at her with his old large grey glassy eyes you would have fancied him awaiting her death as the signal for his own release but she poor mother behind her weeping lids beheld her sons filial love of her wounded and bleeding when there was anything to be done for her old kirby was astir when it was nothing either in physic or assistance he was like a great corner of rock you may indeed imagine grief in the very rock that sees its flower fading to the withered shred on the last night of her life this old man of past ninety carried her in his arms up a flight of stairs to her bed a week after her burial kirby was found a corpse in the mountain forest his having called the death of his darling his lightningstroke must have been the origin of the report that he died of lightning he touched not a morsel of food from the hour of the dropping of the sod on her coffin of ebony wood an old crust of their mahogany bread supposed at first to be a specimen of quartz was found in one of his coat pockets he kissed his girl carinthia before going out on his last journey from home and spoke some wandering words the mine had not been worked for a year she thought she would find him at the mouth of the shaft where he would sometimes be sitting and staring already dead at heart with the death he saw coming to the beloved woman they had to let her down with ropes that she might satisfy herself he was not below she and her great dog and a faithful manservant discovered the body in the forest chillon arrived from england to see the common grave of both his parents and now goodbye to sorrow for a while keep your tears for the living and first i am going to describe to you the young earl of fleetwood son of the strange welsh lady the richest nobleman of his time and how he persued and shunned the lady who had fascinated him henrietta the daughter of commodore baldwin fakenham and how he met carinthia jane and concerning that lovely henrietta and chillon kirbylevellier and of the young poet of ordinary parentage and the giant captain abrane and livia the widowed countess of fleetwood henriettas cousin daughter of curtis fakenham and numbers of others lord levellier lord brailstone lord simon pitscrew chumley potts young ambrose mallard and the english pugilist such a man of honour though he drank and the adventures of madge carinthia janes maid just a few touches and then the marriage dividing great britain into halves taking sides after that i trust you may go on as i would carry you were we all twenty years younger had i but sooner been in possession of these treasured papers i promise you excitement enough if justice is done to them but i must and will describe the wedding this young earl of fleetwood you should know was a very powdermagazine of ambition and never would he break his word which is right if we are properly careful and so he she ceases according to the terms of the treaty the venerable ladys time has passed an extinguisher descends on her giving her the likeness of one under condemnation of the most holy inqusition in the ranks of an auto da fe and singularly resembling that victim at the first sharp bite of the flames she will be when she hears the version of her story chapter iv morning and farewell to an old home brother and sister were about to leave the mountainland for england they had not gone to bed overnight and from the windows of their deserted home a little before dawn they saw the dwindled moon a late riser break through droves of hunted cloud directly topping their ancient guardian height the triple peak and giant of the range friendlier in his name than in aspect for the two young people clinging to the scene they were to quit his name recalled olddays the apparition of his head among the heavens drummed on their sense of banishment to the girl this was a division of her life and the dawn held the sword she felt herself midswing across a gulf that was the grave of one half without a light of promise for the other her passionate excess of attachment to her buried home robbed the future of any colours it might have worn to bid a young heart quicken and england though she was of british blood was a foreign place to her not alluring her brother had twice come out of england reserved in speech her mothers talk of england had been unhappy her father had suffered illtreatment there from a brutal institution termed the admiralty and had never regretted the not seeing england again the thought that she was bound thitherward enfolded her like a frosty mist but these bare walls these loud floors chill rooms dull windows and the vaultsounding of the ghostly house everywhere the absence of the faces in the house told her she had no choice she must go the appearance of her old friend the towering mountainheight up a blue nightsky compelled her swift mind to see herself far away yearning to him out of exile an exile that had no local features she would not imagine them to give a centre of warmth her wilful grief preferred the blank it resembled death in seeming some hollowness behind a shroud which we shudder at the room was lighted by a stablelantern on a kitchentable their seat near the window was a rickety gardenbench rejected in the headlong sale of the furniture and when she rose unable to continue motionless while the hosts of illuminated cloud flew fast she had to warn her brother to preserve his balance he tacitly did so aware of the necessity she walked up and down the long sevenwindowed saloon haunted by her footfall trying to think chafing at his quietness and acknowledging that he did well to be quiet they had finished their packing of boxes and of wearingapparel for the journey there was nothing to think of nothing further to talk of nothing for her to do save to sit and look and deaden her throbs by counting them she soon returned to her seat beside her brother with the marvel in her breast that the house she desired so much to love should be cold and repel her now it was a vacant shell her memories could not hang within it anywhere she shut her eyes to be with the images of the dead conceiving the method as her brothers happy secret and imitated his posture elbows propped on knees to support the chin his quietness breathed of a deeper love than her own meanwhile the high wind had sunk the moon after pushing her withered half to the zenith was climbing the dusky edge revealed fitfully threads and wisps of thin vapour travelled along a falling gale and branched from the dome of the sky in migratory broken lines like wild birds shifting the order of flight north and east where the dawn sat in a web but as yet had done no more than shoot up a glow along the central heavens in amid the waves of deepened aloud a mirror for night to see her dark self in her own hue a shiver between the silent couple pricked their wits and she said chillon shall we run out and call the morning it was an old game of theirs encouraged by their hearty father to be out in the early hour on a rise of ground near the house and call the morning her brother was glad of the challenge and upon one of the yawns following a sleepless night replied with a return to boyishness yes if you like its the last time we shall do her the service here lets go they sprang up together and the bench fell behind them swinging the lantern he carried inconsiderately the ring of it was left on his finger and the end of candle rolled out of the crazy frame to the floor and was extinguished chillon had no matchbox he said to her what do you think of the windowweve done it before carin better than groping down stairs and passages blocked with lumber im ready she said and caught at her skirts by instinct to prove her readiness on the spot a drop of a dozen feet or so from the french window to a flowerbed was not very difficult her father had taught her how to jump besides the how of many other practical things she leaped as lightly as her brother never touching earth with her hands and rising from the proper contraction of the legs in taking the descent she quoted her father mean it when youre doing it for no enemys shot is equal to a weak heart in the act chillon pursued the quotation laying his hand on her shoulder for a sign of approval she looked up at him they passed down the garden and a sloping meadow to a brook swollen by heavy rains over the brook on a narrow plank and up a steep and stony pathway almost a watercourse between rocks to another meadow level with the house that led ascending through a firwood and there the change to thicker darkness told them light was abroad though whether of the clouded moon or of the first grey of the quiet revolution was uncertain metallic light of a subterranean realm it might have been thought you remember everything of father carinthia said we both do said chillon she pressed her brothers arm we will we will never forget anything beyond the firwood light was visibly the dawns halfway down the ravines it resembled the light cast off a torrent water it lay on the grass like a sheet of unreflecting steel and was a face without a smile above their childhood ran along the tracks to the forest by the light which was neither dim nor cold but grave presenting tree and shrub and dwarf growth and grass austerely not deepening or confusing them they wound their way by borders of crag seeing in a dell below the mouth of the idle mine begirt with weedy and shrubhung rock a dripping semi circle farther up they came on the flat juniper and crossed a wet groundthicket of whortleberry their feet were in the moist moss among sprigs of heath and a great firtree stretched his length a peeled multitude of his dead fellows leaned and stood upright in the midst of scattered firestained members and through their skeleton limbs the sheer precipice of slaterock of the bulk across the chasm nursery of hawk and eagle wore a thin blue tinge the sign of warmer light abroad this way my brother cried carinthia shuddering at a path he was about to follow dawn in the mountainland is a meeting of many friends the pinnacle the foresthead the latschentufted mound rockbastion and defiant cliff and giant of the triple peak were in view clearly lined for a common recognition but all were figures of solid gloom unfeatured and bloomless another minute and they had flung off their mail and changed to various indented intricate succinct in ridge scar and channel and they had all a look of watchfulness that made them one company the smell of rockwaters and roots of herb and moss grew keen air became a wine that raised the breast high to breathe it an uplifting coolness pervaded the heights what wonder that the mountainbred girl should let fly her voice the natural carol woke an echo she did not repeat it and we will not forget our home chillon she said touching him gently to comfort some saddened feeling the plumes of cloud now slowly entered into the lofty arch of dawn and melted from brown to purpleblack the upper sky swam with violet and in a moment each stray cloudfeather was edged with rose and then suffused it seemed that the heights fronted east to eye the interflooding of colours and it was imaginable that all turned to the giant whose forehead first kindled to the sun a greeting of god and king on the morning of a farewell we fluctuate sharply between the very distant and the close and homely and even in memory the fluctuation occurs the grander scene casting us back on the modestly nestling and that when it has refreshed us conjuring imagination to embrace the splendour and wonder but the wrench of an immediate division from what we love makes the things within us reach the dearest we put out our hands for them as violentlyparted lovers do though the soul in days to come would know a craving and imagination flap a leaden wing if we had not looked beyond them shall we go down said carinthia for she knew a little cascade near the house showering on rock and fern and longed to have it round her they descended chillon saying that they would soon have the mists rising and must not delay to start on their journey the armies of the young sunrise in mountainlands neighbouring the plains vast shadows were marching over woods and meads black against the edge of golden and great heights were cut with them and bounding waters took the leap in a silvery radiance to gloom the bright and dark banded valleys were like night and morning taking hands down the sweep of their rivers immense was the range of vision scudding the peaks and over the illimitable eastward plains flat to the very east and sources of the sun carinthia said when i marry i shall come here to live and die her brother glanced at her he was fond of her and personally he liked her face but such a confident anticipation of marriage on the part of a portionless girl set him thinking of the character of her charms and the attraction they would present to the world of men they were expressive enough at times he had thought them marvellous in their clear cut of the animating mindno one could fancy her handsome and just now her hair was in some disorder a night without sleep had an effect on her complexion its not usually the wife who decides where to live said he her ideas were anywhere but with the dream of a husband could we stay on another day my dear girl another night on that crazy stool besides mariandl is bound to go today to her new place and whos to cook for us do you propose fasting as well as watching could i cook she asked him humbly no you couldnt not for a starving regiment your accomplishments are of a different sort no its better to get over the pain at once if we cant escape it that i think too said she and we should have to buy provisions then brother instantly after breakfast only let us walk it i know the whole way and it is not more than a two days walk for you and me consent driving would be like going gladly i could never bear to remember that i was driven away and walking will save money we are not rich you tell me brother a few florins more or less he rejoined rather frowning you have good styrian boots i see but i want to be over at the baths there soon not later than tomorrow but brother if they know we are coming they will wait for us and we can be there tomorrow night or the next morning he considered it he wanted exercise and loved this mountainland his inclinations melted into hers though he had reasons for hesitating well well send on my portmanteau and your boxes in the cart well walk it youre a capital walker youre a gallant comrade i wouldnt wish for a better he wondered as he spoke whether any truehearted gentleman besides himself would ever think the same of this lonely girl her eyes looked a delighted noreally for the sweetest on earth to her was to be prized by her brother she hastened forward we will go down and have our last meal at home she said in the dialect of the country we have five eggs no meat for you dear but enough bread and butter some honey left and plenty of coffee i should like to have left old mariandl more but we are unable to do very much for poor people now milk i cannot say she is just the kind soul to be up and out to fetch us milk for an early first breakfast but she may have overslept herself chillon smiled you were right janet about not going to bed last night we might have missed the morning i hate sleep i hate anything that robs me of my will she replied youd be glad of your doses of sleep if you had to work and study to fall down by the wayside tired outyes brother a dead sleep is good then you are in the hands of god father used to say four hours for a man six for a woman and four and twenty for a lord added chillon i remember a lord of that admiralty she appealed to his closer recollection but i mean brother dreaming is what i detest so dont be detesting my dear reserve your strength said he i suppose dreams are of some use now and then i shall never think them useful when we cant get what we want my good carin then we should not waste ourselves in dreams they promise falsely sometimes thats no reason why we should reject the consolation when we cant get what we want my little sister i would not be denied theres the impossible not for you brother perhaps a halfminute after she had spoken he said pursuing a dialogue within himself aloud rather than revealing a secret you dont know her position carinthias heart stopped beating who was this person suddenly conjured up she fancied she might not have heard correctly she feared to ask and yet she perceived a novel softness in him that would have answered pain of an unknown kind made her love of her brother conscious that if she asked she would suffer greater pain the house was in sight a long white building with blinds down at some of the windows and some wide open some showing unclean glass the three aspects and signs of a houses emptiness when they are seen together carinthia remarked on their having met nobody it had a serious meaning for them formerly they were proud of outstripping the busy population of the mine coming down on them with wild wavings and shouts of sunrise they felt the death again a whole field laid low by one stroke and wintriness in the season of glad life a wind had blown and all had vanished the second green of the year shot lively sparkles off the meadows from a fringe of coloured glovelets to a warm silver lake of dews the firwood was already breathing rich and sweet in the sun the halfmoon fell rayless and paler than the fan of fleeces pushed up westward high overhead themselves dispersing on the blue in downy feathers like the mottled grey of an eagles breast the smaller of them bluish like traces of the beaked woodpigeon she looked above then below on the slim and straightgrown flocks of naked purple crocuses in bud and blow abounding over the meadow that rolled to the level of the house and two of these she gathered chapter v a mountain walk in mist and sunshine chillon was right in his forecast of the mists an overmoistened earth steaming to the sun obscured it before the two had finished breakfast which was a finish to everything eatable in the ravaged dwelling with the exception of a sly store for the midday meal that old mariandl had stuffed into chillons leather sackthe fruit of secret begging on their behalf about the neighbourhood he found the sack heavy and bulky as he slung it over his shoulders but she bade him make nothing of such a trifle till he had it inside him and you that love tea so my pretty one so that you always laughed and sang after drinking a cup with your mother she said to carinthia you will find one pinch of it in your bag at the end of the leftfoot slipper to remember your home by when you are out in the world she crossed the strap of the bag on her mistresss bosom and was embraced by carinthia and chillon in turns carinthia telling her to dry her eyes for that she would certainly come back and perhaps occupy the house one day or other the old soul moaned of eyes that would not be awake to behold her she begged a visit at her grave though it was to be in a catholic burialplace and the priests had used her dear master and mistress ill not allowing them to lie in consecrated ground affection made her a champion of religious tolerance and a little afraid of retribution carinthia soothed her kissed her gave the promise and the parting was over she and chillon had on the previous day accomplished a pilgrimage to the restingplace of their father and mother among humble protestants iron smelters in a valley out of the way of their present line of march to the glacier of the great snowmountain marking the junction of three alpine provinces of austria josef the cartdriver with the boxes who was to pass the valley vowed of his own accord to hang a fresh days wreath on the rails he would not hear of money for the purchase and they humoured him the family had been beloved there was an offer of a home for carinthia in the castle of count lebern a friend of her parents much taken with her and she would have accepted it had not chillon overruled her choice determined that as she was english she must come to england and live under the guardianship of her uncle lord levellier of whose character he did not speak the girls cheeks were drawn thin and her lips shut as they departed she was tearless a phantom ring of mist accompanied her from her first footing outside the house she did not look back the house came swimming and plunging after her like a spectral ship on big seas and her father and mother lived and died in her breast and now they were strong consulting chatting laughing caressing now still and white caught by a vapour that dived away with them either to right or left but always with the same suddenness leaving her to question herself whether she existed for more of life seemed to be with their mystery than with her speculations the phantom ring of mist enclosing for miles the invariable lowsweeping dark sprucefir kept her thoughts on them as close as the shroud she walked fast but scarcely felt that she was moving near midday the haunted circle widened rocks were loosely folded in it and heads of trees whose round intervolving roots grasped the yellow roadside soil the mists shook like a curtain and partly opened and displayed a tapestrylandscape roughly worked of woollen crag and castle and suggested glen threaded waters very prominent foreground autumn flowers on banks a predominant atmospheric greyness the sun threw a shaft liquid instead of burning as we see his beams beneath a wave and then the mists narrowed again boiled up the valleys and streams above the mountain curled and flew and were python coils pierced by brighter arrows of the sun a spot of blue signalled his victory above to look at it was to fancy they had been walking under water and had now risen to the surface carinthias mind stepped out of the chamber of death the different air and scene breathed into her a timid warmth toward the future and between her naming of the lesser mountains on their side of the pass she asked questions relating to england and especially the ladies she was to see at the baths beyond the glacier pass she had heard of a party of his friends awaiting him there without much encouragement from him to ask particulars of them and she had hitherto abstained as she was rather shy of meeting her countrywomen the ladies chillon said were cousins one was a young widow the countess of fleetwood and the other was miss fakenham a younger lady carinthia murmured in german poor soul which one was she pitying the widow she said in the tone implying naturally her brother assured her the widow was used to it for this was her second widowhood she marries again exclaimed the girl you dont like that idea said he carinthia betrayed a delicate shudder her brother laughed to himself at her expressive present tense and marries again he said there will certainly be a third husband said she as at the incredible husband lets hope he answered she dropped from her contemplation of the lady and her look at her brother signified it will not be you chillon was engaged in spying for a place where he could spread out the contents of his bag sharp hunger beset them both at the mention of eating a bank of sloping green shaded by a chestnut proposed the seat and here he relieved the bag of a bottle of wine slices of meat bread hard eggs and lettuce a chipped cup to fling away after drinking the wine and a supply of small butlercakes known to be favourites with carinthia she reversed the order of the feast by commencing upon one of the cakes to do honour to mariandls thoughtfulness as at their breakfast they shared the last morsel but we would have made it enough for our dear old dog pluto as well if he had lived said carinthia sighing with her thankfulness and compassionate regrets a mixture often inspiring a tender babbling melancholy dogs eyes have such a sick look of love he might have lived longer though he was very old only he could not survive the loss of father i know the finding of the body broke his heart he sprang forward he stopped and threw up his head it was human language to hear him chillon he lay in the yard trying to lift his eyes when i came to him they were so heavy and he had not strength to move his poor old tail more than once he died with his head on my lap he seemed to beg me and i took him and he breathed twice and that was his end pluto old dog well for you or for me brother we could not have a better wish as for me death when we know we are to die only let my darling live that is my prayer and that we two may not be separated till i am taken to their grave father bought ground for fourhis wife and himself and his two children it does not oblige us to be buried there but could we have any other desire she stretched her hand to her brother he kissed it spiritedly look ahead my dear girl help me to finish this wine there s nothing like good hard walking to give common wine of the country a flavourand out of broken crockery i think it so good carinthia replied after drinking from the cup in england they do not grow wine are the people there kind theyre civilized people of course kindwarm to you chillon some of them when you know them warm is hardly the word winters warm on skates you must do a great deal for yourself they dont boil over by the way dont expect much of your uncle will he not love me he gives you a lodging in his house and food enough well hope you wont see company or much of him i cannot exist without being loved i do not care for company he must love me a little he is one of the warmhearted racehes mothers brother but where his heart is i ve not discovered bear with him just for the present my dear till i am able to support you i will she said the dreary vision of a home with an unloving uncle was not brightened by the alternative of her brothers having to support her she spoke of money have we none chillon we have no debts he answered we have a claim on the government here for indemnification for property taken to build a fortress upon one of the passes into italy father bought the land thinking there would be a yield of ore thereabout and they have seized it rightly enough but they dispute our claim for the valuation we put on it a small sum they would consent to pay it would be a very small sum and i m fathers son i will have justice yes carthinia joined with him to show the same stout nature we have nothing else except a bit to toss up for luck and how can i help being a burden on my brother she inquired in distress marry and be a blessing to a husband he said lightly they performed a sacrifice of the empty bottle and cracked cup on the site of their meal as if it had been a ceremony demanded from travellers and leaving them in fragments proceeded on their journey refreshed walking was now high enjoyment notwithstanding the force of the sun for they were a hardy couple requiring no more than sufficient nourishment to combat the elements with an exulting blood besides they loved mountain air and scenery and each step to the ridge of the pass they climbed was an advance in splendour peaks of ashen hue and pale dry red and pale sulphur pushed up straight forked twisted naked striking their minds with an indeterminate ghostliness of indian so strange they were in shape and colouring these sharp points were the first to greet them between the blue and green a depression of the pass to the left gave sight of the points of black fir forest below round the girths of the barren shafts mountain blocks appeared pushing up in front and a mountain wall and woods on it and mountains in the distance and cliffs riven with falls of water that were silver skeins down lower to meadows villages and spires and lower finally to the whole valley of the foaming river field and river seeming in imagination rolled out from the hand of the heading mountain but see this in winter as i did with father chillon said carinthia she said it upon loves instinct to halo the scene with something beyond present vision and to sanctify it for her brother so that this walk of theirs together should never be forgotten a smooth fold of cloud moveless along one of the upper pastures and still dense enough to be luminous in sunlight was the last of the mist they watched it lying in the form of a fish leviathan diminished as they descended their path and the head was lost the tail spread peacockwise and evaporated slowly in that likeness and soft to a breath of air as gossamer down the body became a ball a cock a little lizard nothingness the bluest bright day of the year was shining chillon led the descent with his trim and handsome figure before her carinthia remembered the current saying that he should have been the girl and she the boy that was because he resembled their mother in face but the build of his limbs and shoulders was not feminine to her admiring eyes he had a look superior to simple strength and grace the look of a great skybird about to mount a fountainlike energy of stature delightful to her contemplation and he had the mouth women put faith in for decision and fixedness she did most fully and reflecting how entirely she did so the thought assailed her some one must be loving him she allowed it to surprise her not choosing to revert to an uneasy sensation of the morning that some one her process of reasoning informed her was necessarily an english young lady she reserved her questions till they should cease this hopping and heeling down the zigzag of the slippery pathtrack when children they had been collectors of beetles and butterflies and the flying by of a royalmantle the purple butterfly grandly fringed could still remind carinthia of the event it was of old to spy and chase one chillon himself was not above the sentiment of their very early days he stopped to ask if she had been that lustrous bluewing a rarer species prized by youngsters shoot through the chestnut trees and they both paused for a moment gazing into the fairyland of infancy she seeing with her brothers eyes this prince of the realm having escaped her he owned he might have been mistaken as the brilliant fellow flew swift and high between leaves like an ordinary fritillary not the less did they get their glimpse of the wonders in the sunny eternity of a childs afternoon an auerhahn chillon she said picturing the maturer day when she had scaled perilous heights with him at night to stalk the blackcock in the prime of the morning she wished they could have had another such adventure to stamp the old home on his heart freshly to tile exclusion of beautiful english faces on the level of the valley where they met the torrentriver walking side by side with him she ventured an inquiry english girls are fair girls are they not there are some dark also he replied but the bestlooking are fair perhaps they are with us mother was fair she was i have only seen a few of them once at vies and at venice and those baths we are going to and at meran i think you considered them charming not all it was touching that she should be such a stranger to her countrywomen he drew a portraitcase from his breastpocket pressing the spring and handed it to her saying there is one he spoke indifferently but as soon as she had seen the face inside it with a look at him and a deep breath she understood that he was an altered brother and that they were three instead of two she handed it back to him saying hushedly and only yes he did not ask an opinion upon the beauty she had seen his pace increased and she hastened her steps beside him she had not much to learn when some minutes later she said shall i see her chillon she is one of the ladies we are to meet what a pity carinthia stepped faster enlightened as to his wish to get to the baths without delay and her heart softened in reflecting how readily he had yielded to her silly preference for going on foot her cry of regret was equivocal it produced no impression on him they reached a village where her leader deemed it adviseable to drive for the remainder of the distance up the valley to the barrier snowmountain she assented instantly she had no longer any active wishes of her own save to make amends to her brother who was and would ever be her brother she could not be robbed of their relationship something undefined in her feeling of possession she had been robbed of she knew it by her spiritlessness and she would fain have attributed it to the idle motion of the car now and them stupidly jolting her on after the valiant exercise of her limbs they were in a land of waterfalls and busy mills a narrowing vale where the runs of grass grew short and wild and the glacierriver roared for the leap more foam than water and the savagery naturally exciting to her breathed of its lair among the rocks and icefields her brother said there he is she saw the whitecrowned king of the region of whose near presence to her old home she had been accustomed to think proudly end she looked at him without springing to him and continued imaging her english home and her loveless uncle merely admiring the scene as if the fire of her soul had been extinguished marry and be a blessing to a husband chillons words whispered of the means of escape from the den of her uncle but who would marry me she thought an unreproved sensation of melting pervaded her she knew her capacity for gratitude and conjuring it up in her heart there came with it the noble knightly gentleman who would really stoop to take a plain girl by the hand release her and say be mine his vizor was down of course she had no power of imagining the lineaments of that prodigy or was he a dream he came and went her mother not unkindly sadly had counted her poor girls chances of winning attention and a husband her father had doated on her face but as she argued her father had been attracted by her mother a beautiful woman and this was a circumstance that reflected the greater hopelessness on her prospects she bore a likeness to her father little to her mother though he fancied the reverse and gave her the mothers lips and hair thinking of herself however was destructive to the form of her mirror of knightliness he wavered he fled for good as the rosy vapour born of our sensibility must do when we relapse to coldness and the more completely when we try to command it no she thought a plain girl should think of work to earn her independence women are not permitted to follow armies chillon she said he laughed out what s in your head the laugh abashed her she murmured of women being good nurses for wounded soldiers if they were good walkers to march with the army and as evidently it sounded witless to him she added to seem reasonable you have not told me the christian names of those ladies he made queer eyes over the puzzle to connect the foregoing and the succeeding in her remarks but answered straightforwardly livia is one and henrietta her ear seized on the stress of his voice henrietta she chose that name for the name of the person disturbing her it fused best she thought with the new element she had been compelled to take into her system to absorb it if she could youre not scheming to have them serve as army hospital nurses my dear no chillon you cant explain it i suppose a sister could go too when you go to war chillon a sister could go if it were permitted by the authorities and be near her brother to nurse him in case of wounds others would be unable to claim the privilege that was her meaning involved with the hazy project of earning an independence but she could not explain it and chillon set her down for one of the inexplicable sex which the simple adventurous girl had not previously seemed to be she was inwardly warned of having talked foolishly and she held her tongue her humble and modest jealousy scarce deserving the title passed with a sigh or two it was her first taste of life in the world a fit of heavymindedness ensued that heightened the contrast her recent mood had bequeathed between herself ignorant as she was and those ladies their names livia and henrietta soared above her and sang the music of the splendid spheres henrietta was closer to earth for her features had been revealed she was therefore the dearer and the richer for him who loved her being one of us though an overearthly one and carinthia gave her to chillon reserving for herself a handmaidens place within the circle of their happiness this done she sat straight in the car it was toiling up the steep ascent of a glen to the mountain village the last of her native province her proposal to walk was accepted and the speeding of her blood now that she had mastered a new element in it soon restored her to her sisterly affinity with natural glories the sunset was on yonder side of the snows here there was a feast of variouslytinted sunset shadows on snow meadows rock river serrated cliff the peaked cap of the rushing rockdotted sweeps of upward snow caught a scarlet illumination one flank of the white in heaven was violetted wonderfully at nightfall under a clear black sky alive with wakeful fires round head and breast of the great alp chillon and carinthia strolled out of the village and he told her some of his hopes they referred to inventions of destructive weapons which were primarily to place his country out of all danger from a world in arms and also it might be mentioned to bring him fortune for i must have money he said sighing it out like a deliberate oath he and his uncle were associated in the inventions they had an improved rocket that would force military chiefs to change their tactics they had a new powder a rifle a model musketthe latter based on his own plans and a scheme for fortress artillery likely to turn the preponderance in favour of the defensive once again and that will be really doing good said chillon for where its with the offensive theres everlasting bullying and plundering carinthia warmly agreed with him but begged him be sure his uncle divided the profits equally she discerned what his need of money signified tenderness urged her to say henrietta chillon well he answered quickly will she wait can she you should ask is she brave who can tell till she has been tried is she quite free she has not yet been captured brother is there no one else theres a nobleman anxious to bestow his titles on her he is rich the first or second wealthiest in great britain they say is he young about the same age as mine is he a handsome young man handsomer than your brother my girl no no no said she and what if he is and your henrietta does not choose him now let me think what i long to think i have her close to me she rocked a roseate image on her heart and went to bed with it by starlight by starlight they sprang to their feet and departed the next morning in the steps of a guide carrying chillon said a better lantern than we left behind us at the smithy father exclaimed carinthia on her swift inward breath for this one of the names he had used to give to her old home revived him to her thoughts and senses fervently chapter vi the natural philosopher three parts down a swift decline of shattered slate where travelling stones loosened from rows of scree hurl away at a bound after one roll over there sat a youth dusty and torn nursing a bruised leg not in the easiest of postures on a sharp tooth of rock that might at any moment have broken from the slanting slab at the end of which it formed a stump and added him a second time to the general crumble of the mountain he had done a portion of the descent in excellent imitation of the detached fragments and had parted company with his alpenstock and plaid preserving his hat and his knapsack he was alone disabled and cheerful in doubt of the arrival of succour before he could trust his left leg to do him further service unaided but it was morning still the sun was hot the air was cool just the tempering opposition to render existence pleasant as a piece of vegetation especially when there has been a question of your ceasing to exist and the view was of a sustaining sublimity of desolateness crag and snow overhead a gloomy vale below no life either of bird or herd a voiceless region where there had once been roars at the bowling of a hill from a mountain to the deep and the third flank of the mountain spoke of it in the silence he would have enjoyed the scene unremittingly like the philosopher he pretended to be in a disdain of civilization and the ambitions of men had not a contest with earth been forced on him from time to time to keep the heel of his right foot dug in shallow shale fixed and supporting as long as it held he was happy and maintained the attitude of a guitar player thrumming the calf of the useless leg to accompany tuneful thoughts but the inevitable lapse and slide of the foot recurred and the philosopher was exhibited as an infant learning to crawl the seat moreover not having been fashioned for him or for any soft purpose resisted his pressure and became a thing of violence that required to be humiliatingly coaxed his last resource to propitiate it was counselled by nature turned mathematician tenacious extension solved the problem he lay back at his length and with his hat over his eyes consented to see nothing for the sake of comfort thus he was perfectly rational though when others beheld him he appeared the insanest of mortals a girls voice gave out the mountain carol ringingly above his heart and all his fancies were in motion at the sound he leaned on an elbow to listen the slide threatened him and he resumed his full stretch determined to take her for a dream he was of the class of youths who in apprehension that their bright season may not be permanent choose to fortify it by a systematic contempt of material realities unless they come in the fairest of shapes and as he was quite sincere in this feeling and election of the right way to live disappointment and sullenness overcame him on hearing mens shouts and steps despite his helpless condition he refused to stir for they had jarred on his dream perhaps his temper unknown to himself had been a little injured by his mishap and he would not have been sorry to charge them with want of common humanity in passing him or he did not think his plight so bad else he would have bawled after them had they gone by far the youths of his description are fools only upon systemhowever earnestly they indulge the present selfpunishing sentiment the party did not pass they stopped short they consulted and a feminine tongue more urgent than the others and very musical sweet to hear anywhere put him in tune she said brother brother in german our philosopher flung off his hat you see said the ladys brother ask him antonshe said to their guide and quick her brother added the guide scrambled along to him and at a closer glance shouted the englishman wheeling his finger to indicate what had happened to the tomnoddy islander his master called to know if there were broken bones as if he could stop for nothing else the cripple was raised the gentleman and lady made their way to him and he tried his hardest to keep from tottering on the slope in her presence no injury had been done to the leg there was only a stiffness and an idiotic doubling of the knee as though at each step his leg pronounced a dogged negative to the act of walking he said something equivalent to this donkey leg to divert her charitable eyes from a countenance dancing with ugly twitches she was the samaritan a sufferer discerns his friend though it be not the one who physically assists him he is inclined by nature to put material aid at a lower mark than gentleness and her brief words of encouragement the tone of their delivery yet more were medical to his blood better help than her brothers iron arm he really believed her brother and the guide held him on each side and she led to pick out the safer footing for him she looked round and pointed to some projection that would form a step she drew attention to views here and there to win excuses for his resting she did not omit to soften her brothers visible impatience as well and this was the art which affected her keenly sensible debtor most i suppose i ought to have taken a guide he said theres not a doubt of that said chillon kirby carinthia halted leaning on her staff but i had the same wish they told us at the inn of an englishman who left last night to sleep on the mountain and would go alone and did i not say brother that must be true love of the mountains these freaks get us a bad name on the continent her brother replied he had no sympathy with nonsense and naturally not with a youth who smelt of being a dreamy romancer and had caused the name of englishman to be shouted in his ear in derision and the fellow might delay his arrival at the baths and sight of the lady of his love for hours they managed to get him hobbling and slipping to the first green tuft of the base where long black tongues of slaterubble pouring into the grass like shorewaves that have spent their burden seem about to draw back to bring the mountain down thence to the level pasture was but a few skips performed sliding well now said chillon you can stand pretty well i think he tried his foot on the ground and then stretched his length saying that it only wanted rest anton pressed a hand at his ankle and made him wince but the bones were sound leg and hip not worse than badly bruised he was advised by anton to plant his foot in the first running water he came to and he was considerate enough to say to chillon now you can leave me and let me thank you half an hour will set me right my name is woodseer if ever we meet again chillon nodded a hurried goodbye without a thought of giving his name in return but carinthia had thrown herself on the grass her brother asked her in dismay if she was tired she murmured to him i should like to hear more english my dear girl youll have enough of it in two or three weeks should we leave a good deed half done chillon he shall have our guide he may not be rich ill pay anton to stick to him brother he has an objection to guides chillon cast hungry eyes on his watch five minutes then he addressed mr woodseer who was reposing indifferent to time hardby your objection to guides might have taught you a sharp lesson it s like declining to have a master in studying a sciencetrusting to instinct for your knowledge of a bargain one might as well refuse an oar to row in a boat i d rather risk it the young man replied these guides kick the soul out of scenery i came for that and not for them you might easily have been a disagreeable part of the scene why not here as well as elsewhere you dont care for your life i try not to care for it a fraction more than destiny does fatalism i suppose you care for something besides ive a slack purse and shun guides and inns when i can i care for open air colour flowers weeds birds insects mountains theres a world behind the mask i call this life and the towns a boiling pot intolerably stuffy my one ambition is to be out of it i thank heaven i have not another on earth yes i care for my notebook because its of no use to a human being except me i slept beside a spring last night and i never shall like a bedroom so well i think i have discovered the great secret i may be wrong of course and if so he had his philosophy the admission was meant to say carinthia expected the revelation of a notable secret but none came or if it did it eluded her grasphe was praising contemplation he was praising tobacco he talked of the charm of poverty upon a settled income of a very small sum of money the fruit of a compact he would execute with the town to agree to his perpetual exclusion from it and to retain his identity and not be the composite which every townsman was he talked of buddha he said here the brooks the brook the mountains the mountain they are as they always were youd have men be the same chillon remarked as to a nursling prattler and he rejoined theyve lost more than theyve gained though he admitted there has been some gain in a certain way fortunately for them young men have not the habit of reflecting upon the indigestion of ideas they receive from members of their community sometimes upon exchange they compare a view of life with their own view to condemn it summarily and he was a curious object to chillon as the perfect opposite of himself i would advise you chillon said to get a pair of styrian boots if you intend to stay in the alps those boots of yours are london make they re my fathers make said mr woodseer chillon drew out his watch come carinthia we must be off he proposed his guide and as anton was rejected he pointed the route over the head of the valley stated the distance to an inn that way saluted and strode mr woodseer partly rising presumed in raising his hat and thanking carinthia to touch her fingers she smiled on him frankly extending her open hand and pointing the route again counselling him to rest at the inn even saying you have not yet your strength to come on with us he thought he would stay some time longer he had a disposition to smoke she tripped away to her brother and was watched through the whiffs of a pipe far up the valley guiltless of any consciousness of producing an impression but her mind was with the stranger sufficiently to cause her to say to chillon at the close of a dispute between him and anton on the interesting subject of the growth of the horns of chamois have we been quite kind to that gentleman chillon looked over his shoulder hes there still hes fond of solitude and carin my dear dont give your hand when you are meeting or parting with people its not done his uninstructed sister said did you not like him she was answered with an oh the tone of which balanced lightly on the neutral line some of the ideas he has are lord fleetwoods i hear and one can understand them in a man of enormous wealth who doesnt know what to do with himself and is deadsick of flattery though it seems odd for an english nobleman to be raving about nature perhaps its because none else of them does lord fleetwood loves our mountains chillon but a fellow who probably has to make his way in the worldand he despises ambition chillon dropped him he was antipathetic to eccentrics and his soldierly and social training opposed the profession of heterodox ideas to have listened seriously to them coming from the mouth of an unambitious bootmakers son involved him in the absurdity he considered that there was no harm in the lad rather a commendable sort of courage and some notion of manners allowing for his ignorance of the convenable in putting out his hand to take a young ladys with the plea of thanking her he hoped she would be more on her guard carinthia was sure she had the name of the nobleman wishing to bestow his title upon the beautiful henrietta lord fleetwood that slender thread given her of the character of her brothers rival who loved the mountains was woven in her mind with her passing experience of the youth they had left behind them until the two became one a highly transfigured one and the mountain scenery made him very threatening to her brother a silky haired youth browneyed unconquerable in adversity immensely rich fond of solitude curled decorated bejewelled by all the elves and gnomes of inmost solitude must have marvellous attractions she feared she thought of him so much that her humble spirit conceived the stricken soul of the woman as of necessity the pursuer as shamelessly though timidly as she herself pursued in imagination the enchanted secret of the mountainland she hoped her brother would not supplicate for it struck her that the lover who besieged the lady would forfeit her roaming and hunting fancy i wonder what that gentleman is doing now she said to chillon he grimaced slightly for her sake he would have liked to inform her for the sake of educating her in the customs of the world she was going to enter that the word gentleman conveys in english a special signification her expression of wonder whether they were to meet him again gave chillon the opportunity of saying it s the unlikeliest thing possibleat all events in england but i think we shall said she my dear you meet people of your own class you dont meet others but we may meet anybody chillon in the street i suppose you would not stop to speak to him in the street it would be strange to see him in the street carinthia said strange or not chillon thought he had said sufficient she was under his protectorship otherwise he would not have alluded to the observance of class distinctions he felt them personally in this case because of their seeming to stretch grotesquely by the pretentious heterodoxy of the young fellow whom nevertheless thinking him over now that he was mentioned he approved for his manliness in bluntly telling his origin and status a chalet supplied them with fresh milk and the inn of a village on a perch with the midday meal their appetites were princely and swept over the little inn like a conflagration only after clearing it did they remember the rearward pedestrian whose probable wants chillon was urged by carthinia to speak of to their host they pushed on clambering up scurrying down tramping gaily till by degrees the chambers of carinthias imagination closed their doors and would no longer intercommunicate her head refused to interest her and left all activity to her legs and her eyes and the latter became unobservant except of foottracks animallike she felt that she was a fine machine and nothing else and she was rapidly approaching those ladies you will tell them how i walked with you she said your friends over yonder said he so that they may not think me so ignorant brother she stumbled on the helpless word in a hasty effort to cloak her vanity he laughed her desire to meet the critical english ladies with a towering reputation in one department of human enterprise was comprehensible considering the natural apprehensiveness of the halfwild girl before such a meeting as it often happens with the silly phrases of simple people the wrong word foolish although it was went to the heart of the hearer and threw a more charitable light than ridicule on her so that they may know i can do something they cannot do was the interpretation it showed her deep knowledge of her poorness in laying bare the fact anxious to cheer her he said come come you can dance you dance well mother has told me and she was a judge you ride you swim you have a voice for country songs at all events and youre a bit of a botanist too youre good at english and german you had a french governess for a couple of years by the way you understand the use of a walkingstick in selfdefence you could handle a sword on occasion father trained me said carthinia i can fire a pistol aiming with a good aim too father told me you could how fond he was of his girl well bear in mind that father was proud of you and hold up your head wherever you are i will she said he assured her he had a mind to have a bugle blown at the entrance of the baths for a challenge to the bathers to match her in warlike accomplishments she bit her lips she could not bear much rallying on the subject just then which is the hard one to please she asked the one you will find the kinder of the two henrietta he nodded has she a father a gallant old admiral admiral baldwin fakenham i am glad of that carinthia sighed out heartily and he is with her and likes you chillon on the whole i think he does a brave officer such a father would be sure to like him so the domestic prospect was hopeful at sunset they stood on the hills overlooking the basin of the baths all enfolded in swathes of pink and crimson up to the shining grey of a high heaven that had the fresh brightness of the morning we are not tired in the slightest said carinthia trifling with the vision of a cushioned rest below i could go on through the night quite comfortably wait till you wake up in your little bed tomorrow chillon replied stoutly to drive a chill from his lovers heart that had seized it at the bare suggestion of their going on chapter vii the ladys letter is not the lover a prophet he that fervently desires may well be one his hurried nature is alive with warmth to break the possible blow and if his fears were not needed they were shadows and if fulfilled was he not convinced of his misfortune by a dark anticipation that rarely erred descending the hills he remembered several omens the sun had sunk when he looked down on the villas and clustered houses not an edge of the orb had been seen the admirals quarters in tile broadfaced hotel had worn an appearance resembling the empty house of yesterday the encounter with the fellow on the rocks had a bad whisper of impish tripping and what moved carinthia to speak of going on a letter was handed to chillon in the hall of the admirals hotel where his baggage had already been delivered the manager was deploring the circumstance that his rooms were full to the roof when chillon said well we must wash and eat and carinthia from watching her brothers forehead during his perusal of the letter declared her readiness for anything he gave her the letter to read by herself while preparing to sit at table unwilling to ask her for a further tax on her energiesbut it was she who had spoken of going on he thought of it as of a debt she had contracted and might be supposed to think payable to their misfortune she read off the first two sentences we can have a carriage here chillon order a carriage i shall get as much sleep in a carriage as in a bed i shall enjoy driving at night she said immediately and strongly urged it and forced him to yield the manager observing that a carriage could be had in the privacy of her room admiring the clear flowing hand she read the words delicious in their strangeness to her notwithstanding the heavy news as though they were sung out of a nightsky most picturesque of castles may none these marks efface for they appeal from tyranny we start at noon today sailing orders have been issued and i could only have resisted them in my own person by casting myself overboard i go like the boat behind the vessel you were expected yesterday at latest this morning i have seen boxes in the hall with a name on them not foreign to me why does the master tarry sir of your valliance you should have held to your good vowquoth the damozel for now you see me sore perplexed and that you did not your devoir is my affliction where lingers chivalry she should have proceeded if not with my knight i feast on your regrets i would not have you less than miserable and i fear the reason is that i am not so very very sure you will be so at all or very hugely as i would command it of you for just time enough to see that change over your eyebrows i know so well if you had seen a certain henrietta yesterday you would have the picture of how you ought to look the admiral was heard welcoming a new arrival you can hear him she ran down the stairs quicker than any cascade of this district she would have made a bet with livia that it could be no one elseher hand was out before she was aware of the difference it was locked in lord fs let the guilty absent suffer for causing such a betrayal of disappointment i must be avenged but if indeed you are unhappy and would like to chide the innocent i am full of compassion for the poor gentleman inheriting my legitimate feelings of wrath and beg merely that he will not pour them out on me with pen and paper but from his lips and eyes time pressing i chatter no more the destination is livias beloved baden we rest a night in the city of mozart a night at munich a night at stuttgart baden will detain my cousin full a week she has captain abrane and sir meeson corby in attendanceher long shadow and her short both devoted to lord f to win her smile and how he drives them the captain has been paraded on the promenade to the stupefaction of the foreigner princes counts generals diplomats passed under him in awe i am told that he is called st christopher why do we go thus hastilymy friend this letter has to be concealed i know some one who sees in the dark think no harm of livia she is bent upon my worldly advantage and that is plain even to the person rejecting it how much more so must it be to papa though he likes you and when you are near him would perhaps in a fit of unworldliness be almost as reckless as the creature he calls madcap and would rather call countess no sooner with a willothe wisp my friend who could ever know where the man was when he himself never knows where he is he is the wind that bloweth as it listeth because it is without an aim or always with a new one and am i the one to direct him i need direction my lord and sovereign must fix my mind i am volatile earthly not to be trusted if i do not worship he himself said to me thathe reads our characters nothing but a proved hero will satisfy henrietta his words and the hero must be shining like a beaconfire kept in a blaze quite true i own it is chillon kirby satisfied he ought to be but ohto be yoked is an insufferable thought unless we name all the conditions but to be yoked to a creature of impulses really i could only describe his erratic nature by commending you to the study of a dragonfly it would map you an idea of what he has been in the twenty four hours since we had him here they tell me a vain sort of person is the cause can she be the cause of his resolving to have a residence here to buy up half the valleyerecting a royal palaceand marking out the siteraving about it in the wildest language poetical if it had been a little reasonableand then after a night suddenly unaccountably hating the place and being under the necessity of flying from it in hot haste tearing us all away as if we were attached to a kite that will neither mount nor fall but rushes about headlong has he heard or suspected or seen certain boxes bearing a name livia has no suspicion though she thinks me wonderfully contented in so dull a place where it has rained nine days in a fortnight i ask myself whether my manner of greeting him betrayed my expectation of another he has brains it is the greatest of errors to suppose him at all like the common run of rich young noblemen he seems to thirst for brilliant wits and original sayings his ambition is to lead all england in everything i readily acknowledge that he has generous ideas too but try to hold him deny him his liberty and it would be seen how desperate and relentless he would be to get loose of this i am convinced he would be either the most abject of lovers or a woman if it turned out not to be love would find him the most unscrupulous of yokefellows yokefellow she would not have her reason in consenting a lamb and a furious bull papa and i have had a serious talk he shuts his ears to my comparisons but admits that as i am the principal person concerned etc rich and a nobleman is too tempting for an anxious father and livias influence is paramount she has not said a syllable in depreciation of you that is to her credit she also admits that i must yield freely if at all and she grants me the use of similes but her tactics are to contest them one by one and the admirable pretender is not as shifty as the mariners breeze he is not like the wandering spark in burnt paper of which you cannot say whether it is chasing or chased it is i who am the shifty pole to the steadiest of magnets she is a princess in other things besides her superiority to physics there will be wild scenes at baden my diary of today is all bestowed on you what have i to write in it except the pair of commas under the last line of yesterday he has not come oh to be caring for a he o that i were with your sister now on one side of her idol to correct her extravagant idolatry i long for her i had a number of nice little phrases to pet her with you have said i have it written that men who are liked by men are the best friends for women in which case the earl should be worthy of our friendship he is liked captain abrane and sir meeson in spite of the hard service he imposes on them with such comical haughtiness incline to speak well of him and methuen rivershere for two days on his way to his embassy at viennaassured us he is the rarest of gentlemen on the point of honour of his word they have stories of him to confirm livias eulogies showing him punctilious to chivalry no man alive is like him in that they say he grieves me all that you have to fear is my pity for one so sensitive so speed sir it is not good for us to be much alone and i am alone when you are absent i hear military music how grand that music makes the dullest world appear in a minute there is a magic in it to bring you to me from the most dreadful of distances chillon it would kill mewriting here and you perhaps behind the hill i can hardly bear iti am torn away my hand will not any more this music burst out to mock me adieu i am yours your henrietta a kiss to the sister it is owing to her carinthia kissed the letter on that last line it seemed to her to end in a celestial shower she was oppressed by wonder of the writer who could run like the rill of the mountains in written speech and her recollection of the contents perpetually hurried to the close which was more in her way of writing for there the brief sentences had a throb beneath them she did not speak of the letter to her brother when she returned it a night in the carriage against his shoulder was her happy prospect in the thought that she would be with her dearest all night touching him asleep and in the sweet sense of being near to the beloved of the fairest angel of her sex they pursued their journey soon after anton was dismissed with warm shakes of the hand and appointments for a possible year in the future the blast of the postillions horn on the dark highway moved chillon to say this is what they call posting my dear she replied tell me brother i do not understand let none these marks efface at the commencement after most picturesque of castles that is you they are quoted from the verses of a lord who was a poet addressed to the castle on lake leman she will read them to you will she the mention of the lord set carinthia thinking of the lord whom that beautiful she pitied because she was forced to wound him and he was very sensitive wrapped in henrietta she slept through the joltings of the carriage the grinding of the wheels the blowing of the horn the flashes of the late moonlight and the kindling of dawn chapter viii of the encounter of two strange young men and their consorting in which the male reader is requested to bear in mind what wild creature he was in his youth while the female should marvel credulously the young man who fancied he had robed himself in the plain homespun of a natural philosopher at the age of twentythree journeyed limping leisurely in the mountain maid carinthias footsteps thankful to the fates for having seen her and reproving the remainder of superstition within him which would lay him open to smarts of evil fortune if he encouraged a senseless gratitude for good seeing that we are simply to take what happens to us the little inn of the village on the perch furnished him a nights lodging and a laugh of satisfaction to hear of a young lady and gentleman and their guide who had devoured everything eatable half a day in advance of him all save the bread and butter and a few scraps of meat apologetically spread for his repast by the maid of the inn not enough for a bantam cock she said promising eggs for breakfast he vowed with an honest heart that it was more than enough and he was nourished by sympathy with the appetites of his precursors and the maids description of their deeds that name carinthia went a good way to fill him farther on he had plenty but less contentment he was compelled to acknowledge that he had expected to meet carinthia again at the baths her absence dealt a violent shock to the aerial structure he dwelt in for though his ardour for the life of the solitudes was unfeigned as was his calm overlooking of social distinctions the selfindulgent dreamer became troubled with an alarming sentience that for him to share the passions of the world of men was to risk the falling lower than most women are a cause of dreams but they are dreaded enemies of his kind of dream deadly enemies of the immaterial dreamers and should one of them be taken on board a vessel of the vapourish texture young woodseer sailed in above the clouds lightly while he was in it alone questions of past future and present the three weights upon humanity bear it down and she must go or the vessel sinks and cast out of it what was he the asking exposed him to the steadiest wind the civilized world is known to blow from merely thinking upon one of the daughters of earth he was made to feel his position in that world though he refused to understand it and assisted by two days of hard walking he reduced carinthia to an abstract enthusiasm no very serious burden his notebook sustained it easily he wrote her name in simple fondness of the name a verse and hints for more and some sentences which he thought profound they were composed as he sat by the roadway on the top of hills and in a boat crossing a dark green lake deep under wooded mountain walls things of priceless value it happened that midway on the lake he perceived his boatman about to prime a pistol to murder the mildeyed stillness and he called to the man in his best german to desist during the altercation there passed a countryman of his in another of the punts who said gravely i thank you for that it was early morning and they had the lake to themselves each deeming the other an intruder for the courtship of solitude wanes when we are haunted by a second person in pursuit of it he is discolouring matter in our pure crystal cup such is the worship of the picturesque and it would appear to say that the spirit of man finds itself yet in the society of barbarians the case admits of good pleading either way even upon the issue whether the exclusive or the vulgar be the more barbarous but in those days the solicitation of the picturesque had been revived by a poet of some impassioned rhetoric and two devotees could hardly meet as the two met here and not be mutually obscurants they stepped ashore in turn on the same small shoot of land where a farm house near a chapel in the shadow of cliffs did occasional service for an inn each had intended to pass a day and a night in this lonely dwellingplace by the lake but a rival was less to be tolerated there than in love and each awaited the others departure with an air that said you are in my sunlight and going deeper more sternly sir you are an offence to natures pudency woodseer was the more placable of the two he had taken possession of the bench outside and he had his notebook and much profundity to haul up with it while fish were frying his countryman had rushed inside to avoid him and remained there pacing the chamber like a lion newly caged their boatmen were brotherly in the anticipation of provision and payment after eating his fish woodseer decided abruptly that as he could not have the spot to himself memorable as it would have been to intermarry with nature in so sacred a welldepth of the mountains he had better be walking and climbing another boat paddling up the lake had been spied solitude was not merely shared with a rival but violated by numbers in the first case we detest the man in the second we fly from an outraged scene he wrote a line or so in his book hurriedly paid his bill and started full of the matter he had briefly committed to his pages at noon sitting beside the beck that runs from the lake he was overtaken by the gentleman he had left behind and accosted in the informal english style with all the politeness possible to a nervously blunt manner this book is yoursi have no doubt it is yours i am glad to be able to restore it i should be glad to be the ownerwriter of the contents i mean i have to beg your excuse i found it lying open i looked at the page i looked through the whole i am quite at your mercy woodseer jumped at the sight of his notebook felt for the emptiness of his pocket and replied thank you thank you its of use to me though to no one else you pardon me certainly i should have done it myself i cannot offer you my apologies as a stranger lord fleetwood was the name given woodseers plebeian was exchanged for it and he stood up the young lord had fair straight thin features with large restless eyes that lighted quickly and a mouth that was winning in his present colloquial mood you could have done the same i should find it hard to forgive the man who pried into my secret thoughts he remarked there they are if one puts them to paper woodseer shrugged yes yes they never last long enough with me so far im safe one page led to another you can meditate i noticed some remarks on religions you think deeply woodseer was of that opinion but modesty urged him to reply with a small flourish just a few heads of ideas when the wind puffs down a sooty chimney the air is filled with little blacks that settle pretty much like the notes in this book of mine there they wait for another puff or my fingers to stamp them i could tell you were the owner of that book said lord fleetwood he swept his forehead feverishly what a power it is to relieve ones brain by writing may i ask you which one of the universities the burden of this question had a ring of irony to one whom it taught to feel rather defiantly that he carried the blazon of a reeking tramp my university woodseer replied was a merchants office in bremen for some months i learnt more greek and latin in bremen than business i was invalided home and then tried a merchants office in london i put on my hat one day and walked into the country my college fellows were hawkers tinkers tramps and ploughmen choughs and crows a volume of our poets and a history of philosophy composed my library i had scarce any money so i learnt how to idle inexpensivelya good first lesson were at the bottom of the world when we take to the road we see men as they were in the beginningnot so eager for harness till they get acquainted with hunger as i did and studied in myself the old animal having his head pushed into the collar to earn a feed of corn woodseer laughed adding that he had been of a serious mind in those days of the alternation of smooth indifference and sharp necessity and he had plucked a flower from them his nature prompted him to speak of himself with simple candour as he had done spontaneously to chillon kirby yet he was now anxious to let his companion know at once the common stuff he was made of together with the great stuff he contained he grew conscious of an overanxiety and was uneasy recollecting how he had just spoken about his naturalness dimly if at all apprehending the cause of this disturbance within what is a lord to a philosopher but the world is around us as a cloak if not a coat in his ignorance he supposed it specially due to a lord seeking acquaintance with him that he should expose his condition doing the which appeared to subject him to parade his intellectual treasures and capacity for shaping sentences and the effect upon lord fleetwood was an incentive to the display nevertheless he had a fretful desire to escape from the discomposing society of a lord he fixed his knapsack and began to saunter the young lord was at his elbow i cant part with you will you allow me woodseer was puzzled and had to say if you wish it i do wish it an hours walk with you one does not meet a man like you every day i have to join a circle of mine in baden but theres no hurry i could be disengaged for a week and i have things to ask you owing to my indiscretionbut you have excused it woodseer turned for a farewell gaze at the great watzmann and saluted him splendid said lord fleetwood but dont clap names on the mountains i saw written in your book a text for dada you write a despotism would procure a perfect solitude but kill the ghost that was my thought at the place where we were at the lake i had it tell me though i could not have written it and ghost is just the word the exact wordtell me are you of welsh blood dad is good welsh pronounce it hard woodseer answered my mother was a glamorganshire woman my father i know walked up from wales mending boots on his road for a livelihood he is not a bad scholar he knows greek enough to like it he is a dissenting preacher when i strike a truism i ve a habit of scoring it to give him a peg or tuningfork for one of his discourses hes a man of talent he taught himself and he taught me more than i learnt at school he is a thinker in his way he loves nature too i rather envy him in some respects he and i are hunters of wisdom on different tracks and he as he says waits for me hes patient ah and i wanted to ask you lord fleetwood observed bursting with it i was puzzled by a name you write here and there near the end and permit me to ask it carinthia it cannot be the country you write after the name a beautiful gorgona haggard venus it seized me i have had the face before my eyes ever since you must mean a woman i cant be deceived in allusions to a woman they have heart in them you met her somewhere about carinthia and gave her the name you write may i refer to the book he received the book and flew through the leaves herea panting look you write again a look of beaten flame a look of one who has run and at last beholds but that is a living face i see her here again from minute to minute she is the rock that loses the sun at night and reddens in the morning you could not create an idea of a woman to move you like that no one could i am certain of it certain if so you re a wizardi swear you are but thats a face high over beauty just to know there is a woman like her is an antidote you compare her to a rock who would imagine a comparison of a woman to a rock but rock is the very picture of beautiful gorgon haggard venus tell me you met her you saw her i want only to hear she lives she is in the world beautiful women compared to roses may whirl away with their handsome dragoons a pang from them is a thing to be ashamed of and there are men who trot about whining with it but a carinthia makes pain honourable you have done what i thought impossiblefused a womans face and grand scenery to make them inseparable she might be wicked for me i should see a bright rim round hatred of herthe rock you describe i could endure horrors and not annihilate her i should think her sacred woodseer turned about to have a look at the man who was even quicker than he at realizing a person from a hint of description and almost insanely extravagant in the pitch of the things he uttered to a stranger for himself he was open with everybody his philosophy not allowing that strangers existed on earth but the presence of a lord brought the conventional world to his feelings though at the same time the title seemed to sanction the exceptional abruptness and wildness of this lord as for suspecting him to be mad it would have been a common idea no stretching of speech or overstepping of social rules could waken a suspicion so spiritless in woodseer he said i can tell you i met her and she lives i could as soon swim in that torrent or leap the mountain as repeat what she spoke or sketch a feature of her she goes into the blood she is a new idea of women she has the face that would tempt a gypsy to evil tellings i could think of it as a history written in a line carinthia saint and martyr as for comparisons they are flowers thrown into the fire i have had thati have thought that said lord fleetwood go on talk of her pray without comparisons i detest them how did you meet her what made you part where is she now i have no wish to find her but i want thoroughly to believe in her another than woodseer would have perceived the young lords malady here was one bitten by the serpent of love and athirst for an image of the sex to serve for the cooling herb as youth will be woodseer put it down to a curious imaginative fellowship with himself he forgot the lord and supposed he had found his own likeness less gifted in speech after talking of carinthia more and more in the abstract he fell upon his discovery of the great secret of life against which his hearer struggled for a time though that was cooling to him too but ultimately there was no resistance and so deep did they sink into the idea of pure contemplation that the idea of woman seemed to have become a part of it no stronger proof of their aethereal conversational earnestness could be offered a locality was given to the great secret and of course it was the place where the most powerful recent impression had been stamped on the mind of the discoverer the shadowy valley rolling from the slate rock woodseer was too artistic a dreamer to present the passing vision of carinthia with any associates there she passed the solitude accepted her and lost her and it was the richer for the one swift gleam she brought no trouble she left no regrets she was the ghost of the rocky obscurity but now remembering her mountain carol he chanced to speak of her as a girl she is a girl cried lord fleetwood frowning over an utter revolution of sentiment at the thought of the beautiful gorgon being a girl for rapid as he was to imagine he had raised a solid fabric upon his conception of carinthia the woman necessarily the womanlogically who but the woman could look the gorgon he tried to explain it to be impossible for a girl to wear the look and his notion evidently was that it had come upon a beautiful face in some staring horror of a world that had bitten the tender woman she touched him sympathetically through the pathos woodseer flung out vociferously for the contrary who but a girl could look the beautiful gorgon what other could seem an emanation of the mountain solitude a woman would instantly breathe the world on it to destroy it hers would be the dramatic and not the poetic face it would shriek of man wake the echoes with the tale of man slaughter all quietude but a girls face has no story of poisonous intrusion she indeed may be cast in the terrors of nature and yet be sweet with nature beautiful because she is purely of nature woodseer did his best to present his view irresistibly perhaps he was not clear it was a piece of skiamachy difficult to render clear to the defeated lord fleetwood had nothing to say but gorgon a girl a gorgon and it struck woodseer as intensely unreasonable considering that he had seen the girl whom in his effort to portray her he had likened to a beautiful gorgon he recounted the scene of the meeting with her pictured it in effective colours but his companion gave no response nor a nod they ceased to converse and when the young lords hired carriage drew up on the road woodseer required persuasion to accompany him they were both in their different stations young tyrants of the world ready to fight the world and one another for not having their immediate view of it such as they wanted it they agreed however not to sleep in the city beds were to be had near the top of a mountain on the other side of the salza their driver informed them and vowing themselves to that particular height in a mutual disgust of the city they waxed friendlier with a reserve woodseer soon had experience that he was receiving exceptional treatment from lord fleetwood whose manservant was on the steps of the hotel in salzburg on the lookout for his master sir meeson has been getting impatient my lord said the man sir meeson corby appeared lord fleetwood cut him short you re in a hurry go at once dont wait for me i join you in badendo me the favour to eat with me he turned to woodseer and here corby tell the countess i have a friend to bear me company and there is to be an extra bedroom secured at her hotel that swinery of a place she insists on visiting is usually crammed with you there he turned to woodseer i might find it agreeableyou can take my man corby i shall not want the fellow positively my dear fleetwood you know sir meeson expostulated i am under orders i dont see howi really cant go on without you please yourself this gentleman is my friend mr woodseer sir meeson corby was a plump little beau of forty at war with his fat and accounting his tight blue tail coat and brass buttons a victory his tightness made his fatness elastic he looked wound up for a dance and could hardly hold on a leg but the presentation of a creature in a battered hat and soiled garments carrying a tattered knapsack half slung lank and with disorderly locks as the earl of fleetwoods friend the friend of the wealthiest nobleman of great britainfixed him in a perked attitude of inquiry that exhausted interrogatives woodseer passed him slouching a bow the circular stare of sir meeson seemed unable to contract he directed it on lord fleetwood and was then reminded that he dealt with prickles where have you been he said blinking to refresh his eyeballs i missed you i ran round and round the town after you i have been to the lake queer fish there sir meeson dropped a glance on the capture lord fleetwood took woodseers arm do you eat with us he asked the baronet who had stayed his eating for an hour and was famished so they strode to the diningroom do you wash sir before eating sir meeson said to woodseer caressing his hands when they had seated themselves at table appliances are to be found in this hotel soap said lord fleetwood soapat least in my chamber fetch it please sir meeson of course could not hear that he requested the waiter to show the gentleman to a room lord fleetwood ordered the waiter to bring a handbasin and towel were off directly and must eat at once he said soapsoap my dear fleetwood sir meeson knuckled on the table to impress it that his appetite and his gorge demanded a thorough cleansing of those fingers if they were to sit at one board let the waiter fetch it the soap is in my portmanteau you spoke of it as a necessity for this gentleman and me bring it woodseer had risen lord fleetwood motioned him down he kept an eye deadas marble on corby who muttered you cant mean that you ask me but the alternative was forced on sir meeson by too strong a power of the implacable eye there was thunder in it a continuity of gaze forcefuller than repetitions of the word he knew lord fleetwood men privileged to attend on him were dogs to the flinty young despot they were sure to be called upon to expiate the faintest offence to him he had hastily to consider that he was banished beyond appeal with the whole torture of banishment to an adorer of the countess livia or else the mad behest must be obeyed he protested shrugged sat fast and sprang up remarking that he went with all the willingness imaginable it could not have been the first occasion he was affecting the excessively obsequious when he came back bearing his metal soapcase the performance was checked by another look solid as shot and as quick woodseer who would have done for sir meeson corby or lazarus what had been done for him thought little of the service but so intense a peremptoriness in the look of an eye made him uncomfortable in his own sense of independence the humblest citizen of a free nation has that warning at some notable exhibition of tyranny in a neighbouring state it acts like a concussion of the air lord fleetwood led an easy dialogue with him and sir meeson on their different themes immediately which was not less impressive to an observer he listened to sir meesons entreaties that he should start at once for baden and appeared to pity the poor gentleman condemned by his office to hang about him in terror of his liege ladys displeasure presently near the close of the meal drawing a ring from his finger he handed it to the baronet and said give her that she knows i shall follow that he added to himselfi shall have illluck till i have it back and he asked woodseer whether he put faith in the virtue of talismans i have never possessed one said woodseer with his natural frankness it would have gone long before this for a nights lodging sir meeson heard him and instantly urged lord fleetwood not to think of dismissing his man francis i beg it fleetwood i beg you to take the man her ladyship will receive me badly ring or no ring if she hears of your being left alone i really cant present myself i shall not go not go i say no stay then said fleetwood he turned to woodseer with an air of deference and requested the privilege of glancing at his notebook again and scanned it closely at one of the pages i believe it true he cried i had a half recollection of iti have had some such thought but never could put it in words you have thought deeply that is only a surface thought or common reflection said woodseer sir meeson stared at them in turn judging by their talk and the effect produced on the earl he took woodseer for a sort of conjuror it was his duty to utter a warning he drew fleetwood aside a word was whispered and they broke asunder with a snap francis was called his master gave him his keys and despatched him into the town to purchase a knapsack or bag for the outfit of a jolly beggar the prospect delighted lord fleetwood he sang notes from the deep chest flaunting like an opera brigand and contemplating his wretched satellites indecision with brimming amusement remember we fight for our money i carry mine he said to woodseer wouldnt it be expedient fleetwood sir meeson suggested a treasurer in the person of himself not a florin corby i should find it all gambled away at baden but i am not abrane im not abrane i never play i have no mania none it would be prudent fleetwood the slightest bulging of a pocket would show on you corby and they would be at you they would fall on you and pluck you to have another fling i d rather my money should go to a knight of the road than feed that dragons jaw a highwayman seems an honest fellow compared with your honourable corporation of flycatchers i could surrender to him with some satisfaction after a trial of the better man i ve tried these tables and couldnt stir a pulse have you it had to be explained to woodseer what was meant by trying the tables not i said he in strong contempt of the queer allurement lord fleetwood studied him half a minute as if measuring and discarding a suspicion of the young philosophers possible weakness under temptation sir meeson corby accompanied the oddly assorted couple through the town and a short way along the road to the mountain for the sake of quieting his conscience upon the subject of his leaving them together he could not have sat down a second time at a table with those hands he said ithe could not have done the thing so the best he could do was to let them go like many of his class he had a mind open to the effect of striking contrasts and the spectacle of the wealthiest nobleman in great britain tramping the road pack on back with a young nobody for his comrade a total stranger who might be a cutthroat and was avowedly next to a mendicant charged him with quantities of interjectory matter that he caught himself firing to the foreign people on the highway hundreds of thousands a year and tramping it like a pedlar with a beggar for his friend he would have given something to have an english ear near him as he watched them rounding under the mountain they were about to climb chapter ix concerning the black goddess fortune and the worship of her together with an introduction of some of her votaries in those early days of fortunes pregnant alternations of colour between the red and the black exhibited publicly as it were a petroleum spring of the ebonyfiery lake below blackforest baden was the sprightliest of the antechambers of hades thither in the ripeness of the year trooped the devotees of the sable goddess to perform sacrifice and annually among them the beautiful livia the countess of fleetwood for nowhere else had she sensation of the perfect repose which is rocked to a slumber by gales she was not of the creatures who are excited by an atmosphere of excitement she took it as the nymph of the stream her native wave and swam on the flood with expansive languor happy to have the master passions about her one or two of which her dainty hand caressed fearless of a sting the lady petted them as her swans it surprised her to a gentle contempt of men and women that they should be ruffled either by love or play a withholding from the scene will naturally arouse disturbing wishes but to be present lulls for then we live we are in our element and who could expect what sane person can desire perpetual good luck fortune the goddess and young love too are divine in their mutability and fortune would resemble a humdrum housewife love a droning husband if constancy were practised by them observe the staggering and plunging of the blindfold wretch seeking to be persuaded of their faithfulness she could make for herself a quiet centre in the heart of the whirlwind but the whirlwind was required the clustered lights at the corner of the vale under forest hills the burst of music the blazing windows of the saloons of the furies and the gamblers advancing and retreating with their totally opposite views of consequences and fashions of wearing or tearing the mask and closer the figures shifting up and down the promenade known and unknown faces and the histories half known half woven weaving fast which flew their threads to provoke speculation pleasantly embraced and diverted the coolblooded lady surrounded by her courtiers who could upon occasion supply the luminous clue or anecdote she had an intuitive liveliness to detect interchanges of eyes the shuttle of intrigue the mild hypocrisy the clever audacity the suspicion confirmed the complication threatening to become resonant and terrible and the old crossing the young and the young outwitting the old wiles of fair traitors and dark knaves of all suits of the pack a more intimate acquaintance with their lineaments inspired a regard for them such as poets may feign the throned high moon to entertain for objects causing her rays to flash the simple fools performing in character were a neutral people grotesques and arabesques wreathed about the margins of the scene venus or fortune smote them to a relievo distinguishing one from another here however as elsewhere the core of interest was with the serious population the lovers and the players in earnest who stood round the furnace and pitched themselves into it not always under a miscalculation of their chances of emerging transfigured instead of serving for fuel these the tragical children of folly were astute they played with lightning and they knew the conditions of the game victories were to be had the ulterior conditions of the game the price paid for a victory they thought little of for they were feverish worshippers of the phantasmal deity called the present a god reigning over the past appreciable only in the future whose whiff of actual being is composed of the embryo idea of the union of these two periods still he is occasionally a benevolent god to the appetites which have but to be continuous to establish him in permanence and as nothing in us more readily supposes perpetuity than the appetite rushing to destroy itself the rational nature of the most universal worship on earth is perceived at once now the price paid for a victory is this that having been favoured in a single instance by the spouse of the aforesaid eminent divinitythe black goddess of the golden fringesmen believe in her for ever after behold her everywhere they belong to her their faith as to sowing and reaping has gone and so has their capacity to see the actual as it is she has the power to attach them to her skirts the more by rewarding their impassioned devotion with cuffs and scorns they have ceased to have a first notion upon anything without a second haunting it which directs them to propitiate fortune but i am reminded by the convulsions of dame gossip that the wisdom of our ancestors makes it a mere hammering of commonplace to insist on such reflections many of them indeed took the union of the black goddess and the rosy present for the composition of the very archfiend some had a shot at the strange conjecture figuring her as tired of men in the end and challengeing him belowequally tired of his easy conquests of men since the glorious old times of the duelling saints by virtue of his one incorrigible weakness which we know him to have as long as we have it ourselves viz the belief in her existence she is to get the better of him upon this point the experience of captain abrane has a value livia was a follower of the red and black and the rounding ball in the person of the giant captain through whom she received her succession of sweetly teasing thrills and shocks as one of the adventurous company they formed together the place was known to him as the fair philistine to another muscular hero he had been shorn there before and sent forth tottering treating the friends he met as pillars to fall with him and when the operation was done thoroughly he pronounced himself refreshed by it like a more sensible samson the cooler for his clipping then it was that he relapsed undistractedly upon processes of his mind and he often said he thought fortune would beat the devil her power is shown in the moving of her solicitors to think instantly after they have made their cast that the reverse of it was what they intended it comes as though she had withdrawn the bandage from her forehead and dropped a leaden glance on them like a great dame angry to have her signal misinterpreted well then distinguished by the goddess in such a manner we have it proved to us how she wished to favour for the reverse wins and we who are pinched blame not her cruelty but our blind folly this is true worship henceforth the pain of her nip is mingled with the dream of her kiss between the positive and the imagined of her we remain confused until the purse is an empty body on a gallows honour too perhaps captain abrane was one of the countess livias numerous courtiers on the border of the promenade under the lighted saloons a colossus inactive he had little to say among the chattering circle for when seated cards were wanted to animate him and he looked entirely out of place and unfitted like a great vessels figurehead in a shipwrights yard she murmured not this evening abrane quoted promptly a line of nursery song how shall he cut it without eer a knife have we run it down so low said she with no reproach in her tone the captain shrugged over his clean abyss where nothing was yesterday their bank presented matronly proportions but an importuned goddess reduces the most voluminous to bare stitches within a few winks of an eye livia turned to a french gentleman of her court m de st ombre and pursued a conversation he was a stately cavalier of the gallicized frankish outlines ready but grave in his bearing grave in his delivery trimly moustached with a guise beard his profound internal question relating to this unenglish beauty of the british isleshad she no passion in her nature was not convinced by her apparent insensibility to fortunes whips sir meeson corby inserted a word of bull french out of place from time to time as it might be necessary to lean on the little man for weapons of war supposing lord fleetwood delayed his arrival yet another day livia was indulgent she assisted him to think that he spoke the foreign tongue mention of lord fleetwood set sir meeson harping again on his alarms in consideration of the vagabond object of the young lord had roamed away with you forget that russett has gypsy in him welsh its about the same said livia he can take excellent care of himself and his purse countess he is a good six days overdue he will be in time for the ball at the schloss sir meeson corby produced an aspect of the word if so perkily that the dejected captain abrane laughed outright and gave him double reason to fret for lord fleetwoods arrival by saying if he hangs off much longer i shall have to come on you for another fifty our two pedestrians out of salzburg were standing up in the night of cloud and pines above the glittering pool having made their way along the path from the hill anciently dedicated to the god mercury and at the moment when sir meeson put forth his frilled wrists to say if you had seen his handsthe creature fleetwood trotted off alone withyoud be a bit anxious too the young lord called his comrade to gaze underneath them there they are hard at it at their playits the word used for the filthiest gutter scramble they had come to know something of one anothers humours which are taken by young men for their characters and should the humours please they are friends until further humours develop trying these nascent conservatives hard to suit them to their moods as well as the accustomed lord fleetwood had discovered in his companion besides the spirit of independence and the powers of thought impressed on him by woodseers precocious flashes a broad playfulness that trenched on buffoonery it astonished amused and relieved him loosening the spell of reverence cast over him by one who could so wonderfully illumine his brain prone to admire and bend the knee where he admired he chafed at subjection unless he had the particular spell constantly renewed a tone in him once or twice of late different from the comrades had warned woodseer to be guarded susceptible however of the extreme contrast between the gamblers below and natures lover beside him fleetwood returned to his enthusiasm without thinking it a bondage i shall never forget the walk we ve had i have to thank you for the noblest of pleasures you ve taught mewell a thousand things the things money cant buy what mornings they were and the deadtired nights under the rock and up to see the snowy peak pink in a gap of thick mist you were right it made a crimsoning colour shine like a new idea up in those mountains one walks with the divinities you said its perfectly true i shall remember i did i have a treasure for life now i understand where you get your ideas the life we lead down there is hoggish you have chosen the right youre right over and over again when you say the dirty sweaters are nearer the angels for cleanliness than my lord and lady sybarite out of a bath in chemical scents a man who thinks loathes their high society i went through juvenal at college but youto be sure you add examplemake me feel the contempt of it more i am everlastingly indebted to you yes i wont forget you preach against the despising of anything this was pleasant in woodseers ears inasmuch as it established the young nobleman as the pupil of his philosophy for the conduct of life and to fortify him he replied set your mind on the beauty and therell be no room for comparisons most of them are unjust precious few instructive in this case they spoil both pictures and that scene down there rather hooks me though i prefer the dachstein in the wane of the afterglow you called it carinthia i did the beautiful gorgon haggard venusif she is to be a girl fleetwood rejoined she looked burnt outa spectre one of the admirably damned said woodseer and he murmured with enjoyment between the lightsthat s the beauty and the tragedy of purgatory his comrade fell in with the pictured idea you hit itnot what you called the sublimely milky and not squalid as youll see the faces of the gambling women at the tables below oblige memay i begdont clap names on the mountains weve seen it stamps guidebook on them english tourist horrors well moralize over the crowds at the tables down there on the whole its a fairish game you know the odds against you as you dont on the turf or the bourse have your fling but dont get bitten theres a virus im not open to it others are hereupon woodseer wishing to have his individuality recognised in the universality it consented to remarked on an exchequer that could not afford to lose and a disposition free of the craving to win these were no doubt good reasons for abstaining and they were grand morality they were at the same time customary phrases of the unfleshed in folly they struck fleetwood with a curious reminder of the puking inexperienced whom he had seen subsequently plunge suicidally he had a sharp vision of the attractive forces of the game and his elemental nature exulted in siding with the stronger against a pretender to the superhuman for woodseer had spoken a trifle loftily as quite above temptation to see a forewarned philosopher lured to try the swim on those tides pulled along the current and caught by the undertug of the lasher would be fun well drop down on them find our hotel and have a look at what theyre doing he said and stepped woodseer would gladly have remained the starlit black ridges about him and the dragons mouth yawing underneath were an opposition of spiritual and mundane innocent noxious exciting to the youthful philosopher he had to follow and so rapidly in the darkness that he stumbled and fell on an arm a small matter bedchambers awaited them at the hotel none of the party and fleetwoods manservant was absent gambling the rascal he said woodseer heard the first note of the place in that his leader was washed neatly dressed and knocking at his door very soon impatient to be off and he flung a promise of supper presently to one whose modest purse had fallen into a debate with this lordly hostelry counting that a supper and a night there would do for it they hurried on to the line of promenaders a river of crosscurrents by the side of seated groups and the willowy swish of silken dresses feminine perfumery cigarsmoke chatter laughter told of pleasure reigning fleetwood scanned the groups he had seen enough in a moment and his face blackened a darting waiter was called to him he said to woodseer savagely as it sounded you shall have something to joint your bones what cause of wrath he had was past a guess a wolf at his vitals bit him hardening his handsome features the waiter darted back bearing a tray and tall glasses filled each with piled particoloured liqueurs on the top of which an eggyolk swam fleetwood gave example swallowing your egg the fieryvelvet triune behind slips after it in an easy milky way like a princesss train on a statemarch and you are completely transformed very agreeably you have become a merry demon well yes its next to magic he replied to woodseers astonished snigger after the draught and explained that it was a famous viennese fourofthemorning panacea the revellers electrical restorer now you can hold on for an hour or two and then well sup at rome ay druids tomorrow cried the philosopher bewitched he found himself bowing to a most heavenly lady composed of day and night in her colouring but more of night where the western edge has become a pale steel blade men were around her forming a semicircle the world of men and women was mere timber and leafage to this flower of her sex glory of her kind how he behaved in her presence he knew not he was beyond selfcriticism or conscious reflection simply the engine of the commixed three liqueurs with parlous fine thoughts and a sense of steaming into the infinite to leave her was to have her as a moon in the heavens and to think of her creatively a swarm of images rushed about her and away took lustre and shade she was a miracle of greyness her eyes translucently grey a darkhaired queen of the twilights and his heart sprang into his brain to picture the novel beauty language became a flushed bacchanal in a ring of dancing similes lying beside a bank of silvery cinquefoil against a clear evening sky where the planet venus is a point of new and warmer light one has the vision of her or something of persephone rising to greet her mother when our beam of day first melts through her as she kneels to gather an early bud of the year would be near it or there is a lake in midforest that curls part in shadow under the foot of morning there we have her he strained to the earthly and the skyey likenesses of his marvel of human beauty because they bestowed her on him in passing all the while he was gazing on a green gamingtable the gold glittered and it heaped or it vanished contemptuous of money beyond the limited sum for his needs he gazed imagination was blunted in him to the hot drama of the business moreover his mind was engaged in insisting that the evening star is not to be called venus because of certain stories and he was vowed to defend his lady from any allusion to them this occupied him by degrees the visible asserted its authority his look on the coin fell to speculating oddly too he was often rightthe money staked on the other side would have won he considered it rather a plain calculation than a guess philosophy withdrew him from his temporary interest in the tricks of a circling white marble ball the chuck farthing of street urchins has quite as much dignity he compared the creatures dabbling over the board to summer flies on butchers meat periodically scared by a cloth more in the abstract they were snatching at a snapdragon bowl it struck him that the gamblers had thronged on an invitation to drink the round of seedtime and harvest in a gulp again they were desperate gleaners hopping skipping bleeding amid a whizz of scytheblades for small wisps of booty nor was it long before the presidency of an ancient hoary goatsatan might be perceived with skeweyes and pucker mouth nursing a hoof on a knee our mediaeval enemy sat symbolical in his deformities as in old italian and dutch thickline engravings of him he rolled a ball for souls excited like kittens to catch it and tumbling into the dozens of vacant pits so it seemed to woodseer whose perceptions were discoloured by hereditary antagonism had he preserved his philosophers eye he would have known that the hoofed one is too wily to show himself owing to his ugliness the black goddess and no other presides at her own game she it is good for us to know it is the power who challenges the individual it is he who spreads the net for the mass she liquefies the brain of man he petrifies or ossifies the heart from her comes craziness from him perversity a more provocative and on the whole more contagious disease the gambler does not seek to lead his fellows into perdition the snared of the demon have pleasure in the act hence our naturally interested forecasts of the contests between them for if he is beaten as all must be at the close of an extended game with her we have only to harden the brain against her allurements and we enter a clearer field woodseer said to fleetwood that ball has a look of a nymph running round and round till she changes to one of the fates well have a run with her said fleetwood keener for business than for metaphorsat the moment he received gold for a banknote captain abrane hurriedly begged a loan both of them threw neither of them threw on the six numbers woodseer would have selected and they lost he stated that the number of had won before abrane tried the transversal enclosing this favoured number of course he cried with foul resignation and a hostile glare the ball had seated itself and was grinning at him from the lowest of the stalls fleetwood quitted the tablenumbers to throw on pair he won won again pushed his luck and lost dragging abrane with him the giant varied his tone of acquiescence in fortunes whims of course i ve only to fling luck hangs right enough till i put down my stake if the luck has gone three times the chances woodseer was rather inquiring than pronouncing lord fleetwood cut him short the chances are equally the contrary and discomposed his argumentative mind as argument in such a place was impossible he had a wild idea of examplejust to see and though he smiled his brain was liquefying upon a calculation of the chances merely for the humour of it he laid a silver piece on the first six which had been neglected they were now blest he laid his winnings on the numbed who would have expected it why the player surely woodseer comported himself like a veteran he had proved that you can calculate the chances instead of turning in triumph to lord fleetwood he laid gold pieces to hug the number and ten in the centre and it is the truth he hoped then to lose and have done with itafter proving his case the ball whirled kicked tried for seat in two in three points and entered the usual temporary wonderment flew round the table and this number was courted in dread avoided with apprehension abrane let fly a mighty breath virgin by jove success was a small matter to gower woodseer he displayed his contempt of fortune by letting his heap of banknotes lie on impair and he won abrane bade him say maximum in a furious whisper he did so as one at home with the word and winning repeatedly observed to fleetwood now i can understand what historians mean in telling us of heroes rushing into the fray and vainly seeking death i always thought death was to be had if you were in earnest fleetwood scrutinized the cast of his features and the touch of his fingers on the crispy paper come to another of these green fields he returned briefly the game here is childs play urging virgin luck not to quit his initiatory table the captain reluctantly went at their heels shortly before the tables were clad in mantles for the night he reported to livia one of the great cases of virgin luck described it from the silver piece to the big heap of notes and drew on his envy of the fellow to sketch the indomitable coolness shown in following or in quitting a run that fellow it is fleetwoods tagrag holds his head like a streetfiddler woodler or some name but theres nothing to be done if we dont cultivate him he must have pocketed a good three thousand and more they had a quarrel about calculations of chances and fleet ran the v up his forehead at a piece of impudence fellow says some highflying stuff fleet brightens like a sunday chimneysweep if i believed in black arts upon my word russett is not usually managed with ease the lady said her placid observation was directed on the pair then descending the steps be careful how you address this gentleman she counselled abrane the name is not woodier i know it must be the right name or none livias fairest smile received them she heard the captain accosting the child of luck as mr woodier and she made a rustle in rising to take fleetwoods arm we havent dined we have to sup said he you are released at the end of the lamps you redeem your ring russett and i will restore it i have to tell you henrietta is here tomorrow she might be in a better place the place where she is to be seen is not generally undervalued by men it is not her fault that she is absent the admiral was persuaded to go and attend those cavalry manoeuvres with the grand duke to whom he had been civil when in command of the mediterranean squadron you know the admiral believes he has militaryi mean soldierlygenius and the delusion may have given him wholesome exercise and helped him to forget his gout so far henrietta will have been satisfied she cannot have found much amusement among dusty troopers or at that court at carlsruhe our french milliner there has helped in retarding her quite against her will she has had to choose a balldress for the raw mountaingirl they have with them and get her fitted and its a task why take her to the ball but the admirals infatuated with this girl and wont hear of her exclusionbecause he says she understands a field of battle and the ducal party have taken to her ah russett you should not have flown no harm only henrietta does require a trifle of management she writes that she is sure of you for the night at the schloss why maam you have given your word he never breaks his lightest word she says it sounds like the beginning of respect the rarest thing men teach women to feel for them a respectable love matcheh good lord youll be civil to my friend you have struck him to the dust you have your one poetical admirer in him i am honoured russett cleared out i suppose abrane is a funnel for pouring into that bank have your fun as you like it i shall get supplies tomorrow by the way you have that boy cressett here what are you doing with him livia spoke of watching over him and guarding him he was at the table beside me bursting to have a fling and my friend mr woodseer said it was adonis come to spy the boarthe picture prompt as bugle to the breath livia proposed to bet him fifty pounds that she would keep young cressett from gambling a single louis the pretty saying did not touch her fleetwood moved and bowed sir meeson corby simulated a petrifaction of his frame at seeing the countess of fleetwood actually partly bent with her gracious acknowledgement of the tramps gawky homage etext editors bookmarks accounting his tight blue tail coat and brass buttons a victory amused after their tiresome work of slaughter and her voice against herself was for england as for comparisons they are flowers thrown into the fire as if the age were the injury brains will beat grim death if we have enough of them but a great success is full of temptations could affect me then without being flung at me country enclosed us to make us feel snug in our own importance did not know the nature of an oath and was dismissed dogs eyes have such a sick look of love drank to show his disdain of its powers earl of cressett fell from his coachbox in a fit father used to say four hours for a man six for a woman fond as they say of his glass and his girl found that he cursed better upon water goodbye to sorrow for a whilekeep your tears for the living had got the trick of

tommy wedger said he saw a dead body go by mighty highnesses who had only smelt the outside edge of battle no enemys shot is equal to a weak heart in the act not afford to lose and a disposition free of the craving to win past future and present the three weights upon humanity put material aid at a lower mark than gentleness puzzle to connect the foregoing and the succeeding seventy when most men are reaping and stacking their sins should we leave a good deed half done showery replied the admiral as his cockedhat was knocked off so indulgent when they drop their blot on a ladys character so much for morality in those days steady shakes them sweetest on earth to her was to be prized by her brother they could have pardoned her a younger lover thus are we stricken by the days of our youth

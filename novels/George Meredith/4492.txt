note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them dw farina by george meredith the white rose club in those lusty ages when the kaisers lifted high the golden goblet of aachen and drank elbow upward the green eyed wine of old romance there lived a bow shot from the bones of the eleven thousand virgins and the three holy kings a prosperous rhinelander by name gottlieb groschen or as it was sometimes ennobled gottlieb von groschen than whom no wealthier merchant bartered for the glory of his ancient mother city nor more honoured burgess swallowed impartially red juice and white under the shadow of his own fig tree vine hills among the hottest sun bibbers of the rheingau glistened in the roll of gottlieb's possessions corn acres below cologne basalt quarries about linz mineral springs in nassau a legacy of the romans to the genius and enterprise of the first of german traders he could have bought up every hawking crag owner and all from hatto's tower to rheineck lore ley combing her yellow locks against the night cloud beheld old gottlieb's rafts endlessly stealing on the moonlight through the iron pass she peoples above st goar a wailful host were the wives of his raftsmen widowed there by her watery music this worthy citizen of cologne held vasty manuscript letters of the kaiser addressed to him 'dear well born son and subject of mine gottlieb' and he was easy with the proudest princes of the holy german realm for gottlieb was a money lender and an honest man in one body he laid out for the plenteous harvests of usury not pressing the seasons with too much rigour 'i sow my seed in winter' said he 'and hope to reap good profit in autumn but if the crop be scanty better let it lie and fatten the soil' 'old earth's the wisest creditor' he would add 'she never squeezes the sun but just takes what he can give her year by year and so makes sure of good annual interest' therefore when people asked gottlieb how he had risen to such a pinnacle of fortune the old merchant screwed his eye into its wisest corner and answered slyly 'because i 've always been a student of the heavenly bodies' a communication which failed not to make the orbs and systems objects of ardent popular worship in cologne where the science was long since considered alchymic and still may be seldom could the kaiser go to war on welschland without first taking earnest counsel of his well born son and subject gottlieb and lightening his chests indeed the imperial pastime must have ceased and the kaiser had languished but for him cologne counted its illustrious citizen something more than man the burghers doffed when he passed and scampish leather draggled urchins gazed after him with praeternatural respect on their hanging chins as if a gold mine of great girth had walked through the awe struck game but for the young men of cologne he had a higher claim to reverence as father of the fair margarita the white rose of germany a noble maiden peerless and a jewel for princes the devotion of these youths should give them a name in chivalry in her honour daily and nightly they earned among themselves black bruises and paraded discoloured countenances with the humble hope to find it pleasing in her sight the tender fanatics went in bands up and down rhineland challenging wayfarers and the peasantry with staff and beaker to acknowledge the supremacy of their mistress whoso of them journeyed into foreign parts wrote home boasting how many times his head had been broken on behalf of the fair margarita and if this happened very often a spirit of envy was created which compelled him when he returned to verify his prowess on no less than a score of his rivals not to possess a beauty scar as the wounds received in these endless combats were called became the sign of inferiority so that much voluntary maiming was conjectured to be going on and to obviate this piece of treachery minutes of fights were taken and attested setting forth that a certain glorious cut or crack was honourably won in fair field on what occasion and from whom every member of the white rose club keeping his particular scroll and on days of festival and holiday wearing it haughtily in his helm strangers entering cologne were astonished at the hideous appearance of the striplings and thought they never had observed so ugly a race but they were forced to admit the fine influence of beauty on commerce seeing that the consumption of beer increased almost hourly all bavaria could not equal cologne for quantity made away with the chief members of the white rose club were berthold schmidt the rich goldsmith's son dietrich schill son of the imperial saddler heinrich abt franz endermann and ernst geller sons of chief burghers each of whom carried a yard long scroll in his cap and was too disfigured in person for men to require an inspection of the document they were dangerous youths to meet for the oaths ceremonies and recantations they demanded from every wayfarer under the rank of baron were what few might satisfactorily perform if lovers of woman other than the fair margarita or loyal husbands and what none save trained heads and stomachs could withstand however naturally manful the captain of the club was he who could drink most beer without intermediate sighing and whose face reckoned the proudest number of slices and mixture of colours the captaincy was most in dispute between dietrich schill and berthold schmidt who in the heat and constancy of contention were gradually losing likeness to man 'good coin' they gloried to reflect 'needs no stamp' one youth in cologne held out against the standing tyranny and chose to do beauty homage in his own fashion and at his leisure it was farina and oaths were registered against him over empty beer barrels an axiom of the white rose club laid it down that everybody must be enamoured of margarita and the conscience of the club made them trebly suspicious of those who were not members they had the consolation of knowing that farina was poor but then he was affirmed a student of black arts and from such a one the worst might reasonably be feared he might bewitch margarita dietrich schill was deputed by the club to sound the white rose herself on the subject of farina and one afternoon in the vintage season when she sat under the hot vine poles among maiden friends eating ripe grapes up sauntered dietrich smirking cap in hand with his scroll trailed behind him 'wilt thou' said margarita offering him a bunch 'unhappy villain that i am' replied dietrich gesticulating fox like refusal 'if i but accept a favour i break faith with the club' 'break it to pleasure me' said margarita smiling wickedly dietrich gasped he stood on tiptoe to see if any of the club were by and half stretched out his hand a mocking laugh caused him to draw it back as if stung the grapes fell farina was at margarita's feet offering them in return 'wilt thou' said margarita with softer stress and slight excess of bloom in her cheeks farina put the purple cluster to his breast and clutched them hard on his heart still kneeling margarita's brow and bosom seemed to be reflections of the streaming crimson there she shook her face to the sky and affected laughter at the symbol her companions clapped hands farina's eyes yearned to her once and then he rose and joined in the pleasantry fury helped dietrich to forget his awkwardness he touched farina on the shoulder with two fingers and muttered huskily 'the club never allow that' farina bowed as to thank him deeply for the rules of the club 'i am not a member you know' said he and strolled to a seat close by margarita dietrich glared after him as head of a club he understood the use of symbols he had lost a splendid opportunity and farina had seized it farina had robbed him 'may i speak with mistress margarita' inquired the white rose chief in a ragged voice 'surely dietrich do speak' said margarita 'alone' he continued 'is that allowed by the club' said one of the young girls with a saucy glance dietrich deigned no reply but awaited margarita's decision she hesitated a second then stood up her full height before him faced him steadily and beckoned him some steps up the vine path dietrich bowed and passing farina informed him that the club would wring satisfaction out of him for the insult farina laughed but answered 'look you of the club beer swilling has improved your manners as much as fighting has beautified your faces go on drink and fight but remember that the kaiser's coming and fellows with him who will not be bullied' 'what mean you' cried dietrich lurching round on his enemy 'not so loud friend' returned farina 'or do you wish to frighten the maidens i mean this that the club had better give as little offence as possible and keep their eyes as wide as they can if they want to be of service to mistress margarita' dietrich turned off with a grunt 'now' said margarita she was tapping her foot dietrich grew unfaithful to the club and looked at her longer than his mission warranted she was bright as the sunset gardens of the golden apples the braids of her yellow hair were bound in wreaths and on one side of her head a saffron crocus was stuck with the bell downward sweetness song and wit hung like dews of morning on her grape stained lips she wore a scarlet corset with bands of black velvet across her shoulders the girlish gown was thin blue stuff and fell short over her firm set feet neatly cased in white leather with buckles there was witness in her limbs and the way she carried her neck of an amiable but capable dragon ready when aroused to bristle up and guard the golden apples against all save the rightful claimant yet her nether lip and little white chin ball had a dreamy droop her frank blue eyes went straight into the speaker the dragon slept it was a dangerous charm 'for' says the minnesinger 'what ornament more enchants us on a young beauty than the soft slumber of a strength never yet called forth and that herself knows not of it sings double things to the heart of knighthood lures and warns us woos and threatens 'tis as nature shining peace yet the mother of storm' 'there is no man' rapturously exclaims heinrich von der jungferweide 'can resist the desire to win a sweet treasure before which lies a dragon sleeping the very danger prattles promise' but the dragon must really sleep as with margarita 'a sham dragon shamming sleep has destroyed more virgins than all the heathen emperors' says old hans aepfelmann of duesseldorf margarita's foot was tapping quicker 'speak dietrich' she said dietrich declared to the club that at this point he muttered 'we love you' margarita was glad to believe he had not spoken of himself he then informed her of the fears entertained by the club sworn to watch over and protect her regarding farina's arts 'and what fear you' said margarita 'we fear sweet mistress he may be in league with sathanas' replied dietrich 'truly then' said margarita 'of all the youths in cologne he is the least like his confederate' dietrich gulped and winked like a patient recovering wry faced from an abhorred potion 'we have warned you fraulein groschen' he exclaimed 'it now becomes our duty to see that you are not snared' margarita reddened and returned 'you are kind but i am a christian maiden and not a pagan soldan and i do not require a body of tawny guards at my heels' thereat she flung back to her companions and began staining her pretty mouth with grapes anew the tapestry word fair maids will have their hero in history siegfried was margarita's chosen she sang of siegfried all over the house 'o the old days of germany when such a hero walked' she sang 'and who wins margarita' mused farina 'happier than siegfried has in his arms brunhild and chrimhild together' crowning the young girl's breast was a cameo and the skill of some cunning artist out of welschland had wrought on it the story of the drachenfels her bosom heaved the battle up and down this cameo was a north star to german manhood but caused many chaste expressions of abhorrence from aunt lisbeth gottlieb's unmarried sister who seemed instinctively to take part with the dragon she was a frail fashioned little lady with a face betokening the perpetual smack of lemon and who reigned in her brother's household when the good wife was gone margarita's robustness was beginning to alarm and shock aunt lisbeth's sealed stock of virtue 'she must be watched such a madl as that' said aunt lisbeth 'ursula what limbs she has' margarita was watched but the spy being neither foe nor friend nothing was discovered against her this did not satisfy aunt lisbeth whose own suspicion was her best witness she allowed that margarita dissembled well 'but' said she to her niece 'though it is good in a girl not to flaunt these naughtinesses in effrontery i care for you too much not to say be what you seem my little one' 'and that am i' exclaimed margarita starting up and towering 'right good my niece' lisbeth squealed 'but now frau groschen lies in god's acre you owe your duty to me mind did you confess last week' 'from beginning to end' replied margarita aunt lisbeth fixed pious reproach on margarita's cameo 'and still you wear that thing' 'why not' said margarita 'girl who would bid you set it in such a place save satan oh thou poor lost child that the eyes of the idle youths may be drawn there and thou become his snare to others margarita what was that welsh wandering juggler but the foul fiend himself mayhap thou maiden of sin they say he has been seen in cologne lately he was swarthy as satan and limped of one leg good master in heaven protect us it was satan himself i could swear' aunt lisbeth crossed brow and breast margarita had commenced fingering the cameo as if to tear it away but aunt lisbeth's finish made her laugh outright 'where i see no harm aunty i shall think the good god is' she answered 'and where i see there's harm i shall think satan lurks' a simper of sour despair passed over aunt lisbeth she sighed and was silent being one of those very weak reeds who are easily vanquished and never overcome 'let us go on with the tapestry child' said she now margarita was ambitious of completing a certain tapestry for presentation to kaiser heinrich on his entry into cologne after his last campaign on the turbaned danube the subject was again her beloved siegfried slaying the dragon on drachenfels whenever aunt lisbeth indulged in any bitter virginity and was overmatched by margarita's frank maidenhood she hung out this tapestry as a flag of truce they were working it in bits not having contrivances to do it in a piece margarita took siegfried and aunt lisbeth the dragon they shared the crag between them a roguish gleam of the rhine toward nonnenwerth could be already made out roland's corner hanging like a sentinel across the chanting island as one top heavy with long watch aunt lisbeth was a great proficient in the art and had taught margarita the little lady learnt it with many other gruesome matters in the palatine of bohemia's family she usually talked of the spectres of hollenbogenblitz castle in the passing of the threads those were dismal spectres in bohemia smelling of murder and the charnel breath of midnight they uttered noises that wintered the blood and revealed sights that stiffened hair three feet long ay and kept it stiff margarita placed herself on a settle by the low arched window and aunt lisbeth sat facing her an evening sun blazoned the buttresses of the cathedral and shadowed the workframes of the peaceful couple to a temperate light margarita unrolled a sampler sheathed with twists of divers coloured threads and was soon busy silver threading siegfried's helm and horns 'i told you of the steward poor kraut did i not child' inquired aunt lisbeth quietly clearing her throat 'many times' said margarita and went on humming over her knee 'her love was a baron a baron so bold she loved him for love he loved her for gold' 'he must see for himself and be satisfied' continued aunt lisbeth 'and holy thomas to warn him for an example poor kraut' 'poor kraut' echoed margarita 'the king loved wine and the knight loved wine and they loved the summer weather they might have loved each other well but for one they loved together' 'you may say poor kraut child' said aunt lisbeth 'well his face was before that as red as this dragon's jaw and ever after he went about as white as a pullet's egg that was something wonderful' 'that was it' chimed margarita 'o the king he loved his lawful wife the knight a lawless lady and ten on one made ringing strife beneath the forest shady' 'fifty to one child' said aunt lisbeth 'you forget the story they made kraut sit with them at the jabbering feast the only mortal there the walls were full of eye sockets without eyes but phosphorus instead burning blue and damp' 'not to night aunty dear it frightens me so' pleaded margarita for she saw the dolor coming 'night when it's broad mid day thou timid one good heaven take pity on such as thou the dish was seven feet in length by four broad kraut measured it with his eye and never forgot it not he when the dish cover was lifted there he saw himself lying boiled 'i did not feel uncomfortable then kraut told us it seemed natural 'his face as it lay there he says was quite calm only a little wrinkled and piggish looking like there was the mole on his chin and the pucker under his left eyelid well the baron carved all the guests were greedy for a piece of him some cried out for breast some for toes it was shuddering cold to sit and hear that the baroness said cheek' 'ah' shrieked margarita 'that can i not bear i will not hear it aunt i will not' 'cheek' aunt lisbeth reiterated nodding to the floor margarita put her fingers to her ears 'still kraut says even then he felt nothing odd of course he was horrified to be sitting with spectres as you and i should be but the first tremble of it was over he had plunged into the bath of horrors and there he was i 've heard that you must pronounce the names of the virgin and trinity sprinkling water round you all the while for three minutes and if you do this without interruption everything shall disappear so they say oh dear heaven of mercy says kraut what i felt when the baron laid his long hunting knife across my left cheek' here aunt lisbeth lifted her eyes to dote upon margarita's fright she was very displeased to find her niece with elbows on the window sill and hands round her head quietly gazing into the street she said severely 'where did you learn that song you were last singing margarita speak thou girl' margarita laughed 'the thrush and the lark and the blackbird they taught me how to sing and o that the hawk would lend his eye and the eagle lend his wing' 'i will not hear these shameless songs' exclaimed aunt lisbeth 'for i would view the lands they view and be where they have been it is not enough to be singing for ever in dells unseen ' a voice was heard applauding her 'good right good carol again gretelchen my birdie' margarita turned and beheld her father in the doorway she tripped toward him and heartily gave him their kiss of meeting gottlieb glanced at the helm of siegfried 'guessed the work was going well you sing so lightsomely to day grete very pretty and that's drachenfels bones of the virgins what a bold fellow was siegfried and a lucky to have the neatest lass in deutschland in love with him well we must marry her to siegfried after all i believe aha or somebody as good as siegfried so chirrup on my darling' 'aunt lisbeth does not approve of my songs' replied margarita untwisting some silver threads 'do thy father's command girl' said aunt lisbeth 'and doing his command should i do a thing of ill i'd rather die to his lovely face than wanton at his will' 'there there' said aunt lisbeth straining out her fingers 'you see gottlieb what over indulgence brings her to not another girl in blessed rhineland and bohemia to boot dared say such words than i can't repeat them don't ask me she's becoming a frankish girl' 'what ballad's that' said gottlieb smiling 'the ballad of holy ottilia and her lover was sold to darkness and she loved him loved him ' 'as you love siegfried you little one' 'more my father for she saw winkried and i never saw siegfried ah if i had seen siegfried never mind she loved him but she loved virtue more and virtue is the child of god and the good god forgave her for loving winkried the devil's son because she loved virtue more and he rescued her as she was being dragged down down down and was half fainting with the smell of brimstone rescued her and had her carried into his glory head and feet on the wings of angels before all men as a hope to little maidens 'and when i thought that i was lost i found that i was saved and i was borne through blessed clouds where the banners of bliss were waved' 'and so you think you too may fall in love with devils' sons girl' was aunt lisbeth's comment 'do look at lisbeth's dragon little heart it's so like' said margarita to her father old gottlieb twitted his hose and chuckled 'she's my girl that may be seen' said he patting her and wheezed up from his chair to waddle across to the dragon but aunt lisbeth tartly turned the dragon to the wall 'it is not yet finished gottlieb and must not be looked at' she interposed 'i will call for wood and see to a fire these evenings of spring wax cold' and away whimpered aunt lisbeth margarita sang 'i with my playmates in riot and disorder were gathering herb and blossom along the forest border' 'thy mother's song child of my heart' said gottlieb 'but vex not good lisbeth she loves thee' 'and do you think she loves me and will you say 'tis true o and will she have me when i come up to woo' 'thou leaping doe thou chattering pie' said gottlieb 'she shall have ribbons and trinkets and shine like a morn of may when we are off to the little hill church our flowery bridal way' 'that she shall and something more ' cried gottlieb 'but hark thee gretelchen the kaiser will be here in three days thou dear one had i not stored and hoarded all for thee i should now have my feet on a hearthstone where even he might warm his boot so get thy best dresses and jewels in order and look thyself proud as any in the land a simple burgher's daughter now grete but so shalt thou not end my butterfly or there's neither worth nor wit in gottlieb groschen' 'three days' margarita exclaimed 'and the helm not finished and the tapestry pieces not sewed and joined and the water not shaded off oh i must work night and day' 'child i'll have no working at night your rosy cheeks will soon be sucked out by oil light and you look no better than poor tallow court beauties to say nothing of the danger this old house saw charles the great embracing the chief magistrate of his liege city yonder some swear he slept in it he did not sneeze at smaller chambers than our kaisers abide no gold ceilings with cornice carvings but plain wooden beams' 'know that the men of great renown were men of simple needs bare to the lord they laid them down and slept on mighty deeds' 'god wot there's no emptying thy store of ballads grete so much shall be said of thee yes times are changeing we're growing degenerate look at the men of linz now to what they were would they have let the lads of andernach float down cabbage stalks to them without a shy back and why all because they funk that brigand beast werner who gets redemption from laach hard by his hold whenever he commits a crime worth paying for as for me my timber and stuffs must come down stream and are too good for the nixen under rhine or think you i would acknowledge him with a toll the hell dog thunder and lightning if old scores could be rubbed out on his hide' gottlieb whirled a thong lashing arm in air and groaned of law and justice what were they coming to margarita softened the theme with a verse 'and tho' to sting his enemy is sweetness to the angry bee the angry bee must busy be ere sweet of sweetness hiveth he the arch thrill of his daughter's voice tickled gottlieb 'that's it birdie you and the proverb are right i don't know which is best 'better hive and keep alive than vengeance wake with that you take' a clatter in the cathedral square brought gottlieb on his legs to the window it was a company of horsemen sparkling in harness one trumpeter rode at the side of the troop and in front a standard bearer matted down the chest with ochre beard displayed aloft to the good citizens of cologne three brown hawks with birds in their beaks on an azure stardotted field 'holy cross' exclaimed gottlieb low in his throat 'the arms of werner where got he money to mount his men why this is daring all cologne in our very teeth 'fend that he visit me now ruin smokes in that ruffian's track i 've felt hot and cold by turns all day' the horsemen came jingling carelessly along the street in scattered twos and threes laughing together and singling out the maidens at the gable shadowed windows with hawking eyes the good citizens of cologne did not look on them favourably some showed their backs and gruffly banged their doors others scowled and pocketed their fists not a few slunk into the side alleys like well licked curs and scurried off with forebent knees they were in truth ferocious looking fellows these trusty servants of the robber baron werner of werner's eck behind andernach leather steel and dust clad them from head to foot big and black as bears wolf eyed fox nosed they glistened bravely in the falling beams of the sun and margarita thrust her fair braided yellow head a little forward over her father's shoulder to catch the whole length of the grim cavalcade one of the troop was not long in discerning the young beauty he pointed her boldly out to a comrade who approved his appetite and referred her to a third the rest followed lead and margarita was as one spell struck when she became aware that all those hungry eyes were preying on hers old gottlieb was too full of his own fears to think for her and when he drew in his head rather suddenly it was with a dismal foreboding that werner's destination in cologne was direct to the house of gottlieb groschen for purposes only too well to be divined 'devil's breeches' muttered gottlieb 'look again grete and see if that hell troop stop the way outside' margarita's cheeks were overflowing with the offended rose 'i will not look at them again father' gottlieb stared and then patted her 'i would i were a man father' gottlieb smiled and stroked his beard 'oh how i burn' and the girl shivered visibly 'grete mind to be as much of a woman as you can and soon such raff as this you may sweep away like cobwebs and no harm done' he was startled by a violent thumping at the streetdoor and as brazen a blast as if the dead were being summoned aunt lisbeth entered and flitted duskily round the room crying 'we are lost they are upon us better death with a bodkin never shall it be said of me never the monsters' then admonishing them to lock bar bolt and block up every room in the house aunt lisbeth perched herself on the edge of a chair and reversed the habits of the screech owl by being silent when stationary 'there's nothing to fear for you lisbeth' said gottlieb with discourteous emphasis 'gottlieb do you remember what happened at the siege of mainz and poor marthe herbstblum who had hoped to die as she was and dame altknopfchen and frau kaltblut and the old baker hans topf's sister all of them as holy as abbesses and that did not save them and nothing will from such godless devourers' gottlieb was gone having often before heard mention of the calamity experienced by these fated women 'comfort thee good heart on my breast' said margarita taking lisbeth to that sweet nest of peace and fortitude 'margarita 'tis your doing have i not said lure them not for they swarm too early upon us and here they are and perhaps in five minutes all will be over herr je what you are laughing heavens of goodness the girl is delighted' here a mocking ha ha accompanied by a thundering snack at the door shook the whole house and again the trumpet burst the ears with fury this summons which seemed to aunt lisbeth final wrought a strange composure in her countenance she was very pale but spread her dress decently as if fear had departed and clasped her hands on her knees 'the will of the lord above must be done' said she 'it is impious to complain when we are given into the hand of the philistines others have been martyred and were yet acceptable' to this heroic speech she added with cold energy 'let them come' 'aunt' cried margarita 'i hear my father's voice with those men aunty i will not let him be alone i must go down to him you will be safe here i shall come to you if there's cause for alarm' and in spite of aunt lisbeth's astonished shriek of remonstrance she hurried off to rejoin gottlieb the wager ere margarita had reached the landing of the stairs she repented her haste and shrank back wrapt in a thunder of oaths she distinguished ''tis the little maiden we want let's salute her and begone or cap your skull with something thicker than you've on it now if you want a whole one happy father' 'gottlieb von groschen i am' answered her father 'and the kaiser ' ''s as fond of a pretty girl as we are down with her and no more drivelling it's only for a moment old measure and scales' 'i tell you rascals i know your master and if you're not punished for this may i die a beggar' exclaimed gottlieb jumping with rage 'may you die as rich as an abbot and so you will if you don't bring her down for i've sworn to see her there 's the end of it man' 'i'll see too if the laws allow this villany ' cried gottlieb 'insulting a peaceful citizen in his own house a friend of your emperor gottlieb von groschen' 'groschen we're cousins then you wouldn't shut out your nearest kin devil's lightning don't you know me pfennig von pfennig this here's heller that's zwanziger all of us vons every soul you're not decided this'll sharpen you my jolly king paunch' and margarita heard the ruffian step as if to get swing for a blow she hurried into the passage and slipping in front of her father said to his assailant 'you have asked for me i am here' her face was colourless and her voice seemed to issue from between a tightened cord she stood with her left foot a little in advance and her whole body heaving and quivering her arms folded and pressed hard below her bosom her eyes dilated to a strong blue her mouth ashy white a strange lustre as of suppressed internal fire flickered over her 'my name 's schwartz thier and so 's my nature' said the fellow with a grin 'but may i never smack lips with a pretty girl again if i harm such a young beauty as this friendly dealing's my plan o' life' 'clear out of my house then fellow and here's money for you' said gottlieb displaying a wrathfully trembling handful of coin 'pish money forty times that wouldn't cover my bet and if it did shouldn't i be disgraced jeered at for a sheep heart no i'm no ninny and not to be diddled i'll talk to the young lady silence out there all's going proper' this to his comrades through the door 'so my beautiful maiden thus it stands we saw you at the window looking like a fresh rose with a gold crown on here are we poor fellows come to welcome the kaiser i began to glorify you schwartz thier says henker rothhals to me i'll wager you odds you don't have a kiss of that fine girl within twenty minutes counting from the hand smack done was my word and we clapped our fists together now you see that's straightforward all i want is not to lose my money and be made a fool of leaving alone that sugary mouth which makes mine water' and he drew the back of his hand along his stubbled jaws 'so come don't hesitate no harm to you my beauty but a compliment and schwartz thier's your friend and anything else you like for ever after come time's up pretty well' margarita leaned to her father a moment as if mortal sickness had seized her then cramping her hands and feet she said in his ear 'leave me to my own care go get the men to protect thee' and ordered schwartz thier to open the door wide seeing gottlieb would not leave her she joined her hands and begged him 'the good god will protect me i will overmatch these men look my father they dare not strike me in the street you they would fell without pity go what they dare in a house they dare not in the street' schwartz thier had opened the door at sight of margarita the troop gave a shout 'now on the doorstep full in view my beauteous one that they may see what a lucky devil i am and have no doubts about the handing over' margarita looked behind gottlieb was still there every member of him quaking like a bog under a heavy heel she ran to him 'my father i have a device wilt thou spoil it and give me to this beast you can do nothing nothing protect yourself and save me' 'cologne broad day' muttered gottlieb as if the enormity had prostrated his belief in facts and moved slowly back margarita strode to the door step schwartz thier was awaiting her his arm circled out and his leering face ducked to a level with his victim's this rough show of gallantry proved costly to him as he was gently closing his iron hold about her enjoying before hand with grim mouthridges the flatteries of triumph margarita shot past him through the door and was already twenty paces beyond the troop before either of them thought of pursuing her at the first sound of a hoof henker rothhals seized the rider's bridle rein and roared 'fair play for a fair bet leave all to the thier' the thier when he had recovered from his amazement sought for old gottlieb to give him a back hit as margarita foresaw that he would not finding him at hand out lumbered the fellow as swiftly as his harness would allow and caught a glimpse of margarita rapidly fleeting up the cathedral square 'only five minutes schwartz thier' some of the troop sung out 'the devil can do his business in one' was the retort and schwartz thier swung himself on his broad backed charger and gored the fine beast till she rattled out a blast of sparkles from the flint in a minute he drew up in front of margarita 'so you prefer settling this business in the square good my choice sweetheart' and he sprang to her side the act of flight had touched the young girl's heart with the spirit of flight she crouched like a winded hare under the nose of the hound and covered her face with her two hands margarita was no wisp in weight but schwartz thier had her aloft in his arm as easily as if he had tossed up a kerchief 'look all and witness' he shouted lifting the other arm henker rothhals and the rest of the troop looked as they came trotting to the scene with the coolness of umpires but they witnessed something other than what schwartz thier proposed this was the sight of a formidable staff whirling an unfriendly halo over the head of the thier and descending on it with such honest intent to confound and overthrow him that the thier succumbed to its force without argument and the square echoed blow and fall simultaneously at the same time the wielder of this sound piece of logic seized margarita and raised a shout in the square for all true men to stand by him in rescuing a maiden from the clutch of brigands and ravishers a crowd was collecting but seemed to consider the circle now formed by the horsemen as in a manner charmed for only one a fair slender youth came forward and ranged himself beside the stranger 'take thou the maiden i'll keep to the staff' said this latter stumbling over his speech as if he was in a foreign land among old roots and wolfpits which had already shaken out a few of his teeth and made him cautious about the remainder 'can it be margarita' exclaimed the youth bending to her and calling to her 'margarita fraulein groschen' she opened her eyes shuddered and said 'i was not afraid am i safe' 'safe while i have life and this good friend' 'where is my father' 'i have not seen him' 'and you who are you do i owe this to you' 'oh no no me you owe nothing' margarita gazed hurriedly round and at her feet there lay the thier with his steel cap shining in dints and three rivulets of blood coursing down his mottled forehead she looked again at the youth and a blush of recognition gave life to her cheeks 'i did not know you pardon me farina what thanks can reward such courage tell me shall we go' 'the youth eyed her an instant but recovering himself took a rapid survey and called to the stranger to follow and help give the young maiden safe conduct home 'just then henker rothhals bellowed 'time's up' he was answered by a chorus of agreement from the troop they had hitherto patiently acted their parts as spectators immovable on their horses the assault on the thier was all in the play and a visible interference of fortune in favour of henker rothhals now general commotion shuttled them and the stranger's keen hazel eyes read their intentions rightly when he lifted his redoubtable staff in preparation for another mighty swoop this time defensive rothhals and half a dozen others with a war cry of curses spurred their steeds at once to ride him down they had not reckoned the length and good will of their antagonist's weapon scarce were they in motion when round it whizzed grazing the nostrils of their horses with a precision that argued practice in the feat and unhorsing two rothhals among the number he dropped heavily on his head and showed signs of being as incapable of combat as the thier a cheer burst from the crowd but fell short the foremost of their number was struck flat to the earth by a fellow of the troop calling on st george his patron saint the stranger began systematically to make a clear ring in his path forward several of the horsemen essayed a cut at his arm with their long double handed swords but the horses could not be brought a second time to the edge of the magic circle and the blood of these warriors being thoroughly up they now came at him on foot in their rage they would have made short work with the three in spite of the magistracy of cologne had they not been arrested by cries of 'werner werner' at the south west end of the square looking rhinewards rode the marauder baron in full armour helm and hauberk with a single retainer in his rear he had apparently caught sight of the brawl and either because he distinguished his own men or was seeking his natural element hastened up for his share in it which was usually that of the king of beasts his first call was for schwartz thier the men made way and he beheld his man in no condition to make military responses he shouted for henker rothhals and again the men opened their ranks mutely exhibiting the two stretched out in diverse directions with their feet slanting to a common point the baron glared then caught off his mailed glove and thrust it between his teeth a rasping gurgle of oaths was all they heard and presently surged up 'who was it' margarita's eyes were shut she opened them fascinated with horror there was an unearthly awful and comic mixture of sounds in werner's querulous fury that was like the noise of a complaining bear rolling up from hollow chested menace to yawning lament never in her life had margarita such a shock of fear the half gasp of a laugh broke on her trembling lips she stared at werner and was falling but farina's arm clung instantly round her waist the stranger caught up her laugh loud and hearty 'as for who did it sir baron' he cried is a cheery tone 'i am the man as you may like to know why and that's due to you and me both of us all i can say is the black muzzle yonder lying got his settler for merry making with this peaceful maiden here without her consent an offence in my green island they reckon a crack o' the sconce light basting for i warrant all company present' and he nodded sharply about 'as for the other there who looks as if a rope had been round his neck once and shirked its duty he counts his wages for helping the devil in his business as will any other lad here who likes to come on and try' werner himself probably would have given him the work he wanted but his eye had sidled a moment over margarita and the hardly suppressed applause of the crowd at the stranger's speech failed to bring his ire into action this solitary time 'who is the maiden' he asked aloud 'fraulein von groschen' replied farina 'von groschen von groschen the daughter of gottlieb groschen rascals' roared the baron turning on his men and out poured a mud spring of filthy oaths and threats which caused henker rothhals who had opened his eyes to close them again as if he had already gone to the place of heat 'only lend me thy staff friend' cried werner 'not i thwack 'em with your own wood' replied the stranger and fell back a leg werner knotted his stringy brows and seemed torn to pieces with the different pulling tides of his wrath he grasped the mane of his horse and flung abroad handfuls till the splendid animal reared in agony 'you shall none of you live over this night villains i 'll hang you every hag's son my last orders were keep quiet in the city ye devil's brood take that and that' laying at them with his bare sword 'off with you and carry these two pigs out of sight quickly or i'll have their heads and make sure o' them' the latter injunction sprang from policy for at the head of the chief street there was a glitter of the city guard marching with shouldered spears 'maiden' said werner with a bull's bow 'let me conduct thee to thy father' margarita did not reply but gave her hand to farina and took a step closer to the stranger werner's brows grew black 'enough to have saved you fair maid' he muttered hoarsely 'gratitude never was a woman's gift say to your father that i shall make excuses to him for the conduct of my men' whereupon casting a look of leisurely scorn toward the guard coming up in the last beams of day the baron shrugged his huge shoulders to an altitude expressing the various contemptuous shades of feudal coxcombry stuck one leather ruffled arm in his side and jolted off at an easy pace 'amen' ejaculated the stranger leaning on his staff 'there are barons in my old land but never a brute beast in harness' margarita stood before him and took his two hands 'you will come with me to my father he will thank you i cannot you will come' tears and a sob of relief started from her the city guard on seeing werner's redoubtable back turned had adopted double time and now came panting up while the stranger bent smiling under a fresh overflow of innocent caresses margarita was caught to her father's breast 'you shall have vengeance for this sweet chuck' cried old gottlieb in the intervals of his hugs 'fear not my father they are punished' and margarita related the story of the stranger's prowess elevating him into a second siegfried the guard huzzaed him but did not pursue the baron old gottlieb without hesitation saluted the astonished champion with a kiss on either cheek 'my best friend you have saved my daughter from indignity come with us home if you can believe that a home where the wolves come daring us dragging our dear ones from our very doorsteps come that we may thank you under a roof at least my little daughter is she not a brave lass' 'she's nothing less than the white rose of germany' said the stranger with a good bend of the shoulders to margarita 'so she's called' exclaimed gottlieb 'she 's worthy to be a man' 'men would be the losers then more than they could afford' replied the stranger with a ringing laugh 'come good friend' said gottlieb 'you must need refreshment prove you are a true hero by your appetite as charles the great said to archbishop turpin i conquered the world because nature gave me a gizzard for everywhere the badge of subjection is a poor stomach come all a day well ended notwithstanding' the silver arrow at the threshold of gottlieb's house a number of the chief burgesses of cologne had corporated spontaneously to condole with him as he came near they raised a hubbub of gratulation strong were the expressions of abhorrence and disgust of werner's troop in which these excellent citizens clothed their outraged feelings for the insult to gottlieb was the insult of all the rhinestream taxes were provoking enough to endure but that the licence of these free booting bands should extend to the homes of free and peaceful men loyal subjects of the emperor was a sign that the evil had reached from pricks to pokes as the saying went and must now be met as became burgesses of ancient cologne and by joint action destroyed 'in in all of you' said gottlieb broadening his smile to suit the many 'we 'll talk about that in doors meantime i've got a hero to introduce to you flesh and blood no old woman's coin and young girl's dream o'day the honest thing and a rarity my masters all that over some good rhine juice from above bacharach in and welcome friends' gottlieb drew the stranger along with him under the carved old oak wood portals and the rest paired and reverentially entered in his wake margarita to make up for this want of courtesy formed herself the last of the procession she may have had another motive for she took occasion there to whisper something to farina bringing sun and cloud over his countenance in rapid flushes he seemed to remonstrate in dumb show but she with an attitude of silence signified her wish to seal the conversation and he drooped again on the door step she paused a moment and hung her head pensively as if moved by a reminiscence the youth had hurried away some strides margarita looked after him his arms were straightened to his flanks his hands clenched and straining out from the wrist he had the aspect of one tugging against the restraint of a chain that suddenly let out link by link to his whole force 'farina' she called and wound him back with a run 'farina you do not think me ungrateful i could not tell my father in the crowd what you did for me he shall know he will thank you he does not understand you now farina he will look not so sorrowful so much i would say to you' so much was rushing on her mind that her maidenly heart became unruly and warned her to beware the youth stood as if listening to a nightingale of the old woods after the first sweet stress of her voice was in his ear when she ceased he gazed into her eyes they were no longer deep and calm like forest lakes the tender glowing blue quivered as with a spark of the young girl's soul in the beams of the moon then rising 'oh margarita' said the youth in tones that sank to sighs 'what am i to win your thanks though it were my life for such a boon' he took her hand and she did not withdraw it twice his lips dwelt upon those pure fingers 'margarita you forgive me i have been so long without hope i have kissed your hand dearest of god's angels' she gently restrained the full white hand in his pressure 'margarita i have thought never before death to have had this sacred bliss i am guerdoned in advance for every grief coming before death' she dropped on him one look of a confiding softness that was to the youth like the opened gate of the innocent garden of her heart 'you pardon me margarita i may call you my beloved strive wait pray hope for you my star of life' her face was so sweet a charity 'dear love one word or say nothing but remain and move not so beautiful you are oh might i kneel to you here dote on you worship this white hand for ever' the colour had passed out of her cheeks like a blissful western red leaving rich paleness in the sky and with her clear brows levelled at him her bosom lifting more and more rapidly she struggled against the charm that was on her and at last released her hand 'i must go i cannot stay pardon you who might not be proud of your love farewell' she turned to move away but lingered a step from him hastily touching her bosom and either hand as if to feel for a brooch or a ring then she blushed drew the silver arrow from the gathered gold shot braids above her neck held it out to him and was gone farina clutched the treasure and reeled into the street half a dozen neighbours were grouped by the door 'what 's the matter in master groschen's house now' one asked as he plunged into the midst of them 'matter' quoth the joy drunken youth catching at the word and mused off into raptures 'there never was such happiness 'tis paradise within exile without but what exile a star ever in the heavens to lighten the road and cheer the path of the banished one' and he loosened his vest and hugged the cold shaft on his breast 'what are you talking and capering at fellow' exclaimed another 'can't you answer about those shrieks like a christian you that have just come out of the house why there's shrieking now it 's a woman thousand thunders it sounds like the frau lisbeth's voice what can be happening to her' 'perhaps she's on fire' was coolly suggested between two or three 'pity to see the old house burnt' remarked one 'house the woman man the woman' 'ah' replied the other an ancient inhabitant of cologne shaking his head 'the house is oldest' farina now recovering his senses heard shrieks that he recognized as possible in the case of aunt lisbeth dreading the wickedness of an opposing sex and alarmed by the inrush of old gottlieb's numerous guests to confirm him she soon appeared and hung herself halfway out of one of the upper windows calling desperately to st ursula for aid he thanked the old lady in his heart for giving him a pretext to enter paradise again but before even love could speed him frau lisbeth was seized and dragged remorselessly out of sight and he and the rosy room darkened together farina twice strode off to the rhine stream as many times he returned it was hard to be away from her it was harder to be near and not close his heart flamed into jealousy of the stranger everything threatened to overturn his slight but lofty structure of bliss so suddenly shot into the heavens he had but to remember that his hand was on the silver arrow and a radiance broke upon his countenance and a calm fell upon his breast 'it was a plight of her troth to me' mused the youth 'she loves me she would not trust her frank heart to speak oh generous young girl what am i to dare hope for such a prize for i never can be worthy and she is one who giving her heart gives it all do i not know her how lovely she looked thanking the stranger the blue of her eyes the warm lighted blue seemed to grow full on the closing lids like heaven's gratitude her beauty is wonderful what wonder then if he loves her i should think him a squire in his degree there are squires of high birth and low' so mused farina with his arms folded and his legs crossed in the shadow of margarita's chamber gradually he fell into a kind of hazy doze the houses became branded with silver arrows all up the cathedral stone was a glitter and dance and quiver of them in the sky mazed confusion of arrowy flights and falls farina beheld himself in the service of the emperor watching these signs and expecting on the morrow to win glory and a name for margarita glory and the name now won old gottlieb was just on the point of paternally blessing them when a rude pat aroused him from the delicious moon dream 'hero by day house guard by night that tells a tale' said a cheerful voice the moon was shining down the cathedral square and street and farina saw the stranger standing solid and ruddy before him he was at first prompted to resent such familiar handling but the stranger's face was of that bland honest nature which like the sun wins everywhere back a reflection of its own kindliness 'you are right' replied farina 'so it is' 'pretty wines inside there and a rare young maiden she has a throat like a nightingale and more ballads at command than a piper's wallet now if i hadn't a wife at home' 'you're married' cried farina seizing the stranger's hand 'surely and my lass can say something for herself on the score of brave looks as well as the best of your german maids here trust me' farina repressed an inclination to perform a few of those antics which violent joy excites and after rushing away and back determined to give his secret to the stranger 'look' said he in a whisper that opens the private doors of a confidence but the stranger repeated the same word still more earnestly and brought farina's eyes on a couple of dark figures moving under the cathedral 'some lamb's at stake when the wolves are prowling' he added ''tis now two hours to the midnight i doubt if our day's work be over till we hear the chime friend' 'what interest do you take in the people of this house that you watch over them thus' asked farina the stranger muffled a laugh in his beard 'an odd question good sooth why in the first place we like well whatso we have done good work for that goes for something in the second i've broken bread in this house put down that in the reckoning in the third well in the third add up all together and the sum total's at your service young sir' farina marked him closely there was not a spot on his face for guile to lurk in or suspicion to fasten on he caught the stranger's hand 'you called me friend just now make me your friend look i was going to say i love this maiden i would die for her i have loved her long this night she has given me a witness that my love is not vain i am poor she is rich i am poor i said and feel richer than the kaiser with this she has given me look it is what our german girls slide in their back hair this silver arrow' 'a very pretty piece of heathenish wear' exclaimed the stranger 'then i was going to say tell me friend of a way to win honour and wealth quickly i care not at how rare a risk only to wealth or high baronry will her father give her' the stranger buzzed on his moustache in a pause of cool pity such as elders assume when young men talk of conquering the world for their mistresses and in truth it is a calm of mind well won 'things look so brisk at home here in the matter of the maiden that i should say wait a while and watch your chance but you're a boy of pluck i serve in the kaiser's army under my lord the kaiser will be here in three days if you 're of that mind then i doubt little you may get posted well but look again there's a ripe brew yonder marry you may win your spurs this night even who knows 's life there's a tall fellow joining those two lurkers' 'can you see into the murk shadow sir squire' 'ay thanks to your styrian dungeons where i passed a year's apprenticeship i learnt to watch the rats and mice at play with never a candle end they play'd so well they sang so nice they dubb'd me comrade called me friend so says the ballad of our red beard king's captivity all evil has a good when our toes and chins are up poison plants make sweetest cup as the old wives mumble to us when we're sick heigho would i were in the little island well home again though that were just their song of welcome to me as i am a christian' 'tell me your name friend' said farina 'guy's my name young man goshawk's my title guy the goshawk so they called me in my merry land the cap sticks when it no longer fits then i drove the arrow and was down on my enemy ere he could ruffle a feather now what would be my nickname a change so sad and a change so bad might set both christian and heathen a sighing change is a curse for it's all for the worse age creeps up and youth is flying and so on with the old song but here am i and yonder's a game that wants harrying so we'll just begin to nose about them a bit' he crossed to the other side of the street and farina followed out of the moonlight the two figures and the taller one were evidently observing them for they also changed their position and passed behind an angle of the cathedral 'tell me how the streets cross all round the cathedral you know the city' said the stranger holding out his hand farina traced with his finger a rough map of the streets on the stranger's hand 'good that's how my lord always marks the battlefield and makes me show him the enemy's posts forward this way' he turned from the cathedral and both slid along close under the eaves and front hangings of the houses neither spoke farina felt that he was in the hands of a skilful captain and only regretted the want of a weapon to make harvest of the intended surprise for he judged clearly that those were fellows of werner's band on the look out they wound down numberless intersections of narrow streets with irregular built houses standing or leaning wry faced in row here a quaint beamed cottage there almost a mansion with gilt arms brackets and devices oil lamps unlit hung at intervals by the corners near a pale christ on crucifix across the passages they hung alight the passages and alleys were too dusky and close for the moon in her brightest ardour to penetrate down the streets a slender lane of white beams could steal 'in all conscience' as the good citizens of cologne declared 'enough for those heathen hounds and sons of the sinful who are abroad when god's own blessed lamp is out' so when there was a moon the expense of oil was saved to the cologne treasury thereby satisfying the virtuous after incessant doubling here and there listening to footfalls and themselves eluding a chase which their suspicious movements aroused they came upon the rhine a full flood of moonlight burnished the knightly river in glittering scales and plates and rings as headlong it rolled seaward on from under crag and banner of old chivalry and rapine both greeted the scene with a burst of pleasure the grey mist of flats on the south side glimmered delightful to their sight coming from that drowsy crowd and press of habitations but the solemn glory of the river delaying not heedless impassioned pouring on in some sublime conference between it and heaven to the great marriage of waters deeply shook farina's enamoured heart the youth could not restrain his tears as if a magic wand had touched him he trembled with love and that delicate bliss which maiden hope first showers upon us like a silver rain when she has taken the shape of some young beauty and plighted us her fair fleeting hand tenderly embraced him as they were emerging into the spaces of the moon a cheer from the stranger arrested farina 'seest thou on the wharf there that is the very one the tallest of the three lakin but we shall have him' wrapt in a long cloak with low pointed cap and feather stood the person indicated he appeared to be meditating on the flow of the water unaware of hostile presences or quite regardless of them there was a majesty in his height and air which made the advance of the two upon him more wary and respectful than their first impulse had counselled they could not read his features which were mantled behind voluminous folds all save a pair of very strange eyes that even as they gazed directly downward seemed charged with restless fiery liquid the two were close behind him guy the goshawk prepared for one of those fatal pounces on the foe that had won him his title he consulted farina mutely who nodded readiness but the instant after a cry of anguish escaped from the youth 'lost gone lost where is it where the arrow the silver arrow my margarita' ere the echoes of his voice had ceased lamenting into the distance they found themselves alone on the wharf the lilies of the valley 'he opened like a bat' said the stranger 'his shadow was red' said farina 'he was off like an arrow' said the stranger 'oh pledge of my young love how could i lose thee' exclaimed the youth and his eyes were misted with tears guy the goshawk shook his brown locks gravely 'bring me a man and i 'll stand up against him whoever he be like a man but this fellow has an ill scent and foreign ways about him that he has his eye boils all down my backbone and tingles at my finger tips jesu save us' 'save us' repeated farina with the echo of a deadened soul they made the sign of the cross and purified the place with holy ejaculations 'i 've seen him at last grant it be for the last time that's my prayer in the name of the virgin and trinity' said guy 'and now let's retrace our steps perchance we shall hunt up that bauble of yours but i'm not fit for mortal work this night longer' burdened by their black encounter the two passed again behind the cathedral farina's hungry glances devoured each footmark of their track where the moon held no lantern for him he went on his knees and groped for his lost treasure with a miser's eager patience of agony drawing his hand slowly over the stony kerb and between the interstices of the thick sown flints like an acute feeling worm despair grew heavy in his breast at every turning he invoked some good new saint to aid him and ran over all the propitiations his fancy could suggest and his religious lore inspire by and by they reached the head of the street where margarita dwelt the moon was dipping down and paler as if touched with a warning of dawn chill sighs from the open land passed through the spaces of the city on certain coloured gables and wood crossed fronts the white light lingered but mostly the houses were veiled in dusk and gottlieb's house was confused in the twilight with those of his neighbours notwithstanding its greater stateliness and the old grandeur of its timbered bulk they determined to take up their position there again and paced on farina with his head below his shoulders and guy nostril in air as if uneasy in his sense of smell on the window ledge of a fair fitted domicile stood a flower pot a rude earthen construction in the form of a river barge wherein grew some valley lilies that drooped their white bells over the sides the goshawk eyed them wistfully 'i must smell those blessed flowers if i wish to be saved' and he stamped resolve with his staff moved by this exclamation farina gazed up at them 'how like a company of maidens they look floating in the vessel of life' he said guy curiously inspected farina and the flower pot shrugged and with his comrade's aid mounted to a level with it seized the prize and redescended 'there' he cried between long luxurious sniffs 'that chases him out of the nostril sooner than aught else the breath of a fresh lass like flower i was tormented till now by the reek of the damned rising from under me this is heaven's own incense i think ' and guy inhaled the flowers and spake prettily to them 'they have a melancholy sweetness friend' said farina 'i think of whispering fays and elf and erl when their odour steals through me do not you' 'nay nor hope to till my wits are clean gone' was the goshawk's reply 'to my mind 'tis an honest flower and could i do good service by the young maiden who there set it i should be rendering back good service done for if that flower has not battled the devil in my nose this night and beaten him my head's a medlar' 'i scarce know whether as a devout christian i should listen to that friend' farina mildly remonstrated 'lilies are indeed emblems of the saints but then they are not poor flowers of earth being transfigured lustrous unfadingly oh cross and passion with what silver serenity thy glory enwraps me gazing on these fair bells i look on the white sea of the saints i am enamoured of fleshly anguish and martyrdom all beauty is that worn by wan smiling faces wherein hope sits as a crown on sorrow and the pale ebb of mortal life is the twilight of joy everlasting colourless peace oh my beloved so walkest thou for my soul on the white sea ever at night clad in the straight fall of thy spotless virgin linen bearing in thy hand the lily and leaning thy cheek to it where the human rose is softened to a milky bloom of red the espousals of heaven with earth over thee moving with thee a wreath of sapphire stars and the solitude of purity around' 'ah' sighed the goshawk dandling his flower pot 'the moon gives strokes as well's the sun i' faith moon struck and maid struck in one he'll be asking for his head soon this dash of the monk and the minstrel is a sure sign that 's their way of loving in this land they all go mad straight off i never heard such talk' guy accompanied these remarks with a pitiful glance at his companion 'come sir lover lend me a help to give back what we've borrowed to its rightful owner 's blood but i feel an appetite this night air takes me in the wind like a battering ram i thought i had laid in a stout four and twenty hours' stock of westphalian wurst at master groschen's supper table good stuff washed down with superior rhine wine say your liebfrauenmilch for my taste though when i first tried it i grimaced like a merry andrew and remembered roast beef and glo'ster ale in my prayers' the goshawk was in the act of replacing the pot of lilies when a blow from a short truncheon skilfully flung struck him on the neck and brought him to the ground with him fell the lilies he glared to the right and left and grasped the broken flower pot for a return missile but no enemy was in view to test his accuracy of aim the deep arched doorways showed their empty recesses the windows slept 'has that youth played me false' thought the discomfited squire as he leaned quietly on his arm farina was nowhere near guy was quickly reassured 'by my fay now that's a fine thing and a fine fellow and a fleet foot that lad 'll rise he'll be a squire some day look at him bowels of a'becket 'tis a sight i'd rather see that now than old groschen 's supper table groaning with wurst again and running a river of rudesheimer tussle on i'll lend a hand if there's occasion but you shall have the honour boy an you can win it' this crying on of the hound was called forth by a chase up the street in which the goshawk beheld farina pursue and capture a stalwart runaway who refused with all his might to be brought back striving every two and three of his tiptoe steps to turn against the impulse farina had got on his neck and nether garments 'who 'd have thought the lad was so wiry and mettlesome with his soft face blue eyes and lank locks but a green mead has more in it than many a black mountain hail and well done if i could dub you knight i would trust me' and he shook farina by the hand farina modestly stood aside and allowed the goshawk to confront his prisoner 'so sir shy i'the dark gallant stick i'the back squire truncheon and knight of the noble order of quicksilver legs just take your stand at the distance you were off me when you discharged this instrument at my head by 'r lady i smart a scratch to pay you in coin and it's lucky for you the coin is small or you might reckon on it the same trust me now back' the goshawk lunged out with the truncheon but the prisoner displayed no hesitation in complying and fell back about a space of fifteen yards 'i suppose he guesses i've never done the stupid trick before' mused guy 'or he would not be so sharp' observing that farina had also fallen back in a line as guard guy motioned him to edge off to the right more bawling 'never mind why' 'now' thought guy 'if i were sure of notching him i'd do the speech part first but as i'm not throwing truncheons being no honourable profession anywhere i'll reserve that the rascal don't quail we'll see how long he stands firm' the goshawk cleared his wrist fixed his eye and swung the truncheon meditatively to and fro by one end he then launched off the shoulder a mighty down fling calmly watching it strike the prisoner to earth like an ox under the hammer 'a hit' said he and smoothed his wrist farina knelt by the body and lifted the head on his breast 'berthold berthold' he cried 'no further harm shall hap to you man speak' 'you ken the scapegrace' said guy sauntering up ''tis berthold schmidt son of old schmidt the great goldsmith of cologne' 'st dunstan was not at his elbow this time' 'a rival of mine' whispered farina 'oho' and the goshawk wound a low hiss at his tongue's tip 'well as i should have spoken if his ears had been open justice struck the blow and a gentle one this comes of taking a flying shot and not standing up fair and that seems all that can be said where lives he' farina pointed to the house of the lilies 'beshrew me the dog has some right on his side whew yonder he lives he took us for some night prowlers why not come up fairly and ask my business smelling a flower is not worth a broken neck nor defending your premises quite deserving a hole in the pate now my lad you see what comes of dealing with cut and run blows and let this be a warning to you' they took the body by head and feet and laid him at the door of his father's house here the colour came to his cheek and they wiped off the streaks of blood that stained him guy proved he could be tender with a fallen foe and farina with an ill fated rival it was who could suggest the soundest remedies or easiest postures one lent a kerchief and nursed him another ran to the city fountain and fetched him water meantime the moon had dropped and morning grey and beamless looked on the house peaks and along the streets with steadier eye they now both discerned a body of men far down fronting gottlieb's house and drawn up in some degree of order all their charity forsook them at once 'possess thyself of the truncheon' said guy 'you see it can damage more work before breakfast and a fine account i must give of myself to my hostess of the three holy kings' farina recovered the destructive little instrument 'i am ready' said he 'but hark there's little work for us there i fancy those be lads of cologne no grunters of the wild 'tis the white rose club always too late for service' voices singing a hunting glee popular in that age swelled up the clear morning air and gradually the words became distinct the kaiser went a hunting a hunting tra ra with his bugle horn at springing morn the kaiser trampled bud and thorn tra ra and the dew shakes green as the horsemen rear and a thousand feathers they flutter with fear and a pang drives quick to the heart of the deer for the kaiser's out a hunting tra ra ta ta ta ta tra ra tra ra ta ta tra ra tra ra the owner of the truncheon awoke to these reviving tones and uttered a faint responsive 'tra ra' 'hark again' said farina in reply to the commendation of the goshawk whose face was dimpled over with the harmony the wild boar lay a grunting a grunting tra ra and boom comes the kaiser to hunt up me or queak the small birdie that hops on the tree tra ra o birdie and boar and deer lie tame for a maiden in bloom or a full blown dame are the daintiest prey and the windingest game when kaisers go a hunting tra ra ha ha ha ha tra ra tra ra ha ha tra ra tra ra the voices held long on the last note and let it die in a forest cadence ''fore gad well done hurrah tra ra ha ha tra ra that's a trick we're not half alive to at home' said guy 'i feel friendly with these german lads' the goshawk's disposition toward german lads was that moment harshly tested by a smart rap on the shoulder from an end of german oak and a proclamation that he was prisoner of the hand that gave the greeting in the name of the white rose club following that his staff was wrested from him by a dozen stout young fellows who gave him no time to get his famous distance for defence against numbers and he and farina were marched forthwith to the chorusing body in front of gottlieb groschen's house the missives of all the inmates gottlieb had slept most with the day on his eyelids for werner hung like a nightmare over him margarita lay and dreamed in rose colour and if she thrilled on her pillowed silken couch like a tense strung harp and fretted drowsily in little leaps and starts it was that a bird lay in her bosom panting and singing through the night and that he was not to be stilled but would musically utter the sweetest secret thoughts of a love bewitched maiden farina's devotion she knew his tenderness she divined his courage she had that day witnessed the young girl no sooner felt that she could love worthily than she loved with her whole strength muffed and remote came the hunting song under her pillow and awoke dreamy delicate curves in her fair face as it thinned but did not banish her dream aunt lisbeth also heard the song and burst out of her bed to see that the door and window were secured against the wanton kaiser despite her trials she had taken her spell of sleep but being possessed of some mystic maiden belief that in cases of apprehended peril from man bed was a rock of refuge and fortified defence she crept back there and allowed the sun to rise without her gottlieb's voice could not awaken her to the household duties she loved to perform with such a doleful visage she heard him open his window and parley in angry tones with the musicians below 'decoys' muttered aunt lisbeth 'be thou alive to them gottlieb' he went downstairs and opened the street door whereupon the scolding and railing commenced anew 'thou hast given them vantage gottlieb brother mine' she complained 'and the good heavens only can say what may result from such indiscreetness' a silence combustible with shuffling of feet in the passage and on the stairs dinned horrors into aunt lisbeth's head 'it was just that sound in the left wing of hollenbogenblitz' she said 'only then it was night and not morning ursula preserve me' 'why lisbeth lisbeth' cried gottlieb from below 'come down 'tis full five o' the morning here's company and what are we to do without the woman' 'ah gottlieb that is like men they do not consider how different it is for us' which mysterious sentence being uttered to herself alone enjoyed a meaning it would elsewhere have been denied aunt lisbeth dressed and met margarita descending they exchanged the good morning of young maiden and old 'go thou first' said aunt lisbeth margarita gaily tripped ahead 'girl' cried aunt lisbeth 'what's that thing in thy back hair' 'i have borrowed lieschen's arrow aunt mine has had an accident' 'lieschen's arrow an accident now i will see to that after breakfast margarita' 'tra ra ta ta tra ra tra ra' sang margarita 'the wild boar lay a grunting a grunting tra ra' 'a maiden's true and proper ornament look at mine child i have worn it fifty years may i deserve to wear it till i am called o margarita trifle not with that symbol' 'o birdie and boar and deer lie tame i am so happy aunty' 'nice times to be happy in margarita' be happy in spring sweet maidens all for autumn's chill will early fall so sings the minnesinger aunty and 'a maiden in the wintry leaf will spread her own disease of grief i love the minnesingers dear sweet mannered men they are such lovers and men of deeds as well as song sword on one side and harp on the other they fight till set of sun and then slacken their armour to waft a ballad to their beloved by moonlight covered with stains of battle as they are and weary' 'what a girl minnesingers yes i know stories of those minnesingers they came to the castle margarita a bead of thy cross is broken i will attend to it wear the pearl one till i mend this may'st thou never fall in the way of minnesingers they are not like werner's troop they do not batter at doors they slide into the house like snakes' 'lisbeth lisbeth' they heard gottlieb calling impatiently 'we come gottlieb' and in a low murmur margarita heard her say 'may this day pass without trouble and shame to the pious and the chaste' margarita knew the voice of the stranger before she had opened the door and on presenting herself the hero gave her a guardian like salute 'one may see' he said 'that it requires better men than those of werner to drive away the rose from that cheek' gottlieb pressed the rosy cheek to his shoulder and patted her 'what do you think grete you have now forty of the best lads in cologne enrolled to protect you and keep guard over the house night and day there what more could a pfalzgrafin ask now and voluntary service all to be paid with a smile which i daresay my lady won't refuse them lisbeth you know our friend fear him not good lisbeth and give us breakfast well sweet chuck you're to have royal honours paid you i warrant they've begun good work already in locking up that idle moony vagabond farina ' 'him what for my father how dared they what has he done' 'o start not my fairy maid a small matter of breakage pet he tried to enter cunigonde schmidt's chamber and knocked down her pot of lilies for which berthold schmidt knocked him down and our friend here out of good fellowship knocked down berthold however the chief offender is marched off to prison by your trusty guard and there let him cool himself berthold shall tell you the tale himself he'll be here to breakfast and receive your orders mistress commander in chief' the goshawk had his eye on margarita her teeth were tight down on her nether lip and her whole figure had a strange look of awkwardness she was so divided with anger 'as witness of the affair i think i shall make a clearer statement fair maiden' he interposed 'in the first place i am the offender we passed under the window of the fraulein schmidt and 'twas i mounted to greet the lilies one shoot of them is in my helm and here let me present them to a worthier holder' he offered the flowers with a smile and margarita took them radiant with gratitude 'our friend berthold' he continued 'thought proper to aim a blow at me behind my back and then ran for his comrades he was caught and by my gallant young hero farina concerning whose character i regret that your respected father and i differ for on the faith of a soldier and true man he's the finest among the fine fellows i've yet met in germany trust me so to cut the story short execution was done upon berthold by my hand for an act of treachery he appears to be a sort of captain of one of the troops and not affectionately disposed to farina for the version of the affair you have heard from your father is a little invention of master berthold's own to do him justice he seemed equally willing to get me under the cold stone but a word from your good father changed the current and as i thought i could serve our friend better free than behind bars i accepted liberty pshaw i should have accepted it any way to tell the truth for your german dungeons are mortal shivering ratty places so rank me no hero fair mistress margarita though the temptation to seem one in such sweet eyes was beginning to lead me astray and now as to our business in the streets at this hour believe the best of us' 'i will i do' said margarita 'lisbeth lisbeth' called gottlieb 'breakfast little sister our champion is starving he asks for wurst milk loaves wine and all thy rarest conserves haste then for the honour of cologne is at stake' aunt lisbeth jingled her keys in and out and soon that harmony drew a number of domestics with platters of swine flesh rolls of white wheaten bread the perpetual worst milk wine barley bread and household stores of dainties in profusion all sparkling on silver relieved by spotless white cloth gottlieb beheld such a sunny twinkle across the goshawk's face at this hospitable array that he gave the word of onset without waiting for berthold and his guest immediately fell to and did not relax in his exertions for a full half hour by the cathedral clock eschewing the beer with a wry look made up of scorn and ruefulness and drinking a well brimmed health in rhine wine all round margarita was pensive aunt lisbeth on her guard gottlieb remembered charles the great's counsel to archbishop turpin and did his best to remain on earth one of its lords dominant 'poor berthold' said he ''tis a good lad and deserves his seat at my table oftener i suppose the flower pot business has detained him we'll drink to him eh grete' 'drink to him dear father but here he is to thank you in person' margarita felt a twinge of pity as berthold entered the livid stains of his bruise deepened about his eyes and gave them a wicked light whenever they were fixed intently but they looked earnest and spoke of a combat in which he could say that he proved no coward and was used with some cruelty she turned on the goshawk a mute reproach yet smiled and loved him well when she beheld him stretch a hand of welcome and proffer a brotherly glass to berthold the rich goldsmith's son was occupied in studying the horoscope of his fortunes in margarita's eyes but when margarita directed his attention to guy he turned to him with a glance of astonishment that yielded to cordial greeting 'well done berthold my brave boy all are friends who sit at table' said gottlieb 'in any case at my table 'tis a worthy foe forgives the blow was dealt him full and fairly says the song and the proverb takes it up with a generous enemy is a friend on the wrong side and no one's to blame for that save old dame fortune so now a bumper to this jovial make up between you lisbeth you must drink it' the little woman bowed melancholy obedience 'why did you fling and run' whispered guy to berthold 'because you were two against one' 'two against one man why have you no such thing as fair play in this land of yours did you think i should have taken advantage of that' 'how could i tell who you were or what you would do' muttered berthold somewhat sullenly 'truly no friend so you ran to make yourself twenty to two but don't be down on the subject i was going to say that though i treated you in a manner upright 'twas perhaps a trifle severe considering your youth but an example's everything and i must let you know in confidence that no rascal truncheon had i flung in my life before so you see i gave you all the chances' berthold moved his lips in reply but thinking of the figure of defeat he was exhibiting before margarita caused him to estimate unfavourably what chances had stood in his favour the health was drunk aunt lisbeth touched the smoky yellow glass with a mincing lip and beckoned margarita to withdraw 'the tapestry child' she said 'dangerous things are uttered after the third glass i know margarita' 'do you call my champion handsome aunt' 'i was going to speak to you about him margarita if i remember he has rough good looks as far as they go yes but thou maiden art thou thinking of him i have thrice watched him wink and that as we know is a habit of them that have sold themselves and what is frail womankind to expect from such a brawny animal' 'and oh to lace his armour up and speed him to the field to pledge him in a kissing cup the knight that will not yield i am sure he is tender aunt notice how gentle he looks now and then' 'thou girl yes i believe she is madly in love with him tender and gentle so is the bear when you're outside his den but enter it maiden and try thou good ursula preserve me from such a fate' 'fear not dear aunt have not a fear of it besides it is not always the men that are bad you must not forget dalilah and lot's wife and pfalzgrafin jutta and the baroness who asked for a piece of poor kraut but let us work let us work' margarita sat down before siegfried and contemplated the hero for the first time she marked a resemblance in his features to farina the same long yellow hair scattered over his shoulders as that flowing from under siegfried's helm the blue eyes square brows and regular outlines 'this is a marvel' thought margarita 'and farina it was to watch over me that he roamed the street last night my best one is he not beautiful' and she looked closer at siegfried aunt lisbeth had begun upon the dragon with her usual method and was soon wandering through skeleton halls of the old palatial castle in bohemia the woolly tongue of the monster suggested fresh horrors to her and if margarita had listened she might have had fair excuses to forget her lover's condition but her voice only did service like a piece of clock work and her mind was in the prison with farina she was long debating how to win his release and meditated so deeply and exclaimed in so many bursts of impatience that aunt lisbeth found her heart melting to the maiden 'now' said she 'that is a well known story about the electress dowager of bavaria when she came on a visit to the castle and my dear child be it a warning terrible too' and the little woman shivered pleasantly 'she had i may tell you this margarita yes she had been false to her wedded husband you understand maiden or no you do not understand i understand it only partly mind false i say ' 'false not true go on dear aunty' said margarita catching the word 'i believe she knows as much as i do' ejaculated aunt lisbeth 'such are girls nowadays when i was young oh for a maiden to know anything then oh it was general reprobation no one thought of confessing it we blushed and held down our eyes at the very idea well the electress she was you must guess so she called for her caudle at eleven o'clock at night what do you think that was well there was spirit in it not to say nutmeg and lemon and peach kernels she wanted me to sit with her but i begged my mistress to keep me from the naughty woman and no friend of hilda of bayern was bertha of bohmen you may be sure oh the things she talked while she was drinking her caudle isentrude sat with her'and said it was fearful beyond blasphemy and that she looked like a bible witch sitting up drinking and swearing and glaring in her nightclothes and nightcap she was on a journey into hungary and claimed the hospitality of the castle on her way there both were widows well it was a quarter to twelve the electress dropped back on her pillow as she always did when she had finished the candle isentrude covered her over heaped up logs on the fire wrapped her dressing gown about her and prepared to sleep it was winter and the wind howled at the doors and rattled the windows and shook the arras lord help us outside was all snow and nothing but forest as you saw when you came to me there gretelchen twelve struck isentrude was dozing but she says that after the last stroke she woke with cold a foggy chill hung in the room she looked at the electress who had not moved the fire burned feebly and seemed weighed upon herr je she thought she heard a noise no quite quiet as heaven preserve her says slip the smell in that room grew like an open grave clammily putrid holy virgin this time she was certain she heard a noise but it seemed on both sides of her there was the great door leading to the first landing and state room and opposite exactly there was the panel of the secret passage the noises seemed to advance as if step by step and grew louder in each ear as she stood horrified on the marble of the hearth she looked at the electress again and her eyes were wide open but for all isentrude's calling she would not wake only think now the noise increased and was a regular tramp grate tramp screw sound coming nearer and nearer saints of mercy the apartment was choking with vapours isentrude made a dart and robed herself behind a curtain of the bed just as the two doors opened she could see through a slit in the woven work and winked her eyes which she had shut close on hearing the scream of the door hinges winked her eyes to catch a sight for moment we are such sinful curious creatures what she saw then she says she shall never forget nor i as she was a living woman there she saw the two dead princes the prince palatine of bohemia and the elector of bavaria standing front to front at the foot of the bed all in white armour with drawn swords and attendants holding pine torches neither of them spoke their vizors were down but she knew them by their arms and bearing both tall stately presences good knights in their day and had fought against the infidel so one of them pointed to the bed and then a torch was lowered and the fight commenced isentrude saw the sparks fly and the steel struck till it was shattered but they fought on not caring for wounds and snorting with fury as they grew hotter they fought a whole hour the poor girl was so eaten up with looking on that she let go the curtain and stood quite exposed among them so to steady herself she rested her hand on the bed side and think what she felt a hand as cold as ice locked hers and get from it she could not that instant one of the princes fell it was bohmen bayern sheathed his sword and waved his hand and the attendants took up the slaughtered ghost feet and shoulders and bore him to the door of the secret passage while bayern strode after ' 'shameful' exclaimed margarita 'i will speak to berthold as he descends i hear him coming he shall do what i wish' 'call it dreadful grete dreadful it was if berthold would like to sit and hear ah she is gone a good girl and of a levity only on the surface' aunt lisbeth heard margarita's voice rapidly addressing berthold his reply was low and brief 'refuses to listen to anything of the sort' aunt lisbeth interpreted it then he seemed to be pleading and margarita uttering short answers 'i trust 'tis nothing a maiden should not hear' the little lady exclaimed with a sigh the door opened and lieschen stood at the entrance 'for fraulein margarita' she said holding a letter halfway out 'give it' aunt lisbeth commanded the woman hesitated ''tis for the fraulein' 'give it i tell thee' and aunt lisbeth eagerly seized the missive and subjected it to the ordeal of touch it was heavy and contained something hard long pensive pressures revealed its shape on the paper it was an arrow 'go' said she to the woman and once alone began bee like to buzz all over it and finally entered it contained margarita's silver arrow 'the art of that girl' and the writing said 'sweetest maiden 'by this arrow of our betrothal i conjure thee to meet me in all haste without the western gate where burning to reveal to thee most urgent tidings that may not be confided to paper now waits petitioning the saints thy 'farina' aunt lisbeth placed letter and arrow in a drawer locked it and 'always thought so' she ascended the stairs to consult with gottlieb roars of laughter greeted her just as she lifted the latch and she retreated abashed there was no time to lose farina must be caught in the act of waiting for margarita and by gottlieb or herself gottlieb was revelling 'may this be a warning to thee gottlieb' murmured lisbeth as she hooded her little body in margarita's fur cloak and determined that she would be the one to confound farina five minutes later margarita returned aunt lisbeth was gone the dragon still lacked a tip to his forked tongue and a stream of fiery threads dangled from the jaws of the monster another letter was brought into the room by lieschen 'for aunt lisbeth' said margarita reading the address 'who can it be from' 'she does not stand pressing about your letters' said the woman and informed margarita of the foregoing missive 'you say she drew an arrow from it' said margarita with burning face 'who brought this tell me' and just waiting to hear it was farina's mother she tore the letter open and read 'dearest lisbeth 'thy old friend writes to thee she that has scarce left eyes to see the words she writes thou knowest we are a fallen house through the displeasure of the emperor on my dead husband my son farina is my only stay and well returns to me the blessings i bestow upon him some call him idle some think him too wise i swear to thee lisbeth he is only good his hours are devoted to the extraction of essences to no black magic now he is in trouble in prison the shadow that destroyed his dead father threatens him now by our old friendship beloved lisbeth intercede with gottlieb that he may plead for my son before the emperor when he comes ' margarita read no more she went to the window and saw her guard marshalled outside she threw a kerchief over her head and left the house by the garden gate the monk by this time the sun stood high over cologne the market places were crowded with buyers and sellers mixed with a loitering swarm of soldiery for whose thirsty natures winestalls had been tumbled up barons and knights of the empire bravely mounted and thickly followed poured hourly into cologne from south germany and north here staring suabians and round featured warriors of the east kingdom swaggered up and down patting what horses came across them for lack of occupation for their hands yonder huge pomeranians with bosks of beard stiffened out square from the chin hurtled mountainous among the peaceable inhabitants troopers dismounted went straddling in tight hose and loose prepared to drink good will to whomsoever would furnish the best quality liquor for that solemn pledge and equally ready to pick a quarrel with them that would not it was a scene of flaring feathers wide flapped bonnets flaunting hose blue and battered steel plates slashed woollen haunch bags leather leggings ensigns and imperious boots and shoulders margarita was too hurried in her mind to be conscious of an imprudence but her limbs trembled and she instinctively quickened her steps when she stood under the sign of the three holy kings where dwelt farina's mother she put up a fervent prayer of thanks and breathed freely 'i had expected a message from lisbeth' said frau farina 'but thou good heart thou wilt help us' 'all that may be done by me i will do' replied margarita 'but his mother yearns to see him and i have come to bear her company' the old lady clasped her hands and wept 'has he found so good a friend my poor boy and trust me dear maiden he is not unworthy for better son never lived and good son good all surely we will go to him but not as thou art i will dress thee such throngs are in the streets i heard them clattering in early this morning rest dear heart till i return' margarita had time to inspect the single sitting room in which her lover lived it was planted with bottles and vases and pipes and cylinders piling on floor chair and table she could not suppress a slight surprise of fear for this display showed a dealing with hidden things and a summoning of scattered spirits it was this that made his brow so pale and the round of his eye darker than youth should let it be she dismissed the feeling and assumed her own bright face as dame farina reappeared bearing on her arm a convent garb and other apparel margarita suffered herself to be invested in the white and black robes of the denial of life 'there' said the frau farina 'and to seal assurance i have engaged a guard to accompany us he was sorely bruised in a street combat yesterday and was billeted below where i nursed and tended him and he is grateful as man should be though i did little doing my utmost and with him near us we have nought to fear' 'good' said margarita and they kissed and departed the guard was awaiting them outside 'come my little lady and with thee the holy sister 'tis no step from here and i gage to bring ye safe as sure as my name's schwartz thier hey the good sister's dropping look now i'll carry her' margarita recovered her self command before he could make good this offer 'only let us hasten there' she gasped the thier strode on and gave them safe conduct to the prison where farina was confined being near one of the outer forts of the city 'thank and dismiss him' whispered margarita 'nay he will wait wilt thou not friend we shall not be long though it is my son i visit here' said frau farina 'till to morrow morning my little lady the lion thanked him that plucked the thorn from his foot and the thier may be black but he's not ungrateful nor a worse beast than the lion' they entered the walls and left him for the first five minutes schwartz thier found employment for his faculties by staring at the shaky small paned windows of the neighbourhood he persevered in this after all novelty had been exhausted from an intuitive dread of weariness there was nothing to see an old woman once bobbed out of an attic and doused the flints with water harassed by increasing dread of the foul nightmare of nothing to do the thier endeavoured to establish amorous intelligence with her she responded with an indignant projection of the underjaw evanishing rapidly there was no resource left him but to curse her with extreme heartiness the thier stamped his right leg and then his left and remembered the old woman as a grievance five minutes longer when she was clean forgotten he yawned another spouse of the moment was wanted to be wooed objurgated and regretted the prison gate was in a secluded street few passengers went by and those who did edged away from the ponderous wanton eyed figure of lazy mischief lounging there as neatly as they well could the thier hailed two or three one took to his legs another bowed smirked gave him a kindly good day and affected to hear no more having urgent business in prospect the thier was a faithful dog but the temptation to betray his trust and pursue them was mighty he began to experience an equal disposition to cry and roar he hummed a ballad 'i swore of her i'd have my will and with him i'd have my way i learn'd my cross bow over the hill now what does my lady say give me the good old cross bow after all and none of these lumbering puff and bangs that knock you down oftener than your man 'a cross stands in the forest still and a cross in the churchyard grey my curse on him who had his will and on him who had his way good beginning bad ending 'tisn't so always many a cross has the cross bow built they say i wish i had mine now to peg off that old woman or somebody i'd swear she's peeping at me over the gable or behind some cranny they're curious the old women curse 'em and the young for that matter devil a young one here 'when i'm in for the sack of a town what think ye i poke after up and down silver and gold i pocket in plenty but the sweet tit bit is my lass under twenty i should like to be in for the sack of this cologne i'd nose out that pretty girl i was cheated of yesterday take the gold and silver and give me the maiden her neck's silver and her hair gold ah and her cheeks roses and her mouth say no more i'm half thinking werner the hungry animal has cast wolf's eyes on her they say he spoke of her last night don't let him thwart me thunderblast him i owe him a grudge he's beginning to forget my plan o' life' a flight of pigeons across the blue top of the street abstracted the thier from these reflections he gaped after them in despair and fell to stretching and shaking himself rattling his lungs with loud reports as he threw his eyes round again they encountered those of a monk opposite fastened on him in penetrating silence the thier hated monks as a wild beast shuns fire but now even a monk was welcome 'halloo' he sung out the monk crossed over to him 'friend' said he 'weariness is teaching thee wantonness wilt thou take service for a night's work where the danger is little the reward lasting' 'as for that' replied the thier 'danger comes to me like greenwood to the deer and good pay never yet was given in promises but i'm bound for the next hour to womankind within there they're my masters as they've been of tough fellows before me' 'i will seek them and win their consent' said the monk and so left him 'quick dealing' thought the thier and grew brisker 'the baron won't want me to night and what if he does let him hang himself though if he should 'twill be a pity i'm not by to help him' he paced under the wall to its farthest course turning back he perceived the monk at the gateway 'a sharp hand' thought the thier 'intrude no question on me' the monk began 'but hold thy peace and follow the women release thee and gladly' 'that's not my plan o' life now money down and then command me' and schwartz thier stood with one foot forward and hand stretched out a curl of scorn darkened the cold features of the monk he slid one hand into a side of his frock above the girdle and tossed a bag of coin 'take it if 'tis in thee to forfeit the greater blessing' he cried contemptuously the thier peeped into the bag and appeared satisfied 'i follow' said he 'lead on good father and i'll be in the track of holiness for the first time since my mother was quit of me' the monk hurried up the street and into the marketplace oblivious of the postures and reverences of the people who stopped to stare at him and his gaunt attendant as they crossed the square schwartz thier spied henker rothhals starting from a wine stall on horseback and could not forbear hailing him before the monk had time to utter a reproach they were deep together in a double shot of query and reply 'whirr' cried the thier breaking on some communication 'got her have they and swung her across stream i'm one with ye for my share or call me sheep' he waved his hand to the monk and taking hold of the horse's rein ran off beside his mounted confederate heavily shod as he was the monk frowned after him and swelled with a hard sigh 'gone' he exclaimed 'and the accursed gold with him well did a voice warn me that such service was never to be bought' he did not pause to bewail or repent but returned toward the prison with rapid footsteps muttering 'i with the prison pass for two why was i beguiled by that bandit saw i not the very youth given into my hands there he that was with the damsel and the aged woman' the ride and the race late in the noon a horseman in the livery of the kaiser's body guard rode dry and dusty into cologne with tidings that the kaiser was at hammerstein castle and commanding all convocated knights barons counts and princes to assemble and prepare for his coming on a certain bare space of ground within two leagues of cologne thence to swell the train of his triumphal entry into the ancient city of his empire guy the goshawk broad set on a flemish mare and a pack horse beside him shortly afterward left the hotel of the three holy kings and trotted up to gottlieb's door 'tent pitching is now my trade' said he as gottlieb came down to him 'my lord is with the kaiser i must say farewell for the nonce is the young lady visible' 'nor young nor old good friend' replied gottlieb with a countenance somewhat ruffled 'i dined alone for lack of your company secret missives came i hear to each of them and both are gadding now what think you of this after the scene of yesterday lisbeth too' 'preaches from the old text master groschen never reckon on womankind for a wise act but farewell and tell mistress margarita that i take it ill of her not giving me her maiden hand to salute before parting my gravest respects to frau lisbeth i shall soon be sitting with you over that prime vintage of yours or fortune's dead against me' so with a wring of the hand guy put the spur to his round flanked beast and was quickly out of cologne on the rough roadway he was neither the first nor the last of the men at arms hastening to obey the kaiser's mandate a string of horse and foot in serpentine knots stretched along the flat land flashing colours livelier than the spring meadows bordering their line of passage guy with a nod for all and a greeting for the best disposed pushed on toward the van till the gathering block compelled him to adopt the snail's pace of the advance party and gave him work enough to keep his two horses from being jammed with the mass now and then he cast a weather eye on the heavens and was soon confirmed in an opinion he had repeatedly ejaculated that 'the first night's camping would be a drencher' in the west a black bank of cloud was blotting out the sun before his time northeast shone bare fields of blue lightly touched with loosefloating strips and flakes of crimson vapour the furrows were growing purple dark and gradually a low moaning obscurity enwrapped the whole line and mufed the noise of hoof oath and waggon wheel in one sullen murmur guy felt very much like a chopped worm as he wriggled his way onward in the dusk impelled from the rear and reduced to grope after the main body frequent and deep counsel he took with a trusty flask suspended at his belt it was no pleasant reflection that the rain would be down before he could build up anything like shelter for horse and man still sadder the necessity of selecting his post on strange ground and in darkness he kept an anxious look out for the moon and was presently rejoiced to behold a broad fire that twinkled branchy beams through an east hill orchard 'my lord calls her goddess' said guy wistfully 'the title's outlandish and more the style of these foreigners but she may have it to night an she 'll just keep the storm from shrouding her bright eye a matter of two hours' she rose with a boding lustre drifts of thin pale upper cloud leaned down ladders pure as virgin silver for her to climb to her highest seat on the unrebellious half circle of heaven 'my mind's made up' quoth guy to the listening part of himself 'out of this i'll get' by the clearer ray he had discerned a narrow track running a white parallel with the general route at the expense of dislocating a mile of the cavalcade he struck into it a dyke had to be taken some heavy fallows crossed and the way was straight before him he began to sneer at the slow jog trot and absence of enterprise which made the fellows he had left shine so poorly in comparison with the goshawk but a sight of two cavaliers in advance checked his vanity and now to overtake them he tasked his fat flemish mare with unwonted pricks of the heel that made her fling out and show more mettle than speed the objects of this fiery chase did not at first awake to a sense of being pursued both rode with mantled visages and appeared profoundly inattentive to the world outside their meditations but the goshawk was not to be denied and by dint of alternately roaring at them and upbraiding his two stumping beasts he at last roused the younger of the cavaliers who called to his companion loudly without effect it seemed for he had to repeat the warning guy was close up with them when the youth exclaimed 'father holy father 'tis sathanas in person' the other rose and pointed trembling to a dark point in the distance as he vociferated 'not here not here but yonder' guy recognized the voice of the first speaker and cried 'stay halt a second have you forgotten the goshawk' 'never' came the reply 'and forget not farina' spur and fleeter steeds carried them out of hearing ere guy could throw in another syllable farina gazed back on him remorsefully but the monk now rated his assistant with indignation 'thou weak one nothing less than fool to betray thy name on such an adventure as this to soul save the saints' farina tossed back his locks and held his forehead to the moon all the monk's ghostly wrath was foiled by the one little last sweet word of his beloved which made music in his ears whenever annoyance sounded 'and herein' say the old writers 'are lovers who love truly truly recompensed for their toils and pains in that love for which they suffer is ever present to ward away suffering not sprung of love but the disloyal who serve not love faithfully are a race given over to whatso this base world can wreak upon them without consolation or comfort of their mistress love whom sacrificing not all to they know not to delight in' the soul of a lover lives through every member of him in the joy of a moonlight ride sorrow and grief are slow distempers that crouch from the breeze and nourish their natures far from swift moving things a true lover is not one of those melancholy flies that shoot and maze over muddy stagnant pools he must be up in the great air he must strike all the strings of life swiftness is his rapture in his wide arms he embraces the whole form of beauty eagle like are his instincts dove like his desires then the fair moon is the very presence of his betrothed in heaven so for hours rode farina in a silver fleeting glory while the monk as a shadow galloped stern and silent beside him so crowning them in the sky one half was all love and light one blackness and fell purpose the combat on drachenfels not to earth was vouchsafed the honour of commencing the great battle of that night by an expiring blue shot beam of moonlight farina beheld a vast realm of gloom filling the hollow of the west and the moon was soon extinguished behind sluggish scraps of iron scud detached from the swinging bulk of ruin as heavily it ground on the atmosphere in the first thunder launch of motion the heart of the youth was strong but he could not view without quicker fawning throbs this manifestation of immeasurable power which seemed as if with a stroke it was capable of destroying creation and the works of man the bare aspect of the tempest lent terrors to the adventure he was engaged in and of which he knew not the aim nor might forecast the issue now there was nothing to illumine their path but such forked flashes as lightning threw them at intervals touching here a hill with clustered cottages striking into day there a may blossom a patch of weed a single tree by the wayside suddenly a more vivid and continuous quiver of violet fire met its reflection on the landscape and farina saw the rhine stream beneath him 'on such a night' thought he 'siegfried fought and slew the dragon' a blast of light as from the jaws of the defeated dragon in his throes made known to him the country he traversed crimsoned above the water glimmered the monster haunted rock itself and mid channel beyond flat and black to the stream stretched the nuns' isle in cloistral peace 'halt' cried the monk and signalled with a peculiar whistle to which he seemed breathlessly awaiting an answer they were immediately surrounded by longrobed veiled figures 'not too late' the monk hoarsely asked of them 'yet an hour' was the reply in soft clear tones of a woman's voice 'great strength and valour more than human be mine' exclaimed the monk dismounting he passed apart from them and they drew in a circle while he prayed kneeling presently he returned and led farina to a bank drawing from some hiding place a book and a bell which he gave into the hands of the youth 'for thy soul no word' said the monk speaking down his throat as he took in breath 'nay not in answer to me be faithful and more than earthly fortune is thine for i say unto thee i shall not fail having grace to sustain this combat' thereupon he commenced the ascent of drachenfels farina followed he had no hint of the monk's mission nor of the part himself was to play in it such a load of silence gathered on his questioning spirit that the outcry of the rageing elements alone prevented him from arresting the monk and demanding the end of his service there that outcry was enough to freeze speech on the very lips of a mortal for scarce had they got footing on the winding path of the crags when the whole vengeance of the storm was hurled against the mountain huge boulders were loosened and came bowling from above trees torn by their roots from the fissures whizzed on the eddies of the wind torrents of rain foamed down the iron flanks of rock and flew off in hoar feathers against the short pauses of darkness the mountain heaved and quaked and yawned a succession of hideous chasms 'there's a devil in this' thought farina he looked back and marked the river imaging lurid abysses of cloud above the mountain summit yea and on the summit a flaming shape was mirrored two nervous hands stayed the cry on his mouth 'have i not warned thee' said the husky voice of the monk 'i may well watch and think for thee as for a dog be thou as faithful' he handed a flask to the youth and bade him drink farina drank and felt richly invigorated the monk then took bell and book 'but half an hour' he muttered 'for this combat that is to ring through centuries' crossing himself he strode wildly upward farina saw him beckon back once and the next instant he was lost round an incline of the highest peak the wind that had just screamed a thousand death screams was now awfully dumb albeit farina could feel it lifting hood and hair in the unnatural stillness his ear received tones of a hymn chanted below now sinking now swelling as though the voices faltered between prayer and inspiration farina caught on a projection of crag and fixed his eyes on what was passing on the height there was the monk in his brown hood and wrapper confronting if he might trust his balls of sight the red hot figure of the prince of darkness as yet no mortal tussle had taken place between them they were arguing angrily it was true yet with the first mutual deference of practised logicians latin and german was alternately employed by both it thrilled farina's fervid love of fatherland to hear the german satan spoke but his latin was good and his command over that tongue remarkable for getting the worst of the argument as usual he revenged himself by parodying one of the church canticles with a point that discomposed his adversary and caused him to retreat a step claiming support against such shrewd assault 'the use of an unexpected weapon in warfare is in itself half a victory induce your antagonist to employ it as a match for you and reckon on completely routing him ' says the old military chronicle 'come' said the demon with easy raillery 'you know your game i mine i really want the good people to be happy dancing kissing propagating what you will we quite agree you can have no objection to me but a foolish old prejudice not personal but class an antipathy of the cowl for which i pardon you what i should find in you to complain of i have only to mention it i am sure is that perhaps you do speak a little too much through your nose' the monk did not fall into the jocular trap by retorting in the same strain 'laugh with the devil and you won't laugh longest' says the proverb keeping to his own arms the holy man frowned 'avaunt fiend' he cried 'to thy kingdom below thou halt raged over earth a month causing blights hurricanes and epidemics of the deadly sins parley no more begone' the demon smiled the corners of his mouth ran up to his ears and his eyes slid down almost into one 'still through the nose' said he reproachfully 'i give thee five minutes' cried the monk 'i had hoped for a longer colloquy' sighed the demon jogging his left leg and trifling with his tail 'one minute ' exclaimed the monk 'truly so' said the demon 'i know old time and his habits better than you really can we meet every saturday night and communicate our best jokes i keep a book of them down there' and as if he had reason to remember the pavement of his halls he stood tiptoe and whipped up his legs 'two minutes' the demon waved perfect acquiescence and continued 'we understand each other he and i all old ones do as long as he lasts i shall the thing that surprises me is that you and i cannot agree similar as we are in temperament and playing for the long odds both of us my failure is perhaps too great a passion for sport aha well 'tis a pity you won't try and live on the benevolent principle i am indeed kind to them who commiserate my condition i give them all they want aha hem try and not believe in me now aha ho can't you what are eyes persuade yourself you're dreaming you can do anything with a mind like yours father gregory and consider the luxury of getting me out of the way so easily as many do it is my finest suggestion aha generally i myself nudge their ribs with the capital idea you're above bribes i was going to observe ' 'three' 'observe that if you care for worldly honours i can smother you with that kind of thing several of your first rate people made a bargain with me when they were in the fog and owe me a trifle patronage they call it i hook the high and the low too little and too much serve me better than beelzebub a weak stomach is certainly more carnally virtuous than a full one consequently my kingdom is becoming too respectable they've all got titles and object to being asked to poke the fire without honourable and with exceeding brightness beaming baroness this admirably benignant down looking highness that interrupts business especially when you have to ask them to fry themselves according to the rules would you like mainz and the rheingau you don't care for beauty puella puellae i have plenty of them too below the historical beauties warmed up at a moment's notice modern ones made famous between morning and night fame is the sauce of beauty or no eh' 'four' 'not quite so fast if you please you want me gone now where's your charity do you ask me to be always raking up those poor devils underneath while i'm here they've a respite they cannot think you kind father gregory as for the harm you see i'm not the more agreeable by being face to face with you though some fair dames do take to my person monstrously the secret is the quantity of small talk i can command that makes them forget my smell which is i confess abominable displeasing to myself and my worst curse your sort father gregory are somewhat unpleasant in that particular if i may judge by their legate here well try small talk they would fall desperately in love with polecats and skunks if endowed with small talk why they have become enamoured of monks before now if skunks why not monks and again ' 'five' having solemnly bellowed this tremendous number the holy man lifted his arms to begin the combat farina felt his nerves prick with admiration of the ghostly warrior daring the second power of creation on that lonely mountain top he expected and shuddered at thought of the most awful fight ever yet chronicled of those that have taken place between heroes and the hounds of evil but his astonishment was great to hear the demon while bell was in air and book aloft retreat shouting 'hold' 'i surrender' said he sullenly 'what terms' 'instantaneous riddance of thee from face of earth' 'good now' said the demon 'did you suppose i was to be trapped into a fight no doubt you wish to become a saint and have everybody talking of my last defeat pictures poems processions with the devil downmost no you're more than a match for me' 'silence darkness' thundered the monk 'and think not to vanquish thy victor by flatteries begone' and again he towered in his wrath the demon drew his tail between his legs and threw the forked fleshy quivering end over his shoulder he then nodded cheerfully pointed his feet and finicked a few steps away saying 'i hope we shall meet again' upon that he shot out his wings that were like the fins of the wyver fish sharpened in venomous points 'commands for your people below' he inquired leering with chin awry 'desperate ruffians some of those cowls you are right not to acknowledge them' farina beheld the holy man in no mood to let the enemy tamper with him longer the demon was influenced by a like reflection for saying 'cologne is the city your holiness inhabits i think' he shot up rocket like over rhineland striking the entire length of the stream and its rough bearded castle crests slate ledges bramble clefts vine slopes and haunted valleys with one brimstone flash frankfort and the far main saw him and reddened ancient trier and mosel heidelberg and neckar limberg and lahn ran guilty of him and the swift artery of these shining veins rhine from his snow cradle to his salt decease glimmered stygian horrors as the infernal comet sprung over bonn sparkled a fiery minute along the face of the stream and vanished leaving a seam of ragged flame trailed on the midnight heavens farina breathed hard through his teeth 'the last of him was awful' said he coming forward to where the monk knelt and grasped his breviary 'but he was vanquished easily' 'easily' exclaimed the holy man gasping satisfaction 'thou weakling is it for thee to measure difficulties or estimate powers easily thou worldling and so are great deeds judged when the danger's past and what am i but the humble instrument that brought about this wondrous conquest the poor tool of this astounding triumph shall the sword say this is the battle i won yonder the enemy i overthrow bow to me ye lords of earth and worshippers of mighty acts not so nay but the sword is honoured in the hero's grasp and if it break not it is accounted trusty this then this little i may claim that i was trusty trusty in a heroic encounter trusty in a battle with earth's terror oh but this must not be said this is to think too much this is to be more than aught yet achieved by man' the holy warrior crossed his arms and gently bowed his head 'take me to the sisters' he said 'the spirit has gone out of me i am faint and as a child' farina asked and had his blessing 'and with it my thanks' said the monk 'thou hast witnessed how he can be overcome thou hast looked upon a scene that will be the glory of christendom thou hast beheld the discomfiture of darkness before the voice of light yet think not much of me account me little in this matter i am but an instrument but an instrument and again but an instrument' farina drew the arms of the holy combatant across his shoulders and descended drachenfels the tempest was as a forgotten anguish bright with maiden splendour shone the moon and the old rocks cherished in her beams put up their horns to blue heaven once more all the leafage of the land shook as to shake off a wicked dream and shuddered from time to time whispering of old fears quieted and present peace the heart of the river fondled with the image of the moon in its depths 'this is much to have won for earth' murmured the monk 'and what is life or who would not risk all to snatch such loveliness from the talons of the fiend the arch foe yet not i not i say not 'twas i did this' soft praises of melody ascended to them on the moist fragrance of air it was the hymn of the sisters 'how sweet' murmured the monk 'put it from me away with it' rising on farina's back and stirruping his feet on the thighs of the youth he cried aloud 'i charge ye whoso ye be sing not this deed before the emperor by the breath of your nostrils pause ere ye whisper aught of the combat of saint gregory with satan and his victory and the marvel of it while he liveth for he would die the humble monk he is' he resumed his seat and farina brought him into the circle of the sisters those pure women took him and smoothed him lamenting and filling the night with triumphing tones farina stood apart 'the breeze tells of dawn' said the monk 'we must be in cologne before broad day' they mounted horse and the sisters grouped and reverenced under the blessings of the monk 'no word of it' said the monk warningly 'we are silent father' they answered 'cologne ward' was then his cry and away he and farina flew the goshawk leads morning was among the grey eastern clouds as they rode upon the camp hastily formed to meet the kaiser all there was in a wallow of confusion fierce struggles for precedence still went on in the neighbourhood of the imperial tent ground where under the standard of germany lounged some veterans of the kaiser's guard calmly watching the scramble up to the edge of the cultivated land nothing was to be seen but brawling clumps of warriors asserting the superior claims of their respective lords variously and hotly disputed were these claims as many red coxcombs testified across that point where the green field flourished not a foot was set for the kaiser's care of the farmer and affection for good harvests made itself respected even in the heat of those jealous rivalries it was said of him that he would have camped in a bog or taken quarters in a cathedral rather than trample down a green blade of wheat or turn over one vine pole in the empire hence the presence of kaiser heinrich was never hailed as egypt's plague by the peasantry but welcome as the may month wherever he went father gregory and farina found themselves in the centre of a group ere they drew rein and a cry rose 'the good father shall decide and all's fair' followed by 'agreed hail and tempest he's dropped down o' purpose' 'father' said one 'here it is i say i saw the devil himself fly off drachenfels and flop into cologne fritz here and frankenbauch saw him too they'll swear to him so 'll i hell's thunder will we yonder fellows will have it 'twas a flash o' lightning as if i didn't see him horns tail and claws and a mighty sight 'twas as i'm a sinner' a clash of voices for the devil and against him burst on this accurate description of the evil spirit the monk sank his neck into his chest 'gladly would i hold silence on this my sons' said he in a supplicating voice 'speak father' cried the first spokesman gathering courage from the looks of the monk father gregory appeared to commune with himself deeply at last lifting his head and murmuring 'it must be' he said aloud ''twas verily satan o my sons him this night in mortal combat i encountered and overcame on the summit of drachenfels before the eyes of this youth and from satan i this night deliver ye an instrument herein as in all other' shouts and a far spreading buzz resounded in the camp hundreds had now seen satan flying off the drachenstein father gregory could no longer hope to escape from the importunate crowds that beset him for particulars the much contested point now was as to the exact position of satan's tail during his airy circuit before descending into cologne it lashed like a lion's 'twas cocked for certain he sneaked it between his legs like a lurcher he made it stumpy as a brown bear's he carried it upright as a pike 'o my sons have i sown dissension have i not given ye peace' exclaimed the monk but they continued to discuss it with increasing frenzy farina cast a glance over the tumult and beheld his friend guy beckoning earnestly he had no difficulty in getting away to him as the fetters of all eyes were on the monk alone the goshawk was stamping with excitement 'not a moment to be lost my lad' said guy catching his arm 'here i've had half a dozen fights already for this bit of ground do you know that fellow squatting there' farina beheld the thier at the entrance of a tumbledown tent he was ruefully rubbing a broken head 'now' continued guy 'to mount him is the thing and then after the wolves of werner as fast as horse flesh can carry us no questions bound are you and what am i but this is life and death lad hark' the goshawk whispered something that sucked the blood out of farina's cheek 'look you what's your lockjaw name keep good faith with me and you shall have your revenge and the shiners i promise besides my lord's interest for a better master but sharp we won't mount till we're out of sight o' the hell scum you horde with' the thier stood up and staggered after them through the camp there was no difficulty in mounting him horses were loose and scampering about the country not yet delivered from their terrors of the last night's tempest 'here be we three good men' exclaimed guy when they were started and farina had hurriedly given him the heads of his adventure with the monk 'three good men one has helped to kick the devil one has served an apprenticeship to his limb and one is ready to meet him foot to foot any day which last should be myself not a man more do we want though it were to fish up that treasure you talk of being under the rhine there and guarded by i don't know how many tricksy little villains horses can be ferried across at linz you say' 'ay thereabout' grunted the thier 'we 're on the right road then' said guy 'thanks to you both i've had no sleep for two nights not a wink and must snatch it going not the first time' the goshawk bent his body and spoke no more farina could not get a word further from him by the mastery he still had over his rein the goshawk alone proved that he was of the world of the living schwartz thier rendered either sullen or stunned by the latest cracked crown he had received held his jaws close as if they had been nailed at linz the horses were well breathed the goshawk who had been snoring an instant before examined them keenly and shook his calculating head 'punch that beast of yours in the ribs' said he to farina 'ah not a yard of wind in him and there's the coming back when we shall have more to carry well this is my lord's money but i' faith it's going in a good cause and master groschen will make it all right no doubt not a doubt of it' the goshawk had seen some excellent beasts in the stables of the kaiser's krone but the landlord would make no exchange without an advance of silver this done the arrangement was prompt 'schwartz thier i've got your name now' said guy as they were ferrying across 'you're stiff certain they left cologne with the maiden yesternoon now' 'ah did they and she's at the eck safe enow by this time' 'and away from the eck this night she shall come trust me' 'or there will i die with her' cried farina 'fifteen men at most he has you said' continued guy 'two not sound five true as steel and the rest shillyshally 'slife one lock loose serves us but two saves us five we're a match for throwing in bluff baron the remainder go with victory' 'can we trust this fellow' whispered farina 'trust him' roared guy 'why i've thumped him lad pegged and pardoned him trust him trust me if werner catches a sight of that snout of his within half a mile of his hold he'll roast him alive' he lowered his voice 'trust him we can do nothing without him i knocked the devil out of him early this morning no chance for his highness anywhere now this eck of werner's would stand a siege from the kaiser in person i hear we must into it like weasels and out as we can' dismissing the ferry barge with stern injunctions to be in waiting from noon to noon the three leapt on their fresh nags 'stop at the first village' said guy 'we must lay in provision as master groschen says nothing's to be done turpin without provender' 'goshawk' cried farina 'you have time tell me how this business was done' the only reply was a soft but decided snore that spoke like a voluptuous trumpet of dreamland and its visions at sinzig the thier laid his hand on guy's bridle with the words 'feed here' a brief but effective form of signal which aroused the goshawk completely the sign of the trauben received them here wurst reeking with garlic eggs black bread and sour wine was all they could procure farina refused to eat and maintained his resolution in spite of guy's sarcastic chiding 'rub down the beasts then and water them' said the latter 'made a vow i suppose' muttered guy 'that's the way of those fellows no upright manly take the thing as it comes but fly sky high whenever there's a dash on their heaven what has his belly done to offend him it will be crying out just when we want all quiet i wouldn't pay werner such a compliment as go without a breakfast for him not i would you schwartz thier' 'henker not i' growled the thier 'he'll lose one sooner' 'first snatch his prey or he'll be making god save us a meal for a kaiser the brute' guy called in the landlady clapped down the score and abused the wine 'sir' said the landlady 'ours is but a poor inn and we do our best' 'so you do' replied the goshawk softened 'and i say that a civil tongue and rosy smiles sweeten even sour wine' the landlady a summer widow blushed and as he was stepping from the room called him aside 'i thought you were one of that dreadful werner's band and i hate him' guy undeceived her 'he took my sister' she went on 'and his cruelty killed her he persecuted me even in the lifetime of my good man last night he came here in the middle of the storm with a young creature bright as an angel and sorrowful ' 'he's gone you're sure' broke in guy 'gone oh yes soon as the storm abated he dragged her on oh the way that young thing looked at me and i able to do nothing for her' 'now the lord bless you for a rosy christian' cried guy and in his admiration he flung his arm round her and sealed a ringing kiss on each cheek 'no good man defrauded by that and let me see the fellow that thinks evil of it if i ever told a woman a secret i 'd tell you one now trust me but i never do so farewell not another' hasty times keep the feelings in a ferment and the landlady was extremely angry with guy and heartily forgave him all within a minute 'no more' said she laughing 'but wait i have something for you' the goshawk lingered on a fretting heel she was quickly under his elbow again with two flasks leaning from her bosom to her arms 'there i seldom meet a man like you and when i do i like to be remembered this is a true good wine real liebfrauenmilch which i only give to choice customers' 'welcome it is' sang guy to her arch looks 'but i must pay for it' 'not a pfennig' said the landlady 'not one' 'not one ' she repeated with a stamp of the foot 'in other coin then' quoth guy and folding her waist which did not this time back away the favoured goshawk registered rosy payment on a very fresh red mouth receiving in return such lively discount that he felt himself bound in conscience to make up the full sum a second time 'what a man' sighed the landlady as she watched the goshawk lead off along the banks 'courtly as a knight open as a squire and gentle as a page' werner's eck a league behind andernach and more in the wintry circle of the sun than laach its convenient monastic neighbour stood the castle of werner the robber baron far into the south hazy with afternoon light a yellow succession of sandhills stretched away spouting fire against the blue sky of an elder world but now dead and barren of herbage around is a dusty plain where the green blades of spring no sooner peep than they become grimed with sand and take an aged look in accordance with the ungenerous harvests they promise the aridity of the prospect is relieved on one side by the lofty woods of laach through which the sun setting burns golden red and on the other by the silver sparkle of a narrow winding stream bordered with poplars and seen but a glistening mile of its length by all the thirsty hills the eck or corner itself is thick set with wood but of a stunted growth and lying like a dark patch on the landscape it served however entirely to conceal the castle and mask every movement of the wary and terrible master a trained eye advancing on the copse would hardly mark the glimmer of the turrets over the topmost leaves but to every loophole of the walls lies bare the circuit of the land werner could rule with a glance the rhine's course down from the broad rock over coblentz to the white tower of andernach he claimed that march as his right but the mosel was no hard ride's distance and he gratified his thirst for rapine chiefly on that river delighting in it consequently as much as his robber nature boiled over the bound of his feudal privileges often had the baron held his own against sieges and restrictions bans and impositions of all kinds he boasted that there was never a knight within twenty miles of him that he had not beaten nor monk of the same limit not in his pay this braggadocio received some warrant from his yearly increase of licence and his craft and his castle combined made him a notable pest of the region a scandal to the abbey whose countenance he had and a frightful infliction on the poorer farmers and peasantry the sun was beginning to slope over laach and threw the shadows of the abbey towers half way across the blue lake waters as two men in the garb of husbandmen emerged from the wood their feet plunged heavily and their heads hung down as they strode beside a wain mounted with straw whistling an air of stupid unconcern but a close listener might have heard that the lumbering vehicle carried a human voice giving them directions as to the road they were to take and what sort of behaviour to observe under certain events the land was solitary a boor passing asked whether toll or tribute they were conveying to werner tribute they were advised to reply which caused him to shrug and curse as he jogged on hearing him the voice in the wain chuckled grimly their next speech was with a trooper who overtook them and wanted to know what they had in the wain for werner tribute they replied and won the title of 'brave pigs' for their trouble 'but what's the dish made of' said the trooper stirring the straw with his sword point 'tribute' came the answer 'ha you've not been to werner's school' and the trooper swung a sword stroke at the taller of the two sending a tremendous shudder throughout his frame but he held his head to the ground and only seemed to betray animal consciousness in leaning his ear closer to the wain 'blood and storm will ye speak' cried the trooper 'never talk much but an ye say nothing to the baron' thrusting his hand into the straw 'here's what's better than speaking' 'well said eh liebfrauenmilch ho ho a rare bleed' striking the neck of the flask on a wheel the trooper applied it to his mouth and ceased not deeply ingurgitating till his face was broad to the sky and the bottle reversed he then dashed it down sighed and shook himself 'rare news the kaiser's come he'll be in cologne by night but first he must see the baron and i'm post with the order that's to show you how high he stands in the kaiser's grace don't be thinking of upsetting werner yet any of you mind now' 'that's blass gesell' said the voice in the wain as the trooper trotted on adding ''gainst us' 'makes six' responded the driver within sight of the eck they descried another trooper coming toward them this time the driver was first to speak 'tribute provender bread and wine for the high baron werner from his vassals over tonnistein' 'and i'm out of it fasting like a winter wolf' howled the fellow he was in the act of addressing himself to an inspection of the wain's contents when a second flask lifted in air gave a sop to his curiosity this flask suffered the fate of the former 'a swabian blockhead aren't you' 'ay that country' said the driver 'may be henker rothhals happens to be with the baron' 'to hell with him i wish he had my job and i his of watching the yellow bird in her new cage till she's taken out to night and then a jolly bumper to the baron all round' the driver wished him a fortunate journey strongly recommending him to skirt the abbey westward and go by the ahr valley as there was something stirring that way and mumbling 'makes five again' as he put the wheels in motion 'goshawk' said his visible companion 'what do you say now' 'i say bless that widow' 'oh bring me face to face with this accursed werner quickly my god ' gasped the youth 'tusk 'tis not werner we want there's the thier speaking no no schwartz thier i trust you no doubt but the badger smells at a hole before he goes inside it we're strangers and are allowed to miss our way' leaving the wain in farina's charge he pushed through a dense growth of shrub and underwood and came crouching on a precipitous edge of shrouded crag which commanded a view of the stronghold extending round it as if scooped clean by some natural action about a stone'sthrow distant and nearly level with the look out tower sheer from a deep circular basin clothed with wood and bottomed with grass and bubbling water rose a naked moss stained rock on whose peak the castle firmly perched like a spying hawk the only means of access was by a narrow natural bridge of rock flung from this insulated pinnacle across to the mainland one man well disposed might have held it against forty 'our way's the best' thought guy as he meditated every mode of gaining admission 'a hundred men an hour might be lost cutting steps up that steep slate and once at the top we should only have to be shoved down again' while thus engaged he heard a summons sounded from the castle and scrambled back to farina 'the thier leads now' said he 'and who leads is captain it seems easier to get out of that than in there's a square tower and a round i guess the maiden to be in the round now lad no crying out you don't come in with us but back you go for the horses and have them ready and fresh in yon watered meadow under the castle the path down winds easy' 'man' cried farina 'what do you take me for go you for the horses' 'not for a fool' guy rejoined tightening his lip 'but now is your time to prove yourself one' 'with you or without you i enter that castle' 'oh if you want to be served up hot for the baron's supper mess by all means' 'thunder' growled schwartz thier 'aren't ye moving' the goshawk beckoned farina aside 'act as i tell you or i'm for cologne' 'traitor' muttered the youth 'swearing this that if we fail the baron shall need a leech sooner than a bride' 'that stroke must be mine' the goshawk griped the muscle of farina's arm till the youth was compelled to slacken it with pain 'could you drive a knife through a six inch wood wall i doubt this wild boar wants a harder hit than many a best man could give 'sblood obey sirrah how shall we keep yon fellow true if he sees we're at points' 'i yield' exclaimed farina with a fall of the chest 'but hear i nothing of you by midnight oh then think not i shall leave another minute to chance farewell haste heaven prosper you you will see her and die under her eyes that may be denied to me what have i done to be refused that last boon' 'gone without breakfast and dinner' said guy in abhorrent tones a whistle from the wain following a noise of the castlegates being flung open called the goshawk away and he slouched his shoulders and strode to do his part without another word farina gazed after him and dropped into the covert the water lady 'bird of lovers voice of the passion of love sweet deep disaster toning nightingale' sings the old minnesinger 'who that has not loved hearing thee is touched with the wand of love's mysteries and yearneth to he knoweth not whom humbled by overfulness of heart but who listening already loveth heareth the language he would speak yet faileth in feeleth the great tongueless sea of his infinite desires stirred beyond his narrow bosom is as one stript of wings whom the angels beckon to their silver homes and he leaneth forward to ascend to them and is mocked by his effort then is he of the fallen and of the fallen would he remain but that tears lighten him and through the tears stream jewelled shafts dropt down to him from the sky precious ladders inlaid with amethyst sapphire blended jasper beryl rose ruby ether of heaven flushed with softened bloom of the insufferable presences and lo the ladders dance and quiver and waylay his eyelids and a second time he is mocked aspiring and after the third swoon standeth hope before him with folded arms and eyes dry of the delusions of tears saying thou hast seen thou hast felt thy strength hath reached in thee so far now shall i never die in thee ' 'for surely' says the minstrel 'hope is not born of earth or it were perishable rather know her the offspring of that embrace strong love straineth the heavens with this owe we to thy music bridal nightingale and the difference of this celestial spirit from the smirking phantasy of whom all stand soon or late forsaken is the difference between painted day with its poor ambitious snares and night lifting its myriad tapers round the throne of the eternal the prophet stars of everlasting time and the one dieth and the other liveth and the one is unregretted and the other walketh in thought spun raiment of divine melancholy her ears crowded with the pale surges that wrap this shifting shore in her eyes a shape of beauty floating dimly that she will not attain this side the water but broodeth on evermore 'therefore hold on thy cherished four long notes which are as the very edge where exultation and anguish melt meet and are sharpened to one ecstasy death dividing bird fill the woods with passionate chuckle and sob sweet chaplain of the marriage service of a soul with heaven pour out thy holy wine of song upon the soft footed darkness till like a priest of the inmost temple 'tis drunken with fair intelligences' thus the old minstrels and minnesingers strong and full sang the nightingales that night farina held watch by the guilty castle that entombed his living beloved the castle looked itself a denser shade among the moonthrown shadows of rock and tree the meadow spread like a green courtyard at the castle's foot it was of lush deep emerald grass softly mixed with grey in the moon's light and showing like jasper where the shadows fell thickest there was yet a mist of colour all about ran a brook and babbled to itself the spring crocus lifted its head in moist midgrasses of the meadow rejoiced with freshness the rugged heights seemed to clasp this one innocent spot as their only garden treasure and a bank of hazels hid it from the castle with a lover's arm 'the moon will tell me' mused farina 'the moon will signal me the hour when the moon hangs over the round tower i shall know 'tis time to strike' the song of the nightingales was a full unceasing throb it went like the outcry of one heart from branch to branch the four long notes and the short fifth which leads off to that hurried gush of music gurgling rich with passion came thick and constant from under the tremulous leaves at first farina had been deaf to them his heart was in the dungeon with margarita or with the goshawk in his dangers forming a thousand desperate plans among the red hot ploughshares of desperate action finally without a sense of being wooed it was won the tenderness of his love then mastered him 'god will not suffer that fair head to come to harm' he thought and with the thought a load fell off his breast he paced the meadows and patted the three pasturing steeds involuntarily his sight grew on the moon she went so slowly she seemed not to move at all a little wing of vapour flew toward her it whitened passed and the moon was slower than before oh were the heavens delaying their march to look on this iniquity again and again he cried 'patience it is not time' he flung himself on the grass the next moment he climbed the heights and was peering at the mass of gloom that fronted the sky it reared such a mailed head of menace that his heart was seized with a quivering as though it had been struck behind lay scattered some small faint winkling stars on sapphire fields and a stain of yellow light was in a breach of one wall he descended what was the goshawk doing was he betrayed it was surely now time no the moon had not yet smitten the face of the castle he made his way through the hazel bank among flitting nightmoths and glanced up to measure the moon's distance as he did so a first touch of silver fell on the hoary flint 'oh young bird of heaven in that devil's clutch' sounds like the baying of boar hounds alarmed him they whined into silence he fell back the meadow breathed peace and more and more the nightingales volumed their notes as in a charmed circle of palpitating song he succumbed to languor the brook rolled beside him fresh as an infant toying with the moonlight he leaned over it and thrice waywardly dipped his hand in the clear translucence was it his own face imaged there farina bent close above an eddy of the water it whirled with a strange tumult breaking into lines and lights a face not his own nor the moon's nor was it a reflection the agitation increased now a wreath of bubbles crowned the pool and a pure water lily but larger ascended wavering he started aside and under him a bright head garlanded with gemmed roses appeared no fairer figure of woman had farina seen her visage had the lustrous white of moonlight and all her shape undulated in a dress of flashing silver white wonderful to see the lady of the water smiled on him and ran over with ripples and dimples of limpid beauty then as he retreated on the meadow grass she swam toward him and taking his hand pressed it to her after her touch the youth no longer feared she curved her finger and beckoned him on all that she did was done flowingly the youth was a shadow in her silver track as she passed like a harmless wave over the closed crocuses but the crocuses shivered and swelled their throats of streaked purple and argent as at delicious rare sips of a wine breath of violet and ladysmock and valley lily mingled and fluttered about her farina was as a man working the day's intent in a dream he could see the heart in her translucent hanging like a cold dingy ruby by the purity of his nature he felt that such a presence must have come but to help it might be margarita's guardian fairy they passed the hazel bank and rounded the castlecrag washed by the brook and beneath the advancing moon standing in a ring of brawling silver the youth with his fervid eyes marked the old weather stains and scars of long defiance coming into colour that mystery of wickedness which the towers had worn in the dusk was dissolved and he endured no more the almost abashed sensation of competing littleness that made him think there was nought to do save die combating single handed such massive power the moon shone calmly superior like the prowess of maiden knights and now the harsh frown of the walls struck resolution to his spirit and nerved him with hate and the contempt true courage feels when matched against fraud and villany on a fallen block of slate cushioned with rich brown moss and rusted weather stains the water lady sat and pointed to farina the path of the moon toward the round tower she did not speak and if his lips parted put her cold finger across them then she began to hum a soft sweet monotony of song vague and careless very witching to hear farina caught no words nor whether the song was of days in dust or in flower but his mind bloomed with legends and sad splendours of story while she sang on the slate block under sprinkled shadows by the water he had listened long in trance when the water lady hushed and stretched forth a slender forefinger to the moon it stood like a dot over the round tower farina rose in haste she did not leave him to ask her aid but took his hand and led him up the steep ascent halfway to the castle she rested there concealed by bramble tufts she disclosed the low portal of a secret passage and pushed it open without effort she paused at the entrance and he could see her trembling seeming to wax taller till she was like a fountain glittering in the cold light then she dropped as drops a dying bet and cowered into the passage darkness thick with earth dews oppressed his senses he felt the clammy walls scraping close on him not the dimmest lamp or guiding sound was near but the lady went on as one who knew her way passing a low vaulted dungeon room they wound up stairs hewn in the rock and came to a door obedient to her touch which displayed a chamber faintly misted by a solitary bar of moonlight farina perceived they were above the foundation of the castle the walls gleamed pale with knightly harness habergeons gaping for heads breastplates of blue steel halbert and hand axe greaves glaives boar spears and polished spur fixed heel pieces he seized a falchion hanging apart but the lady stayed his arm and led to another flight of stone ending in a kind of corridor noises of laughter and high feasting beset him at this point the lady of the water sidled her head as to note a familiar voice and then drew him to a looped aperture farina beheld a scene that first dazzled but as it grew into shape sank him with dismay below and level with the chamber he had left a rude banqueting hall glowed under the light of a dozen flambeaux with smoking boar's flesh deer's flesh stone flagons and horn beakers at the head of this board sat werner scarlet with furious feasting and on his right hand margarita bloodless as a beautiful martyr bound to the fire retainers of werner occupied the length of the hall chorusing the baron's speeches and drinking their own healths when there was no call for another farina saw his beloved alone she was dressed as when he parted with her last the dear cameo lay on her bosom but not heaving proudly as of old her shoulders were drooped forward and contracted her bosom in its heaving she would have had a humbled look but for the marble sternness of her eyes they were fixed as eyes that see the way of death through all earthly objects 'now dogs' cried the baron 'the health of the night and swell your lungs for i'll have no cat's cry when werner's bride is the toast monk or no monk's leave she's mine ay my pretty one it shall be made right in the morning if i lead all the laach rats here by the nose thunder no disrespect to werner's bride from pope or abbot now sing out or wait these fellows shall drink it first' he stretched and threw a beaker of wine right and left behind him and farina's despair stiffened his limbs as he recognized the goshawk and schwartz thier strapped to the floor their beards were already moist with previous libations similarly bestowed and they received this in sullen stillness but farina thought he observed a rapid glance of encouragement dart from beneath the goshawk's bent brows as margarita momentarily turned her head half way on him 'lick your chaps ye beasts and don't say werner stints vermin good cheer his nuptial night now' continued the baron growing huskier as he talked louder 'short and ringing my devil's pups werner and his bride and may she soon give you a young baron to keep you in better order than i can as if she does her duty she will' the baron stood up and lifted his huge arm to lead the toast 'werner and his bride' not a voice followed him there was a sudden intimation of the call being echoed but it snapped and ended in shuffling tones as if the hall door had closed on the response 'what 's this' roared the baron in that caged wild beast voice margarita remembered she had heard in the cathedral square no one replied 'speak or i'll rot you a fathom in the rock curs' 'herr baron' said henker rothhals impressively 'the matter is that there's something unholy among us' the baron's goblet flew at his head before the words were uttered 'i'll make an unholy thing of him that says it' and werner lowered at them one by one 'then i say it herr baron' pursued henker rothhals wiping his frontispiece 'the devil has turned against you at last look up there ah it's gone now but where's the man sitting this side saw it not' the baron made one spring and stood on the board 'now will any rascal here please to say so' something in the cruel hang of his threatening hatchet jaw silenced many in the act of confirming the assertion 'stand out henker rotthals ' rotthals slid a hunting knife up his wrist and stepped back from the board 'beast' roared the baron 'i said i wouldn't shed blood to night i spared a traitor and an enemy ' 'look again' said rothhals 'will any fellow say he saw nothing there' while all heads including werner's were directed to the aperture which surveyed them rothhals tossed his knife to the goshawk unperceived this time answers came to his challenge but not in confirmation the baron spoke with a gasping gentleness 'so you trifle with me i'm dangerous for that game mind you of blass gesell i made a better beast of him by sending him three quarters of the road to hell for trial' bellowing 'take that' he discharged a broad blade hitherto concealed in his right hand straight at rothhals it fixed in his cheek and jaw wringing an awful breath of pain from him as he fell against the wall 'there's a lesson for you not to cross me children' said werner striding his stumpy legs up and down the crashing board and puffing his monstrous girth of chest and midriff 'let him stop there awhile to show what comes of thwarting werner fire devils before the baroness too something unholy is there something unholy in his jaw i think leave it sticking he's against meat last is he i'll teach you who he's for who speaks' all hung silent these men were animals dominated by a mightier brute he clasped his throat and shook the board with a jump as he squeaked rather than called a second time 'who spoke' he had not again to ask in this pause as the baron glared for his victim a song so softly sung that it sounded remote but of which every syllable was clearly rounded swelled into his ears and froze him in his angry posture 'the blood of the barons shall turn to ice and their castle fall to wreck when a true lover dips in the water thrice that runs round werner's eck 'round werner's eck the water runs the hazels shiver and shake the walls that have blotted such happy suns are seized with the ruin quake 'and quake with the ruin and quake with rue thou last of werner's race the hearts of the barons were cold that knew the water dame's embrace 'for a sin was done and a shame was wrought that water went to hide and those who thought to make it nought they did but spread it wide 'hold ready hold ready to pay the price and keep thy bridal cheer a hand has dipped in the water thrice and the water dame is here' the rescue the goshawk was on his feet 'now lass' said he to margarita 'now is the time' he took her hand and led her to the door schwartz thier closed up behind her not a man in the hall interposed werner's head moved round after them like a dog on the watch but he was dumb the door opened and farina entered he bore a sheaf of weapons under his arm the familiar sight relieved werner's senses from the charm he shouted to bar the prisoners' passage his men were ranged like statues in the hall there was a start among them as if that terrible noise communicated an instinct of obedience but no more they glanced at each other and remained quiet the goshawk had his eye on werner 'stand back lass' he said to margarita she took a sword from farina and answered with white lips and flashing eyes 'i can fight goshawk' 'and shall if need be but leave it to me now returned guy his eye never left the baron suddenly a shriek of steel rang all fell aside and the combatants stood opposed on clear ground farina took margarita's left hand and placed her against the wall between the thier and himself werner's men were well content to let their master fight it out the words spoken by henker rothhals that the devil had forsaken him seemed in their minds confirmed by the weird song which every one present could swear he heard with his ears 'let him take his chance and try his own luck' they said and shrugged the battle was between guy as margarita's champion and werner in schwartz thier's judgement the two were well matched and he estimated their diverse qualities from sharp experience 'for short work the baron and my new mate for tough standing to 't' farina's summary in favour of the goshawk was 'a stouter heart harder sinews and a good cause the combat was generally regarded with a professional eye and few prayers margarita solely there asked aid from above and knelt to the virgin but her too the clash of arms and dire earnest of mortal fight aroused to eager eyes she had not dallied with heroes in her dreams she was as ready to second siegfried on the crimson field as tend him in the silken chamber it was well that a woman's heart was there to mark the grace and glory of manhood in upright foot to foot encounter for the others it was a mere calculation of lucky hits even farina in his anxiety for her saw but the brightening and darkening of the prospect of escape in every attitude and hard ringing blow margarita was possessed with a painful exaltation in her eyes the bestial baron now took a nobler form and countenance but the goshawk assumed the sovereign aspect of old heroes who whether persecuted or favoured of heaven still maintained their stand remembering of what stuff they were and who made them 'never' say the old writers with a fervour honourable to their knowledge of the elements that compose our being 'never may this bright privilege of fair fight depart from us nor advantage of it fail to be taken man against man or beast singly keeping his ground is as fine rapture to the breast as beauty in her softest hour affordeth for if woman taketh loveliness to her when she languisheth so surely doth man in these fierce moods when steel and iron sparkle opposed and their breath is fire and their lips white with the lock of resolution all their faculties knotted to a point and their energies alive as the daylight to prove themselves superior according to the laws and under the blessing of chivalry' 'for all' they go on to improve the comparison 'may admire and delight in fair blossoming dales under the blue dome of peace but 'tis the rare lofty heart alone comprehendeth and is heightened by terrific splendours of tempest when cloud meets cloud in skies black as the sepulchre and glory sits like a flame on the helm of ruin' for a while the combatants aired their dexterity contenting themselves with cunning cuts and flicks of the sword edge in which werner first drew blood by a keen sweep along the forehead of the goshawk guy had allowed him to keep his position on the board and still fought at his face and neck he now jerked back his body from the hip and swung a round stroke at werner's knee sending him in retreat with a snort of pain before the baron could make good his ground guy was level with him on the board werner turned an upbraiding howl at his men they were not disposed to second him yet they one and all approved his personal battle with fate and never more admired him and felt his power but the affair was exciting and they were not the pillars to prop a falling house werner clenched his two hands to his ponderous glaive and fell upon guy with heavier fury he was becoming not unworth the little womanly appreciation margarita was brought to bestow on him the voice of the water lady whispered at her heart that the baron warred on his destiny and that ennobles all living souls bare headed the combatants engaged and the headpiece was the chief point of attack no swerving from blows was possible for either ward or take a false step would have ensured defeat this also induced caution many a double stamp of the foot was heard as each had to retire in turn 'not at his head so much he'll bear battering there all night long' said henker rothhals in a breathing interval knocks had been pretty equally exchanged but the baron's head certainly looked the least vulnerable whereas guy exhibited several dints that streamed freely yet he looked eye and bearing as fresh as when they began and the calm regular heave of his chest contrasted with werner's quick gasps his smile too renewed each time the baron paused for breath gave margarita heart it was not a taunting smile but one of entire confidence and told all the more on his adversary as werner led off again and the choice was always left him every expression of the goshawk's face passed to full light in his broad eyes the baron's play was a reckless fury there was nothing to study in it guy became the chief object of speculation he was evidently trying to wind his man he struck wildly some thought others judged that he was a random hitter and had no mortal point in aim schwartz thier's opinion was frequently vented 'too round a stroke down on him chop not slice' guy persevered in his own fashion according to schwartz thier he brought down by his wilfulness the blow that took him on the left shoulder and nigh broke him it was a weighty blow followed by a thump of sound the sword edge swerved on his shoulder blade or he must have been disabled but werner's crow was short and he had no time to push success one of the goshawk's swooping under hits half severed his right wrist and the blood spirted across the board he gasped and seemed to succumb but held to it still though with slackened force guy now attacked holding to his round strokes he accustomed werner to guard the body and stood to it so briskly right and left that werner grew bewildered lost his caution and gave ground suddenly the goshawk's glaive flashed in air and chopped sheer down on werner's head so shrewd a blow it was against a half formed defence that the baron dropped without a word right on the edge of the board and there hung feebly grasping with his fingers 'who bars the way now' sang out guy no one accepted the challenge success clothed him with terrors and gave him giant size 'then fare you well my merry men all' said guy 'bear me no ill will for this a little doctoring will right the bold baron' he strode jauntily to the verge of the board and held his finger for margarita to follow she stepped forward the men put their beards together muttering she could not advance farina doubled his elbow and presented sword point three of the ruffians now disputed the way with bare steel margarita looked at the goshawk he was smiling calmly curious as he leaned over his sword and gave her an encouraging nod she made another step in defiance one fellow stretched his hand to arrest her all her maidenly pride stood up at once 'what a glorious girl' murmured the goshawk as he saw her face suddenly flash and she retreated a pace and swung a sharp cut across the knuckles of her assailant daring him or one of them with hard bright eyes beautifully vindictive to lay hand on a pure maiden 'you have it barenleib' cried the others and then to margarita 'look young mistress we are poor fellows and ask a trifle of ransom and then part friends' 'not an ace' the goshawk pronounced from his post 'two to one remember' 'the odds are ours' replied the goshawk confidently they ranged themselves in front of the hall door instead of accepting this challenge guy stepped to werner and laid his moaning foe length wise in an easier posture he then lifted margarita on the board and summoned them with cry of 'free passage' they answered by a sullen shrug and taunt 'schwartz thier rothhals farina buckle up and make ready then' sang guy he measured the length of his sword and raised it the goshawk had not underrated his enemies he was tempted to despise them when he marked their gradually lengthening chaps and eyeballs not one of them moved all gazed at him as if their marrows were freezing with horror 'what's this' cried guy they knew as little as he but a force was behind them irresistible against their efforts the groaning oak slipped open pushing them forward and an apparition glided past soft as the pallid silver of the moon she slid to the baron and put her arms about him and sang to him had the water lady laid an iron hand on all those ruffians she could not have held them faster bound than did the fear of her presence the goshawk drew his fair charge through them followed by farina the thier and rothhals a last glimpse of the hall showed them still as old cathedral sculpture staring at white light on a fluted pillar of the wall the passage of the rhine low among the swarthy sandhills behind the abbey of laach dropped the round red moon soft lengths of misty yellow stole through the glens of rhineland the nightingales still sang closer and closer the moon came into the hushed valleys there is a dell behind hammerstein castle a ring of basking sward girdled by a silver slate brook and guarded by four high peaked hills that slope down four long wooded corners to the grassy base here it is said the elves and earthmen play dancing in circles with laughing feet that fatten the mushroom they would have been fulfilling the tradition now but that the place was occupied by a sturdy group of mortals armed with staves the intruders were sleepy and lay about on the inclines now and then two got up and there rang hard echoes of oak again all were calm as cud chewing cattle and the white water ran pleased with quiet it may be that the elves brewed mischief among them for the oaken blows were becoming more frequent one complained of a kick another demanded satisfaction for a pinch 'go to' drawled the accused drowsily in both cases 'too much beer last night' within three minutes the company counted a pair of broken heads the east was winning on the west in heaven and the dusk was thinning they began to mark each whom he had cudgelled a noise of something swiftly in motion made them alert a roebuck rushed down one of the hills and scampered across the sward the fine beast went stretching so rapidly away as to be hardly distinct 'sathanas once more' they murmured and drew together the name passed through them like a watchword 'not he this time' cried the two new comers emerging from the foliage 'he's safe under cologne the worse for all good men who live there but come follow to the rhine there 's work for us on the yonder side and sharp work' 'why' answered several 'we 've our challenge with the lads of leutesdorf and wied to day' 'd' ye see this' said the foremost of the others pointing to a carved ivory white rose in his cap 'brothers' he swelled his voice 'follow with a will for the white rose is in danger' immediately they ranked and followed zealously through the buds of young bushes and over heaps of damp dead leaves a half hour's scramble when they defiled under hammerstein and stood before the rhine their leader led up the river and after a hasty walk stopped loosened his hood and stripped 'now' said he strapping the bundle to his back 'let me know the hound that refuses to follow his leader when the white rose is in danger' 'long live dietrich' they shouted he dropped from the bank and waded in he was soon supported by the remainder of the striplings and all struck out boldly into mid stream never heard history of a nobler passage of the rhine than this made between andernach and hammerstein by members of the white rose club bundle on back to relieve the white rose of germany from thrall and shame they were taken far down by the rapid current and arrived panting to land the dressing done they marched up the pass of tonnistein and took a deep draught at the spring of pleasant waters there open to wayfarers arrived at the skirts of laach they beheld two farmer peasants lashed back to back against a hazel they released them but could gain no word of information as the fellows after a yawn and a wink started off all heels to make sure of liberty on the shores of the lake the brotherhood descried a body of youths whom they hailed and were welcomed to companionship 'where's berthold' asked dietrich he was not present 'the more glory for us then' dietrich said it was here seriously put to the captain whether they should not halt at the abbey and reflect seeing that great work was in prospect 'truly' quoth dietrich 'dying on an empty stomach is heathenish and cold blood makes a green wound gape kaiser conrad should be hospitable and the monks honour numbers here be we thirty and nine let us go' the west was dark blue with fallen light the lakewaters were growing grey with twilight the abbey stood muffled in shadows already the youths had commenced battering at the convent doors when they were summoned by the voice of the goshawk on horseback to their confusion they beheld the white rose herself on his right hand chapfallen dietrich bowed to his sweet mistress 'we were coming to the rescue' he stammered a laugh broke from the goshawk 'you thought the lady was locked up in the ghostly larder eh' dietrich seized his sword and tightened his belt 'the club allows no jesting with the white rose sir stranger' margarita made peace 'i thank you all good friends but quarrel not i pray you with them that save me at the risk of their lives' 'our service is equal' said the goshawk flourishing 'only we happen to be beforehand with the club for which farina and myself heartily beg pardon of the entire brotherhood' 'farina' exclaimed dietrich 'then we make a prisoner instead of uncaging a captive' 'what 's this' said guy 'so much' responded dietrich 'yonder's a runaway from two masters the law of cologne and the conqueror of satan and all good citizens are empowered to bring him back dead or alive' 'dietrich dietrich dare you talk thus of the man who saved me' cried margarita dietrich sullenly persisted 'then look' said the white rose reddening under the pale dawn 'he shall not he shall not go with you' one of the club was here on the point of speaking to the white rose a breach of the captain's privilege dietrich felled him unresisting to earth and resumed 'it must be done beauty of cologne the monk father gregory is now enduring shame and scorn for lack of this truant witness' 'enough i go ' said farina 'you leave me' margarita looked tender reproach weariness and fierce excitement had given a liquid flame to her eyes and an endearing darkness round their circles that matched strangely with her plump youth her features had a soft white flush she was less radiant but never looked so bewitching an aspect of sweet human languor caught at the heart of love and raised tumults 'it is a duty' said farina 'then go' she beckoned and held her hand for him to kiss he raised it to his lips this was seen of all the club as they were departing with farina and guy prepared to demand admittance into the convent dietrich chanced to ask how fared dame lisbeth schwartz thier was by and answered with a laugh that he had quite forgotten the little lady 'we took her in mistake for you mistress she was a one to scream the moment she was kissed mum as a cloister we kissed her all of us for the fun of it no harm no harm we should have dropped her when we found we had the old bird 'stead of the young one but reckoned ransom ye see she's at the eck rattling i's wager like last year's nut in the shell' 'lisbeth lisbeth poor lisbeth we will return to her instantly' cried margarita 'not you' said guy 'yes i' 'no' said guy 'gallant goshawk best of birds let me go' 'without me or farina never i see i shall have no chance with my lord now come then come fair irresistible come lads farina can journey back alone you shall have the renown of rescuing dame lisbeth' 'farina forget not to comfort my father' said margarita between margarita's society and farina's there was little dispute in the captain's mind which choice to make farina was allowed to travel single to cologne and dietrich petted by margarita and gently jeered by guy headed the club from laach waters to the castle of the robber baron the back blows of sathanas monk gregory was pacing the high road between the imperial camp and suffering cologne the sun had risen through interminable distances of cloud that held him remote in a succession of receding mounds and thinner veils realm beyond realm till he showed fireless like a phantom king in a phantom land the lark was in the breast of morning the field mouse ran along the furrows dews hung red and grey on the weedy banks and wayside trees at times the nostril of the good father was lifted and he beat his breast relapsing into sorrowful contemplation passed any citizen of cologne the ghostly head sunk into its cowl 'there's a black raven' said many monk gregory heard them and murmured 'thou hast me evil one thou hast me' it was noon when farina came clattering down from the camp 'father' said he 'i have sought thee' 'my son' exclaimed monk gregory with silencing hand 'thou didst not well to leave me contending against the tongues of doubt answer me not the maiden and what weighed she in such a scale no more i am punished well speaks the ancient proverb beware the back blows of sathanas i that thought to have vanquished him vanity has wrecked me in this world and the next i am the victim of self incense i hear the demons shouting their chorus here comes monk gregory who called himself conqueror of darkness in the camp i am discredited and a scoff in the city i am spat upon abhorred satan my son fights not with his fore claws 'tis with his tail he fights o farina listen my son he entered to his kingdom below through cologne even under the stones of the cathedral square and the stench of him abominably remaineth challenging the nostrils of holy and unholy alike the kaiser cannot approach for him the citizens are outraged oh had i held my peace in humbleness i had truly conquered him but he gave me easy victory to inflate me i shall not last now this only is left my son that thou bear living testimony to the truth of my statement as i bear it to the folly' farina promised in the face of all he would proclaim and witness to his victory on drachenfels 'that i may not be ranked an impostor' continued the monk 'and how great must be the virtue of them that encounter that dark spirit valour availeth nought but if virtue be not in' ye soon will ye be puffed to bursting with that devil's poison self incense surely my son thou art faithful and for this service i can reward thee follow me yet again' on the road they met gottlieb groschen hastening to the camp dismay rumpled the old merchant's honest jowl farina drew rein before him 'your daughter is safe worthy master groschen' said he 'safe' cried gottlieb 'where is she my grete' farina briefly explained gottlieb spread out his arms and was going to thank the youth he saw father gregory and his whole frame narrowed with disgust 'are you in company with that pestilent animal that curse of cologne' 'the good monk ' said farina 'you are leagued with him then sirrah expect no thanks from me cologne i say is cursed meddling wretches could ye not leave satan alone he hurt us not we were free of him cologne i say is cursed the enemy of mankind is brought by you to be the deadly foe of cologne' so saying gottlieb departed 'seest thou my son' quoth the monk 'they reason not' farina was dejected willingly would he for his part have left the soul of evil a loose rover for the sake of some brighter horizon to his hope no twinge of remorse accompanied gottlieb the kaiser had allotted him an encampment and a guard of honour for his household while the foulness raged and there gottlieb welcomed back margarita and aunt lisbeth on the noon after his meeting with farina the white rose had rested at laach and was blooming again she and the goshawk came trotting in advance of the club through the woods of laach startling the deer with laughter and sending the hare with her ears laid back all across country in vain dietrich menaced guy with the terrors of the club aunt lisbeth begged of margarita not to leave her with the footmen in vain the joyous couple galloped over the country and sprang the ditches and leapt the dykes up and down the banks glad as morning hawks entering andernach at a round pace where they rested at a hostel as capable of producing good rhine and mosel wine then as now here they had mid day's meal laid out in the garden for the angry club and somewhat appeased them on their arrival with bumpers of the best scharzhofberger after a refreshing halt three boats were hired on their passage to the river they encountered a procession of monks headed by the archbishop of andernach bearing a small figure of christ carved in blackthorn and varnished said to work miracles and a present to the good town from two hungarian pilgrims 'are ye for cologne' the monks inquired of them 'direct down stream' they answered 'send then hither to us gregory the conqueror of darkness that he may know there is gratitude on earth and gratulation for great deeds' said the monks so with genuflexions the travellers proceeded and entered the boats by the archbishop's white tower hammerstein castle and rheineck they floated under salzig and the ahr confluence rolandseck and nonnenwerth drachenfels and bonn hills green with young vines dells waving fresh foliage margarita sang as they floated ancient ballads she sang that made the goshawk sigh for home and affected the club with delirious love for the grand old water that was speeding them onward aunt lisbeth was not to be moved she alone held down her head she looked not gottlieb in the face as he embraced her nor to any questioning would she vouchsafe reply from that time forth she was charity to woman and the exuberant cheerfulness and familiarity of the men toward her soon grew kindly and respectful the dragon in aunt lisbeth was destroyed she objected no more to margarita's cameo the goshawk quickly made peace with his lord and enjoyed the commendation of the kaiser dietrich schill thought of challenging him but the club had graver business and this was to pass sentence on berthold schmidt for the crime of betraying the white rose into the hands of werner they had found berthold at the eck and there consented to let him remain until ransom was paid for his traitorous body berthold in his mad passion was tricked by werner and on his release by payment of the ransom submitted to the judgement of the club which condemned him to fight them all in turn and then endure banishment from rhineland the goshawk for his sister's sake interceding before a harsher tribunal the entry into cologne seven days kaiser heinrich remained camped outside cologne six times in six successive days the kaiser attempted to enter the city and was foiled 'beard of barbarossa' said the kaiser 'this is the first stronghold that ever resisted me' the warrior bishops electors pfalzgrafs and knights of the empire all swore it was no shame not to be a match for the demon 'if' said the reflective kaiser 'we are to suffer below what poor cologne is doomed to undergo now let us by all that is savoury reform and do penance' the wind just then setting on them dead from cologne made the courtiers serious many thought of their souls for the first time this is recorded to the honour of monk gregory on the seventh morning the kaiser announced his determination to make a last trial it was dawn and a youth stood before the kaiser's tent praying an audience conducted into the presence of the kaiser the youth they say succeeded in arousing him from his depression for brave as he was kaiser heinrich dreaded the issue forthwith order was given for the cavalcade to set out according to the rescript kaiser heinrich retaining the youth at his right hand but the youth had found occasion to visit gottlieb and margarita each of whom he furnished with a flashflask curiously shaped and charged with a distillation as the head of the procession reached the gates of cologne symptoms of wavering were manifest kaiser heinrich commanded an advance at all cost pfalzgraf nase as the old chronicles call him in their humour but assuredly a great noble led the van and pushed across the draw bridge hesitation and signs of horror were manifest in the assemblage round the kaiser's person the kaiser and the youth at his right hand were cheery not a whit drooped they several of the heroic knights begged the kaiser's permission to fall back 'follow pfalzgraf nase' the kaiser is reported to have said great was the wonderment of the people of cologne to behold kaiser heinrich riding in perfect stateliness up the main street toward the cathedral while right and left of him bishops and electors were dropping incapable the kaiser advanced till by his side the youth rode sole 'thy name' said the kaiser he answered 'a poor youth unconquerable kaiser farina i am called' 'thy recompense' said the kaiser he answered 'the hand of a maiden of cologne most gracious kaiser and master' 'she is thine' said the kaiser kaiser heinrich looked behind him and among a host grasping the pommels of their saddles and reeling vanquished were but two erect a maiden and an old man 'that is she unconquerable kaiser' farina continued bowing low 'it shall be arranged on the spot' said the kaiser a word from kaiser heinrich sealed gottlieb's compliance said he 'gracious kaiser and master though such a youth could of himself never have aspired to the possession of a groschen yet when the kaiser pleads for him objection is as the rock of moses and streams consent truly he has done cologne good service and if margarita my daughter can be persuaded ' the kaiser addressed her with his blazing brows margarita blushed a ready autumn of rosy ripe acquiescence 'a marriage registered yonder' said the kaiser pointing upward 'i am thine murmured margarita as farina drew near her 'seal it seal it' quoth the kaiser in hearty good humour 'take no consent from man or maid without a seal' farina tossed the contents of a flask in air and saluted his beloved on the lips this scene took place near the charred round of earth where the foulest descended to his kingdom below men now pervaded cologne with flasks purifying the atmosphere it became possible to breathe freely 'we germans' said kaiser heinrich when he was again surrounded by his courtiers 'may go wrong if we always follow pfalzgraf nase but this time we have been well led' whereat there was obsequious laughter the pfalzgraf pleaded a susceptible nostril 'thou art i fear but a timid mortal' said the kaiser 'never have i been found so on the german field imperial majesty' returned the pfalzgraf 'i take glory to myself that this nether reek overcomes me' 'even that we must combat you see' exclaimed kaiser heinrich 'but come all to a marriage this night and take brides as soon as you will all of you increase and give us loyal subjects in plenty i count prosperity by the number of marriages in my empire' the white rose club were invited by gottlieb to the wedding and took it in vast wrath until they saw the kaiser and such excellent stout german fare present when immediately a battle raged as to who should do the event most honour and was in dispute till dawn dietrich schill being the man he having consumed wurst the length of his arm and wine sufficient to have floated a st goar salmon which was long proudly chronicled in his family and is now unearthed from among the ancient honourable records of cologne the goshawk was farina's bridesman and a very spiriting bridesman was he aunt lisbeth sat in a corner faintly smiling 'child' said the little lady to margarita when they kissed at parting 'your courage amazes me do you think do you know poor sweet bird delivered over hand and foot' 'i love him i love him aunty that's all i know' said margarita 'love love love him' 'heaven help you' ejaculated aunt lisbeth 'pray with me' said margarita the two knelt at the foot of the bride bed and prayed very different prayers but to the same end that done aunt lisbeth helped undress the white rose and trembled and told a sad nuptial anecdote of the castle and put her little shrivelled hand on margarita's heart and shrieked 'child it gallops' she cried ''tis happiness' said margarita standing in her hair 'may it last only' exclaimed aunt lisbeth 'it will aunty i am humble i am true' and the fair girl gathered the frill of her nightgown 'look not in the glass' said lisbeth 'not to night look if you can to morrow' she smoothed the white rose in her bed tucked her up and kissed her leaving her as a bud that waits for sunshine conclusion the shadow of monk gregory was seen no more in cologne he entered the calendar and ranks next st anthony for three successive centuries the towns of rhineland boasted his visits in the flesh and the conqueror of darkness caused dire rhenish feuds the tailed infernal repeated his famous back blow on farina the youth awoke one morning and beheld warehouses the exact pattern of his own displaying flasks shaped even as his own and a farina to right and left of him in a week they were doubled a month quadrupled them they increased 'fame and fortune' mused farina 'come from man and the world love is from heaven we may be worthy and lose the first we lose not love unless unworthy would ye know the true farina look for him who walks under the seal of bliss whose darling is for ever his young sweet bride leading him from snares priming his soul with celestial freshness there is no hypocrisy can ape that aspect least of all the creatures of the damned by this i may be known' seven years after when the goshawk came into cologne to see old friends and drink some of gottlieb's oldest rudesheimer he was waylaid by false farinas and only discovered the true one at last by chance in the music gardens near the rhine where farina sat having on one hand margarita and at his feet three boys and one girl over whom both bent lovingly like the parent vine fondling its grape bunches in summer light etext editor's bookmarks a generous enemy is a friend on the wrong side all are friends who sit at table be what you seem my little one bed

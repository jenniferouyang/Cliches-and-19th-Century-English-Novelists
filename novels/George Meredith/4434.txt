significantly closed and it became known that death had taken mr melchisedec harrington and struck one off the list of living tailors the demise of a respectable member of this class does not ordinarily create a profound sensation he dies and his equals debate who is to be his successor while the rest of them who have come in contact with him very probably hear nothing of his great launch and final adieu till the winding up of cash accounts on which occasions we may augur that he is not often blessed by one or other of the two great parties who subdivide this universe in the case of mr melchisedec it was otherwise this had been a grand man despite his calling and in the teeth of opprobrious epithets against his craft to be both generally blamed and generally liked evinces a peculiar construction of mortal mr melchisedec whom people in private called the great mel had been at once the sad dog of lymport and the pride of the town he was a tailor and he kept horses he was a tailor and he had gallant adventures he was a tailor and he shook hands with his customers finally he was a tradesman and he never was known to have sent in a bill such a personage comes but once in a generation and when he goes men miss the man as well as their money that he was dead there could be no doubt kilne the publican opposite had seen sally one of the domestic servants come out of the house in the early morning and rush up the street to the doctors tossing her hands and she not disinclined to dilute her grief had on her return related that her master was then at his last gasp and had refused in so many words to swallow the doctor i wont swallow the doctor he says i wont swallow the doctor sally moaned i never touched him he says and i never will kilne angrily declared that in his opinion a man who rejected medicine in extremity ought to have it forced down his throat and considering that the invalid was pretty deeply in kilnes debt it naturally assumed the form of a dishonest act on his part but sally scornfully dared any one to lay hand on her master even for his own good for said she hes got his eyes awake though he do lie so helpless he marks ye ah ah kilne sniffed the air sally then rushed back to her duties now theres a man kilne stuck his hands in his pockets and began his meditation which however was cut short by the approach of his neighbour barnes the butcher to whom he confided what he had heard and who ejaculated professionally obstinate as a pig as they stood together they beheld sally a figure of telegraph at one of the windows implying that all was just over amen said barnes as to a matter of fact affair some minutes after the two were joined by grossby the confectioner who listened to the news and observed just like him id have sworn hed never take doctors stuff and nodding at kilne liked his medicine best eh had a hemgood lot of it muttered kilne with a suddenly serious brow how does he stand on your books asked barnes kilne shouldered round crying who the deuce is to know i dont grossby sighed in he comes with his good morning grossby fine day for the hunt grossby and a ten pound note have the kindness to put that down in my favour grossby and just as i am going to say look herethis wont do he has me by the collar and theres one of the regiments going to give a supper party which hes to order or the admirals wife wants the receipt for that pie or in comes my wife and theres no talking of business then though she may have been bothering about his account all the night beforehand something or other and so we run on what i want to know said barnes the butcher is where he got his tenners from kilne shook a sagacious head no knowing i suppose we shall get something out of the fire barnes suggested that depends answered the emphatic kilne but you know if the widow carries on the business said grossby theres no reason why we shouldnt get it all eh there aint two that can make clothes for nothing and make a profit out of it said kilne that young chap in portugal added barnes he wont take to tailoring when he comes home dye think he will kilne muttered cant say and grossby a kindly creature in his way albeit a creditor reverting to the first subject of their discourse ejaculated but what a one he waseh fineto look on kilne assented well he was like a marquis said barnes here the three regarded each other and laughed though not loudly they instantly checked that unseemliness and kilne as one who rises from the depths of a calculation with the sum in his head spoke quite in a different voice well what do you say gentlemen shall we adjourn no use standing here by the invitation to adjourn it was well understood by the committee kilne addressed that they were invited to pass his threshold and partake of a morning draught barnes the butcher had no objection whatever and if grossby a man of milder make entertained any the occasion and common interests to be discussed advised him to waive them in single file these mourners entered the publicans house where kilne after summoning them from behind the bar on the important question what it should be and receiving first perfect acquiescence in his views as to what it should be and then feeble suggestions of the drink best befitting that early hour and the speakers particular constitution poured out a toothful to each and one to himself heres to him poor fellow said kilne and was deliberately echoed twice now it wasnt that kilne pursued pointing to the bottle in the midst of a smacking of lips that wasnt what got him into difficulties it was expensive luckshries it was being above his condition horses whats a tradesman got to do with horses unless hes retired then hes a gentleman and can do as he likes its no use trying to be a gentleman if you cant pay for it it always ends bad why there was he consorting with gentlefolksgay as a lark who has to pay for it kilnes fellow victims maintained a rather doleful tributary silence im not saying anything against him now the publican further observed its too late and there im sorry hes gone for one he was as kind a hearted a man as ever breathed and there perhaps it was just as much my fault i couldnt say no to himdash me if i could lymport was a prosperous town and in prosperity the much despised british tradesman is not a harsh he is really a well disposed easy soul and requires but management manner occasional instalmentsjust to freshen the accountand a surety that he who debits is on the spot to be a right royal king of credit only the account must never drivel stare aut crescere appears to be his feeling on that point and the departed mr melchisedec undoubtedly understood him there for the running on of the account looked deplorable and extraordinary now that mr melchisedec was no longer in a position to run on with it and it was precisely his doing so which had prevented it from being brought to a summary close long before both barnes the butcher and grossby the confectioner confessed that they too found it hard ever to say no to him and speaking broadly never could except once said barnes when he wanted me to let him have a ox to roast whole out on the common for the battle of waterloo i stood out against him on that no no says i ill joint him for ye mr harrington you shall have him in joints and eat him at homeha ha just like him said grossby with true enjoyment of the princely disposition that had dictated the patriotic order ohthere kilne emphasized pushing out his arm across the bar as much as to say that in anything of such a kind the great mel never had a rival that marquis affair changed him a bit said barnes perhaps it did for a time said kilne whats in the grain you know he couldnt change he would be a gentleman and nothingd stop him and i shouldnt wonder but what that young chap out in portugalll want to be one too though he didnt bid fair to be so fine a man as his father more of a scholar remarked kilne that i call his worst faultshilly shallying about that young chap i mean his kilne stretched a finger toward the dead mans house first the young chaps to be sent into the navy then its the army then hes to be a judge and sit on criminals then he goes out to his sister in portugal and now theres nothing but a tailor open to him as i see if were to get our money ah and he hasnt got too much spirit to work to pay his fathers debts added barnes theres a business there to make any mans fortuneproperly directed i say but i suppose like father like son hell becoming the marquis too he went to a gentlemans school and hes had foreign training i dont know what to think about it his sisters over therethey were fine women oh a fine family every one of em and married well exclaimed the publican i never had the exact rights of that marquis affair said grossby and remembering that he had previously laughed knowingly when it was alluded to pursued of course i heard of it at the time but how did he behave when he was blown upon barnes undertook to explain but kilne who relished the narrative quite as well and was readier said look here ill tell you i had it from his own mouth one night when he wasntnot quite himself he was coming down king william street where he stabled his horse you know and i met him hed been dining out somewhere out over fallowfield i think it was and he sings out to me ah kilne my good fellow and i wishing to be equal with him says a fine night my lord and he draws himself uphe smelt of good companysays he kilne im not a lord as you know and you have no excuse for mistaking me for one sir so i pretended i had mistaken him and then he tucked his arm under mine and said youre no worse than your betters kilne they took me for one at squire uplifts to night but a man who wishes to pass off for more than he is kilne and impose upon people he says hes contemptible kilne contemptible so that you know set me thinking about bath and the marquis and i couldnt help smiling to myself and just let slip a question whether he had enlightened them a bit kilne said he youre an honest man and a neighbour and ill tell you what happened the squire he says likes my company and i like his table now the squired never do a dirty action but the squires nephew mr george uplift he cant forget that i earn my money and once or twice i have had to correct him and ill wager mel did it too well he goes on there was admiral sir jackson racial and his lady at dinner squire falco of bursted lady barrington admiral comblemanour admiral that was mr this and that i forget their namesand other ladies and gentlemen whose acquaintance i was not honoured with you know his way of talking and there was a goose on the table he says and looking stern at me dont laugh yet says he like thunder well he goes on mr george caught my eye across the table and said so as not to be heard by his uncle if that bird was rampant you would see your own arms marquis and mel replied quietly for him to hear and as that bird is couchant mr george you had better look to your sauce couchant means squatting you know thats heraldry well that wasnt bad sparring of mels but bless you he was never taken aback and the gentlefolks was glad enough to get him to sit down amongst em so says mr george i know youre a fire eater marquis and his dander was up for he began marquising mel and doing the mock polite at such a rate that by and by one of the ladies who didnt know mel called him my lord and his lordship and says mel i merely bowed to her and took no notice so that passed off and there sits mel telling his anecdotes as grand as a king and by and by young mr george who hadnt forgiven mel and had been pulling at the bottle pretty well he sings out its michaelmas the death of the goose and i should like to drink the marquiss health and he drank it solemn but as far as i can make out the women part of the company was a little in the dark so mel waited till there was a sort of a pause and then speaks rather loud to the admiral by the way sir jackson may i ask you has the title of marquis anything to do with tailoring now mel was a great favourite with the admiral and with his lady too they sayand the admiral played into his hands you see and says he im not aware that it has mr harrington and he begged for to know why he asked the questioncalled him mister you understand so mel said and i can see him now right out from his chest he spoke with his head upwhen i was a younger man i had the good taste to be fond of good society and the bad taste to wish to appear different from what i was in it thats mel speaking everybody was listening so he goes on i was in the habit of going to bath in the season and consorting with the gentlemen i met there on terms of equality and for some reason that i am quite guiltless of says mel the hotel people gave out that i was a marquis in disguise and upon my honour ladies and gentlemeni was young then and a fooli could not help imagining i looked the thing at all events i took upon myself to act the part and with some success and considerable gratification for in my opinion says mel no real marquis ever enjoyed his title so much as i did one day i was in my shopno main street lymportand a gentleman came in to order his outfit i received his directions when suddenly he started back stared at me and exclaimed my dear marquis i trust you will pardon me for having addressed you with so much familiarity i recognized in him one of my bath acquaintances that circumstance ladies and gentlemen has been a lesson to me since that time i have never allowed a false impression with regard to my position to exist i desire says mel smiling to have my exact measure taken everywhere and if the michaelmas bird is to be associated with me i am sure i have no objection all i can say is that i cannot justify it by letters patent of nobility thats how mel put it do you think they thought worse of him i warrant you he came out of it in flying colours gentlefolks like straight forwardness in their inferiorsthats what they do ah said kilne meditatively i see him now walking across the street in the moonlight after hed told me that a fine figure of a man and there aint many marquises to match him to this barnes and grossby not insensible to the merits of the recital they had just given ear to agreed and with a common voice of praise in the mouths of his creditors the dead mans requiem was sounded chapter ii the heritage of the son toward evening a carriage drove up to the door of the muted house and the card of lady racial bearing a hurried line in pencil was handed to the widow it was when you looked upon her that you began to comprehend how great was the personal splendour of the husband who could eclipse such a woman mrs harrington was a tall and a stately dame dressed in the high waists of the matrons of that period with a light shawl drawn close over her shoulders and bosom she carried her head well and her pale firm features with the cast of immediate affliction on them had much dignity dignity of an unrelenting physical order which need not express any remarkable pride of spirit the family gossips who on both sides were vain of this rare couple and would always descant on their beauty even when they had occasion to slander their characters said to distinguish them that henrietta maria had a port and melchisedec a presence and that the union of a port and a presence and such a port and such a presence was so uncommon that you might search england through and you would not find another not even in the highest ranks of society there lies some subtle distinction here due to the minute perceptions which compel the gossips of a family to coin phrases that shall express the nicest shades of a domestic difference by a port one may understand them to indicate something unsympathetically impressive whereas a presence would seem to be a thing that directs the most affable appeal to our poor human weaknesses his majesty king george iv for instance possessed a port beau brummel wielded a presence many it is true take a presence to mean no more than a shirt frill and interpret a port as the art of walking erect but this is to look upon language too narrowly on a more intimate acquaintance with the couple you acknowledge the aptness of the fine distinction by birth mrs harrington had claims to rank as a gentlewoman that is her father was a lawyer of lymport the lawyer however since we must descend the genealogical tree was known to have married his cook who was the ladys mother now mr melchisedec was mysterious concerning his origin and in his cups talked largely and wisely of a great welsh family issuing from a line of princes and it is certain that he knew enough of their history to have instructed them on particular points of it he never could think that his wife had done him any honour in espousing him nor was she the woman to tell him so she had married him for love rejecting various suitors squire uplift among them in his favour subsequently she had committed the profound connubial error of transferring her affections or her thoughts from him to his business which indeed was much in want of a mate and while he squandered the guineas she patiently picked up the pence they had not lived unhappily he was constantly courteous to her but to see the port at that sordid work considerably ruffled the presenceput as it were the peculiar division between them and to behave toward her as the same woman who had attracted his youthful ardours was a task for his magnificent mind and may have ranked with him as an indemnity for his general conduct if his reflections ever stretched so far the townspeople of lymport were correct in saying that his wife and his wife alone had as they termed it kept him together nevertheless now that he was dead and could no longer be kept together they entirely forgot their respect for her in the outburst of their secret admiration for the popular man such is the constitution of the inhabitants of this dear island of britain so falsely accused by the great napoleon of being a nation of shopkeepers here let any one proclaim himself above buttons and act on the assumption his fellows with one accord hoist him on their heads and bear him aloft sweating and groaning and cursing but proud of him and if he can contrive or has any good wife at home to help him to die without going to the dogs they are one may say unanimous in crying out the same eulogistic funeral oration as that commenced by kilne the publican when he was interrupted by barnes the butcher now theres a man mrs harrington was sitting in her parlour with one of her married nieces mrs fiske and on reading lady racials card she gave word for her to be shown up into the drawing room it was customary among mrs harringtons female relatives who one and all abused and adored the great mel to attribute his shortcomings pointedly to the ladies which was as much as if their jealous generous hearts had said that he was sinful but that it was not his fault mrs fiske caught the card from her aunt read the superscription and exclaimed the idea at least she might have had the decency she never set her foot in the house beforeand right enough too what can she want now i decidedly would refuse to see her aunt the widows reply was simply dont be a fool ann rising she said here take poor jacko and comfort him till i come back jacko was a middle sized south american monkey and had been a pet of her husbands he was supposed to be mourning now with the rest of the family mrs fiske received him on a shrinking lap and had found time to correct one of his indiscretions before she could sigh and say in the rear of her aunts retreating figure i certainly never would let myself down so but mrs harrington took her own counsel and jacko was of her persuasion for he quickly released himself from mrs fiskes dispassionate embrace and was slinging his body up the balusters after his mistress mrs harrington said lady racial very sweetly swimming to meet her as she entered the room i have intruded upon you i fear in venturing to call upon you at such a time the widow bowed to her and begged her to be seated lady racial was an exquisitely silken dame in whose face a winning smile was cut and she was still sufficiently youthful not to be accused of wearing a flower too artificial it was so sudden so sad she continued we esteemed him so much i thought you might be in need of sympathy and hoped i mightdear mrs harrington can you bear to speak of it i can tell you anything you wish to hear my lady the widow replied lady racial had expected to meet a woman much more like what she conceived a tradesmans wife would be and the grave reception of her proffer of sympathy slightly confused her she said i should not have come at least not so early but sir jackson my husband thought and indeed i imaginedyou have a son mrs harrington i think his name is evan my lady evan it was of him we have been speaking i imagined that is we thought sir jackson mightyou will be writing to him and will let him know we will use our best efforts to assist him in obtaining some position worthy of hissuperior tosomething that will secure him from the harassing embarrassments of an uncongenial employment the widow listened to this tender allusion to the shears without a smile of gratitude she replied i hope my son will return in time to bury his father and he will thank you himself my lady he has no taste forafor anything in the shape of trade has he mrs harrington i am afraid not my lady any positiona situationthat of a clerk evenwould be so much better for him the widow remained impassive and many young gentlemen i know who are clerks and are enabled to live comfortably and make a modest appearance in society and your son mrs harrington he would find it surely an improvement uponmany would think it a step for him i am bound to thank you for the interest you take in my son my lady does it not quite suit your views mrs harrington lady racial was surprised at the widows manner if my son had only to think of himself my lady oh but of coursethe lady understood her nowof course you cannot suppose mrs harrington but that i should anticipate he would have you to live with him and behave to you in every way as a dutiful son surely a clerks income is not very large my lady no but enough as i have said and with the management you would bring mrs harrington to produce a modest respectable maintenance my respect for your husband mrs harrington makes me anxious to press my services upon you lady racial could not avoid feeling hurt at the widows want of common gratitude a clerks income would not be more than a year my lady to begin withno certainly not more the lady was growing brief if my son puts by the half of that yearly he can hardly support himself and his mother my lady half of that yearly mrs harrington he would have to do so and be saddled till he dies my lady i really cannot see why lady racial had a notion of some excessive niggardly thrift in the widow which was arousing symptoms of disgust mrs harrington quietly said there are his fathers debts to pay my lady his fathers debts under but above my lady five thousand pounds mrs harrington the ladys delicately gloved hand gently rose and fell and this poor young manshe pursued my son will have to pay it my lady for a moment the lady had not a word to instance presently she remarked but mrs harrington he is surely under no legal obligation he is only under the obligation not to cast disrespect on his fathers memory my lady and to be honest while he can but mrs harrington surely what can the poor young man do he will pay it my lady but how mrs harrington there is his fathers business my lady his fathers business then must the young man become a tradesman in order to show respect for his father preposterous that was the ladys natural inward exclamation she said rather shrewdly for one who knew nothing of such things but a business which produces debts so enormous mrs harrington the widow replied my son will have to conduct it in a different way it would be a very good business conducted properly my lady but if he has no taste for it mrs harrington if he is altogether superior to it for the first time during the interview the widows inflexible countenance was mildly moved though not to any mild expression my son will have not to consult his tastes she observed and seeing the lady after a short silence quit her seat she rose likewise and touched the fingers of the hand held forth to her bowing you will pardon the interest i take in your son said lady racial i hope indeed that his relatives and friends will procure him the means of satisfying the demands made upon him he would still have to pay them my lady was the widows answer poor young man indeed i pity him sighed her visitor you have hitherto used no efforts to persuade him to take such a stepmrs harrington i have written to mr goren who was my husbands fellow apprentice in london my lady and he is willing to instruct him in cutting and measuring and keeping accounts certain words in this speech were obnoxious to the fine ear of lady racial and she relinquished the subject your husband mrs harringtoni should so much have wishedhe did not pass away inin pain he died very calmly my lady it is so terrible so disfiguring sometimes one dreads to seeone can hardly distinguish i have known cases where death was dreadful but a peaceful death is very beautiful there is nothing shocking to the mind it suggests heaven it seems a fulfilment of our prayers would your ladyship like to look upon him said the widow lady racial betrayed a sudden gleam at having her desire thus intuitively fathomed for one moment mrs harrington we esteemed him so much may i the widow responded by opening the door and leading her into the chamber where the dead man lay at that period when threats of invasion had formerly stirred up the military fire of us islanders the great mel as if to show the great napoleon what character of being a british shopkeeper really was had by remarkable favour obtained a lieutenancy of militia dragoons in the uniform of which he had revelled and perhaps for the only time in his life felt that circumstances had suited him with a perfect fit however that may be his solemn final commands to his wife henrietta maria on whom he could count for absolute obedience in such matters had been that as soon as the breath had left his body he should be taken from his bed washed perfumed powdered and in that uniform dressed and laid out with directions that he should be so buried at the expiration of three days that havoc in his features might be hidden from men in this array lady racial beheld him the curtains of the bed were drawn aside the beams of evening fell soft through the blinds of the room and cast a subdued light on the figure of the vanquished warrior the presence dumb now for evermore was sadly illumined for its last exhibition but one who looked closely might have seen that time had somewhat spoiled that perfect fit which had aforetime been his pride and now that the lofty spirit had departed there had been extreme difficulty in persuading the sullen excess of clay to conform to the dimensions of those garments the upper part of the chest alone would bear its buttons and across one portion of the lower limbs an ancient seam had started recalling an incident to them who had known him in his brief hour of glory for one night as he was riding home from fallowfield and just entering the gates of the town a mounted trooper spurred furiously past and slashing out at him gashed his thigh mrs melchisedec found him lying at his door in a not unwonted way carried him up stairs in her arms as she had done many a time before and did not perceive his condition till she saw the blood on her gown the cowardly assailant was never discovered but mel was both gallant and had in his military career the reputation of being a martinet hence divers causes were suspected the wound failed not to mend the trousers were repaired peace about the same time was made and the affair passed over looking on the fine head and face lady racial saw nothing of this she had not looked long before she found covert employment for her handkerchief the widow standing beside her did not weep or reply to her whispered excuses at emotion gazing down on his mortal length with a sort of benignant friendliness aloof as one whose duties to that form of flesh were well nigh done at the feet of his master jacko the monkey had jumped up and was there squatted with his legs crossed very like a tailor the imitative wretch had got a towel and as often as lady racials handkerchief travelled to her eyes jackos peery face was hidden and you saw his lithe skinny body doing griefs convulsions till tired of this amusement he obtained possession of the warriors helmet from a small round table on one side of the bed a calque of the barbarous military georgian form with a huge knob of horse hair projecting over the peak and under this trying to adapt it to his rogues head the tricksy image of death extinguished himself all was very silent in the room then the widow quietly disengaged jacko and taking him up went to the door and deposited him outside during her momentary absence lady racial had time to touch the dead mans forehead with her lips unseen chapter iii the daughters of the shears three daughters and a son were left to the world by mr melchisedec love well endowed had already claimed to provide for the daughters first in the shape of a lean marine subaltern whose days of obscuration had now passed and who had come to be a major of that corps secondly presenting his addresses as a brewer of distinction thirdly and for a climax as a portuguese count no other than the senor silva diaz conde de saldar and this match did seem a far more resplendent one than that of the two elder sisters with major strike and mr andrew cogglesby but the rays of neither fell visibly on lymport these escaped eurydices never reappeared after being once fairly caught away from the gloomy realms of dis otherwise trade all three persons of singular beauty a certain refinement some port and some presence hereditarily combined they feared the clutch of that fell king and performed the widest possible circles around him not one of them ever approached the house of her parents they were dutiful and loving children and wrote frequently but of course they had to consider their new position and their husbands and their husbands families and the world and what it would say if to it the dreaded rumour should penetrate lymport gossips as numerous as in other parts declared that the foreign nobleman would rave in an extraordinary manner and do things after the outlandish fashion of his country for from him there was no doubt the shop had been most successfully veiled and he knew not of plutos close relationship to his lovely spouse the marriages had happened in this way balls are given in country towns where the graces of tradesmens daughters may be witnessed and admired at leisure by other than tradesmen by occasional country gentlemen of the neighbourhood with light minds and also by small officers subalterns wishing to do tender execution upon mans fair enemy and to find a distraction for their legs the classes of our social fabric have here and there slight connecting links and provincial public balls are one of these they are dangerous for cupid is no respecter of class prejudice and if you are the son of a retired tea merchant or of a village doctor or of a half pay captain or of anything superior and visit one of them you are as likely to receive his shot as any shopboy even masquerading lords at such places have been known to be slain outright and although society allows to its highest and dearest to save the honour of their families and heal their anguish by indecorous compromise you if you are a trifle below that mark must not expect it you must absolutely give yourself for what you hope to get dreadful as it sounds to philosophic ears you must marry this having danced with caroline harrington the gallant lieutenant strike determined to do nor when he became aware of her fathers occupation did he shrink from his resolve after a months hard courtship he married her straight out of her fathers house that he may have all the credit due to him it must be admitted that he did not once compare or possibly permit himself to reflect on the dissimilarity in their respective ranks and the step he had taken downward till they were man and wife and then not in any great degree before fortune had given him his majority an advance the good soldier frankly told his wife he did not owe to her if we may be permitted to suppose the colonel of a regiment on friendly terms with one of his corporals we have an estimate of the domestic life of major and mrs strike among the garrison males his comrades he passed for a disgustingly jealous brute the ladies in their pretty language signalized him as a finick now having achieved so capital a marriage caroline worthy creature was anxious that her sisters should not be less happy and would have them to visit her in spite of her husbands protests there can be no danger she said for she was in fresh quarters far from the nest of contagion the lieutenant himself ungrudgingly declared that looking on the ladies no one for an instant could suspect and he saw many young fellows ready to be as great fools as he had been another voluntary confession he made to his wife for the candour of which she thanked him and pointed out that it seemed to run in the family inasmuch as mr andrew cogglesby his rich relative had seen and had proposed for harriet the lieutenant flatly said he would never allow it in fact he had hitherto concealed the non presentable portion of his folly very satisfactorily from all save the mess room and mr andrews passion was a severe dilemma to him it need scarcely be told that his wife fortified by the fervid brewer defeated him utterly what was more she induced him to be an accomplice in deception for though the lieutenant protested that he washed his hands of it and that it was a fraud and a snare he certainly did not avow the condition of his wifes parents to mr andrew but alluded to them in passing as the country people he supposed the country people must be asked he said the brewer offered to go down to them but the lieutenant drew an unpleasant picture of the country people and his wife became so grave at the proposal that mr andrew said he wanted to marry the lady and not the country people and if she would have him there he was there he was behaving with a particular and sagacious kindness to the raw lieutenant since harriets arrival if the lieutenant sent her away mr andrew would infallibly pursue her and light on a discovery twice cursed by love twice the victim of tailordom our excellent marine gave away harriet harrington in marriage to mr andrew cogglesby thus joy clapped hands a second time and horror deepened its shadows from higher ground it was natural that the remaining sister should take a bolder flight of the loves of the fair louisa harrington and the foreign count and how she first encountered him in the brewers saloons and how she being a humorous person laughed at his loaf for her and wore the colours that pleased him and kindled and soothed his jealousy little is known beyond the fact that she espoused the count under the auspices of the affluent brewer and engaged that her children should be brought up in the faith of the catholic church which lymport gossips called paying the devil for her pride the three sisters gloriously rescued by their own charms had now to think of their one young brother how to make him a gentleman that was their problem preserve him from tailordomfrom all contact with tradethey must otherwise they would be perpetually linked to the horrid thing they hoped to outlive and bury a cousin of mr melchisedecs had risen to be an admiral and a knight for valiant action in the old war when men could rise him they besought to take charge of the youth and make a distinguished seaman of him he courteously declined they then attacked the married marinenavy or army being quite indifferent to them as long as they could win for their brother the badge of one service when he is a gentleman at once they said like those who see the end of their labours strike basely pretended to second them it would have been delightful to him of course to have the tailors son messing at the same table and claiming him when he pleased with a familiar ah brother and prating of their relationship everywhere strike had been a fool in revenge for it he laid out for himself a masterly career of consequent wisdom the breweruxorious andrew cogglesbymight and would have bought the commission strike laughed at the idea of giving money for what could be got for nothing he told them to wait in the meantime evan a lad of seventeen spent the hours not devoted to his positive professionthat of gentlemanin the offices of the brewery toying with big books and balances which he despised with the combined zeal of the sucking soldier and emancipated tailor two years passed in attendance on the astute brother in law to whom fortune now beckoned to come to her and gather his laurels from the pig tails about the same time the countess sailed over from lisbon on a visit to her sister harriet in reality it was whispered in the cogglesby saloons on a diplomatic mission from the court of lisbon but that could not be made ostensible the countess narrowly examined evan whose steady advance in his profession both her sisters praised yes said the countess in a languid alien accent he has something of his fathers carriagesomething something of his deliveryhis readiness it was a remarkable thing that these ladies thought no man on earth like their father and always cited him as the example of a perfect gentleman and yet they buried him with one mind and each mounted guard over his sepulchre to secure his ghost from an airing he can walk my dears certainly and talka little tte tte i do not say i should think there he would bea stick all you english are but what sort of a bow has he got i ask you how does he enter a room and then his smile his laugh he laughs like a horseabsolutely theres no music in his smile oh you should see a portuguese nobleman smile oh dios honeyed my dears but evan has it not none of you english have you go so the countess pressed a thumb and finger to the sides of her mouth and set her sisters laughing i assure you no better not a bit i faint in your society i ask myselfwhere am i among what boors have i fallen but evan is no worse than the rest of you i acknowledge that if he knew how to dress his shoulders properly and to direct his eyesoh the eyes you should see how a portuguese nobleman can use his eyes soul my dears soul can any of you look the unutterable without being absurd you look so and the countess hung her jaw under heavily vacuous orbits something as a sheep might yawn but i acknowledge that evan is no worse than the rest of you she repeated if he understood at all the management of his eyes and mouth but thats what he cannot possibly learn in englandnot possibly as for your poor husband harriet one really has to remember his excellent qualities to forgive him poor man and that stiff bandbox of a man of yours caroline addressing the wife of the marine he looks as if he were all angles and sections and were taken to pieces every night and put together in the morning he may be a good soldiergood anything you willbut dios to be married to that he is not civilized none of you english are you have no place in the drawing room you are like so many intrusive oxenabsolutely one of your men trod on my toe the other night and what do you think the creature did jerks back then the half of him forwardi thought he was going to break in twothen grins and grunts oh m sure beg pardon m sure i dont know whether he didnt say maam the countess lifted her hands and fell away in laughing horror when her humour or her feelings generally were a little excited she spoke her vernacular as her sisters did but immediately subsided into the deliberate delicately syllabled drawl now that happened to me once at one of our great balls she pursued i had on one side of me the duchesse eugenia de formosa de fontandigua on the other sat the countess de pel a widow and we were talking of the ices that evening eugenia you must know my dears was in love with the count belmaraa i was her sole confidante the countess de pela horrible creature oh she was the duchesss determined enemywould have stabbed her for belmaraa one of the most beautiful men adored by every woman so we talked ices eugenic and myself quite comfortably and that horrible de pel had no idea in life eugenia had just said this ice sickens me i do not taste the flavour of the vanille i answered it is here it mustit cannot but be here you love the flavour of the vanille with her exquisite smile i see her now saying too well it is necessary to me i live on itwhen up he came in his eagerness his foot just effleured my robe oh i never shall forget in an instant he was down on one knee it was so momentary that none saw it but we three and done with ineffable grace pardon he said in his sweet portuguese pardon looking upthe handsomest man i ever beheld and when i think of that odious wretch the other night with his oh m sure beg pardon m sure pon my honour i could have kicked himi could indeed here the countess laughed out but relapsed into alas that belmaraa should have betrayed that beautiful trusting creature to de pel such scandal a duelthe duke was wounded for a whole year eugenia did not dare to appear at court but had to remain immured in her country house where she heard that belmaraa had married de pel it was for her money of course rich as croesus and as wicked as the black man below as dear papa used to say by the way werent we talking of evan ahyes and so forth the countess was immensely admired and though her sisters said that she was foreignized overmuch they clung to her desperately she seemed so entirely to have eclipsed tailordom or demogorgon as the countess was pleased to call it who could suppose this grand mannered lady with her coroneted anecdotes and delicious breeding the daughter of that thing it was not possible to suppose it it seemed to defy the fact itself they congratulated her on her complete escape from demogorgon the countess smiled on them with a lovely sorrow safe from the whisper my dears the ceaseless dread if you knew what i have to endure i sometimes envy you pon my honour i sometimes wish i had married a fishmonger silva indeed is a most excellent husband polished such polish as you know not of in england he has a waya wriggle with his shoulders in companyi cannot describe it to you so slight so elegant and he is all that a woman could desire but who could be safe in any part of the earth my dears while papa will go about so and behave so extraordinarily i was at dinner at your english embassy a month ago and there was admiral combleman then on the station off lisbon sir jackson racials friend who was the admiral at lymport formerly i knew him at once and thought oh what shall i do my heart was like a lump of lead i would have given worlds that we might one of us have smothered the other i had to sit beside himit always happens thank heaven he did not identify me and then he told an anecdote of papa it was the dreadful old bath story i thought i should have died i could not but fancy the admiral suspected was it not natural and what do you think i had the audacity to do i asked him coolly whether the mr harrington he mentioned was not the son of sir abraham harrington of torquaythe gentleman who lost his yacht in the lisbon waters last year i brought it on myself gentleman maammaam says the horrid old creature laughing gentleman hes a i cannot speak it i choke and then he began praising papa dios what i suffered but you know i can keep my countenance if i perish i am a harrington as much as any of us and the countess looked superb in the pride with which she said she was what she would have given her hand not to be but few feelings are single on this globe and junction of sentiments need not imply unity in our yeasty compositions after it was overmy supplice continued the countess i was questioned by all the ladiesi mean our ladiesnot your english they wanted to know how i could be so civil to that intolerable man i gained a deal of credit my dears i laid it all ondiplomacy the countess laughed bitterly diplomacy bears the burden of it all i pretended that combleman could be useful to silva oh what hypocrites we all are the ladies listening could not gainsay this favourite claim of universal brotherhood among the select who wear masks instead of faces with regard to evan the countess had far outstripped her sisters in her views a gentleman she had discovered must have one of two thingsa title or money he might have all the breeding in the world he might be as good as an angel but without a title or money he was under eclipse almost total on a gentleman the sun must shine now evan had no title no money the clouds were thick above the youth to gain a title he would have to scale aged mountains there was one break in his firmament through which the radiant luminary might be assisted to cast its beams on him still young that divine portal was matrimony if he could but make a rich marriage he would blaze transfigured all would be well and why should not evan marry an heiress as well as another i know a young creature who would exactly suit him said the countess she is related to the embassy and is in lisbon now a charming childjust sixteen dios how the men rave about her and she isnt a beautytheres the wonder and she is a little too gauchetoo english in her habits and ways of thinking likes to be admired of course but doesnt know yet how to set about getting it she rather scandalizes our ladies but when you know hershe will have they say a hundred thousand pounds in her own right rose jocelyn the daughter of sir franks and that eccentric lady jocelyn she is with her uncle melville the celebrated diplomate though to tell you the truth we turn him round our fingers and spin him as the boys used to do the cockchafers i cannot forget our old fallowfield school life you see my dears well rose jocelyn would just suit evan she is just of an age to receive an impression and i would take care she did instance me a case where i have failed or there is the portuguese widow the rostral shes thirty certainly but she possesses millions estates all over the kingdom and the sweetest creature but no evan would be out of the way there certainly butour women are very nice they have the dearest sweetest ways but i would rather evan did not marry one of them and then theres the religion this was a sore of the countesss own and she dropped a tear in coming across it no my dears it shall be rose jocelyn she concluded i will take evan over with me and see that he has opportunities it shall be rose and then i can call her mine for in verity i love the child it is not my part to dispute the countesss love for miss jocelyn and i have only to add that evan unaware of the soft training he was to undergo and the brilliant chance in store for him offered no impediment to the proposition that he should journey to portugal with his sister whose subtlest flattery was to tell him that she should not be ashamed to own him there and ultimately furnished with cash for the trip by the remonstrating brewer went so these parcae daughters of the shears arranged and settled the young mans fate his task was to learn the management of his mouth how to dress his shoulders properly and to direct his eyesrare qualities in man or woman i assure you the management of the mouth being especially admirable and correspondingly difficult these achieved he was to place his battery in position and win the heart and hand of an heiress our comedy opens with his return from portugal in company with miss rose the heiress the honourable melville jocelyn the diplomate and the count and countess de saldar refugees out of that explosive little kingdom chapter iv on board the jocasta from the tagus to the thames the government sloop of war jocasta had made a prosperous voyage bearing that precious freight a removed diplomatist and his family for whose uses let a sufficient vindication be found in the exercise he affords our crews in the science of seamanship she entered our noble river somewhat early on a fine july morning early as it was two young people who had nothing to do with the trimming or guiding of the vessel stood on deck and watched the double shore beginning to embrace them more and more closely as they sailed onward one a young lady very young in manner wore a black felt hat with a floating scarlet feather and was clad about the shoulders in a mantle of foreign style and pattern the other you might have taken for a wandering don were such an object ever known so simply he assumed the dusky sombrero and dangling cloak of which one fold was flung across his breast and drooped behind him the line of an adolescent dark moustache ran along his lip and only at intervals could you see that his eyes were blue and of the land he was nearing for the youth was meditative and held his head much down the young lady on the contrary permitted an open inspection of her countenance and seemed for the moment at least to be neither caring nor thinking of what kind of judgement would be passed on her her pretty nose was up sniffing the still salt breeze with vivacious delight oh she cried clapping her hands there goes a dear old english gull how i have wished to see him i havent seen one for two years and seven months when im at home ill leave my window open all night just to hear the rooks when they wake in the morning there goes another she tossed up her nose again exclaiming im sure i smell england nearer and nearer i smell the fields and the cows in them id have given anything to be a dairy maid for half an hour i used to lie and pant in that stifling air among those stupid people and wonder why anybody ever left england arent you glad to come back this time the fair speaker lent her eyes to the question and shut her lips sweet cold chaste lips she had a mouth that had not yet dreamed of kisses and most honest eyes the young man felt that they were not to be satisfied by his own and after seeking to fill them with a doleful look which was immediately succeeded by one of superhuman indifference he answered yes we shall soon have to part and commenced tapping with his foot the cheerful martyrs march speech that has to be hauled from the depths usually betrays the effort listening an instant to catch the import of this cavernous gasp upon the brink of sound the girl said part what do you mean apparently it required a yet vaster effort to pronounce an explanation the doleful look the superhuman indifference were repeated in due order sound a little more distinct uttered the words we cannot be as we have been in england and then the cheerful martyr took a few steps farther why you dont mean to say youre going to give me up and not be friends with me because weve come back to england cried the girl in a rapid breath eyeing him seriously most conscientiously he did not mean it but he replied with the quietest negative no she mimicked him why do you say no like that why are you so mysterious evan wont you promise me to come and stop with us for weeks havent you said we would ride and hunt and fish together and read books and do all sorts of things he replied with the quietest affirmative yes what does yes mean she lifted her chest to shake out the dead alive monosyllable as he had done why are you so singular this morning evan have i offended you you are so touchy the slur on his reputation for sensitiveness induced the young man to attempt being more explicit i mean he said hesitating why we must part we shall not see each other every day nothing more than that and away went the cheerful martyr in sublimest mood oh and that makes you sorry a shade of archness was in her voice the girl waited as if to collect something in her mind and was now a patronizing woman why you dear sentimental boy you dont suppose we could see each other every day for ever it was perhaps the cruelest question that could have been addressed to the sentimental boy from her mouth but he was a cheerful martyr you dear don doloroso she resumed i declare if you are not just like those young portugals this morning and over there you were such a dear english fellow and thats why i liked you so much do change do please be lively and yourself again or mind ill call you don doloroso and that shall be your name in england see therethatsthats whats the name of that place hoy mr skerne she hailed the boatswain passing do tell me the name of that place mr skerne righted about to satisfy her minutely and then coming up to evan he touched his hat and said i maynt have another opportunitywe shall be busy up thereof thankin you again sir for what you did for my poor drunken brother bill and you may take my word i wont forget it sir if he does and i suppose hell be drowning his memory just as he was near drowning himself evan muttered something grimaced civilly and turned away the girls observant brows were moved to a faintly critical frown and nodding intelligently to the boatswains remark that the young gentleman did not seem quite himself now that he was nearing home she went up to evan and said im going to give you a lesson in manners to be quits with you listen sir why did you turn away so ungraciously from mr skerne while he was thanking you for having saved his brothers life now theres where youre too english cant you bear to be thanked i dont want to be thanked because i can swim said evan but it is not that oh how you trifle she cried theres nothing vexes me so much as that way you have wouldnt my eyes have sparkled if anybody had come up to me to thank me for such a thing i would let them know how glad i was to have done such a thing doesnt it make them happier dear evan my dear miss jocelyn what the honest grey eyes fixed on him narrowed their enlarged lids she gazed before her on the deck saying im sure i cant understand you i suppose its because im a girl and i never shall till im a woman heigho a youth who is engaged in the occupation of eating his heart cannot shine to advantage and is as much a burden to himself as he is an enigma to others evan felt this but he could do nothing and say nothing so he retired deeper into the folds of the don and remained picturesque and scarcely pleasant they were relieved by a summons to breakfast from below she brightened and laughed now what will you wager me evan that the countess doesnt begin sweet child how does she this morning blooming when she kisses me her capital imitation of his sisters manner constrained him to join in her laugh and he said ill back against that i get three fingers from your uncle and morrow young sir down they ran together laughing and sure enough the identical words of the respective greetings were employed which they had to enjoy with all the discretion they could muster rose went round the table to her little cousin alec aged seven kissed his reluctant cheek and sat beside him announcing a sea appetite and great capabilities while evan silently broke bread the count de saldar a diminutive tawny man just a head and neck above the tablecloth sat sipping chocolate and fingering dry toast which he would now and then dip in jelly and suck with placidity in the intervals of a curt exchange of french with the wife of the hon melville a ringleted english lady or of portuguese with the countess who likewise sipped chocolate and fingered dry toast and was mournfully melodious the hon melville as became a tall islander carved beef and ate of it like a ruler of men beautiful to see was the compassionate sympathy of the countesss face when rose offered her plate for a portion of the world subjugating viand as who should say sweet child thou knowest not yet of sorrows thou canst ballast thy stomach with beef in any other than an heiress she would probably have thought this is indeed a disgusting little animal and most unfeminine conduct rose unconscious of praise or blame rivalled her uncle in enjoyment of the fare and talked of her delight in seeing england again and anything that belonged to her native land mrs melville perceived that it pained the refugee countess and gave her the glance intelligible but the countess never missed glances or failed to interpret them she said let her i love to hear the sweet childs prattle it was fortunate she addressed the diplomatist that we touched at southampton and procured fresh provision very lucky for us said he glaring shrewdly between a mouthful the count heard the word southampton and wished to know how it was comprised a passage of portuguese ensued and then the countess said silva you know desired to relinquish the vessel at southampton he does not comprehend the word expense but she shook a dumb alas i must think of that for him now oh always avoid expense said the hon melville accustomed to be paid for by his country at what time shall we arrive may i ask do you think the countess gently inquired the watch of a man who had his eye on time was pulled out and she was told it might be two hours before dark another reckoning keenly balanced informed the company that the days papers could be expected on board somewhere about three oclock in the afternoon and then said the hon melville nodding general gratulation we shall know how the world wags how it had been wagging the countesss straining eyes under closed eyelids were eloquent of too late i fear me to wait upon lord livelyston to night she suggested to night the hon melville gazed blank astonishment at the notion oh certainly too late tonight a hum i think madam you had better not be in too great a hurry to see him repose a little recover your fatigue oh exclaimed the countess with a beam of utter confidence in him i shall be too happy to place myself in your handsbelieve me this was scarcely more to the taste of the diplomatist he put up his mouth and said blandly i fearyou know madam i must warn you beforehandi personally am but an insignificant unit over here you know i personally cant guarantee much assistance to younot positive what i can doof course very happy and he fell to again upon the beef not so very insignificant said the countess smiling as at a softly radiant conception of him have to bob and bow like the rest of them over here he added proof against the flattery but that you will not forsake silva i am convinced said the countess and paying little heed to his brief oh what i can do continued for over here in england we are almost friendless my relationssuch as are left of themare not in high place she turned to mrs melville and renewed the confession with a proud humility truly i have not a distant cousin in the cabinet mrs melville met her sad smile and returned it as one who understood its entire import my brother in lawmy sister i think you knowmarried aa brewer he is rich but well such was her taste my brother in law is indeed in parliament and he very little use seeing he votes with the opposite party the diplomatist interrupted her ah but he will not said the countess serenely i can trust with confidence that if it is for silvas interest he will assuredly so dispose of his influence as to suit the desiderations of his family and not in any way oppose his opinions to the powers that would willingly stoop to serve us it was impossible for the hon melville to withhold a slight grimace at his beef when he heard this extremely alienized idea of the nature of a member of the parliament of great britain he allowed her to enjoy her delusion as she pursued no so much we could offer in repayment it is little but this in verity is a case silvas wrongs have only to be known in england and i am most assured that the english people will not permit it in the days of his prosperity silva was a friend to england and england should notshould notforget it now had we money but of that arm our enemies have deprived us and i fear without it we cannot hope to have the justice of our cause pleaded in the english papers mr redner you know the correspondent in lisbon is a sworn foe to silva and why but because i would not procure him an invitation to court the man was so horridly vulgar his gloves were never clean i had to hold a bouquet to my nose when i talked to him that you say was my fault truly so but what woman can be civil to a low bred pretentious offensive man mrs melville again appealed to smiled perfect sympathy and said to account for his character yes he is the son of a small shopkeeper of some kind in southampton i hear a very good fellow in his way said her husband oh i cant bear that class of people rose exclaimed i always keep out of their way you can always tell them the countess smiled considerate approbation of her exclusiveness and discernment so sweet a smile you were on deck early my dear she asked evan rather abruptly master alec answered for him yes he was and so was rose they made an appointment just as they used to do under the oranges children the countess smiled to mrs melville they always whisper when im by alec appended children the countesss sweetened visage entreated mrs melville to re echo but that lady thought it best for the moment to direct rose to look to her packing now that she had done breakfast and i will take a walk with my brother on deck said the countess silva is too harassed for converse the parties were thus divided the silent count was left to meditate on his wrongs in the saloon and the diplomatist alone with his lady thought fit to say to her shortly perhaps it would be as well to draw away from these people a little weve done as much as we could for them in bringing them over here they may be trying to compromise us that womans absurd shes ashamed of the brewer and yet she wants to sell himor wants us to buy him ha i think she wants us to send a couple of frigates and threaten bombardment of the capital if they dont take her husband back and receive him with honours perhaps it would be as well said mrs melville roses invitation to him goes for nothing rose inviting the count down to hampshire the diplomatists brows were lifted no i mean the other said the diplomatists wife oh the young fellow very good young fellow gentlemanly no harm in him perhaps not said the diplomatists wife you dont suppose he expects us to keep him on or provide for him over hereeh the diplomatists wife informed him that such was not her thought that he did not understand and that it did not matter and as soon as the hon melville saw that she was brooding something essentially feminine and which had no relationship to the great game of public life curiosity was extinguished in him on deck the countess paced with evan and was for a time pleasantly diverted by the admiration she could without looking perceive that her sorrow subdued graces had aroused in the breast of a susceptible naval lieutenant at last she spoke my dear remember this your last word to mr jocelyn will be i will do myself the honour to call upon my benefactor early to rose you will say be assured miss jocelyn miss jocelyn i shall not fail in hastening to pay my respects to your family in hampshire you will remember to do it in the exact form i speak it evan laughed what call him benefactor to his face i couldnt do it ah my child besides he isnt a benefactor at all his private secretary died and i stepped in to fill the post because nobody else was handy and tell me of her who pushed you forward evan my dear sister im sure im not ungrateful no but headstrong opinionated now these people will endeavouroh i have seen it in a thousand little thingsthey wish to shake us off now if you will but do as i indicate put your faith in an older head evan it is your only chance of society in england for your brother in lawi ask you what sort of people will you meet at the cogglesbys now and then a nobleman very much out of his element in short you have fed upon a diet which will make you to distinguish and painfully to know the difference indeed yes you are looking about for rose it depends upon your behaviour now whether you are to see her at all in england do you forget you wished once to inform her of your origin think of her words at the breakfast this morning the countess imagined she had produced an impression evan said yes and i should have liked to have told her this morning that im myself nothing more than the son of a stop cried his sister glancing about in horror the admiring lieutenant met her eye blandishingly she smiled on him most beautiful weather for a welcome to dear england and passed with majesty boy she resumed are you mad i hate being such a hypocrite madam then you do not love her evan this may have been dubious logic but it resulted from a clear sequence of ideas in the ladys head evan did not contest it and assuredly you will lose her evan think of my troubles i have to intrigue for silva i look to your future i smile oh heaven how do i not smile when things are spoken that pierce my heart this morning at the breakfast evan took her hand and patted it what is your pity she sighed if it had not been for you my dear sister i should never have held my tongue you are not a harrington you are a dawley she exclaimed indignantly evan received the accusation of possessing more of his mothers spirit than his fathers in silence you would not have held your tongue she said with fervid severity and you would have betrayed yourself and you would have said you were that and you in that costume why goodness gracious could you bear to appear so ridiculous the poor young man involuntarily surveyed his person the pains of an impostor seized him the deplorable image of the don making confession became present to his mind it was a clever stroke of this female intriguer she saw him redden grievously and blink his eyes and not wishing to probe him so that he would feel intolerable disgust at his imprisonment in the don she continued but you have the sense to see your duties evan you have an excellent sense in the main no one would dreamto see you you did not i must say you did not make enough of your gallantry a portuguese who had saved a mans life evan would he have been so boorish you behaved as if it was a matter of course that you should go overboard after anybody in your clothes on a dark night so then the jocelyns took it i barely heard one compliment to you and rosewhat an effect it should have had on her but owing to your manner i do believe the girl thinks it nothing but your ordinary business to go overboard after anybody in your clothes on a dark night pon my honour i believe she expects to see you always dripping the countess uttered a burst of hysterical humour so you miss your credit that inebriated sailor should really have been gold to you be not so young and thoughtless the countess then proceeded to tell him how foolishly he had let slip his great opportunity a portuguese would have fixed the young lady long before by tender moonlight in captivating language beneath the umbrageous orange groves a portuguese would have accurately calculated the effect of the perfume of the blossom on her sensitive nostrils and know the exact moment when to kneel and declare his passion sonorously yes said evan one of them did she told me she told you and youwhat did you do laughed at him with her to be sure laughed at him she told you and you helped her to laugh at love have you no perceptions why did she tell you because she thought him such a fool i suppose you never will know a woman said the countess with contempt much of his worldly sister at a time was more than evan could bear accustomed to the symptoms of restiveness she finished her discourse enjoyed a quiet parade up and down under the gaze of the lieutenant and could find leisure to note whether she at all struck the inferior seamen even while her mind was absorbed by the multiform troubles and anxieties for which she took such innocent indemnification the appearance of the hon melville jocelyn on deck and without his wife recalled her to business it is a peculiarity of female diplomatists that they fear none save their own sex men they regard as their natural prey in women they see rival hunters using their own weapons the countess smiled a slowly kindling smile up to him set her brother adrift and delicately linked herself to evans benefactor i have been thinking she said knowing your kind and most considerate attentions that we may compromise you in england he at once assured her he hoped not he thought not at all the idea is due to my brother she went on for iwomen know so littleand most guiltlessly should we have done so my brother perhaps does not think of us foremost but his argument i can distinguish i can see that were you openly to plead silvas cause you might bring yourself into odium mr jocelyn and heaven knows i would not that may i then ask that in england we may be simply upon the same footing of private friendship the diplomatist looked into her uplifted visage that had all the sugary sparkles of a crystallized preserved fruit of the portugal clime and observed confidentially that with every willingness in the world to serve her he did think it would possibly be better for a time to be upon that footing apart from political considerations i was very sure my brother would apprehend your views said the countess he poor boy his career is closed he must sink into a different sphere he will greatly miss the intercourse with you and your sweet family further relieved the diplomatist delivered a high opinion of the young gentleman his abilities and his conduct and trusted he should see him frequently by an apparent sacrifice the lady thus obtained what she wanted near the hour speculated on by the diplomatist the papers came on board and he unaware how he had been manoeuvred for lack of a wife at his elbow was quickly engaged in appeasing the great british hunger for news second only to that for beef it seems and equally acceptable salted when it cannot be had fresh leaving the devotee of statecraft with his legs crossed and his face wearing the cognizant air of one whose head is above the waters of events to enjoy the mighty meal of fresh and salted at discretion the countess dived below meantime the jocasta as smoothly as before she was ignorant of how the world wagged slipped up the river with the tide and the sun hung red behind the forest of masts burnishing a broad length of the serpentine haven of the nations of the earth a young englishman returning home can hardly look on this scene without some pride of kinship evan stood at the fore part of the vessel rose in quiet english attire had escaped from her aunt to join him singing in his ears to spur his senses isnt it beautiful isnt it beautiful dear old england what do you find so beautiful he asked oh you dull fellow why the ships and the houses and the smoke to be sure the ships why i thought you despised trade mademoiselle and so i do that is not trade but tradesmen of course i mean shopkeepers its they who send the ships to and fro and make the picture that pleases you nevertheless do they said she indifferently and then with a sort of fervour why do you always grow so cold to me whenever we get on this subject i cold evan responded the incessant fears of his diplomatic sister had succeeded in making him painfully jealous of this subject he turned it off why our feelings are just the same do you know what i was thinking when you came up i was thinking that i hoped i might never disgrace the name of an englishman now thats noble cried the girl and im sure you never will of an english gentleman evan i like that better would you rather be called a true english lady than a true english woman rose dont think i would my dear she answered pertly but gentleman always means more than man to me and whats a gentleman mademoiselle cant tell you don doloroso something you are sir she added surveying him evan sucked the bitter and the sweet of her explanation his sister in her anxiety to put him on his guard had not beguiled him to forget his real state his sister the diplomatist and his lady the refugee count with ladies maids servants and luggage were now on the main deck and master alec who was as good as a newspaper correspondent for private conversations put an end to the colloquy of the young people they were all assembled in a circle when the vessel came to her moorings the diplomatist glutted with news and thirsting for confirmations the count dumb courteous and quick eyed the honourable lady complacent in the consciousness of boxes well packed the countess breathing mellifluous long drawn adieux that should provoke invitations evan and rose regarded each other the boat to convey them on shore was being lowered and they were preparing to move forward just then the vessel was boarded by a stranger is that one of the creatures of your customs i did imagine we were safe from them exclaimed the countess the diplomatist laughingly requested her to save herself anxiety on that score while under his wing but she had drawn attention to the intruder who was seen addressing one of the midshipmen he was a man in a long brown coat and loose white neckcloth spectacles on nose which he wore considerably below the bridge and peered over as if their main use were to sight his eye a beaver hat with broadish brim on his head a man of no station it was evident to the ladies at once and they would have taken no further notice of him had he not been seen stepping toward them in the rear of the young midshipman the latter came to evan and said a fellow of the name of goren wants you says theres something the matter at home evan advanced and bowed stiffly mr goren held out his hand you dont remember me young man i cut out your first suit for you when you were breeched though yes ah your poor father wouldnt put his hand to it goren embarrassed and not quite alive to the chapter of facts this name should have opened to him evan bowed again goren continued the possessor of the name he had a cracked voice that when he spoke a word of two syllables commenced with a lugubrious crow and ended in what one might have taken for a curious question it is a bad business brings me young man im not the best messenger for such tidings its a black suit young man its your father the diplomatist and his lady gradually edged back but rose remained beside the countess who breathed quick and seemed to have lost her self command thinking he was apprehended mr goren said im going down to night to take care of the shop hes to be buried in his old uniform you had better come with me by the night coach if you would see the last of him young man breaking an odd pause that had fallen the countess cried aloud suddenly in his uniform mr goren felt his arm seized and his legs hurrying him some paces into isolation thanks thanks was murmured in his ear not a word more evan cannot bear it oh you are good to have come and we are grateful my father my father she had to tighten her hand and wrist against her bosom to keep herself up she had to reckon in a glance how much rose had heard or divined she had to mark whether the count had understood a syllable she had to whisper to evan to hasten away with the horrible man she had to enliven his stunned senses and calm her own and with mournful images of her father in her brain the female spartan had to turn to rose and speculate on the girls reflective brows while she said as over a distant relative sadly but without distraction a death in the family and preserved herself from weeping her heart out that none might guess the thing who did not positively know it evan touched the hand of rose without meeting her eyes he was soon cast off in mr gorens boat then the countess murmured final adieux twilight under her lids but yet a smile stately affectionate almost genial rose her sweet rose she must kiss she could have slapped rose for appearing so reserved and cold she hugged rose as to hug oblivion of the last few minutes into her the girl leant her cheek and bore the embrace looking on her with a kind of wonder only when alone with the count in the brewers carriage awaiting her on shore did the lady give a natural course to her grief well knowing that her silva would attribute it to the darkness of their common exile she wept but in the excess of her misery two words of strangely opposite signification pronounced by mr goren two words that were at once poison and antidote sang in her brain two words that painted her dead father from head to foot his nature and his fortune these were the shop and the uniform oh what would she not have given to have seen and bestowed on her beloved father one last kiss oh how she hoped that her inspired echo of uniform on board the jocasta had drowned the memory eclipsed the meaning of that fatal utterance of shop chapter v the family and the funeral it was the evening of the second day since the arrival of the black letter in london from lymport and the wife of the brewer and the wife of the major sat dropping tears into one anothers laps in expectation of their sister the countess mr andrew cogglesby had not yet returned from his office the gallant major had gone forth to dine with general sir george frebuter the head of the marines of his time it would have been difficult for the major he informed his wife to send in an excuse to the general for non attendance without entering into particulars and that he should tell the general he could not dine with him because of the sudden decease of a tailor was as he let his wife understand and requested her to perceive quite out of the question so he dressed himself carefully and though peremptory with his wife concerning his linen and requiring natural services from her in the button department and a casual expression of contentment as to his ultimate make up he left her that day without any final injunctions to occupy her mind and she was at liberty to weep if she pleased a privilege she did not enjoy undisturbed when he was present for the warrior hated that weakness and did not care to hide his contempt for it of the three sisters the wife of the major was oddly enough the one who was least inveterately solicitous of concealing the fact of her parentage reticence of course she had to study with the rest the major was a walking book of reticence and the observances he professed also in company with herself alone to have had much trouble in drilling her to mark and properly preserve them she had no desire to speak of her birthplace but for some reason or other she did not share her heros rather petulant anxiety to keep the curtain nailed down on that part of her life which preceded her entry into the ranks of the royal marines some might have thought that those fair large blue eyes of hers wandered now and then in pleasant unambitious walks behind the curtain and toyed with little flowers of palest memory utterly tasteless totally wanting in discernment not to say gratitude the major could not presume her to be and yet his wits perceived that her answers and the conduct she shaped in accordance with his repeated protests and long reaching apprehensions of what he called danger betrayed acquiescent obedience more than the connubial sympathy due to him danger on the field the major knew not of he did not scruple to name the word in relation to his wife for as he told her should he some day as in the chapter of accidents might occur sally into the street a knight companion of the bath and become known to men as sir maxwell strike it would be decidedly disagreeable for him to be blown upon by a wind from lymport moreover she was the mother of a son the major pointed out to her the duty she owed her offspring certainly the protecting aegis of his rank and title would be over the lad but she might depend upon it any indiscretion of hers would damage him in his future career the major assured her young maxwell must be considered for all this the mother and wife when the black letter found them in the morning at breakfast had burst into a fit of grief and faltered that she wept for a father mrs andrew to whom the letter was addressed had simply held the letter to her in a trembling hand the major compared their behaviour with marked encomiums of mrs andrew now this lady and her husband were in obverse relative positions the brewer had no will but his harriets his esteem for her combined the constitutional feelings of an insignificantly built little man for a majestic woman and those of a worthy soul for the wife of his bosom possessing or possessed by her the good brewer was perfectly happy she it might be thought under these circumstances would not have minded much his hearing what he might hear it happened however that she was as jealous of the winds of lymport as the major himself as vigilant in debarring them from access to the brewery as now the countess could have been we are not dissecting human nature suffice it therefore from a mere glance at the surface to say that just as moneyed men are careful of their coin women who have all the advantages in a conjunction are miserly in keeping them and shudder to think that one thing remains hidden which the world they move in might put down pityingly in favour of their spouse even though to the little man twere naught she assumed that a revelation would diminish her moral stature and certainly it would not increase that of her husband so no good could come of it besides andrew knew his whole conduct was a tacit admission that she had condescended in giving him her hand the features of their union might not be changed altogether by a revelation but it would be a shock to her consequently harriet tenderly rebuked caroline for her outcry at the breakfast table and caroline the elder sister who had not since marriage grown in so free an air excused herself humbly and the two were weeping when the countess joined them and related what she had just undergone hearing of carolines misdemeanour however louisas eyes rolled aloft in a paroxysm of tribulation it was nothing to caroline it was comparatively nothing to harriet but the count knew not louisa had a father believed that her parents had long ago been wiped out and the count was by nature inquisitive and if he once cherished a suspicion he was restless he was pointed in his inquiries he was pertinacious in following out a clue there never would be peace with him and then as they were secure in their privacy louisa cried aloud for her father her beloved father harriet wept silently caroline alone expressed regret that she had not set eyes on him from the day she became a wife how could we dear the countess pathetically asked under drowning lids papa did not wish it sobbed mrs andrew i never shall forgive myself said the wife of the major drying her cheeks perhaps it was not herself whom she felt she never could forgive ah the man their father was incomparable melchisedec he might well be called so generous so lordly when the rain of tears would subside for a moment one would relate an anecdote or childish reminiscence of him and provoke a more violent outburst never among the nobles of any land never have i seen one like him exclaimed the countess and immediately requested harriet to tell her how it would be possible to stop andrews tongue in silvas presence at present you know my dear they may talk as much as they likethey cant understand one another one bit mrs cogglesby comforted her by the assurance that andrew had received an intimation of her wish for silence everywhere and toward everybody and that he might be reckoned upon to respect it without demanding a reason for the restriction in other days caroline and louisa had a little looked down on harriets alliance with a dumpy mana brewerand had always kind christian compassion for him if his name were mentioned they seemed now by their silence to have a happier estimate of andrews qualities while the three sisters sat mingling their sorrows and alarms their young brother was making his way to the house as he knocked at the door he heard his name pronounced behind him and had no difficulty in recognizing the worthy brewer what van my boy how are you quite a foreigner by george what a hat mr andrew bounced back two or three steps to regard the dusky sombrero how do you do sir said evan sir to you mr andrew briskly replied dont they teach you to give your fist in portugal eh ill sir you wait till im sir andrew and then sir away you do speak english still van eh quite jolly my boy mr andrew rubbed his hands to express that state in himself suddenly he stopped blinked queerly at evan grew pensive and said bless my soul i forgot the door opened mr andrew took evans arm murmured a hush and trod gently along the passage to his library were safe here he said theretheres something the matter up stairs the women are upset about something harriet mr andrew hesitated and branched off youve heard weve got a new baby evan congratulated him but another inquiry was in mr andrews aspect and evans calm sad manner answered it yesmr andrew shook his head dolefullya splendid little chap a rare little chap a we cant help these things van they will happen sit down my boy mr andrew again interrogated evan with his eyes my father is dead said evan yes mr andrew nodded and glanced quickly at the ceiling as if to make sure that none listened overhead my parliamentary duties will soon be over for the season he added aloud pursuing in an under breath going down to night van he is to be buried to morrow said evan then of course you go yes quite right love your father and mother always love your father and mother old tom and i never knew ours toms quite well same as ever ill he rang the bell have my chop in here with you you must try and eat a bit van here we are and there we go old toms wandering for one of his weeks youll see him some day he aint like me no dinner to day i suppose charles this was addressed to the footman he announced dinner to day at half past six as usual sir bowed and retired mr andrew pored on the floor and rubbed his hair back on his head an odd world was his remark evan lifted up his face to sigh im almost sick of it damn appearances cried mr andrew jumping on his legs the action cooled him im sorry i swore he said bad habit the majors hereyou know that and he assumed the majors voice and strutted in imitation of the stalwart marine majorastrike of the royal marines returned from china covered with glorya hero van we cant expect him to be much of a mourner and we shant have him to dine with us to daythats something he sank his voice i hope the widowll bear it i hope to god my mother is well evan groaned thatll do said mr andrew dont say any more as he spoke he clapped evan kindly on the back a message was brought from the ladies requiring evan to wait on them he returned after some minutes how do you think harriets looking asked mr andrew and not waiting for an answer whispered are they going down to the funeral my boy evans brow was dark as he replied they are not decided wont harriet go she is not goingshe thinks not and the countesslouisas upstairs ehwill she go she cannot leave the countshe thinks not wont caroline go caroline can go shehei meancaroline can go the major objects she wishes to mr andrew struck out his arm and uttered the majora compromise for a loud anathema but the compromise was vain for he sinned again in an explosion against appearances im a brewer van do you think im ashamed of it not while i brew good beer my boynot while i brew good beer they dont think worse of me in the house for it it isnt ungentlemanly to brew good beer van but whats the use of talking mr andrew sat down and murmured poor girl poor girl the allusion was to his wife for presently he said i cant see why harriet cant go whats to prevent her evan gazed at him steadily deaths levelling influence was in evans mind he was ready to say why and fully mr andrew arrested him with a sharp never mind harriet does as she likes im accustomed tohem what she does is best after all she doesnt interfere with my business nor i with hers man and wife pausing a moment or so mr andrew intimated that they had better be dressing for dinner with his hand on the door which he kept closed he said in a businesslike way you know van as for me i should be very willingonly too happyto go down and pay all the respect i could he became confused and shot his head from side to side looking anywhere but at evan happy now and to morrow to do anything in my power if harrietfollow the funeralone of the familyanything i could do butawed better be dressing for dinner and out the enigmatic little man went evan partly divined him then but at dinner his behaviour was perplexing he was too cheerful he pledged the count he would have the portuguese for this and that and make anglican efforts to repeat it and laugh at his failures he would not see that there was a father dead at a table of actors mr andrew overdid his part and was the worst his wife could not help thinking him a heartless little man the poor show had its term the ladies fled to the boudoir sacred to grief evan was whispered that he was to join them when he might without seeming mysterious to the count before he reached them they had talked tearfully over the clothes he should wear at lymport agreeing that his present foreign apparel being black would be suitable and would serve almost as disguise to the inhabitants at large and as evan had no english wear and there was no time to procure any for him that was well they arranged exactly how long he should stay at lymport whom he should visit the manner he should adopt toward the different inhabitants by all means he was to avoid the approach of the gentry for hours evan in a trance half stupefied had to listen to the countesss directions how he was to comport himself in lymport show that you have descended among them dear van but are not of them our beautiful noble english poet expresses it so you have come to pay the last mortal duties which they will respect if they are not brutes and attempt no familiarities allow none gently but firmly imitate silva you remember at dona risbondas ball when he met the comte de dartigues and knew he was to be in disgrace with his court on the morrow oh the exquisite shade of difference in silvas behaviour towards the comte so finely delicately perceptible to the comte and not a soul saw it but that wretched frenchman he came to me madame he said is a question permitted i replied as many as you please m le comte but no answers promised he said may i ask if the courier has yet come innay m le comte i replied this is diplomacy inquire of me or better give me an opinion on the new glac silk from parismadame said he bowing i hope paris may send me aught so good or that i shall grace half so well i smiled you shall not be single in your hopes m le comte the gift would be base that you did not embellish he lifted his hands french fashion madame it is that i have received the giftindeed m le comteeven now from the count de saldar your husband i looked most innocently from my husband m le comtefrom him madame a portrait an ambassador without his coat the portrait was a finished performance i said and may one beg the permission to inspect itmais said he laughing were it you alone it would be a privilege to me i had to check him believe me m le comte that when i look upon it my praise of the artist will be extinguished by my pity for the subject he should have stopped there but you cannot have the last word with a frenchmannot even a woman fortunately the queen just then made her entry into the saloon and his mot on the charity of our sex was lost we bowed mutually and were separated the countess employed her handkerchief yes dear van that is how you should behave imply things with dearest mama of course you are the dutiful son alas you must stand for son and daughters mama has so much sense she will understand how sadly we are placed but in a week i will come to her for a day and bring you back so much his sister louisa his sister harriet offered him her house for a home in london thence to project his new career his sister caroline sought a word with him in private but only to weep bitterly in his arms and utter a faint moan of regret at marriages in general he loved this beautiful creature the best of his three sisters partly it may be because he despised her superior officer and tried with a few smothered words to induce her to accompany him but she only shook her fair locks and moaned afresh mr andrew in the farewell squeeze of the hand at the street door asked him if he wanted anything he negatived the requirement of anything whatever with an air of careless decision though he was aware that his purse barely contained more than would take him the distance but the instincts of this amateur gentleman were very fine and sensitive on questions of money his family had never known him beg for a shilling or admit his necessity for a penny nor could he be made to accept money unless it was thrust into his pocket somehow his sisters had forgotten this peculiarity of his harriet only remembered it when too late but i dare say andrew has supplied him she said andrew being interrogated informed her what had passed between them and you think a harrington would confess he wanted money was her scornful exclamation evan would walkhe would die rather it was treating him like a mendicant andrew had to shrink in his brewers skin by some fatality all who were doomed to sit and listen to the countess de saldar were sure to be behindhand in an appointment when the young man arrived at the coach office he was politely informed that the vehicle in which a seat had been secured for him was in close alliance with time and tide and being under the same rigid laws could not possibly have waited for him albeit it had stretched a point to the extent of a pair of minutes at the urgent solicitation of a passenger a gentleman who speaks so sir said a volunteer mimic of the office crowing and questioning from his throat in gorens manner yok yok that was how he spoke sir evan reddened for it brought the scene on board the jocasta vividly to his mind the heavier business obliterated it he took counsel with the clerks of the office and eventually the volunteer mimic conducted him to certain livery stables where evan like one accustomed to command ordered a chariot to pursue the coach received a touch of the hat for a lordly fee and was soon rolling out of london chapter vi my gentleman on the road the postillion had every reason to believe that he carried a real gentleman behind him in other words a purse long and liberal he judged by all the points he knew of a firm voice a brief commanding style an apparent indifference to expense and the inexplicable minor characteristics such as polished boots and a striking wristband and so forth which will show a creature accustomed to step over the heads of men he had therefore no particular anxiety to part company and jogged easily on the white highway beneath a moon that walked high and small over marble clouds evan reclined in the chariot revolving his sensations in another mood he would have called them thoughts perhaps and marvelled at their immensity the theme was love and death one might have supposed from his occasional mutterings at the pace regulated by the postillion that he was burning with anxiety to catch the flying coach he had forgotten it forgotten that he was giving chase to anything a pair of wondering feminine eyes pursued him and made him fret for the miles to throw a thicker veil between him and them the serious level brows of rose haunted the poor youth and reflecting whither he was tending and to what sight he had shadowy touches of the holiness there is in death from which came a conflict between the imaged phantoms of his father and of rose and he sided against his love with some bitterness his sisters weeping for their father and holding aloof from his ashes evan swept from his mind he called up the man his father was the kindliness the readiness the gallant gaiety of the great mel youths are fascinated by the barbarian virtues and to evan under present influences his father was a pattern of manhood he asked himself was it infamous to earn ones bread and answered it very strongly in his fathers favour the great mels creditors were not by to show him another feature of the case hitherto in passive obedience to the indoctrination of the countess evan had looked on tailors as the proscribed race of modern society he had pitied his father as a man superior to his fate but despite the fitfully honest promptings with rose tempting to him because of the wondrous chivalry they argued and at bottom false probably as the hypocrisy they affected to combat he had been by no means sorry that the world saw not the spot on himself other sensations beset him now since such a man was banned by the world which was to be despised the clear result of evans solitary musing was to cast a sort of halo over tailordom death stood over the pale dead man his father and dared the world to sneer at him by a singular caprice of fancy evan had no sooner grasped this image than it was suggested that he might as well inspect his purse and see how much money he was master of are you impatient with this young man he has little character for the moment most youths are like popes women they have no character at all and indeed a character that does not wait for circumstances to shape it is of small worth in the race that must be run to be set too early is to take the work out of the hands of the sculptor who fashions men happily a youth is always at school and if he was shut up and without mark two or three hours ago he will have something to show you now as i have seen blooming seaflowers and other graduated organisms when left undisturbed to their own action where the fates have designed that he shall present his figure in a story this is sure to happen to the postillion evan was indebted for one of his first lessons about an hour after midnight pastoral stillness and the moon begat in the postillion desire for a pipe daylight prohibits the dream of it to mounted postillions at night the question is more human and allows appeal the moon smiles assentingly and smokers know that she really lends herself to the enjoyment of tobacco the postillion could remember gentlemen who did not object who had even given him cigars turning round to see if haply the present inmate of the chariot might be smoking he observed a head extended from the window how far are we was inquired the postillion numbered the milestones passed do you see anything of the coach cant say as i do sir he was commanded to stop evan jumped out i dont think ill take you any farther he said the postillion laughed to scorn the notion of his caring how far he went with a pipe in his mouth he insinuatingly remarked he could jog on all night and throw sleep to the dogs fresh horses at hillford fresh at fallowfield and the gentleman himself would reach lymport fresh in the morning no no i wont take you any farther evan repeated but what do it matter sir urged the postillion id rather go on as i am iamade no arrangement to take you the whole way oh cried the postillion dont you go troublin yourself about that sir master knows its touch and go about catchin the coach im all right so infatuated was the fellow in the belief that he was dealing with a perfect gentlemanan easy pocket now you would not suppose that one who presumes he has sufficient would find a difficulty in asking how much he has to pay with an effort indifferently masked evan blurted by the way tell mehow muchwhat is the charge for the distance weve come there are gentlemen screws there are conscientious gentlemen they calculate and remonstrating or not they pay the postillion would rather have had to do with the gentleman royal who is above base computation but he knew the humanity in the class he served and with his conception of evan only partially dimmed he remarked oh h h that wont hurt you sir jump along insettle that by and by but when my gentleman stood fast and renewed the demand to know the exact charge for the distance already traversed the postillion dismounted glanced him over and speculated with his fingers tipping up his hat meantime evan drew out his purse a long one certainly but limp out of this drowned looking wretch the last spark of life was taken by the sum the postillion ventured to name and if paying your utmost farthing without examination of the charge and cheerfully stepping out to walk fifty miles penniless constituted a postillions gentleman evan would have passed the test the sight of poverty however provokes familiar feelings in poor men if you have not had occasion to show them you possess particular qualities the postillions eye was more on the purse than on the sum it surrendered there said evan i shall walk good night and he flung his cloak to step forward stop a bit sir arrested him the postillion rallied up sideways with an assumption of genial respect i didnt calclate myself in that there amount were these words think you of a character to strike a young man hard on the breast send the blood to his head and set up in his heart a derisive chorus my gentleman could pay his money and keep his footing gallantly but to be asked for a penny beyond what he possessed to be seen beggared and to be claimed a debtor aleck pride was the one developed faculty of evans nature the fates who mould us always work from the main spring i will not say that the postillion stripped off the mask for him at that instant completely but he gave him the first true glimpse of his condition from the vague sense of being an impostor evan awoke to the clear fact that he was likewise a fool it was impossible for him to deny the mans claim and he would not have done it if he could acceding tacitly he squeezed the ends of his purse in his pocket and with a let me see tried his waistcoat not too impetuously for he was careful of betraying the horrid emptiness till he was certain that the powers who wait on gentlemen had utterly forsaken him they had not he discovered a small coin under ordinary circumstances not contemptible but he did not stay to reflect and was guilty of the error of offering it to the postillion the latter peered at it in the centre of his palm gazed queerly in the gentlemans face and then lifting the spit of silver for the disdain of his mistress the moon he drew a long breath of regret at the original mistake he had committed and said thats what youre goin to give me for my nights work the powers who wait on gentlemen had only helped the pretending youth to try him a rejection of the demand would have been infinitely wiser and better than this paltry compromise the postillion would have fought it he would not have despised his fare how much it cost the poor pretender to reply its the last farthing i have my man the postillion could not know a scabby sixpence the postillion continued his question you heard what i said evan remarked the postillion drew another deep breath and holding out the coin at arms length well sir he observed as one whom mental conflict has brought to the philosophy of the case now was we to change places i couldnt a done it i couldnt a done it he reiterated pausing emphatically take it sir he magnanimously resumed take it you rides when you can and you walks when you must lord forbid i should rob such a gentleman as you one who feels a death is for the hour lifted above the satire of postillions a good genius prompted evan to avoid the silly squabble that might have ensued and made him ridiculous he took the money quietly saying thank you not to lose his vantage the postillion though a little staggered by the move rejoined dont mention it evan then said good night my man i wont wish for your sake that we changed places you would have to walk fifty miles to be in time for your fathers funeral good night you are it to look at was the postillions comment seeing my gentleman depart with great strides he did not speak offensively rather it seemed to appease his conscience for the original mistake he had committed for subsequently came my oath on it i dont get took in again by a squash hat in a hurry unaware of the ban he had by a sixpenny stamp put upon an unoffending class evan went ahead hearing the wheels of the chariot still dragging the road in his rear the postillion was in a dissatisfied state of mind he had asked and received more than his due but in the matter of his sweet self he had been choused as he termed it and my gentleman had baffled him he could not quite tell how but he had been got the better of his sarcasms had not stuck and returned to rankle in the bosom of their author as a jew therefore may eye an erewhile bondsman who has paid the bill but stands out against excess of interest on legal grounds the postillion regarded evan of whom he was now abreast eager for a controversy fine night said the postillion to begin and was answered by a short assent lateish for a poor man to be outdont you think sir eh i ought to think so said evan mastering the shrewd unpleasantness he felt in the colloquy forced on him oh you youre a gentleman the postillion ejaculated you see i have no money feel it too sir i am sorry you should be the victim victim the postillion seized on an objectionable word i aint no victim unless you was up to a joke with me sir just now was that the game evan informed him that he never played jokes with money or on men cause it looks like it sir to go to offer a poor chap sixpence the postillion laughed hollow from the end of his lungs sixpence for a nights work it is a joke if you dont mean it for one why do you know sir i could gothere i dont care where it isi could go before any magistrate livin and hed make ye pay its a charge as custom is and hed make ye pay or prhaps youre a goin on my generosity andll say he gev back that sixpence well i shouldnt a thought a gentlemand make that his defence before a magistrate but there my man if it makes ye happy keep it but you take my advice sir when you hires a chariot see youve got the shiners and dont you go never again offerin a sixpence to a poor man for a nights work they dont like it it hurts their feelins dont you forget that sir lay that up in your mind now the postillion having thus relieved himself jeeringly asked permission to smoke a pipe to which evan said pray smoke if it pleases you and the postillion hardly mollified added the baccys paid for and smoked as will sometimes happen the feelings of the man who had spoken out and behaved doubtfully grew gentle and christian whereas those of the man whose bearing under the trial had been irreproachable were much the reverse the postillion smokedhe was a lord on his horse he beheld my gentleman trudging in the dust awhile he enjoyed the contrast dividing his attention between the footfarer and moon to have had the last word is always a great thing and to have given my gentleman a lecture because he shunned a dispute also counts and then there was the poor young fellow trudging to his fathers funeral the postillion chose to remember that now in reality he allowed he had not very much to complain of and my gentlemans courteous avoidance of provocation the apparent fact that he the postillion had humbled him and got the better of him equally it may be acted on his fine english spirit i should not like to leave out the tobacco in this good change that was wrought in him however he presently astonished evan by pulling up his horses and crying that he was on his way to hillford to bait and saw no reason why he should not take a lift that part of the road at all events evan thanked him briefly but declined and paced on with his head bent it wont cost you nothingnot a sixpence the postillion sang out pursuing him come sir be a man i aint a hintin at anythingjump in evan again declined and looked out for a side path to escape the fellow whose bounty was worse to him than his abuse and whose mention of the sixpence was unlucky dash it cried the postillion youre going down to a funerali think you said your fathers siryou may as well try and get there respectableas far as i go its one to me whether youre in or out the horses wont feel it and i do wish youd take a lift and welcome its because youre too much of a gentleman to be beholden to a poor man i suppose evans young pride may have had a little of that base mixture in it and certainly he would have preferred that the invitation had not been made to him but he was capable of appreciating what the rejection of a piece of friendliness involved and as he saw that the man was sincere he did violence to himself and said very well then ill jump in the postillion was off his horse in a twinkling and trotted his bandy legs to undo the door as to a gentleman who paid this act of service evan valued suppose i were to ask you to take the sixpence now he said turning round with one foot on the step well sir the postillion sent his hat aside to answer i dont want itid rather not have it but there ill take itdash the sixpence and well cry quits evan surprised and pleased with him dropped the bit of money in his hand saying it will fill a pipe for you while youre smoking it think of me as in your debt youre the only man i ever owed a penny to the postillion put it in a side pocket apart and observed a sixpence kindly meant is worth any crown piece thats grudgedthat it is in you jump sir its a jolly night thus may one not a conscious sage play the right tune on this human nature of ours by forbearance put it in the wrong and then by not refusing the burden of an obligation confer something better the instrument is simpler than we are taught to fancy but it was doubtless owing to a strong emotion in his soul as well as to the stuff he was made of that the youth behaved as he did we are now and then above our own actions seldom on a level with them evan i dare say was long in learning to draw any gratification from the fact that he had achieved without money the unparalleled conquest of a man perhaps he never knew what immediate influence on his fortune this episode effected at hillford they went their different ways the postillion wished him good speed and evan shook his hand he did so rather abruptly for the postillion was fumbling at his pocket and evidently rounding about a proposal in his mind my gentleman has now the road to himself money is the clothing of a gentleman he may wear it well or ill some you will mark carry great quantities of it gracefully some with a stinted supply present a decent appearance very few i imagine will bear inspection who are absolutely stripped of it all save the shameless are toiling to escape that trial my gentleman treading the white highway across the solitary heaths that swell far and wide to the moon is by the postillion who has seen him pronounced no sham nor do i think the opinion of any man worthless who has had the postillions authority for speaking but it is i am told a finer test to embellish much gentleman apparel than to walk with dignity totally unadorned this simply tries the soundness of our faculties that tempts them in erratic directions it is the difference between active and passive excellence as there is hardly any situation however so interesting to reflect upon as that of a man without a penny in his pocket and a gizzard full of pride we will leave mr evan harrington to what fresh adventures may befall him walking toward the funeral plumes of the firs under the soft midsummer flush westward where his father lies chapter vii mother and son rare as epic song is the man who is thorough in what he does and happily so for in life he subjugates us and he makes us bondsmen to his ashes it was in the order of things that the great mel should be borne to his final resting place by a troop of creditors you have seen since the occasion demands a pompous simile clouds that all day cling about the sun and in seeking to obscure him are compelled to blaze in his livery at fall of night they break from him illumined hang mournfully above him and wear his natural glories long after he is gone thus then these worthy fellows faithful to him to the dust fulfilled mels triumphant passage amongst them and closed his career to regale them when they returned mrs mel whose mind was not intent on greatness was occupied in spreading meat and wine mrs fiske assisted her as well as she could seeing that one hand was entirely engaged by her handkerchief she had already stumbled and dropped a glass which had brought on her sharp condemnation from her aunt who bade her sit down or go upstairs to have her cry out and then return to be serviceable oh i cant help it sobbed mrs fiske that he should be carried away and none of his children to see him the last time i can understand louisaand harriet too perhaps but why could not caroline and that they should be too fine ladies to let their brother come and bury his father oh it does seem mrs fiske fell into a chair and surrendered to grief where is the cold tongue said mrs mel to sally the maid in a brief under voice please mum jacko he must be whipped you are a careless slut please i cant think of everybody and everything and poor master sally plumped on a seat and took sanctuary under her apron mrs mel glanced at the pair continuing her labour oh aunt aunt cried mrs fiske why didnt you put it off for another day to give evan a chance masterd have kept another two days he would whimpered sally oh aunt to think cried mrs fiske and his coffin not bearin of his spurs whimpered sally mrs mel interrupted them by commanding sally to go to the drawing room and ask a lady there of the name of mrs wishaw whether she would like to have some lunch sent up to her mrs fiske was requested to put towels in evans bedroom yes aunt if youre not infatuated said mrs fiske as she prepared to obey while sally seeing that her public exhibition of sorrow and sympathy could be indulged but an instant longer unwound herself for a violent paroxysm blurting between stops if hed onyve gone to his last bed comfortable if hed onyve been that decent as not for to go to his last bed with his clothes on if hed onyve had a comfortable sheet it makes a woman feel cold to think of him full dressed there as if he was goin to be a soldier on the day o judgement to let people speak was a maxim of mrs mels and a wise one for any form of society when emotions are very much on the surface she continued her arrangements quietly and having counted the number of plates and glasses and told off the guests on her fingers she sat down to await them the first one who entered the room was her son you have come said mrs mel flushing slightly but otherwise outwardly calm you didnt suppose i should stay away from you mother evan kissed her cheek i knew you would not mrs mel examined him with those eyes of hers that compassed objects in a single glance she drew her finger on each side of her upper lip and half smiled saying that wont do here what asked evan and proceeded immediately to make inquiries about her health which she satisfied with a nod you saw him lowered van yes mother then go and wash yourself for you are dirty and then come and take your place at the head of the table must i sit here mother without a doubtyou must you know your room quick in this manner their first interview passed mrs fiske rushed in to exclaim so you were right aunthe has come i met him on the stairs oh how like dear uncle mel he looks in the militia with that moustache i just remember him as a child and oh what a gentleman he is at the end of the sentence mrs mels face suddenly darkened she said in a deep voice dont dare to talk that nonsense before him ann mrs fiske looked astonished what have i done aunt he shant be ruined by a parcel of fools said mrs mel there go women have no place here how the wretches can force themselves to touch a morsel after this morning mrs fiske exclaimed glancing at the table men must eat said mrs mel the mourners were heard gathering outside the door mrs fiske escaped into the kitchen mrs mel admitted them into the parlour bowing much above the level of many of the heads that passed her assembled were messrs barnes kilne and grossby whom we know mr doubleday the ironmonger mr joyce the grocer mr perkins commonly called lawyer perkins mr welbeck the pier master of lymport bartholomew fiske mr coxwell a fallowfield maltster brewer and farmer creditors of various dimensions all of them mr goren coming last behind his spectacles my son will be with you directly to preside said mrs mel accept my thanks for the respect you have shown my husband i wish you good morning morning maam answered several voices and mrs mel retired the mourners then set to work to relieve their hats of the appendages of crape an undertakers man took possession of the long black cloaks the gloves were generally pocketed thats my second black pair this year said joyce theyll last a time to come i dont need to buy gloves while neighbours pop off undertakers gloves seem to me as if theyre made for mutton fists remarked welbeck upon which kilne nudged barnes the butcher with a sharp aha and barnes observed oh i never wear emthey does for my boys on sundays i smoke a pipe at home the fallowfield farmer held his length of crape aloft and inquired what shall do with this oh you keep it said one or two coxwell rubbed his chin dont like to rob the widder whats left goes to the undertaker asked grossby to be sure said barnes and kilne added its a job lawyer perkins ejaculating confidently perquisites of office gentlemen perquisites of office which settled the dispute and appeased every conscience a survey of the table ensued the mourners felt hunger or else thirst but had not it appeared amalgamated the two appetites as yet thirst was the predominant declaration and grossby after an examination of the decanters unctuously deduced the fact which he announced that port and sherry were present try the port said kilne good barnes inquired a very intelligent i ought to know with a reserve of regret at the extension of his intimacy with the particular vintage under that roof was winked by kilne lawyer perkins touched the arm of a mourner about to be experimental on kilnes port i think we had better wait till young mr harrington takes the table dont you see yes ah croaked goren the head of the family as the saying goes i suppose we shant go into business to day joyce carelessly observed lawyer perkins answered no you cant expect it mr harrington has led me to anticipate that he will appoint a day dont you see oh i see returned joyce i aint in such a hurry whats he doing doubleday whose propensities were waggish suggested shaving but half ashamed of it since the joke missed fell to as if he were soaping his face and had some trouble to contract his jaw the delay in evans attendance on the guests of the house was caused by the fact that mrs mel had lain in wait for him descending to warn him that he must treat them with no supercilious civility and to tell him partly the reason why on hearing the potential relations in which they stood toward the estate of his father evan hastily and with the assurance of a son of fortune said they should be paid thats what they would like to hear said mrs mel you may just mention it when theyre going to leave say you will fix a day to meet them every farthing pursued evan on whom the tidings were beginning to operate what debts my poor father and a thumping sum van you will open your eyes wider but it shall be paid motherit shall be paid debts i hate them id slave night and day to pay them mrs mel spoke in a more positive tense and so will i van now go it mattered little to her what sort of effect on his demeanour her revelation produced so long as the resolve she sought to bring him to was nailed in his mind and she was a woman to knock and knock again till it was firmly fixed there with a strong purpose and no plans there were few who could resist what in her circle she willed not even a youth who would gaily have marched to the scaffold rather than stand behind a counter a purpose wedded to plans may easily suffer shipwreck but an unfettered purpose that moulds circumstances as they arise masters us and is terrible character melts to it like metal in the steady furnace the projector of plots is but a miserable gambler and votary of chances of a far higher quality is the will that can subdue itself to wait and lay no petty traps for opportunity poets may fable of such a will that it makes the very heavens conform to it or i may add what is almost equal thereto one who would be a gentleman to consent to be a tailor the only person who ever held in his course against mrs mel was melher husband but with him she was under the physical fascination of her youth and it never left her in her heart she barely blamed him what he did she took among other inevitable matters the door closed upon evan and waiting at the foot of the stairs a minute to hear how he was received mrs mel went to the kitchen and called the name of dandy which brought out an ill built low browed small man in a baggy suit of black who hopped up to her with a surly salute dandy was a bird mrs mel had herself brought down and she had for him something of a sportsmans regard for his victim dandy was the cleaner of boots and runner of errands in the household of melchisedec having originally entered it on a dark night by the cellar mrs mel on that occasion was sleeping in her dressing gown to be ready to give the gallant night hawk her husband the service he might require on his return to the nest hearing a suspicious noise below she rose and deliberately loaded a pair of horse pistols weapons mel had worn in his holsters in the heroic days gone and with these she stepped downstairs straight to the cellar carrying a lantern at her girdle she could not only load but present and fire dandy was foremost in stating that she called him forth steadily three times before the pistol was discharged he admitted that he was frightened and incapable of speech at the apparition of the tall terrific woman after the third time of asking he had the ball lodged in his leg and fell mrs mel was in the habit of bearing heavier weights than dandy she made no ado about lugging him to a chamber where with her own hands for this woman had some slight knowledge of surgery and was great in herbs and drugs she dressed his wound and put him to bed crying contempt ever present in dandys memory at such a poor creature undertaking the work of housebreaker taught that he really was a poor creature for the work dandy his nursing over begged to be allowed to stop and wait on mrs mel and she who had like many strong natures a share of pity for the objects she despised did not cast him out a jerk in his gait owing to the bit of lead mrs mel had dropped into him and a little perhaps to her self satisfied essay in surgical science on his person earned him the name he went by when her neighbours remonstrated with her for housing a reprobate mrs mel would say dandy is well fed and well physicked theres no harm in dandy by which she may have meant that the food won his gratitude and the physic reduced his humours she had observed human nature at any rate dandy was her creature and the great mel himself rallied her about her squire when were you drunk last was mrs mels address to dandy as he stood waiting for orders he replied to it in an altogether injured way there now youve been and called me away from my dinner to ask me that why when i had the last chance to be sure and you were at dinner in your new black suit well growled dandy i borrowed sallys apron seems i cant please ye mrs mel neither enjoined nor cared for outward forms of respect where she was sure of complete subserviency if dandy went beyond the limits she gave him an extra dose up to the limits he might talk as he pleased in accordance with mrs mels maxim that it was a necessary relief to all talking creatures now take off your apron she said and wash your hands dirty pig and go and wait at table in there she pointed to the parlour door come straight to me when everybody has left well there i am with the bottles again returned dandy its your fault this time mind ill come as straight as i can dandy turned away to perform her bidding and mrs mel ascended to the drawing room to sit with mrs wishaw who was as she told all who chose to hear an old flame of mels and was besides what mrs mel thought more of the wife of mels principal creditor a wholesale dealer in cloth resident in london the conviviality of the mourners did not disturb the house still men who are not accustomed to see the colour of wine every day will sit and enjoy it even upon solemn occasions and the longer they sit the more they forget the matter that has brought them together pleading their wives and shops however they released evan from his miserable office late in the afternoon his mother came down to himand saying i see how you did the journeyyou walked it told him to follow her yes mother evan yawned i walked part of the way i met a fellow in a gig about ten miles out of fallowfield and he gave me a lift to flatsham i just reached lymport in time thank heaven i wouldnt have missed that by the way ive satisfied these men oh said mrs mel they wantedone or two of themwhat a penance it is to have to sit among those people an hourthey wanted to ask me about the business but i silenced them i told them to meet me here this day week mrs mel again said oh and pushing into one of the upper rooms heres your bedroom van just as you left it ah so it is muttered evan eyeing a print the douglas and the percy he took the dead man by the hand what an age it seems since i last saw that theres sir hugh montgomery on horsebackhe hasnt moved dont you remember my father calling it the battle of tit for tat gallant percy i know he wished he had lived in those days of knights and battles it does not much signify whom one has to make clothes for observed mrs mel her son happily did not mark her i think we neither of us were made for the days of pence and pounds he continued now mother sit down and talk to me about him did he mention me did he give me his blessing i hope he did not suffer id have given anything to press his hand and looking wistfully at the percy lifting the hand of douglas dead evans eyes filled with big tears he suffered very little returned mrs mel and his last words were about you what were they evan burst out i will tell you another time now undress and go to bed when i talk to you van i want a cool head to listen you do nothing but yawn yard measures the mouth of the weary youth instinctively snapped short the abhorred emblem here i will help you van in spite of his remonstrances and petitions for talk she took off his coat and waistcoat contemptuously criticizing the cloth of foreign tailors and their absurd cut have you heard from louisa asked evan yes yesabout your sisters by and by now be good and go to bed she still treated him like a boy whom she was going to force to the resolution of a man dandys sleeping room was on the same floor as evans thither when she had quitted her son she directed her steps she had heard dandy tumble up stairs the moment his duties were over and knew what to expect when the bottles had been in his way for drink made dandy savage and a terror to himself it was her command to him that when he happened to come across liquor he should immediately seek his bedroom and bolt the door and dandy had got the habit of obeying her on this occasion he was vindictive against her seeing that she had delivered him over to his enemy with malice prepense a good deal of knocking and summoning of dandy by name was required before she was admitted and the sight of her did not delight him as he testified im drunk he bawled will that do for ye mrs mel stood with her two hands crossed above her apron string noting his sullen lurking eye with the calm of a tamer of beasts you go out of the room im drunk dandy repeated and pitched forward on the bed post in the middle of an oath she understood that it was pure kindness on dandys part to bid her go and be out of his reach and therefore on his becoming so abusive as to be menacing she without a shade of anger and in the most unruffled manner administered to him the remedy she had reserved in the shape of a smart box on the ear which sent him flat to the floor he rose after two or three efforts quite subdued now dandy sit on the edge of the bed dandy sat on the extreme edge and mrs mel pursued now dandy tell me what your master said at the table talked at em like a lord he did said dandy stupidly consoling the boxed ear what were his words dandys peculiarity was that he never remembered anything save when drunk and mrs mels dose had rather sobered him by degrees scratching at his head haltingly he gave the context gentlemen i hear for the first time youve claims against my poor father nobody shall ever say he died and any man was the worse for it ill meet you next week and ill bind myself by law heres lawyer perkins no mr perkins ill pay off every penny gentlemen look upon me as your debtor and not my father delivering this with tolerable steadiness dandy asked will that do that will do said mrs mel ill send you up some tea presently lie down dandy the house was dark and silent when evan refreshed by his rest descended to seek his mother she was sitting alone in the parlour with a tenderness which mrs mel permitted rather than encouraged evan put his arm round her neck and kissed her many times one of the symptoms of heavy sorrow a longing for the signs of love made evan fondle his mother and bend over her yearningly mrs mel said once dear van good boy and quietly sat through his caresses sitting up for me mother he whispered yes van we may as well have our talk out ah he took a chair close by her side tell me my fathers last words he said he hoped you would never be a tailor evans forehead wrinkled up theres not much fear of that then his mother turned her face on him and examined him with a rigorous placidity all her features seeming to bear down on him evan did not like the look you object to trade van yes decidedly motherhate it but thats not what i want to talk to you about didnt my father speak of me much he desired that you should wear his militia sword if you got a commission i have rather given up hope of the army said evan mrs mel requested him to tell her what a colonels full pay amounted to and again the number of years it required on a rough calculation to attain that grade in reply to his statement she observed a tailor might realize twice the sum in a quarter of the time what if he doesdouble or treble cried evan impetuously and to avoid the theme and cast off the bad impression it produced on him he rubbed his hands and said i want to talk to you about my prospects mother what are they mrs mel inquired the severity of her mien and sceptical coldness of her speech caused him to inspect them suddenly as if she had lent him her eyes he put them by till the gold should recover its natural shine saying by the way mother ive written the half of a history of portugal have you said mrs mel for louisa no mother of course not to sell it albuquerque what a splendid fellow he was informing him that he knew she abominated foreign names she said and your prospects are writing histories of portugal no mother i was going to tell you i expect a government appointment mr jocelyn likes my worki think he likes me you know i was his private secretary for ten months you write a good hand his mother interposed and im certain i was born for diplomacy for an easy chair and an ink dish before you and lacqueys behind whats to be your income van evan carelessly remarked that he must wait and see a very proper thing to do said mrs mel for now that she had fixed him to some explanation of his prospects she could condescend in her stiff way to banter slightly touched by it evan pursued half laughing as men do who wish to propitiate common sense on behalf of what seems tolerably absurd its not the immediate income you know mother one thinks of ones future in the diplomatic service as louisa says you come to be known to ministers gradually i mean that is they hear of you and if you show you have some capacitylouisa wants me to throw it up in time and stand for parliament andrew she thinks would be glad to help me to his seat once in parliament and known to ministers youyour career is open to you in justice to mr evan harrington it must be said he built up this extraordinary card castle to dazzle his mothers mind he had lost his right grasp of her character for the moment because of an undefined suspicion of something she intended and which sent him himself to take refuge in those flimsy structures while the very altitude he reached beguiled his imagination and made him hope to impress hers mrs mel dealt it one fillip and in the meantime how are you to live and pay the creditors though evan answered cheerfully oh they will wait and i can live on anything he was nevertheless floundering on the ground amid the ruins of the superb edifice and his mother upright and rigid continuing you can live on anything and they will wait and call your father a rogue he started grievously bitten by one of the serpents of earth good heaven mother what are you saying that they will call your father a rogue and will have a right to said the relentless woman not while i live evan exclaimed you may stop one mouth with your fist but you wont stop a dozen van evan jumped up and walked the room what am i to do he cried i will pay everything i will bind myself to pay every farthing what more can i possibly do make the money said mrs mels deep voice evan faced her my dear mother you are very unjust and inconsiderate i have been working and doing my best i promisewhat do the debts amount to something like in all van very well youth is not alarmed by the sound of big sums very welli will pay it evan looked as proud as if he had just clapped down the full amount on the table out of the history of portugal half written and the prospect of a government appointment mrs mel raised her eyelids to him in timein time mother mention your proposal to the creditors when you meet them this day week she said neither of them spoke for several minutes then evan came close to her saying what is it you want of me mother i want nothing vani can support myself but what would you have me do mother be honest do your duty and dont be a fool about it i will try he rejoined you tell me to make the money where and how can i make it i am perfectly willing to work in this house said mrs mel and as this was pretty clear speaking she stood up to lend her figure to it here faltered evan what be a tailor the word did not sting her tongue i oh thats quite impossible said evan and visions of leprosy and rose shrinking her skirts from contact with him shadowed out and away in his mind understand your choice mrs mel imperiously spoke what are brains given you for to be played the fool with by idiots and women you have to pay to save your father from being called a rogue you can only make the money in one way which is open to you this business might produce a thousand pounds a year and more in seven or eight years you may clear your fathers name and live better all the time than many of your bankrupt gentlemen you have told the creditors you will pay them do you think theyre gaping fools to be satisfied by a history of portugal if you refuse to take the business at once they will sell me up and quite right too understand your choice theres mr goren has promised to have you in london a couple of months and teach you what he can he is a kind friend would any of your gentlemen acquaintance do the like for you understand your choice you will be a beggarthe son of a rogueor an honest man who has cleared his fathers name during this strenuously uttered allocution mrs mel though her chest heaved but faintly against her crossed hands showed by the dilatation of her eyes and the light in them that she felt her words there is that in the aspect of a fine frame breathing hard facts which to a youth who has been tumbled headlong from his card castles and airy fabrics is masterful and like the pressure of a fate evan drooped his head now said mrs mel you shall have some supper evan told her he could not eat i insist upon your eating said mrs mel empty stomachs are foul counsellors mother do you want to drive me mad cried evan she looked at him to see whether the string she held him by would bear the slight additional strain decided not to press a small point then go to bed and sleep on it she saidsure of himand gave her cheek for his kiss for she never performed the operation but kept her mouth as she remarked for food and speech and not for slobbering mummeries evan returned to his solitary room he sat on the bed and tried to think oppressed by horrible sensations of self contempt that caused whatever he touched to sicken him there were the douglas and the percy on the wall it was a happy and a glorious time was it not when men lent each other blows that killed outright when to be brave and cherish noble feelings brought honour when strength of arm and steadiness of heart won fortune when the fair stars of earthsweet womenwakened and warmed the love of squires of low degree this legacy of the dead mans hand evan would have paid it with his blood but to be in bondage all his days to it through it to lose all that was dear to him to wear the length of a loathed existencewe should pardon a young mans wretchedness at the prospect for it was in a time before our joyful era of universal equality yet he never cast a shade of blame upon his father the hours moved on and he found himself staring at his small candle which struggled more and more faintly with the morning light like his own flickering ambition against the facts of life chapter viii introduces an eccentric at the auroraone of those rare antiquated taverns smelling of comfortable time and solid english fare that had sprung up in the great coffee days when taverns were clubs and had since subsisted on the attachment of steady bachelor templars there had been dismay and even sorrow for a month the most constant patron of the establishmentan old gentleman who had dined there for seven and twenty years four days in the week off dishes dedicated to the particular days and had grown grey with the landlady the cook and the head waiterthis old gentleman had abruptly withheld his presence though his name his residence his occupation were things only to be speculated on at the aurora he was very well known there and as men are best to be known that is to say by their habits some affection for him also was felt the landlady looked on him as a part of the house the cook and the waiter were accustomed to receive acceptable compliments from him monthly his precise words his regular ancient jokes his pint of madeira and after pint of port his antique bow to the landlady passing out and in his method of spreading his table napkin on his lap and looking up at the ceiling ere he fell to and how he talked to himself during the repast and indulged in short chuckles and the one look of perfect felicity that played over his features when he had taken his first sip of portthese were matters it pained them at the aurora to have to remember for three weeks the resolution not to regard him as of the past was general the aurora was the old gentlemans home men do not play truant from home at sixty years of age he must therefore be seriously indisposed the kind heart of the landlady fretted to think he might have no soul to nurse and care for him but she kept his corner near the fire place vacant and took care that his pint of madeira was there the belief was gaining ground that he had gone and that nothing but his ghost would ever sit there again still the melancholy ceremony continued for the landlady was not without a secret hope that in spite of his reserve and the mystery surrounding him he would have sent her a last word the cook and head waiter interrogated as to their dealings with the old gentleman testified solemnly to the fact of their having performed their duty by him they would not go against their interests so much as to forget one of his ways they saidtaking oath as it were by their lower nature in order to be credited an instinct men have of one another the landlady could not contradict them for the old gentleman had made no complaint but then she called to memory that fifteen years back in such and such a year wednesdays dish had been by shameful oversight furnished him for tuesdays and he had eaten it quietly but refused his port which pathetic event had caused alarm and inquiry when the error was discovered and apologized for the old gentleman merely saying dont let it happen again next day he drank his port as usual and the wheels of the aurora went smoothly the landlady was thus justified in averring that something had been done by somebody albeit unable to point to anything specific women who are almost as deeply bound to habit as old gentlemen possess more of its spiritual element and are warned by dreams omens creepings of the flesh unwonted chills suicide of china and other shadowing signs when a break is to be anticipated or has occurred the landlady of the aurora tavern was visited by none of these and with that beautiful trust which habit gives and which boastful love or vainer earthly qualities would fail in effecting she ordered that the pint of madeira should stand from six oclock in the evening till sevena small monument of confidence in him who was at one instant the poor old dear at another the naughty old gad about further the faithless old good for nothing and again the blessed pet of the landladys parlour alternately and indiscriminately apostrophized by herself her sister and daughter on the last day of the month a step was heard coming up the long alley which led from the riotous scrambling street to the plentiful cheerful heart of the aurora the landlady knew the step she checked the natural flutterings of her ribbons toned down the strong simper that was on her lips rose pushed aside her daughter and as the step approached curtsied composedly old habit lifted his hat and passed with the same touching confidence in the aurora that the aurora had in him he went straight to his corner expressed no surprise at his welcome by the madeira and thereby apparently indicated that his appearance should enjoy a similar immunity as of old he called jonathan and was not to be disturbed till he did so seeing that jonathan smirked and twiddled his napkin the old gentleman added thursday but jonathan a man had not his mistresss keen intuition of the deportment necessitated by the case or was incapable of putting the screw upon weak excited nature for he continued to smirk and was remarking how glad he was he was sure and something he had dared to think and almost to fear when the old gentleman called to him as if he were at the other end of the room will you order thursday or not sir whereat jonathan flew and two or three cosy diners glanced up from their plates or the paper smiled and pursued their capital occupation glad to see me the old gentleman muttered querulously of course glad to see a customer why do you tell me that talk tattle might as well have a woman to waitjust he wiped his forehead largely with his handkerchief as one whom calamity hunted a little too hard in summer weather no tumbling room for the wine too that was his next grievance he changed the pint of madeira from his left side to his right and went under his handkerchief again feverishly the world was severe with this old gentleman ah clock wrong now he leaned back like a man who can no longer carry his burdens informing jonathan on his coming up to place the roll of bread and firm butter that he was forty seconds too fast as if it were a capital offence and he deserved to step into eternity for outstripping time but i daresay you dont understand the importance of a minute said the old gentleman bitterly not you or any of you better if we had run a little ahead of your minute perhapsand the rest of you do you think you can cancel the mischief thats done in the world in that minute sir by hurrying ahead like that tell me rather at a loss jonathan scanned the clock seriously and observed that it was not quite a minute too fast the old gentleman pulled out his watch he grunted that a lying clock was hateful to him subsequently sinking into contemplation of his thumbsa sign known to jonathan as indicative of the old gentlemans system having resolved in spite of external outrages to be fortified with calm to meet the repast it is not fair to go behind an eccentric but the fact was this old gentleman was slightly ashamed of his months vagrancy and cruel conduct and cloaked his behaviour toward the aurora in all the charges he could muster against it he was very human albeit an odd form of the race happily for his digestion of thursday the cook warned by jonathan kept the old gentlemans time not the auroras and the dinner was correct the dinner was eaten in peace he began to address his plate vigorously poured out his madeira and chuckled as the familiar ideas engendered by good wine were revived in him jonathan reported at the bar that the old gentleman was all right again one would like here to pause while our worthy ancient feeds and indulge in a short essay on habit to show what a sacred and admirable thing it is that makes flimsy time substantial and consolidates his triple life it is proof that we have come to the end of dreams and times delusions and are determined to sit down at lifes feast and carve for ourselves its day is the child of yesterday and has a claim on to morrow whereas those who have no such plan of existence and sum of their wisdom to show the winds blow them as they list consider then mercifully the wrath of him on whom carelessness or forgetfulness has brought a snap in the links of habit you incline to scorn him because his slippers misplaced or asparagus not on his table the first day of a particular spring month he gazes blankly and sighs as one who saw the end to you it may appear small you call to him to be a man he is but he is also an immortal and his confidence in unceasing orderly progression is rudely dashed but the old gentleman has finished his dinner and his madeira and says now jonathan thock the porthis joke when matters have gone well meant to express the sound of the uncorking probably the habit of making good jokes is rare as you know old gentlemen have not yet attained to it nevertheless jonathan enjoys this one which has seen a generation in and out for he knows its purport to be my heart is open and now is a great time with this old gentleman he sips and in his eyes the world grows rosy and he exchanges mute or monosyllable salutes here and there his habit is to avoid converse but he will let a light remark season meditation he says to jonathan the bill for the month yes sir jonathan replies would you not prefer sir to have the items added on to the month ensuing i asked you for the bill of the month said the old gentleman with an irritated voice and a twinkle in his eye jonathan bowed but his aspect betrayed perplexity and that perplexity was soon shared by the landlady for jonathan said he was convinced the old gentleman intended to pay for sixteen days and the landlady could not bring her hand to charge him for more than two here was the dilemma foreseen by the old gentleman and it added vastly to the flavour of the port pleasantly tickled he sat gazing at his glass and let the minutes fly he knew the part he would act in his little farce if charged for the whole month he would peruse the bill deliberately and perhaps cry out hulloa and then snap at jonathan for the interposition of a remark but if charged for two days he would wish to be told whether they were demented those people outside and scornfully return the bill to jonathan a slap on the shoulder and a voice found you at last tom violently shattered the excellent plot and made the old gentleman start he beheld mr andrew cogglesby drinking port tom said mr andrew ill join you and he sat down opposite to him rubbing his hands and pushing back his hair jonathan entering briskly with the bill fell back a step in alarm the old gentleman whose inviolacy was thus rudely assailed sat staring at the intruder his mouth compressed and three fingers round his glass which it was doubtful whether he was not going to hurl at him waiter mr andrew carelessly hailed a pint of this port if you please jonathan sought the countenance of the old gentleman do you hear sir cried the latter turning his wrath on him another pint he added take back the bill and away went jonathan to relate fresh marvels to his mistress mr andrew then addressed the old gentleman in the most audacious manner astonished to see me here tom dare say you are i knew you came somewhere in this neighbourhood and as i wanted to speak to you very particularly and you wouldnt be visible till monday why i spied into two or three places and here i am you might see they were brothers they had the same bushy eyebrows the same healthy colour in their cheeks the same thick shoulders and brisk way of speaking and clear sharp though kindly eyes only tom was cast in larger proportions than andrew and had gotten the grey furniture of time for his natural wear perhaps too a cross in early life had a little twisted him and set his mouth in a rueful bunch out of which occasionally came biting things mr andrew carried his head up and eyed every man living with the benevolence of a patriarch dashed with the impudence of a london sparrow tom had a nagging air and a trifle of acridity on his broad features still any one at a glance could have sworn they were brothers and jonathan unhesitatingly proclaimed it at the aurora bar mr andrews hands were working together and at them and at his face the old gentleman continued to look with a firmly interrogating air want to know what brings me tom ill tell you presently hotisnt it what the deuce are you taking exercise for the old gentleman burst out and having unlocked his mouth he began to puff and alter his posture there you are thawed in a minute said mr andrew whats an eccentric a child grown grey it isnt mine i read it somewhere ah heres the port good ill warrant jonathan deferentially uncorked excessive composure on his visage he arranged the table cloth to a nicety fixed the bottle with exactness and was only sent scudding by the old gentlemans muttering of eavesdropping pie followed by a short go and even then he must delay to sweep off a particular crumb good it is said mr andrew rolling the flavour on his lips as he put down his glass i follow you in port tom elder brother the old gentleman also drank and was mollified enough to reply shant follow you in parliament havent forgiven that yet tom no great harm done when youre silent capital port said mr andrew replenishing the glasses i ought to have inquired where they kept the best port i might have known youd stick by it by the way talking of parliament theres talk of a new election for fallowfield you have a vote there will you give it to jocelyn theres talk of his standing if hell wear petticoats ill give him my vote there you go tom i hate masquerades youre penny trumpets of the women that tattle comes from the bed curtains when a petticoat steps forward i give it my vote or else i button it up in my pocket this was probably one of the longest speeches he had ever delivered at the aurora there was extra port in it jonathan who from his place of observation noted the length of time it occupied though he was unable to gather the context glanced at mr andrew with a sly satisfaction mr andrew laughing signalled for another pint so youve come here for my vote have you said mr tom why no not exactly that mr andrew answered blinking and passing it by jonathan brought the fresh pint and tom filled for himself drank and said emphatically and with a confounding voice your women have been setting you on me sir andrew protested that he was entirely mistaken youre the puppet of your women well tom not in this instance heres to the bachelors and brother tom at their head it seemed to be andrews object to help his companion to carry a certain quantity of port as if he knew a virtue it had to subdue him and to have fixed on a particular measure that he should hold before he addressed him specially arrived at this he said look here tom i know your ways i shouldnt have bothered you here i never have before but we couldnt very well talk it over in business hours and besides youre never at the brewery till monday and the matters rather urgent why dont you speak like that in parliament the old man interposed because parliament isnt my brother replied mr andrew you know tom you never quite took to my wifes family im not a match for fine ladies nan well harriet would have taken to you tom and will now if youll let her of course its a pity if shes ashamed ofhem you found it out about the lymport people tom and youve kept the secret and respected her feelings and i thank you for it women are odd in those things you know she mustnt imagine ive heard a whisper i believe it would kill her the old gentleman shook silently do you want me to travel over the kingdom hawking her for the daughter of a marquis now dont joke tom im serious are you not a radical at heart why do you make such a set against the poor women what do we spring from i take off my hat nan when i see a cobblers stall and i tom dont care a rush who knows it homosomething but we never had much schooling weve thriven and should help those we can weve got on in the world wife come back from lymport sneered tom andrew hurriedly and with some confusion explained that she had not been able to go on account of the child account of the child his brother repeated working his chin contemptuously sisters gone theyre stopping with us said andrew reddening so the tailor was left to the kites and the crows ah hum and tom chuckled youre angry with me tom for coming here said andrew i see what it is thought how it would be youre offended old tom come where you like returned tom the place is open its a fool that hopes for peace anywhere they sent a woman here to wait on me this day month thats a shame said mr andrew propitiatingly well never mind tom the women are sometimes in the wayevan went down to bury his father hes there now you wouldnt see him when he was at the brewery tom hesupon my honour hes a good young fellow a fine young gentleman ive no doubt nan a really good lad tom no nonsense ive come here to speak to you about him mr andrew drew a letter from his pocket pursuing just throw aside your prejudices and read this its a letter i had from him this morning but first i must tell you how the case stands know more than you can tell me nan said tom turning over the flavour of a gulp of his wine well then just let me repeat it he has been capitally educated he has always been used to good society well we mustnt sneer at it good societys better than bad youll allow he has refined tastes well you wouldnt like to live among crossing sweepers tom hes clever and accomplished can speak and write in three languages i wish i had his abilities he has good manners well tom you know you like them as well as anybody and nowbut read for yourself yah went old tom the women have been playing the fool with him since he was a baby i read his rigmarole no mr andrew shrugged his shoulders and opened the letter saying well listen and then he coughed and rapidly skimmed the introductory part excuses himself for addressing me formallypoor boy circumstances have altered his position towards the world found his fathers affairs in a bad state only chance of paying off fathers debts to undertake management of business and bind himself to so much a year but there tom if you wont read it you miss the poor young fellows character he says that he has forgotten his station fancied he was superior to trade but hates debt and will not allow anybody to throw dirt at his fathers name while he can work to clear it and will sacrifice his pride come tom thats manly isnt it i call it touching poor lad manly it may have been but the touching part of it was a feature missed in mr andrews hands at any rate it did not appear favourably to impress tom whose chin had gathered its ominous puckers as he inquired whats the trade he dont say andrew added with a wave of the hand out of a sort of feeling for his sistersi like him for it now what i want to ask you tom is whether we cant assist him in some way why couldnt we take him into our office and fix him there eh if he works wellwere both getting old and my brats are chickswe might by and by give him a share make a brewer of him ha thered be another mighty sacrifice for his pride come come tom said andrew hes my wifes brother and im yours andthere you know what women are they like to preserve appearances we ought to consider them preserve appearances echoed tom ha wholl do that for them better than a tailor andrew was an impatient little man fitter for a kind action than to plead a cause jeering jarred on him and from the moment his brother began it he was of small service to evan he flung back against the partition of the compound rattling it to the disturbance of many a quiet digestion tom he cried i believe youre a screw never said i wasnt rejoined tom as he finished his glass im a bachelor and a personyoure married and an object i wont have the tailors family at my coat tails do you mean to say tom you dont like the young fellow the countess says hes half engaged to an heiress and he has a chance of appointmentsof course nothing may come of them but do you mean to say you dont like him for what he has done tom made his jaw disagreeably prominent fraid im guilty of that crime and you that swear at people pretending to be above their station exclaimed andrew i shall get in a passion i cant stand this here waiter what have i to pay go cried the time honoured guest of the aurora to jonathan advancing andrew pressed the very roots of his hair back from his red forehead and sat upright and resolute glancing at tom and now ensued a curious scene of family blood for no sooner did elderly tom observe this bantam like demeanour of his brother than he ruffled his feathers likewise and looked down on him agitating his wig over a prodigious frown whereof came the following sharp colloquy andrew beginning ill pay off the debts out of my own pocket you can make a greater fool of yourself then he shant be a tailor he shant be a brewer i say he shall live like a gentleman i say he shall squat like a turk bang went andrews hand on the table ive pledged my word mind tom made a counter demonstration and ill have my way hang it i can be as eccentric as you said andrew and i as much a donkey as you if i try hard said tom something of the cobblers stall followed this till waxing furious tom sung out to jonathan hovering around them in watchful timidity more port and the words immediately fell oily on the wrath of the brothers both commenced wiping their heads with their handkerchiefs the faces of both emerged and met with a half laugh and severally determined to keep to what they had spoken there was a tacit accord between them to drop the subject like sunshine after smart rain the port shone on these brothers like a voice from the pastures after the bellowing of the thunder andrews voice asked got rid of that twinge of the gout tom did you rub in that ointment while tom replied ay how about that rheumatism of yours have you tried that indy oil receiving a like assurance the remainder of the port ebbed in meditation and chance remarks the bit of storm had done them both good and tom especiallythe cynical carping grim old gentlemanwas much improved by the nearer resemblance of his manner to andrews behind this unaffected fraternal concord however the fact that they were pledged to a race in eccentricity was present they had been rivals before and anterior to the date of his marriage andrew had done odd eclipsing things but andrew required prompting to it he required to be put upon his mettle whereas it was more nature with tom nature and the absence of a wife gave him advantages over andrew besides he had his character to maintain he had said the word and the first vanity of your born eccentric is that he shall be taken for infallible presently andrew ducked his head to mark the evening clouds flushing over the court yard of the aurora time to be off tom he said wife at home ah tom answered well i havent got to go to bed so early what an old rogue you are tom andrew pushed his elbows forward on the table amiably gad we havent drunk wine together sinceby george well have another pint many as you like said tom over the succeeding pint andrew in whose veins the port was merry favoured his brother with an imitation of major strike and indicated his dislike to that officer tom informed him that major strike was speculating the ass eats at my table and treats me with contempt just tell him that youre putting by the bones for him hell want em then andrew with another glance at the clouds now violet on a grey sky said he must really be off upon which tom observed dont come here again you old rascal tom cried andrew swinging over the table its quite jolly for us to be hob a nobbing together once more gadno we wont though i promisedharriet eh what say tom nother pint nan tom shook his head in a roguishly cosy irresistible way andrew from a shake of denial and resolve fell into the same and there sat the two brothersa jolly picture the hour was ten when andrew cogglesby comforted by toms remark that he tom had a wig and that he andrew would have a wigging left the aurora and he left it singing a song tom cogglesby still sat at his table holding before him evans letter of which he had got possession and knocking it round and round with a stroke of the forefinger to the tune of tinker tailor soldier sailor pothecary ploughboy thief each profession being sounded as a corner presented itself to the point of his nail after indulging in this species of incantation for some length of time tom cogglesby read the letter from beginning to end and called peremptorily for pen ink and paper chapter ix the countess in low society by dint of stratagems worthy of a court intrigue the countess de saldar contrived to traverse the streets of lymport and enter the house where she was born unsuspected and unseen under cover of a profusion of lace and veil and mantilla which only her heroic resolve to keep her beauties hidden from the profane townspeople could have rendered endurable beneath the fervid summer sun dress in a foreign style she must as without it she lost that sense of superiority which was the only comfort to her in her tribulations the period of her arrival was ten days subsequent to the burial of her father she had come in the coach like any common mortal and the coachman upon her request had put her down at the governors house and the guard had knocked at the door and the servant had informed her that general hucklebridge was not the governor of lymport nor did admiral combleman then reside in the town which tidings the coach then being out of sight it did not disconcert the countess to hear and she reached her mother having at least cut off communication with the object of conveyance the countess kissed her mother kissed mrs fiske and asked sharply for evan mrs fiske let her know that evan was in the house where inquired the countess i have news of the utmost importance for him i must see him where is he aunt said mrs fiske in the shop i think i wonder he did not see you passing louisa the countess went bolt down into a chair go to him jane said mrs mel tell him louisa is here and dont return mrs fiske departed and the countess smiled thank you mama you know i never could bear that odious vulgar little woman oh the heat you talk of portugal and oh poor dear papa what i have suffered flapping her laces for air and wiping her eyes for sorrow the countess poured a flood of sympathy into her mothers ears and then said but you have made a great mistake mama in allowing evan to put his foot into that place hebeloved of an heiress why if an enemy should hear of it it would ruin himpositively blast himfor ever and that she loves him i have proof positive yes with all her frankness the little thing cannot conceal that from me now she loves him and i desire you to guess mama whether rivals will not abound and what enemy so much to be dreaded as a rival and what revelation so awful as that he has stood in ain aboutique mrs mel maintained her usual attitude for listening it had occurred to her that it might do no good to tell the grand lady her daughter of evans resolution so she simply said it is discipline for him and left her to speak a private word with the youth timidly the countess inspected the furniture of the apartment taking chills at the dingy articles she saw in the midst of her heat that she should have sprung from this the thought was painful still she could forgive providence so much but should it ever be known she had sprung from this alas she felt she never could pardon such a dire betrayal she had come in good spirits but the mention of evans backsliding had troubled her extremely and though she did not say to herself what was the benefit resulting from her fathers dying if evan would be so base minded she thought the thing indefinitely and was forming the words on her mouth one harrington in a shop is equal to all when evan appeared alone why goodness gracious wheres your moustache cried the countess gone the way of hair said evan coldly stooping to her forehead such a distinction the countess continued reproachfully why mon dieu one could hardly tell you as you look now from the very commonest tradesmanif you were not rather handsome and something of a figure its a disguise evando you know that and ive parted with itthats all said evan no more disguises for me the countess immediately took his arm and walked with him to a window his face was certainly changed murmuring that the air of lymport was bad for him and that he must leave it instantly she bade him sit and attend to what she was about to say while you have been here degenerating evan day by dayas you always do out of my sightdegenerating no less a wordi have been slaving in your interests yes i have forced the jocelyns socially to acknowledge us i have not slept i have eaten bare morsels do abstinence and vigils clear the wits i know not but indeed they have enabled me to do more in a week than would suffice for a lifetime hark to me i have discovered roses secret si it is so rose loves you you blush you blush like a girl she loves you and you have let yourself be seen in a shop contrast me the two things oh in verity dreadful as it is one could almost laugh but the moment i lose sight of you my instructions vanish as quickly as that hair on your superior lip which took such time to perfect alas you must grow it again immediately use any perfumers contrivance rowland i have great faith in rowland without him i believe there would have been many bald women committing suicide you remember the bottle i gave to the count de villa flor countess he said to me you have saved this egg shell from a crack by helping to cover itfor so he called his headthe top you know was beginning to shine like an egg and i do fear me he would have done it ah you do not conceive what the dread of baldness is to a woman deathdeath is preferable to baldness baldness is death and a wiga wig oh horror total extinction is better than to rise again in a wig but you are young and play with hair but i was saying i went to see the jocelyns i was introduced to sir franks and his lady and the wealthy grandmother and i have an invitation for you evanyou unmannered boy that you do not bow a gentle incline forward of the shoulders and the eyes fixed softly your upper lids drooping triflingly as if you thanked with gentle sincerity but were indifferent well well if you will not an invitation for you to spend part of the autumn at beckley court the ancestral domain where there will be company the nobles of the land consider that you say it was bold in me to face them after that horrible man committed us on board the vessel a harrington is anything but a coward i did go and because i am devoted to your interests that very morning i saw announced in the paper just beneath poor andrews hand as he held it up at the breakfast table reading it i saw among the deaths sir abraham harrington of torquay baronet of quinsy twice that good man has come to my rescue oh i welcomed him as a piece of providence i turned and said to harriet i see they have put poor papa in the paper harriet was staggered i took the paper from andrew and pointed it to her she has no readiness she has had no foreign training she could not comprehend and andrew stood on tiptoe and peeped he has a bad cough and coughed himself black in the face i attribute it to excessive bad manners and his cold feelings he left the room i reproached harriet but oh the singularity of the excellent fortune of such an event at such a time it showed that our harrington luck had not forsaken us i hurried to the jocelyns instantly of course it cleared away any suspicions aroused in them by that horrible man on board the vessel and the tears i wept for sir abraham evan in verity they were tears of deep and sincere gratitude what is your mouth knitting the corners at are you laughing evan hastily composed his visage to the melancholy that was no counterfeit in him just then yes continued the countess easily reassured i shall ever feel a debt to sir abraham harrington of torquay i dare say we are related to him at least he has done us more service than many a rich and titled relative no one supposes he would acknowledge poor papa i can forgive him that evan the countess pointed out her finger with mournful and impressive majesty as we look down on that monkey people of rank and consideration in society look on what poor dear papa was this was partly true for jacko sat on a chair in his favourite attitude copied accurately from the workmen of the establishment at their labour with needle and thread growing cognizant of the infamy of his posture the countess begged evan to drive him out of her sight and took a sniff at her smelling bottle she went on now dear van you would hear of your sweet rose not a word evan hastily answered why what does this indicate whims then you do love i tell you louisa i dont want to hear a word of any of them said evan with an angry gleam in his eyes they are nothing to me nor i to them imy walk in life is not theirs faint heart faint heart the countess lifted a proverbial forefinger thank heaven i shall have the consolation of not going about and bowing and smirking like an impostor evan exclaimed there was a wider intelligence in the countesss arrested gaze than she chose to fashion into speech i knew she said i knew how the air of this horrible lymport would act on you but while i live evan you shall not sink in the sludge you with all the pains i have lavished on you and with your presencefor you have a presence so rare among young men in this england you who have been to a court and interchanged bows with duchesses and i know not what besidesnay i do not accuse you but if you had not been a mere boy and an english boypoor eugenia herself confessed to me that you had a looka tender cleaving of the underlidsthat made her catch her hand to her heart sometimes it reminded her so acutely of false belmaraa could you have had a greater compliment than that you shall not stop here another day true said evan for im going to london to night not to london the countess returned with a conquering glance but to beckley courtand with me to london louisa with mr goren again the countess eyed him largely but took as it were a side path from her broad thought saying yes fortunes are made in london if you would they should be rapid she meditated at that moment dandy knocked at the door and called outside please master mr goren says theres a gentleman in the shopwants to see you very well replied evan moving he was swung violently round the countess had clutched him by the arm a fearful expression was on her face whither do you go she said to the shop louisa too late to arrest the villanous word she pulled at him are you quite insane consent to be seen by a gentleman there what has come to you you must be lunatic are we all to be utterly ruineddisgraced is my mother to starve said evan absurd rejoinder no you should have sold everything here before this she can live with harrietsheonce out of this horrible elementshe would not show it but evan you are getting away from me you are not goingspeak i am going said evan the countess clung to him exclaiming never while i have the power to detain you but as he was firm and strong she had recourse to her womans aids and burst into a storm of sobs on his shouldera scene of which mrs mel was for some seconds a composed spectator whats the matter now said mrs mel evan impatiently explained the case mrs mel desired her daughter to avoid being ridiculous and making two fools in her family and at the same time that she told evan there was no occasion for him to go contrived with a look to make the advice a command he in that state of mind when one takes bitter delight in doing an abhorred duty was hardly willing to be submissive but the despair of the countess reduced him and for her sake he consented to forego the sacrifice of his pride which was now his sad sole pleasure feeling him linger the countess relaxed her grasp hers were tears that dried as soon as they had served their end and to give him the full benefit of his conduct she said i knew evan would be persuaded by me evan pitifully pressed her hand and sighed tea is on the table down stairs said mrs mel i have cooked something for you louisa do you sleep here to night can i tell you mama murmured the countess i am dependent on our evan oh well we will eat first said mrs mel and they went to the table below the countess begging her mother to drop titles in designating her to the servants which caused mrs mel to say there is but one i do the cooking and the countess ever disposed to flatter and be suave even when stung by a fact or a phrase added and a beautiful cook you used to be dear mama at the table awaiting them sat mrs wishaw mrs fiske and mr goren who soon found themselves enveloped in the countesss graciousness mr goren would talk of trade and compare lymport business with london and the countess loftily interested in his remarks drew him out to disgust her brother mrs wishaw in whom the countess at once discovered a frivolous pretentious woman of the moneyed trading class she treated as one who was alive to society and surveyed matters from a station in the world leading her to think that she tolerated mr goren as a lady christian of the highest rank should tolerate the insects that toil for us mrs fiske was not so tractable for mrs fiske was hostile and armed mrs fiske adored the great mel and she had never loved louisa hence she scorned louisa on account of her late behaviour toward her dead parent the countess saw through her and laboured to be friendly with her while she rendered her disagreeable in the eyes of mrs wishaw and let mrs wishaw perceive that sympathy was possible between them manoeuvring a trifle too delicate perhaps for the people present but sufficient to blind its keen witted author to the something that was being concealed from herself of which something nevertheless her senses apprehensively warned her and they might have spoken to her wits but that mortals cannot unaided guess or will not unless struck in the face by the fact credit what is to their minds the last horror i came down in the coach quite accidental with this gentleman said mrs wishaw fanning a cheek and nodding at mr goren im an old flame of dear mels i knew him when he was an apprentice in london now wasnt it odd your motheri suppose i must call you my lady the countess breathed a tender spare me with a smile that added among friends mrs wishaw resumed your mother was an old flame of this gentlemans i found out so there were two old flames and i couldnt help thinking but i was so glad to have seen dear mel once more ah sighed the countess he was always a martial looking man and laid out he was quite imposing i declare i cried so as it reminded me of when i couldnt have him for he had nothing but his legs and armsand i married wishaw but its a comfort to think i have been of some service to dear dear mel for wishaws a man of accounts and payments and i knew mel had cloth from him and the lady suggested bills delayed with two or three nods you know and ill do my best for his son you are kind said the countess smiling internally at the vulgar creatures misconception of evans requirements did he ever talk much about mary fence asked mrs wishaw polly fence he used to say sweet polly fence oh i think so frequently observed the countess mrs fiske primmed her mouth she had never heard the great mel allude to the name of fence the goren croak was heard painters have painted out melchisedec this afternoon yesah in and outas the saying goes here was an opportunity to mortify the countess mrs fiske placidly remarked have we the other put up in its stead its shorter a twinge of weakness had made evan request that the name of evan harrington should not decorate the shopfront till he had turned his back on it for a time mrs mel crushed her venomous niece what have you to do with such things shine in your own affairs first ann before you meddle with others relieved at hearing that melchisedec was painted out and unsuspicious of the announcement that should replace it the countess asked mrs wishaw if she thought evan like her dear papa so like returned the lady that i would not be alone with him yet for worlds i should expect him to be making love to me for you know my deari must be familiarmel never could be alone with you without it was his nature i speak of him before marriage but if i can trust myself with him i shall take charge of mr evan and show him some london society that is indeed kind said the countess glad of a thick veil for the utterance of her contempt evan thoughi fearwill be rather engaged his friends the jocelyns of beckley court willi fearhardly dispense with him and lady splendersyou know her the marchioness of splenders noby repute at least a most beautiful and most fascinating woman report of him alone has induced her to say that evan must and shall form a part of her autumnal gathering at splenders castle and how he is to get out of it i cannot tell but i am sure his multitudinous engagements will not prevent his paying due court to mistress wishaw as the countess intended mistress wishaws vanity was reproved and her ambition excited a pretty doublestroke only possible to dexterous players the lady rejoined that she hoped so she was sure and forthwith because she suddenly seemed to possess him more than his son launched upon mels incomparable personal attractions this caused the countess to enlarge upon evans vast personal prospects they talked across each other a little till the countess remembered her breeding allowed mrs wishaw to run to an end in hollow exclamations and put a finish to the undeclared controversy by a traverse of speech as if she were taking up the most important subject of their late colloquy but evan is not in his own handshe is in the hands of a lovely young woman i must tell you he belongs to her and not to us you have heard of rose jocelyn the celebrated heiress engaged mrs wishaw whispered aloud the countess an adept in the lie impliedpractised by her that she might not subject herself to future punishment in which she was so devout a believer that she condemned whole hosts to itdeeply smiled really said mrs wishaw and was about to inquire why evan with these brilliant expectations could think of trade and tailoring when the young man whose forehead had been growing black jumped up and quitted them thus breaking the harmony of the table and as the countess had said enough she turned the conversation to the always welcome theme of low society she broached death and corpses and became extremely interesting and very sympathetic the only difference between the ghostly anecdotes she related and those of the other ladies being that her ghosts were all of them titled and walked mostly under the burden of a coronet for instance there was the portuguese marquis de col he had married a spanish wife whose end was mysterious undressing on the night of the anniversary of her death and on the point of getting into bed he beheld the dead woman lying on her back before him all night long he had to sleep with this freezing phantom regularly every fresh anniversary he had to endure the same penance no matter where he might be or in what strange bed on one occasion when he took the live for the dead a curious thing occurred which the countess scrupled less to relate than would men to hint at ghosts were the one childish enjoyment mrs mel allowed herself and she listened to her daughter intently ready to cap any narrative but mrs fiske stopped the flood you have improved on peter smithers louisa she said the countess turned to her mildly you are certainly thinking of peter smithers mrs fiske continued bracing her shoulders surely you remember poor peter louisa an old flame of your own he was going to kill himself but married a devonshire woman and they had disagreeables and she died and he was undressing and saw her there in the bed and wouldnt get into it and had the mattress and the curtains and the counterpanes and everything burnt he told us it himself you must remember it louisa the countess remembered nothing of the sort no doubt could exist of its having been the portuguese marquis de col because he had confided to her the whole affair and indeed come to her as his habit was to ask her what he could possibly do under the circumstances if mrs fiskes friend who married the devonshire person had seen the same thing the coincidence was yet more extraordinary than the case mrs fiske said it assuredly was and glanced at her aunt who as the countess now rose declaring she must speak to evan chid mrs fiske and wished her and peter smithers at the bottom of the sea no no mama said the countess laughing that would hardly be proper and before mrs fiske could reply escaped to complain to evan of the vulgarity of those women she was not prepared for the burst of wrath with which evan met her louisa said he taking her wrist sternly you have done a thing i cant forgive i find it hard to bear disgrace myself i will not consent to bring it upon others why did you dare to couple miss jocelyns name with mine the countess gave him out her arms length speak on van she said admiring him with a bright gaze answer me louisa and dont take me for a fool any more he pursued you have coupled miss jocelyns name with mine in company and i insist now upon your giving me your promise to abstain from doing it anywhere before anybody if she saw you at this instant van returned the incorrigible countess would she desire it think you oh i must make you angry before her i see that you have your fathers frown you surpass him for your delivery is more correct and equally fluent and if a woman is momentarily melted by softness in a man she is for ever subdued by boldness and bravery of mien evan dropped her hand miss jocelyn has done me the honour to call me her friend that was in other days his lip quivered i shall not see miss jocelyn again yes i would lay down my life for her but thats idle talk no such chance will ever come to me but i can save her from being spoken of in alliance with me and what i am and i tell you louisa i will not have it saying which and while he looked harshly at her wounded pride bled through his eyes she was touched sit down dear i must explain to you and make you happy against your will she said in another voice and an english accent the mischief is done van if you do not want rose jocelyn to love you you must undo it in your own way i am not easily deceived on the morning i went to her house in town she took me aside and spoke to me not a confession in words the blood in her cheeks when i mentioned you did that for her everything about you she must knowhow you bore your grief and all and not in her usual free manner but timidly as if she feared a surprise or feared to be wakened to the secret in her bosom she half suspectstell him she said i hope he will not forget me the countess was interrupted by a great sob for the picture of frank rose jocelyn changed and soft and as it were shadowed under a veil of bashful regard for him so filled the young man with sorrowful tenderness that he trembled and was as a child marking the impression she had produced on him and having worn off that which he had produced on her the countess resumed the art in her style of speech easier to her than nature so the sweetest of roses may be yours dear van and you have her in a gold setting to wear on your heart are you not enviable i will notno i will not tell you she is perfect i must fashion the sweet young creature though i am very ready to admit that she is much improved by thisshall i call it desired consummation evan could listen no more such a struggle was rising in his breast the effort to quench what the countess had so shrewdly kindled passionate desire to look on rose but for one lightning flash desire to look on her and muffled sense of shame twin born with it wild love and leaden misery mixed dead hopelessness and vivid hope up to the neck in purgatory but his soul saturated with visions of bliss the fair orb of love was all that was wanted to complete his planetary state and aloft it sprang showing many faint fair tracts to him and piling huge darknesses as if in search of something he suddenly went from the room i have intoxicated the poor boy said the countess and consulted an attitude by the evening light in a mirror approving the result she rang for her mother and sat with her till dark telling her she could not and would not leave her dear mama that night at the supper table evan did not appear and mr goren after taking counsel of mrs mel dispersed the news that evan was off to london on the road again with a purse just as ill furnished and in his breast the light that sometimes leads gentlemen as well as ladies astray chapter x my gentleman on the road again near a milestone under the moonlight crouched the figure of a woman huddled with her head against her knees and careless hair falling to the summers dust evan came upon this sight within a few miles of fallowfield at first he was rather startled for he had inherited superstitious emotions from his mother and the road was lone the moon full he went up to her and spoke a gentle word which provoked no reply he ventured to put his hand on her shoulder continuing softly to address her she was flesh and blood evan stooped his head to catch a whisper from her mouth but nothing save a heavier fall of the breath she took as of one painfully waking was heard a misery beyond our own is a wholesome picture for youth and though we may not for the moment compare the deep with the lower deep we if we have a heart for outer sorrows can forget ourselves in it evan had just been accusing the heavens of conspiracy to disgrace him those patient heavens had listened as is their wont they had viewed and had not been disordered by his mental frenzies it is certainly hard that they do not come down to us and condescend to tell us what they mean and be dumb foundered by the perspicuity of our argumentsthe argument for instance that they have not fashioned us for the science of the shears and do yet impel us to wield them nevertheless they to whom mortal life has ceased to be a long matter perceive that our appeals for conviction are answered now and then very closely upon the call when we have cast off the scales of hope and fancy and surrender our claims on mad chance it is given us to see that some plan is working out that the heavens icy as they are to the pangs of our blood have been throughout speaking to our souls and according to the strength there existing we learn to comprehend them but their language is an element of time whom primarily we have to know evan harrington was young he wished not to clothe the generation what was to the remainder of the exiled sons of adam simply the brand of expulsion from paradise was to him hell in his agony anything less than an angel soft voiced in his path would not have satisfied the poor boy and here was this wretched outcast and instead of being relieved he was to act the reliever striving to rouse the desolate creature he shook her slightly she now raised her head with a slow gradual motion like that of a wax work showing a white young face tearlessdreadfully drawn at the lips after gazing at him she turned her head mechanically to her shoulder as to ask him why he touched her he withdrew his hand saying why are you here pardon me i want if possible to help you a light sprang in her eyes she jumped from the stone and ran forward a step or two with a gasp oh my god i want to go and drown myself evan lingered behind her till he saw her body sway and in a fit of trembling she half fell on his outstretched arm he led her to the stone not knowing what on earth to do with her there was no sign of a house near they were quite solitary to all his questions she gave an unintelligible moan he had not the heart to leave her so taking a sharp seat on a heap of flints thus possibly furnishing future occupation for one of his craftsmen he waited and amused himself by marking out diagrams with his stick in the thick dust his thoughts were far away when he heard faintly uttered why do you stop here to help you please dont let me be i cant be helped my good creature said evan its quite impossible that i should leave you in this state tell me where you were going when your illness seized you i was going she commenced vacantly to the seathe water she added with a shivering lip the foolish youth asked her if she could be cold on such a night no im not cold she replied drawing closer over her lap the ends of a shawl which would in that period have been thought rather gaudy for her station you were going to lymport yeslymports nearest i think and why were you out travelling at this hour she dropped her head and began rocking to right and left while they talked the noise of waggon wheels was heard approaching evan went into the middle of the road and beheld a covered waggon and a fellow whom he advanced to meet plodding a little to the rear of the horses he proved kindly he was a farmers man he said and was at that moment employed in removing the furniture of the farmers son who had failed as a corn chandler in lymport to hillford which he expected to reach about morn he answered evans request that he would afford the young woman conveyance as far as fallowfield tak her in that i will she wont hurt the harses he pursued pointing his whip at the vehicle theres my mate garge stoakes hes in there snorin his turn cant you hear n asnorin thraugh the wheels i can ive been laughin he do snore that loudgarge do proceeding to inform evan how george stokes had snored in that characteristic manner from boyhood ever since he and george had slept in a hayloft together and how he kept wakeful and driven to distraction by george stokes nose had been occasionally compelled in sheer self defence madly to start up and hold that pertinacious alarum in tight compression between thumb and forefinger and how george stokes thus severely handled had burst his hold with a tremendous snort as big as a bull and had invariably uttered the exclamation hulloasame to you my lad and rolled over to snore as fresh as everall this with singular rustic comparisons racy of the soil and in raw hampshire dialect the waggoner came to a halt opposite the stone and while evan strode to assist the girl addressed himself to the great task of arousing the sturdy sleeper and quieting his trumpet heard by all ears now that the accompaniment of the wheels was at an end george violently awakened complained that it was before his time to which he was true and was for going off again with exalted contentment though his heels had been tugged and were dangling some length out of the machine but his comrade with a determined blow of the lungs gave another valiant pull and george stokes was on his legs marvelling at the world and man evan had less difficulty with the girl she rose to meet him put up her arms for him to clasp her waist whispering sharply in an inward breath what are you going to do with me and indifferent to his verbal response trustingly yielded her limbs to his guidance he could see blood on her bitten underlip as with the help of the waggoner he lifted her on the mattress backed by a portly bundle which the sagacity of mr stokes had selected for his couch the waggoner cracked his whip laughing at george stokes who yawned and settled into a composed ploughswing without asking questions apparently resolved to finish his nap on his legs warnt he like that myzepper chap i see at the circus bound athert gray mare chuckled the waggoner so hed a gone on had ye a let n no wulves waddnt wake garge till hed slept it out then hed say marnin to m are ye wake now garge the admirable sleeper preferred to be a quiet butt and the waggoner leisurely exhausted the fun that was to be had out of him returning to it with a persistency that evinced more concentration than variety in his mind at last evan said your pace is rather slow theyll be shut up in fallowfield ill go on ahead youll find me at one of the innsthe green dragon in return for this speech the waggoner favoured him with a stare followed by the exclamation oh no dang that why whats the matter quoth evan you ent goin to be off for to leave me and garge in the lurch there with that ther young woman in that ther pickle returned the waggoner evan made an appeal to his reason but finding that impregnable he pulled out his scanty purse to guarantee his sincerity with an offer of pledgemoney the waggoner waved it aside he wanted no money he said look heer he went on if youre for a start i tells ye plain i chucks that ther young woman int the road evan bade him not to be a brute nark and crop the waggoner doggedly ejaculated very much surprised that a fellow who appeared sound at heart should threaten to behave so basely evan asked an explanation upon which the waggoner demanded to know what he had eyes for and as this query failed to enlighten the youth he let him understand that he was a man of family experience and that it was easy to tell at a glance that the complaint the young woman laboured under was one common to the daughters of eve he added that should an emergency arise he though a family man would be useless that he always vacated the premises while those incidental scenes were being enacted at home and that for him and george stokes to be left alone with the young woman why they would be of no more service to her than a couple of babies newborn themselves he for his part he assured evan should take to his heels and relinquish waggon and horses and all while george probably would stand and gape and the end of it would be they would all be had up for murder he diverged from the alarming prospect by a renewal of the foregoing alternative to the gentleman who had constituted himself the young womans protector if he parted company with them they would immediately part company with the young woman whose condition was evident why couldnt you tall that said the waggoner as evan tingling at the ears remained silent i know nothing of such things he answered hastily like one hurt i have to repeat the statement that he was a youth and a modest one he felt unaccountably unreasonably but horridly ashamed the thought of his actual position swamped the sickening disgust at tailordom worse then might happen to us in this extraordinary world there was something more abhorrent than sitting with ones legs crossed publicly stitching and scoffed at he called vehemently to the waggoner to whip the horses and hurry ahead into fallowfield but that worthy whatever might be his dire alarms had a regular pace that was conscious of no spur the reply of all right satisfied him at least and evans chaste sighs for the appearance of an assistant petticoat round a turn of the road were offered up duly to the measure of the waggoners steps suddenly the waggoner came to a halt and said blest if that garge baint a snorin on his pins evan lingered by him with some curiosity while the waggoner thumped his thigh to yes he be no he baint several times in eager hesitation its a fellow calling from the downs said evan ay so responded the waggoner dangd if i didnt think twere that garge of ourn hark awhile at a repetition of the call the waggoner stopped his team after a few minutes a man appeared panting on the bank above them down which he ran precipitately knocked against evan apologized with the little breath that remained to him and then held his hand as to entreat a hearing evan thought him half mad the waggoner was about to imagine him the victim of a midnight assault he undeceived them by requesting in rather flowery terms conveyance on the road and rest for his limbs it being explained to him that the waggon was already occupied he comforted himself aloud with the reflection that it was something to be on the road again for one who had been belated lost and wandering over the downs for the last six hours walcome to git in when young woman gits out said the waggoner ill gi ye my sleep on t hillford thanks worthy friend returned the new comer the state of the case is thisim happy to take from humankind whatsoever i can get if this gentleman will accept of my company and my legs hold out all will yet be well though he did not wear a petticoat evan was not sorry to have him next to the interposition of the gods we pray for human fellowship when we are in a mess so he mumbled politely dropped with him a little to the rear and they all stepped out to the crack of the waggoners whip rather a slow pace said evan feeling bound to converse six hours on the downs makes it extremely suitable to me rejoined the stranger you lost your way i did sir yes one does not court those desolate regions wittingly i am for life and society the embraces of diana do not agree with my constitution if classics there be who differ from me i beg them to take six hours on the downs alone with the moon and the last prospect of bread and cheese and a chaste bed seemingly utterly extinguished i am cured of my romance of course when i say bread and cheese i speak figuratively food is implied evan stole a glance at his companion besides the other continued with an inflexion of grandeur for a man accustomed to his hunters it is you will confess unpleasanti speak hypotheticallyto be reduced to his legs to that extent that it strikes him shrewdly he will run them into stumps the stranger laughed the fair lady of the night illumined his face like one who recognized a subject evan thought he knew the voice a curious struggle therein between native facetiousness and an attempt at dignity appeared to evan not unfamiliar and the egregious failure of ambition and triumph of the instinct helped him to join the stranger in his mirth jack raikes he said surely the man it was answered to him but you and near our old schoolviscount harrington these marvels occur you seewe meet again by night evan with little gratification at the meeting fell into their former comradeship tickled by a recollection of his old schoolfellows india rubber mind mr raikes stood about a head under him he had extremely mobile features thick flexible eyebrows a loose voluble mouth a ridiculous figure on a dandified foot he represented to you one who was rehearsing a part he wished to act before the world and was not aware that he took the world into his confidence how he had come there his elastic tongue explained in tropes and puns and lines of dramatic verse his patrimony spent he at once believed himself an actor and he was hissed off the stage of a provincial theatre ruined the last ignominy endured i fled from the gay vistas of the benchfor they live who would thither lead me and determined the day before the yesterdaywhat thinkst thou why to go boldly and offer myself as adlatus to blessed old cudford yes a little latin is all that remains to me and i resolved like the man i am to turn hic hac hoc into bread and cheese and beer impute nought foreign to me in the matter of pride usher in our old schoolpoor old jack exclaimed evan lieutenant in the cudford academy the latter rejoined i walked the distance from london i had my interview with the respected principal he gave me of mutton nearest the bone which they say is sweetest and on sweet things you should not regale in excess endymion watched the sheep that bred that mutton he gave me the thin beer of our boyhood that i might the more soberly state my mission that beer my friend was brewed by one who wished to form a study for pantomimic masks he listened with the gravity which is all his own to the recital of my career he pleasantly compared me to phaethon congratulated the river thames at my not setting it on fire in my rapid descent and extended to me the three fingers of affectionate farewell you an usher a rearer of youth mr raikes oh no oh no that was all i could get out of him gad he might have seen that i didnt joke with the mutton bone if i winced at the beer it was imperceptible now a man who can do that is what i call a man in earnest youve just come from cudford said evan short is the tale though long the way friend harrington from bodley is ten miles to beckley i walked them from beckley is fifteen miles to fallowfield them i was traversing when lo near sweet eventide a fair horsewoman riding with her groom at her horses heels lady says i addressing her as much out of the style of the needy as possible will you condescend to direct me to fallowfieldare you going to the match says she i answered boldly that i was beckleys in says she and youll be in time to see them out if you cut across the downs there i lifted my hata desperate measure for the brim wont bear muchbut honour to women though we perish she bowed i cut across the downs in fine harrington old boy ive been wandering among those downs for the last seven or eight hours i was on the point of turning my back on the road for the twentieth time i believe when i heard your welcome vehicular music and hailed you and i ask you isnt it luck for a fellow who hasnt got a penny in his pocket and is as hungry as five hundred hunters to drop on an old friend like this evan answered with the question where was it you said you met the young lady in the first place o amadis i never said she was young youre on the scent i see nursing the fresh image of his darling in his hearts recesses evan as they entered fallowfield laid the state of his purse before jack and earned anew the epithet of amadis when it came to be told that the occupant of the waggon was likewise one of its pensioners sleep had long held its reign in fallowfield nevertheless mr raikes though blind windows alone looked on him and nought foreign was to be imputed to him in the matter of pride had become exceedingly solicitous concerning his presentation to the inhabitants of that quiet little country town and while evan and the waggoner consultedthe former with regard to the chances of procuring beds and supper the latter as to his prospect of beer and a comfortable riddance of the feminine burden weighing on them allmr raikes was engaged in persuading his hat to assume something of the gentlemanly polish of its youth and might have been observed now and then furtively catching up a leg to be dusted ere the wheels of the waggon stopped he had gained that ease of mind which the knowledge that you have done all a man may do and circumstances warrant establishes capacities conscious of their limits may repose even proudly when they reach them and if mr raikes had not quite the air of one come out of a bandbox he at least proved to the discerning intelligence that he knew what sort of manner befitted that happy occasion and was enabled by the pains he had taken to glance with a challenge at the sign of the hostelry under which they were now ranked and from which though the hour was late and fallowfield a singularly somnolent little town there issued signs of life approaching to festivity chapter xi doings at an inn what every traveller sighs to find was palatably furnished by the green dragon of fallowfielda famous inn and a constellation for wandering coachmen there pleasant smiles seasoned plenty and the bill was gilded in a manner unknown to our days whoso drank of the ale of the green dragon kept in his memory a place apart for it the secret that to give a warm welcome is the breath of life to an inn was one the green dragon boasted even then not to share with many red lions or cocks of the morning or kings heads or other fabulous monsters and as if to show that when you are in the right track you are sure to be seconded there was a friend of the green dragon who on a particular night of the year caused its renown to enlarge to the dimensions of a miracle but that for the moment is my secret evan and jack were met in the passage by a chambermaid before either of them could speak she had turned and fled with the words more coming which with the addition of my goodness me were echoed by the hostess in her recess hurried directions seemed to be consequent and then the hostess sallied out and said with a curtsey please to step in gentlemen this is the room tonight evan lifted his hat and bowing requested to know whether they could have a supper and beds beds sir cried the hostess what am i to do for beds yes beds indeed you may have but bed roomsif you ask for them it really is more than i can supply you with i have given up my own i sleep with my maid jane to night anything will do for us madam replied evan renewing his foreign courtesy but there is a poor young woman outside another the hostess instantly smiled down her inhospitable outcry she said evan must have a room to herself she is ill must is must sir returned the gracious hostess but i really havent the means you have bed rooms madam every one of them engaged sir by ladies madam lord forbid sir she exclaimed with the honest energy of a woman who knew her sex evan bade jack go and assist the waggoner to bring in the girl jack who had been all the time pulling at his wristbands and settling his coat collar by the dim reflection of a window of the bar departed after on his own authority assuring the hostess that fever was not the young womans malady as she protested against admitting fever into her house seeing that she had to consider her guests were open to all the world to night except fever said the hostess yes she rejoined to evans order that the waggoner and his mate should be supplied with ale they shall have as much as they can drink which is not a speech usual at inns when one man gives an order for others but evan passed it by and politely begged to be shown in to one of the gentlemen who had engaged bedrooms oh if you can persuade any of them sir im sure ive nothing to say observed the hostess pray dont ask me to stand by and back it thats all had evan been familiar with the green dragon he would have noticed that the landlady its presiding genius was stiffer than usual the rosy smile was more constrained as if a great host had to be embraced and were trying it to the utmost stretch there was however no asperity about her and when she had led him to the door he was to enter to prefer his suit and she had asked whether the young woman was quite common and he had replied that he had picked her up on the road and that she was certainly poor the hostess said im sure youre a very good gentleman sir and if i could spare your asking at all i would with that she went back to encounter mr raikes and his charge and prime the waggoner and his mate a noise of laughter and talk was stilled gradually as evan made his bow into a spacious room wherein as the tops of pines are seen swimming on the morning mist about a couple of dozen guests of divers conditions sat partially revealed through wavy clouds of tobacco smoke by their postures which evans appearance by no means disconcerted you read in a glance men who had been at ease for so many hours that they had no troubles in the world save the two ultimate perplexities of the british sybarite whose bed of roses is harassed by the pair of problems first what to do with his legs secondly how to imbibe liquor with the slightest possible derangement of those members subordinate to his upper structure of old the sybarite complained not so our self helpful islanders since they could not now that work was done and jollity the game take off their legs they got away from them as far as they might in fashions original or imitative some by thrusting them out at full length some by cramping them under their chairs while some taking refuge in a mental effort forgot them a process to be recommended if it did not involve occasional pangs of consciousness to the legs of their neighbours we see in our cousins west of the great water who are said to exaggerate our peculiarities beings labouring under the same difficulty and intent on its solution as to the second problem that of drinking without discomposure to the subservient limbs the company present worked out this republican principle ingeniously but in a manner beneath the attention of the muse let clio record that mugs and glasses tobacco and pipes were strewn upon the table but if the guests had arrived at that stage when to reach the arm or arrange the person for a sip of good stuff causes moral debates and presents to the mind impediments equal to what would be raised in active men by the prospect of a great excursion it is not to be wondered at that the presence of a stranger produced no immediate commotion two or three heads were half turned such as faced him imperceptibly lifted their eyelids good evening sir said one who sat as chairman with a decisive nod good night aint it a jolly looking old fellow queried of the speaker in an under voice gad you dont expect me to be wishing the gentleman good bye do you retorted the former ha ha no to be sure answered the old boy and the remark was variously uttered that good night by a caprice of our language did sound like it good evenings how d ye dohow are ye good nights be off and be blowed to you observed an interpreter with a positive mind and another whose intelligence was not so clear but whose perceptions had seized the point exclaimed i never says it when i hails a chap but dash my buttons if i mightnt a done one day or another queer the chairman warmed by his joke added with a sharp wink ay it would be queer if you hailed good night in the middle of the day and this among a company soaked in ripe ale could not fail to run the electric circle and persuaded several to change their positions in the rumble of which evans reply if he had made any was lost few however were there who could think of him and ponder on that glimpse of fun at the same time and he would have been passed over had not the chairman said take a seat sir make yourself comfortable before i have that pleasure replied evan i i see where tis burst out the old boy who had previously superinduced a diversion hes going to ax if he cant have a bed a roar of laughter and dont you remember this day last year followed the cunning guess for awhile explication was impossible and evan coloured and smiled and waited for them i was going to ask said so shouted the old boy gleefully one of the gentlemen who has engaged a bed room to do me the extreme favour to step aside with me and allow me a moments speech with him long faces were drawn and odd stares were directed toward him in reply i see where tis the old boy thumped his knee aint it now speak up sir theres a lady in the case i may tell you thus much answered evan that it is an unfortunate young woman very ill who needs rest and quiet didnt i say so shouted the old boy but this time though his jolly red jowl turned all round to demand a confirmation it was not generally considered that he had divined so correctly between a lady and an unfortunate young woman there seemed to be a strong distinction in the minds of the company the chairman was the most affected by the communication his bushy eyebrows frowned at evan and he began tugging at the brass buttons of his coat like one preparing to arm for a conflict speak out sir if you please he said above boardno asidesno taking advantages you want me to give up my bed room for the use of your young woman sir evan replied quietly she is a stranger to me and if you could see her sir and know her situation i think she would move your pity i dont doubt it siri dont doubt it returned the chairman they all move our pity thats how they get over us she has diddled you and she would diddle me and diddle us alldiddle the devil i dare say when her time comes i dont doubt it sir to confront a vehement old gentleman sitting as president in an assembly of satellites requires command of countenance and evan was not browbeaten he held him and the whole room from where he stood under a serene and serious eye for his feelings were too deeply stirred on behalf of the girl to let him think of himself that question of hers what are you going to do with me implying such helplessness and trust was still sharp on his nerves gentlemen he said i humbly beg your pardon for disturbing you as i do but with a sudden idea that a general address on behalf of a particular demand must necessarily fail he let his eyes rest on one there whose face was neither stupid nor repellent and who though he did not look up had an attentive thoughtful cast about the mouth may i entreat a word apart with you sir evan was not mistaken in the index he had perused the gentleman seemed to feel that he was selected from the company and slightly raising his head carelessly replied my bed is entirely at your disposal resuming his contemplative pose on the point of thanking him evan advanced a step when up started the irascible chairman i dont permit it i wont allow it and before evan could ask his reasons he had rung the bell muttering they follow us to our inns now the baggages they must harry us at our inns we cant have peace and quiet at our inns in a state of combustion he cried out to the waiter here mark this gentleman has brought in a dirty wench pack her up to my bed room and lock her in lock her in and bring down the key agreeably deceived in the old gentlemans intentions evan could not refrain from joining the murmured hilarity created by the conclusion of his order the latter glared at him and added now sir youve done your worst sit down and be merry replying that he had a friend outside and would not fail to accept the invitation evan retired he was met by the hostess with the reproachful declaration on her lips that she was a widow woman wise in appearances and that he had brought into her house that night work she did not expect or bargain for rather since i must speak truth of my gentleman to silence her on the subject and save his ears than to propitiate her favour towards the girl evan drew out his constitutionally lean purse and dropped it in her hand praying her to put every expense incurred to his charge she exclaimed if dr pillie has his full sleep this night i shall be astonished and evan hastily led jack into the passage to impart to him that the extent of his resources was reduced to the smallest of sums in shillings i can beat my friend at that reckoning said mr raikes and they entered the room eyes were on him this had ever the effect of causing him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line asking the waiter carelessly for some light supper dish he suggested the various french with not that and the affable naming of another nor that dear me we shall have to sup on chops i believe evan saw the chairman scrutinizing raikes much as he himself might have done and he said bread and cheese for me raikes exclaimed really well my lord you lead and your taste is mine a second waiter scudded past and stopped before the chairman to say if you please sir the gentlemen upstairs send their compliments and will be happy to accept ha was the answer thought better of it have they lay for three more then five more i guess he glanced at the pair of intruders among a portion of the guests there had been a return to common talk and one had observed that he could not get that good evening and good night out of his head which had caused a friend to explain the meaning of these terms of salutation to him while another of a philosophic turn pursued the theme you see when we meets we makes a night of it so when we parts its good nightnatural aint it a proposition assented to and considerably dilated on but whether he was laughing at that or what had aroused the fit the chairman did not say gentle chuckles had succeeded his laughter by the time the bread and cheese appeared in the rear of the provision came three young gentlemen of whom the foremost lumped in singing to one behind him and you shall have little rosey they were clad in cricketing costume and exhibited the health and manners of youthful englishmen of station frolicsome young bulls bursting on an assemblage of sheep they might be compared to the chairman welcomed them a trifle snubbingly the colour mounted to the cheeks of mr raikes as he made incision in the cheese under their eyes knitting his brows fearfully as if at hard work the chairman entreated evan to desist from the cheese and pulling out his watch thundered time the company generally jumped on their legs and in the midst of a hum of talk and laughter he informed evan and jack that he invited them cordially to a supper up stairs and would be pleased if they would partake of it and in a great rage if they would not raikes was for condescending to accept evan sprang up and cried gladly sir and gladly would he have cast his cockney schoolmate to the winds in the presence of these young cricketers for he had a prognostication the door was open and the company of jolly yeomen tradesmen farmers and the like had become intent on observing all the ceremonies of precedence not one would broaden his back on the other and there was bowing and scraping and grimacing till farmer broadmead was hailed aloud and the old boy stepped forth and was summarily pushed through the chairman calling from the rear hulloa no names to night to which was answered lustily all right mr tom and the speaker was reproved with there you go at it again and out and up they hustled the chairman said quietly to evan as they were ascending the stairs we dont have names to night may as well drop titles which presented no peculiar meaning to evans mind and he smiled the usual smile to raikes at the door of the supper room the chairman repeated the same and with extreme affability and alacrity of abnegation the other rejoined oh certainly no wonder that he rubbed his hands with more delight than aristocrats and people with gentlemanly connections are in the habit of betraying at the prospect of refection for the release from bread and cheese was rendered overpoweringly glorious in his eyes by the bountiful contrast exhibited on the board before him chapter xii in which ale is shown to have one quality of wine to proclaim that yon ribs of beef and yonder ruddy britons have met is to furnish matter for an hours comfortable meditation digest the fact here the fates have put their seal to something nature clearly devised it was intended and it has come to pass a thing has come to pass which we feel to be right the machinery of the world then is not entirely dislocated there is harmony on one point among the mysterious powers who have to do with us apart from its eloquent and consoling philosophy the picture is pleasant you see two rows of shoulders resolutely set for action heads in divers degrees of proximity to their plates eyes variously twinkling or hypocritically composed chaps in vigorous exercise now leans a fellow right back with his whole face to the firmament ale is his adoration he sighs not till he sees the end of the mug now from one a laugh is sprung but as if too early tapped he turns off the cock and primes himself anew occupied by their own requirements these britons allow that their neighbours have rights no cursing at waste of time is heard when plates have to be passed disagreeable it is still duty field marshal duty the britons chief star shines here if one usurps more than his allowance of elbow room bring your charge against them that fashioned him work away to arrive at some compass yourself now the mustard ceases to travel and the salt the guests have leisure to contemplate their achievements laughs are more prolonged and come from the depths now ale which is to beef what eve was to adam threatens to take possession of the field happy they who following natures direction admitted not bright ale into their paradise till their manhood was strengthened with beef some impatient had thirsted had satisfied their thirst and the ale the light though lovely spirit with nothing to hold it down had mounted to their heads just as eve will do when adam is not mature just as she didalas now the ruins of the feast being removed and a clear course left for the flow of ale farmer broadmead facing the chairman rises he stands in an attitude of midway he speaks gentlemen taint fust time you and i be met here to salbrate this here occasion i say not fust time not by many a time taint well gentlemen i aint much of a speaker gentlemen as you know howsever here i be no denyin that im on my legs this heres a strange enough world and a mans a gentleman i say we ought for to be glad when we got m you know im coming to it shortly i aint much of a speaker and if you wants somethin new you must ax elsewhere but what i say isbang it heres good health and long life to mr tom up there no names shouts the chairman in the midst of a tremendous clatter farmer broadmead moderately disengages his breadth from the seat he humbly axes pardon which is accorded him with a blunt nod ale to beef what eve was to adam circulates beneath a dazzling foam fair as the first woman mr tom for the breach of the rules in mentioning whose name on a night when identities are merged we offer sincere apologies every other minute mr tom is toasted his parents who selected that day sixty years ago for his bow to be made to the world are alluded to with encomiums and float down to posterity on floods of liquid amber but to see all the subtle merits that now begin to bud out from mr tom the chairman and giver of the feast and also rightly to appreciate the speeches we require to be enormously charged with ale mr raikes did his best to keep his head above the surface of the rapid flood he conceived the chairman in brilliant colours and probably owing to the energy called for by his brain the legs of the young man failed him twice as he tried them attention was demanded mr raikes addressed the meeting the three young gentlemen cricketers had hitherto behaved with a certain propriety it did not offend mr raikes to see them conduct themselves as if they were at a play and the rest of the company paid actors he had likewise taken a position and had been the first to laugh aloud at a particular slip of grammar while his shrugs at the aspirates transposed and the pronunciation prevalent had almost established a free masonry between him and one of the three young gentlemen cricketersa fair haired youth with a handsome reckless face who leaned on the table humorously eyeing the several speakers and exchanging by words and laughs with his friends on each side of him but mr raikes had the disadvantage of having come to the table empty in stomachthirsty exceedingly and i repeat that as without experience you are the victim of divinely given eve so with no foundation to receive it upon are you the victim of good sound ale he very soon lost his head he would otherwise have seen that he must produce a wonderfully telling speech if he was to keep the position he had taken and had better not attempt one the three young cricketers were hostile from the beginning all of them leant forward calling attention loudly laughing for the fun to come gentlemen he said and said it twice the gap was wide and he said gentlemen again this commencement of a speech proves that you have made the plunge but not that you can swim at a repetition of gentlemen expectancy resolved into cynicism gien a help sang out a son of the plough to a neighbour of the orator hang it murmured another we aint such gentlemen as that comes to mr raikes was politely requested to tune his pipe with a gloomy curiosity as to the results of jacks adventurous undertaking and a touch of anger at the three whose bearing throughout had displeased him evan regarded his friend he too had drunk and upon emptiness bright ale had mounted to his brain a hero should be held as sacred as the grand llama so let no more be said than that he drank still nor marked the replenishing of his glass raikes cleared his throat for a final assault he had got an image and was dashing off but unhappily as if to make the start seem fair he was guilty of his reiteration gentlemen everybody knew that it was a real start this time and indeed he had made an advance and had run straight through half a sentence it was therefore manifestly unfair inimical contemptuous overbearing and base for one of the three young cricketers at this period to fling back weariedly and exclaim by the lord too many gentlemen here evan heard him across the table lacking the key of the speakers previous conduct the words might have passed as it was they to the ale invaded head of a young hero feeling himself the worlds equal and condemned nevertheless to bear through life the insignia of tailordom not unnaturally struck with peculiar offence there was arrogance too in the young man who had interposed he was long in the body and when he was not refreshing his sight by a careless contemplation of his finger nails looked down on his company at table as one may do who comes from loftier studies he had what is popularly known as the nose of our aristocracy a nose that much culture of the external graces and affectation of suavity are required to soften thereto were joined thin lips and arched brows birth it was possible he could boast hardly brains he sat to the right of the fair haired youth who with his remaining comrade a quiet smiling fellow appeared to be better liked by the guests and had been hailed once or twice under correction of the chairman as mr harry the three had distinguished one there by a few friendly passages and this was he who had offered his bed to evan for the service of the girl the recognition they extended to him did not affect him deeply he was called drummond and had his place near the chairmen whose humours he seemed to relish the ears of mr raikes were less keen at the moment than evans but his openness to ridicule was that of a man on his legs solus amid a company sitting and his sense of the samewhen he saw himself the victim of itacute his face was rather comic and under the shadow of embarrassment twitching and working for ideasmight excuse a want of steadiness and absolute gravity in the countenances of others the chairmans neighbour drummond whispered him laxley will get up a row with that fellow its young jocelyn egging him on said the chairman um added drummond its the friend of that talkative rascal thats dangerous if it comes to anything mr raikes perceived that his host desired him to conclude so lifting his voice and swinging his arm he ended allow me to propose to you the fly in amber in other words our excellent host embalmed in brilliant ale drink him and so let him live in our memories for ever he sat down very well contented with himself very little comprehended and applauded loudly the flyin number echoed farmer broadmead confidently and with clamour adding to a friend when both had drunk the toast to the dregs but what number that be or how many tis of em dishes me but thats nether here nor there the chairman and host of the evening stood up to reply welcomed by thundersthere ye be mr tom glad i lives to see ye and no names and long life to him this having subsided the chairman spoke first nodding you dont want many words and if you do you wont get em from me cries of got something better took up the blunt address youve been true to it most of you i like men not to forget a custom good reason so to be and a jolly good custom replied to both sentences as to the beef i hope you didnt find it tough as to the alei know all about that aha good rang the verdict all i can say is that this day next year it will be on the table and i hope that every one of you will meet tomwill meet me here punctually im not a parliament man so thatll do the chairmans breach of his own rules drowned the termination of his speech in an uproar re seating himself he lifted his glass and proposed the antediluvians farmer broadmead echoed the antediloovians appending as a private sentiment and dam rum chaps they were the antediluvians undoubtedly the toast of the evening were enthusiastically drunk and in an ale of treble brew when they had quite gone down mr raikes ventured to ask for the reason of their receiving such honour from a posterity they had so little to do with he put the question mildly but was impetuously snapped at by the chairman you respect men for their luck sir dont you dont be a hypocrite and say you dontyou do very well so do i thats why i drink the antediluvians our worthy host here drummond gravely smiling undertook to elucidate the case has a theory that the constitutions of the postdiluvians have been deranged and their lives shortened by the miasmas of the deluge i believe he carries it so far as to say that noah in the light of a progenitor is inferior to adam owing to the shaking he had to endure in the ark and which he conceives to have damaged the patriarch and the nervous systems of his sons its a theory you know they lived close on a thousand years hale heartyand no water said the chairman well exclaimed one some way down the table a young farmer red as a cocks comb no fools they eh master where theres ale would you drink water my hearty and back he leaned to enjoy the tribute to his wit a wit not remarkable but nevertheless sufficient in the noise it created to excite the envy of mr raikes who inveterately silly when not engaged in a contest now began to play on the names of the sons of noah the chairman lanced a keen light at him from beneath his bushy eyebrows before long he had again to call two parties to order to raikes laxley was a puppy to laxley mr raikes was a snob the antagonism was natural ale did but put the match to the magazine but previous to an explosion laxley who had observed evans disgust at jacks exhibition of himself and had been led to think by his conduct and clothes in conjunction that evan was his own equal a gentleman condescending to the society of a low born acquaintancehad sought with sundry propitiations intelligent glances light shrugs and such like to divide evan from jack he did this doubtless because he partly sympathized with evan and to assure him that he took a separate view of him probably evan was already offended or he held to jack as a comrade should or else it was that tailordom and the pride of his accepted humiliation bellowed in his ears every fresh minute nothing assume i incline to think that the more ale he drank the fiercer rebel he grew against conventional ideas of rank and those class barriers which we scorn so vehemently when we find ourselves kicking at them whatsoever the reason that prompted him he did not respond to laxleys advances and laxley disregarding him dealt with raikes alone in a tone plainly directed at him he said well harry tired of this the agriculturals are good fun but i cant stand much of the small cockney a blackguard who tries to make jokes out of the scriptures ought to be kicked harry rejoined with wet lips wopping stuff this ale whos that you want to kick somebody who objects to his bray i suppose mr raikes struck in across the table negligently thrusting out his elbow to support his head did you allude to me sir laxley inquired i alluded to a donkey sir raikes lifted his eyelids to the same level as laxleys a passing remark on that interesting animal his friend harry now came into the ring to try a fall are you an usher in a school he asked meaning by his looks what men of science in fisticuffs call business mr raikes started in amazement he recovered as quickly no sir not quite but i have no doubt i should be able to instruct you upon a point or two good manners for instance remarked the third young cricketer without disturbing his habitual smile or what comes from not observing them said evan unwilling to have jack over matched perhaps youll give me a lesson now harry indicated a readiness to rise for either of them at this juncture the chairman interposed harmony my ladsharmony to night farmer broadmead imagining it to be the signal for a song returned all right mr mr chair but we ant got pipes in yet pipes before harmony you know to night the pipes were summoned forthwith system appeared to regulate the proceedings of this particular night at the green dragon the pipes charged and those of the guests who smoked well fixed behind them celestial harmony was invoked through the slowly curling clouds in britain the goddess is coy she demands pressure to appear and great gulps of ale vastly does she swell the chests of her island children but with the modesty of a maid at the commencement precedence again disturbed the minds of the company at last the red faced young farmer led off with the rose and the thorn in that day chloe still lived nor were the amorous transports of strephon quenched mountainous inflationmouse like issue characterized the young farmers first verse encouraged by manifest approbation he now told chloe that he by heaven never would plant in that bosom a thorn with such a volume of sound as did indeed show how a lovers oath should be uttered in the ear of a british damsel to subdue her good cried mr raikes anxious to be convivial subsiding into impertinence he asked laxley could you tip us a strephonade sir rejoiced to listen to you im sure promise you my applause beforehand harry replied hotly will you step out of the room with me a minute have you a confession to make quoth jack unmoved have you planted a thorn in the feminine flower garden make a clean breast of it at the table confess openly and be absolved while evan spoke a word of angry reproof to raikes harry had to be restrained by his two friends the rest of the company looked on with curiosity the mouth of the chairman was bunched drummond had his eyes on evan who was gazing steadily at the three suddenly the fellow isnt a gentleman struck the attention of mr raikes with alarming force raikesand it may be because he knew he could do more than evan in this respectvociferated im the son of a gentleman drummond from the head of the table saw that a diversion was imperative he leaned forward and with a look of great interest said are you pray never disgrace your origin then if the choice were offered me i think i would rather have known his father said the smiling fellow yawning and rocking on his chair you would possibly have been exceedingly intimatewith his right foot said raikes the other merely remarked oh that is the language of the son of a gentleman the tumult of irony abuse and retort went on despite the efforts of drummond and the chairman it was odd for at farmer broadmeads end of the table friendship had grown maudlin two were seen in a drowsy embrace with crossed pipes and others were vowing deep amity and offering to fight the man that might desire it are ye a friend or are ye a foe was heard repeatedly and consequences to the career of the respondent on his choice of affirmatives to either of these two interrogations emphatically detailed it was likewise asked in reference to the row at the gentlemens end why doan they stand up and have t out they talks they speechifieswhy doan they fight for t and then be friendly wheres the yarmony mr chair i axesso please ye sang out farmer broadmead ay ay silence the chairman called mr raikes begged permission to pronounce his excuses but lapsed into a lamentation for the squandering of property bequeathed to him by his respected uncle and for whichas far as he was intelligiblehe persisted in calling the three offensive young cricketers opposite to account before he could desist harmony no longer coy burst on the assembly from three different sources a man who is given to liquor soared aloft with the maid of sweet seventeen who participated in the adventures of young molly and the kicking cow while the guests selected the chorus of the song that first demanded it evan probably thought that harmony was herself only when she came single or he was wearied of his fellows and wished to gaze a moment on the skies whose arms were over and around his young beloved he went to the window and threw it up and feasted his sight on the moon standing on the downs he could have wept at the bitter ignominy that severed him from rose and again he gathered his pride as a cloak and defied the world and gloried in the sacrifice that degraded him the beauty of the night touched him and mixed these feelings with mournfulness he quite forgot the bellow and clatter behind the beauty of the night and heaven knows what treacherous hope in the depths of his soul coloured existence warmly he was roused from his reverie by an altercation unmistakeably fierce raikes had been touched on a tender point in reply to a bantering remark of his laxley had hummed over bits of his oration amid the chuckles of his comrades unfortunately at a loss for a biting retort raikes was reduced to that plain confession of a lack of wit he offered combat ill tell you what said laxley i never soil my hands with a blackguard and a fellow who tries to make fun of scripture in my opinion is one a blackguarddo you hear but if youll give me satisfactory proofs that you really are what i have some difficulty in believingthe son of a gentlemanill meet you when and where you please fight him anyhow said harry ill take him myself after we finish the match to morrow laxley rejoined that mr raikes must be left to him then ill take the other said harry where is he evan walked round to his place i am here he answered and at your service will you fight cried harry there was a disdainful smile on evans mouth as he replied i must first enlighten you i have no pretensions to your blue blood or yellow if sir you will deign to challenge a man who is not the son of a gentleman and consider the expression of his thorough contempt for your conduct sufficient to enable you to overlook that fact you may dispose of me my friend here has it seems reason to be proud of his connections that you may not subsequently bring the charge against me of having led you to soil your handsas your friend there terms iti with all the willingness in the world to chastise you or him for your impertinence must first give you a fair chance of escape by telling you that my father was a tailor the countenance of mr raikes at the conclusion of this speech was a painful picture he knocked the table passionately exclaiming whod have thought it yet he had known it but he could not have thought it possible for a man to own it publicly indeed evan could not have mentioned it but for hot fury and the ale it was the ale in him expelling truth and certainly to look at him none would have thought it that will do said laxley lacking the magnanimity to despise the advantage given him you have chosen the very best means of saving your skins well come to you when our supply of clothes runs short added harry a snip pardon me said evan with his eyes slightly widening but if you come to me i shall no longer give you a choice of behaviour i wish you good night gentlemen i shall be in this house and am to be found here till ten oclock to morrow morning sir he addressed the chairman i must apologize to you for this interruption to your kindness for which i thank you very sincerely its good night now sir he pursued bowing and holding out his hand with a smile the chairman grasped it youre a hot headed young fool sir youre an ill tempered ferocious young ass cant you see another young donkey without joining company in kicks eh sit down and dont dare to spoil the fun any more you a tailor wholl believe it youre a nobleman in disguise didnt your friend say soha ha sit down he pulled out his watch and proclaiming that he was born into this world at the hour about to strike called for a bumper all round while such of the company as had yet legs and eyes unvanquished by the potency of the ale stood up to drink and cheer mark the waiter scurried into the room and to the immense stupefaction of the chairman and amusement of his guests spread the news of the immediate birth of a little stranger on the premises who was declared by dr pillie to be a lusty boy and for whom the kindly landlady solicited good luck to be drunk chapter xiii the match of fallow field against beckley the dramatic proportions to which ale will exalt the sentiments within us and our delivery of them are apt to dwindle and shrink even below the natural elevation when we look back on them from the hither shore of the river of sleepin other words wake in the morning and it was with no very self satisfied emotions that evan dressing by the full light of day reviewed his share in the events of the preceding night why since he had accepted his fate should he pretend to judge the conduct of people his superiors in rank and where was the necessity for him to thrust the fact of his being that abhorred social pariah down the throats of an assembly of worthy good fellows the answer was that he had not accepted his fate that he considered himself as good a gentleman as any man living and was in absolute hostility with the prejudices of society that was the state of the case but the evaporation of ale in his brain caused him to view his actions from the humble extreme of that delightful liquor of which the spirit had flown and the corpse remained having revived his system with soda water and finding no sign of his antagonist below mr raikes to disperse the sceptical dimples on his friends face alluded during breakfast to a determination he had formed to go forth and show on the cricket field for you know he observed they cant have any objection to fight one evan slightly colouring answered why you said up stairs you thought fighting duels disgraceful folly so it is so it is everybody knows that returned jack but what can a gentleman do be a disgraceful fool i suppose said evan and raikes went on with his breakfast as if to be such occasionally was the distinguished fate of a gentleman of which others not so happy in their birth might well be envious he could not help betraying that he bore in mind the main incidents of the festival over night for when he had inquired who it might be that had reduced his friend to wear mourning and heard that it was his father spoken by evan with a quiet sigh mr raikes tapped an egg and his flexible brows exhibited a whole bar of contending arguments within more than for the love of pleasure he had spent his money to be taken for a gentleman he naturally thought highly of the position having bought it but raikes appreciated a capital fellow and felt warmly to evan who moreover was feeding him if not born a gentleman this harrington had the look of one and was pleasing in female eyes as the landlady now present bore witness wishing them good morning and hoping they had slept well she handed to evan his purse telling him she had taken it last night thinking it safer for the time being in her pocket and that the chairman of the feast paid for all in the green dragon up to twelve that day he having been born between the hours and liking to make certain and that every year he did the same and was a seemingly rough old gentleman but as soft hearted as a chicken his name must positively not be inquired she said to be thankful to him was to depart asking no questions and with a dart in the bosom from those eyesthose eyes cried jack shaking his head at the landladys resistless charms i hope you was not one of the gentlemen who came and disturbed us last night sir she turned on him sharply jack dallied with the imputation but denied his guilt no it wasnt your voice continued the landlady a parcel of young puppies calling themselves gentlemen i know him its that young mr laxley and he the nephew of a bishop and one of the honourables and then the poor gals get the blame i call it a shame i do theres that poor young creature up stairssomebodys victim she is and nobodys to suffer but herself the little fool yes said raikes ah we regret these things in after life and he looked as if he had many gentlemanly burdens of the kind on his conscience its a wonder to my mind remarked the landlady when she had placidly surveyed mr raikes how young gals can let some of you men folk mislead em she turned from him huffily and addressed evan the old gentleman is gone sir he slept on a chair breakfasted and was off before eight he left word as the child was born on his birthright hed provide for it and pay the mothers bill unless you claimed the right im afraid he suspectedwhat i never never no but by what ive seen of younever will believe for you id say must be a gentleman whatever your company she asks one favour of you sirfor you to go and let her speak to you once before you go away for good shes asleep now and mustnt be disturbed will you do it by and by please to comfort the poor creature sir evan consented i am afraid also it was the landladys flattering speech made him without reckoning his means add that the young mother and her child must be considered under his care and their expenses charged to him the landlady was obliged to think him a wealthy as well as a noble youth and admiringly curtsied mr john raikes and mr evan harrington then strolled into the air and through a long courtyard with brewhouse and dairy on each side and a pleasant smell of baking bread and dogs winking in the sun cats at the corners of doors satisfied with life and turkeys parading and fowls strutting cocks that overset the dignity of mr raikes by awakening his imitative propensities certain white capped women who were washing in a tub laughed and one observed hes for all the world like the little bantam cock stickin self up in a crow against the spaniar and this and the landladys marked deference to evan induced mr raikes contemptuously to glance at our national blindness to the true diamond and worship of the mere plumes in which a person is dressed they passed a pretty flower garden and entering a smooth shorn meadow beheld the downs beautifully clear under sunlight and slowly sailing images of cloud at the foot of the downs on a plain of grass stood a white booth topped by a flag which signalled that on that spot fallowfield and beckley were contending a singular old gentleman a very singular old gentleman that raikes observed following an idea that had been occupying him we did wrong to miss him we ought to have waylaid him in the morning never miss a chance harrington what chance evan inquired those old gentlemen are very odd jack pursued very strange he wouldnt have judged me by my attire admetus flocks i guard yet am a god dress is nothing to those old cocks hes an eccentric i know it i can see it hes a corrective of cudford who is abhorrent to my soul to give you an instance now of what those old boys will doi remember my father taking me when i was quite a youngster to a tavern he frequented and we met one night just such an old fellow as this and the waiter told us afterwards that he noticed me particularly he thought me a very remarkable boypredicted great things for some reason or other my father never took me there again i remember our having a welsh rarebit there for supper and when the waiter last night mentioned a rarebit gad he started up before me i gave chase into my early youth however my father never took me to meet the old fellow again i believe it lost me a fortune evans thoughts were leaping to the cricket field or he would have condoled with mr raikes for a loss that evidently afflicted him still now it must be told that the ladys maid of mrs andrew cogglesby borrowed temporarily by the countess de saldar for service at beckley court had slept in charge of the countesss boxes at the green dragon the countess having told her with the candour of high born dames to their attendants that it would save expense and that besides admiral combleman whom she was going to see or sir perkins ripley her fathers old friend whom she should visit if admiral combleman was not at his mansionboth were likely to have full houses and she could not take them by storm an arrangement which left her upwards of twelve hours liberty seemed highly proper to maria conning this ladys maid a very demure young person she was at her bed room window as evan passed up the courtyard of the inn and recognized him immediately can it be him they mean thats the low tradesman was marias mysterious exclamation she examined the pair and added oh no it must be the tall one they mistook for the small one but mr harrington ought not to demean himself by keeping company with such and my lady should know of it my lady alighting from the lymport coach did know of it within a few minutes after evan had quitted the green dragon and turned pale as high born dames naturally do when they hear of a relatives disregard of the company he keeps a tailor my lady said scornful maria and the countess jumped and complained of a pin how did you hear of this conning she presently asked with composure oh my lady he was tipsy last night and kept swearing out loud he was a gentleman tipsy the countess murmured in terror she had heard of inaccessible truths brought to light by the magic wand of alcohol was evan intoxicated and his dreadful secret unlocked last night and who may have told you of this conning she asked maria plunged into one of the boxes and was understood to say that nobody in particular had told her but that among other flying matters it had come to her ears my brother is charity itself sighed the countess he welcomes high or low yes but my lady a tailor maria repeated and the countess agreeing with her scorn as she did could have killed her at least she would have liked to run a bodkin into her and make her scream in her position she could not always be charity itself nor is this the required character for a high born dame so she rarely affected it order a fly discover the direction mr harrington has taken spare me further remarks she said and maria humbly flitted from her presence when she was gone the countess covered her face with her hands even this creature would despise us she exclaimed the young lady encountered by mr raikes on the road to fallowfield was wrong in saying that beckley would be seen out before the shades of evening caught up the ball not one but two men of beckleythe last twocarried out their bats cheered handsomely by both parties the wickets pitched in the morning they carried them in again and plaudits renewed proved that their fame had not slumbered to stand before a field thoroughly aware that every successful stroke you make is adding to the hoards of applause in store for you is a joy to your friends an exasperation to your foes i call this an exciting situation and one as proud as a man may desire then again the two last men of an eleven are twins they hold one life between them so that he who dies extinguishes the other your faculties are stirred to their depths you become engaged in the noblest of rivalries in defending your own you fight for your comrades existence you are assured that the dread of shame if not emulation is making him equally wary and alert behold then the two bold men of beckley fighting to preserve one life under the shadow of the downs they stand beneath a glorious day and before a gallant company for there are ladies in carriages here there are cavaliers good county names may be pointed out the sons of first rate families are in the two elevens mingled with the yeomen and whoever can best do the business fallowfield and beckley without regard to rank have drawn upon their muscle and science one of the bold men of beckley at the wickets is nick frim son of the gamekeeper at beckley court the other is young tom copping son of squire copping of dox hall in the parish of beckley last year you must know fallowfield beat that is why nick frim a renowned out hitter good to finish a score brilliantly with a pair of threes has taken to blocking and mr tom cuts with caution though he loves to steal his runs and is usually dismissed by his remarkable cunning the field was ringing at a stroke of nick frims who had lashed out in his old familiar style at last and the heavens heard of it when evan came into the circle of spectators nick and tom were stretching from post to post might and main a splendid four was scored the field took breath with the heroes and presume not to doubt that heroes they are it is good to win glory for your country it is also good to win glory for your village a member of parliament sir george lowton notes this emphatically from the statesmans eminence to a group of gentlemen on horseback round a carriage wherein a couple of fair ladies reclined they didnt shout more at the news of the battle of waterloo now this is our peculiarity this absence of extreme centralization it must be encouraged local jealousies local rivalries local triumphsthese are the strength of the kingdom if you mean to say that crickets a the old squire speaking squire uplift of fallowfield remembered the saving presences and coughedgood thing im one with ye sir george encouraged egad they dont want much of that here give some of your lean london straws a strip o clean grass and a bit o liberty and youll do em a service what a beautiful hit exclaimed one of the ladies languidly watching the ascent of the ball beautiful d ye call it muttered the squire the ball indeed was dropping straight into the hands of the long hit off instantly a thunder rolled but it was beckley that took the joyful treblefallowfield the deeply cursing bass the long hit off he who never was known to miss a catchbutter fingered beasthe has let the ball slip through his fingers are there gods in the air fred linnington the unfortunate of fallowfield with a whole year of unhappy recollection haunting him in prospect ere he can retrieve his characterfred if he does not accuse the powers of the sky protests that he cannot understand it which means the same fallowfields defeatshould such be the result of the contesthe knows now will be laid at his door five men who have bowled at the indomitable beckleyans think the same albeit they are britons it abashes them they are not the men they were their bowling is as the bowling of babies and see nick who gave the catch and pretends he did it out of commiseration for fallowfield the ball has flown from his bat sheer over the booth if they dont add six to the score it will be the fault of their legs but no they rest content with a fiver and cherish their wind yet more they mean to do success does not turn the heads of these britons as it would of your frivolous foreigners and now small boys who represent the press here spread out from the marking booth announcing foremost and in larger type as it were quite in press style their opinionwhich is that fallowfield will get a jolly good hiding and vociferating that beckley is seventy nine ahead and that nick frim the favourite of the field has scored fifty one to his own cheek the boys are boys of both villages but they are british boysthey adore prowess the fallowfield boys wish that nick frim would come and live on their side the boys of beckley rejoice in possessing him nick is the wicketkeeper of the beckley eleven long limbed wiry keen of eye his fault as a batsman is that he will be a slashing hitter he is too sensible of the joys of a grand spanking hit a short life and a merry one has hitherto been his motto but there were reasons for nicks rare display of skill that woman may have the credit due to her and as there never was a contest of which she did not sit at the springs so is she the source of all superhuman efforts exhibited by men be it told that polly wheedle is on the field polly one of the upper housemaids of beckley court polly eagerly courted by fred linnington humbly desired by nick frima pert and blooming maidenwho while her suitors combat hotly for an undivided smile improves her holiday by instilling similar unselfish aspirations into the breasts of others between his enjoyment of society and the melancholy it engendered in his mind by reflecting on him the age and decrepitude of his hat mr john raikes was doubtful of his happiness for some time but as his taste for happiness was sharp he with a great instinct amounting almost to genius in its pursuit resolved to extinguish his suspicion by acting the perfectly happy man to do this it was necessary that he should have listeners evan was not enough and was besides unsympathetic he had not responded to jacks cordial assurances of his friendship in spite of anything uttered before they came into the field heat and lustre were now poured from the sky on whose soft blue a fleet of clouds sailed heavily nick frim was very wonderful no doubt he deserved that the gods should recline on those gold edged cushions above and lean over to observe him nevertheless the ladies were beginning to ask when nick frim would be out the small boys alone preserved their enthusiasm for nick as usual the men took a middle position theirs was the pleasure of critics which being founded on the judgement lasts long and is without disappointment at the close it was sufficient that the ladies should lend the inspiration of their bonnets to this fine match their presence on the field is another beautiful instance of the generous yielding of the sex simply to grace our amusement and their acute perception of the part they have to play mr raikes was rather shy of them at first but his acting rarely failing to deceive himself he began to feel himself the perfectly happy man he impersonated and where there were ladies he went and talked of days when he had creditably handled a bat and of a renown in the annals of cricket cut short by mysterious calamity the foolish fellow did not know that they care not a straw for cricketing fame his gaiety presently forsook him as quickly as it had come instead of remonstrating at evans restlessness it was he who now dragged evan from spot to spot he spoke low and nervously were watched there was indeed a man lurking near and moving as they moved with a speculative air writs were out against raikes he slipped from his friend saying never mind me that old amphitryons birthday hangs on till the meridian you understand his table invites he is not unlikely to enjoy my conversation what maynt that lead to seek me there evan strolled on relieved by the voluntary departure of the weariful funny friend he would not shake off but could not well link with a long success is better when seen at a distance of time and nick frim was beginning to suffer from the monotony of his luck fallowfield could do nothing with him he no longer blocked he lashed out at every ball and far flew every ball that was bowled the critics saw in this return to his old practices promise of nicks approaching extinction the ladies were growing hot and weary the little boys gasped on the grass but like cunning circulators of excitement spread a report to keep it up that nick on going to his wickets the previous day had sworn an oath that he would not lay down his bat till he had scored a hundred so they had still matter to agitate their youthful breasts and nicks gradual building up of tens and prophecies and speculations as to his chances of completing the hundred were still vehemently confided to the field amid a general mopping of faces evan did become aware that a man was following him the man had not the look of a dreaded official his countenance was sun burnt and open and he was dressed in a countrymans holiday suit when evan met his eyes they showed perplexity evan felt he was being examined from head to heel but by one unaccustomed to his part and without the courage to decide what he ought consequently to do while a doubt remained though his inspection was verging towards a certainty in his mind at last somewhat annoyed that the man should continue to dog him wherever he moved he turned on him and asked him what he wanted be you a muster eavn harrington esquire the man drawled out in the rustic music of inquiry that is my name said evan ay returned the man its somebody lookin like a lord and has a small friend wi shockin old hat and i see ye come out o the green dragn this mornini dont reckn theres eer a mistaak but i likes to make cock sure be you been to poortigal sir yes answered evan i have been to poortigal whats the name o the capital o portugal sir the man looked immensely shrewd and nodding his consent at the laughing reply added and there you was born sir youll excuse my boldness but i only does whats necessary evan said he was not born there no not born there thats good now sir did you happen to be born anywheres within smell o salt water yes answered evan i was born by the sea not far beyond fifty mile from fallfield here sir something less all right now im cock sure said the man now if youll have the kindness just to oblige me by he sped the words and the instrument jointly at evan takin that there letter ill say good bye sir and my works done for the day saying which he left evan with the letter in his hands evan turned it over curiously it was addressed to evan harrington esquire t of lymport a voice paralyzed his fingers the clear ringing voice of a young horsewoman accompanied by a little maid on a pony who galloped up to the carriage upon which squire uplift sir george lowton hamilton jocelyn and other cavaliers were in attendance here i am at last and beckleys in still how d ye do lady racial how d ye do sir george how d ye do everybody your servant squire we shall beat you harry says we shall soon be a hundred a

be fair now and im not going to be kissed on the field if you please squire here dorry will do instead dorry come and be kissed by the squire it was rose living and glowing rose who was the brilliant young amazon smoothing the neck of a mettlesome gray cob evans heart bounded up to her but his limbs were motionless the squire caught her smaller companion in his arms and sounded a kiss upon both her cheeks then settled her in the saddle and she went to answer some questions of the ladies she had the same lively eyes as rose quick saucy lips red and open for prattle rolls of auburn hair fell down her back for being a child she was allowed privileges to talk as her thoughts came as well as to wear her hair as it grew was a special privilege of this young person on horseback or elsewhere now i know what you want to ask me aunt shorne isnt it about my papa hes not come and he wont be able to come for a weekglad to be with cousin rosey i should think i am shes the nicest girl i ever

of his fingers and its swollen so its just like a great fat fir cone he cant write a bit and rests his hand on a table he wants to have me made to write with my left hand as well as my right as if i was ever going to have the gout in one of my fingers sir george lowton observed to hamilton jocelyn that melville must take to his tongue now i fancy he will said hamilton my father wont give up his nominee so i fancy hell try fallowfield of course we go in for the agricultural interest but theres a cantankerous old ruffian down herea brewer or somethinghes got half the votes at his bidding we

see a thing do come along as hard as you can im sure it was not miss dorothy retorted with the large eyes of innocence you said you wanted to see nick frim keeping the wicket and ferdinand laxley bowl and oh you know something you said about drummond forth now shall i tell upon you said rose no dont hastily replied the little woman blushing and the cavaliers laughed out and the ladies smiled and dorothy added it isnt much after all then come lets have it or i shall be jealous said the squire shall i tell rose asked slily its unfair to betray one of your sex rose remarked the sweetly smiling lady yes lady racialmaynt a woman have secrets dorothy put it with great natural earnestness and they all laughed aloud but i know a secret of roseys continued miss dorothy and if she tells upon me i shall tell upon her theyre out cried rose pointing her whip at the wickets good night to beckley tom coppings run out questions as to how it was done passed from mouth to mouth questions as to whether it was fair sprang from toms friends and that a doubt existed was certain the whole field was seen converging toward the two umpires farmer broadmead for fallowfield master nat hodges for beckley it really is a mercy theres some change in the game said mrs shorne waving her parasol its a charming game but it wants variety a little when do you return rose not for some time said rose primly i like variety very well but i dont seek it by running away the moment ive come no but my dear mrs shorne negligently fanned her face you will have to come with us i fear when we go your uncle accompanies us i really think the squire will too and mr forth is no chaperon even you understand that oh i can get an old mandont be afraid said rose or must i have an old woman aunt the lady raised her eyelids slowly on rose and thought if you were soundly whipped my little madam what a good thing it would be for you and that good thing mrs shorne was willing to do for rose she turned aside and received the salute of an unmistakable curate on foot ah mr parsley you lend your countenance to the game then the curate observed that sound churchmen unanimously supported the game bravo cried rose how i like to hear you talk like that mr parsley i didnt think you had so much sense you and i will have a game togethersingle wicket we must play for somethingwhat shall it be ohfor nothing the curate vacuously remarked thats for love you rogue exclaimed the squire come come none o that sirha ha oh very well well play for love said rose and ill hold the stakes my deareh you dear old naughty squirewhat do you mean rose laughed but she had all the men surrounding her and mrs shorne talked of departing why did not evan bravely march away why he asked himself had he come on this cricket field to be made thus miserable what right had such as he to look on rose consider however the young mans excuses he could not possibly imagine that a damsel who rode one day to a match would return on the following day to see it finished or absolutely know that unseen damsel to be rose jocelyn and if he waited it was only to hear her sweet voice once again and go for ever as far as he could fathom his hopes they were that rose would not see him but the hopes of youth are deep just then a toddling small rustic stopped in front of evan and set up a howl for his fayther evan lifted him high to look over peoples heads and discover his wandering parent the urchin when he had settled to his novel position surveyed the field and shouting fayther fayther here i bes on top of a gentleman made lusty signs which attracted not his father alone rose sang out who can lend me a penny instantly the curate and the squire had a race in their pockets the curate was first but rose favoured the squire took his money with a nod and a smile and rode at the little lad to whom she was saying here bonny boy this will buy you she stopped and coloured evan the child descended rapidly to the ground a bow and a few murmured words replied to her isnt this just like you my dear evan shouldnt i know that whenever i met you you would be doing something kind how did you come here you were on your way to beckley to london said evan to london and not coming over to see meus here the little fellows father intervened to claim his offspring and thank the lady and the gentleman and with his penny firmly grasped he who had brought the lady and the gentleman together was borne off a wealthy human creature before much further could be said between them the countess de saldar drove up my dearest rose and my dear countess and not louisa then and i am very glad to see you without attempting the endearing louisapassed the countess de saldar then admitted the presence of her brother think said rose he talks of going on straight from here to london that pretty pout will alone suffice to make him deviate then said the countess with her sweetest open slyness i am now on the point of accepting your most kind invitation our foreign habits allow us to visit thus early he will come with me evan tried to look firm and speak as he was trying to look rose fell to entreaty and from entreaty rose to command and in both was utterly fascinating to the poor youth luxuriouslywhile he hesitated and dwelt on this and that faint objectionhis spirit drank the delicious changes of her face to have her face before him but one day seemed so rich a boon to deny himself that he was beginning to wonder at his constancy in refusal and now that she spoke to him so pressingly devoting her guileless eyes to him alone he forgot a certain envious feeling that had possessed him while she was rattling among the other malesa doubt whether she ever cast a thought on mr evan harrington yes he will come cried rose and he shall ride home with me and my friend drummond and he shall have my grooms horse if he doesnt mind bob can ride home in the cart with polly my maid and hell like that because pollys always good funwhen theyre not in love with her then of course she torments them naturally said the countess mr evan harringtons final objection based on his not having clothes and so forth was met by his foreseeing sister i have your portmanteau packed in with me my dear brother conning has her feet on it i divined that i should overtake you evan felt he was in the toils after a struggle or two he yielded and having yielded did it with grace in a moment and with a power of self compression equal to that of the adept countess he threw off his moodiness as easily as if it had been his spanish mantle and assumed a gaiety that made the countesss eyes beam rapturously upon him and was pleasing to rose apart from the lead in admiration the countess had given hernot for the first time we mortals the best of us may be silly sheep in our likes and dislikes where there is no premeditated or instinctive antagonism we can be led into warm acknowledgement of merits we have not sounded this the countess de saldar knew right well rose now intimated her wish to perform the ceremony of introduction between her aunt and uncle present and the visitors to beckley court the countess smiled and in the few paces that separated the two groups whispered to her brother miss jocelyn my dear the eye glasses of the beckley group were dropped with one accord the ceremony was gone through the softly shadowed differences of a grand manner addressed to ladies and to males were exquisitely accomplished by the countess de saldar harrington harrington her quick ear caught on the mouth of squire uplift scanning evan her accent was very foreign as she said aloud we are entirely strangers to your gameyour creecket my brother and myself are scarcely english nothing save diplomacy are we adepts in you must be excessively dangerous madam said sir george hat in air even in that i fear we are babes and sucklings and might take many a lesson from you will you instruct me in your creecket what are they doing now it seems very unintelligibleindistinctis it not inasmuch as farmer broadmead and master nat hodges were surrounded by a clamorous mob shouting both sides of the case as if the loudest and longest winded were sure to wrest a favourable judgement from those two infallible authorities on the laws of cricket the noble game was certainly in a state of indistinctness the squire came forward to explain piteously entreated not to expect too much from a womans inapprehensive wits which he plainly promised under eyes that had melted harder men he would not his forbearance and bucolic gallantry were needed for he had the countesss radiant full visage alone her senses were dancing in her right ear which had heard the name of lady racial pronounced and a voice respond to it from the carriage into what a pit had she suddenly plunged you ask why she did not drive away as fast as the horses would carry her and fly the veiled head of demogorgon obscuring valley and hill and the shining firmament and threatening to glare destruction on her you do not know an intriguer she relinquishes the joys of life for the joys of intrigue this is her element the countess did feel that the heavens were hard on her she resolved none the less to fight her way to her object for where so much had conspired to favour herthe decease of the generous sir abraham harrington of torquay and the invitation to beckley courtcould she believe the heavens in league against her did she not nightly pray to them in all humbleness of body for the safe issue of her cherished schemes and in this how unlike she was to the rest of mankind she thought so she relied on her devout observances they gave her sweet confidence and the sense of being specially shielded even when specially menaced moreover tell a woman to put back when she is once clearly launched timid as she may be her light bark bounds to meet the tempest i speak of women who do launch they are not numerous but to the wise the minorities are the representatives indeed it is an intricate game said the countess at the conclusion of the squires explanation and leaned over to mrs shorne to ask her if she thoroughly understood it yes i suppose i do was the reply itrather than the amusement they find in it this lady had recovered mr parsley from rose but had only succeeded in making the curate unhappy without satisfying herself the countess gave her the shrug of secret sympathy we must not say so she observed aloudmost artlessly and fixed the squire with a bewitching smile under which her heart beat thickly as her eyes travelled from mrs shorne to the squire she had marked lady racial looking singularly at evan who was mounting the horse of bob the groom fine young fellow that said the squire to lady racial as evan rode off with rose an extremely handsome well bred young man she answered her eyes met the countesss and the countess after resting on their surface with an ephemeral pause murmured i must not praise my brother and smiled a smile which was meant to mean i think with you and thank you and love you for admiring him had lady racial joined the smile and spoken with animation afterwards the countess would have shuddered and had chills of dread as it was she was passably content lady racial slightly dimpled her cheek for courtesys sake and then looked gravely on the ground this was no promise it was even an indication as the countess read her of something beyond suspicion in the ladys mind but it was a sign of delicacy and a sign that her feelings had been touched from which a truce might be reckoned on and no betrayal feared she heard it said that the match was for honour and glory a match of two days duration under a broiling sun all for honour and glory was it not enough to make her despise the games of men for something better she played her game was for one hundred thousand pounds the happiness of her brother and the concealment of a horror to win a game like that was worth the trouble whether she would have continued her efforts had she known that the name of evan harrington was then blazing on a shop front in lymport i cannot tell the possessor of the name was in love and did not reflect smiling adieu to the ladies bowing to the gentlemen and apprehending all the homage they would pour out to her condescending beauty when she had left them the countesss graceful hand gave the signal for beckley she stopped the coachman ere the wheels had rolled off the muffling turf to enjoy one glimpse of evan and rose riding together with the little maid on her pony in the rear how suitable they seemed how happy she had brought them together after many difficultiesmight it not be it was surely a thing to be hoped for rose galloping freshly was saying to evan why did you cut off your moustache he neck and neck with her replied you complained of it in portugal and she portugals old times now to meand i always love old times im sorry and oh evan did you really do it for me and really just then flying through the air close to the darling of his heart he had not the courage to spoil that delicious question but dallying with the lie he looked in her eyes lingeringly this picture the countess contemplated close to her carriage two young gentlemen cricketers were strolling while fallowfield gained breath to decide which men to send in first to the wickets one of these stood suddenly on tiptoe and pointing to the pair on horseback cried with the vivacity of astonishment look there do you see that what the deuce is little rosey doing with the tailor fellow the countess though her cheeks were blanched gazed calmly in demogorgons face took a mental impression of the speaker and again signalled for beckley chapter xiv the countess describes the field of action now to clear up a point or two you may think the comic muse is straining human nature rather toughly in making the countess de saldar rush open eyed into the jaws of demogorgon dreadful to her she has seen her brother pointed out unmistakeably as the tailor fellow there is yet time to cast him off or fly with him is it her extraordinary heroism impelling her onward or infatuated rashness or is it her mere animal love of conflict the countess de saldar like other adventurers has her star they who possess nothing on earth have a right to claim a portion of the heavens in resolute hands much may be done with a star as it has empires in its gift so may it have heiresses the countesss star had not blinked balefully at her that was one reason why she went straight on to beckley again the countess was a born general with her star above with certain advantages secured with battalions of lies disciplined and zealous and with one clear prize in view besides other undeveloped benefits dimly shadowing forth the countess threw herself headlong into the enemys country but that you may not think too highly of this lady i must add that the trivial reason was the exciting causeas in many great enterprises this was nothing more than the simple desire to be located if but for a day or two on the footing of her present rank in the english country house of an offshoot of our aristocracy she who had moved in the first society of a foreign capitalwho had married a count a minister of his sovereign had enjoyed delicious high bred badinage with refulgent ambassadors could boast the friendship of duchesses and had been the amiable receptacle of their pardonable follies she who moreover heartily despised things englishthis lady experienced thrills of proud pleasure at the prospect of being welcomed at a third rate english mansion but then that mansion was beckley court we return to our first ambitions as to our first loves not that they are dearer to usquit that delusion our ripened loves and mature ambitions are probably closest to our hearts as they deserve to bebut we return to them because our youth has a hold on us which it asserts whenever a disappointment knocks us down our old loves with the bad natures i know in them are always lurking to avenge themselves on the new by tempting us to a little retrograde infidelity a schoolgirl in fallowfield the tailors daughter had sighed for the bliss of beckley court beckley court was her elysium ere the ardent feminine brain conceived a loftier summit fallen from that attained eminence she sighed anew for beckley court nor was this mere spiritual longing it had its material side at beckley court she could feel her foreign rank moving with our nobility as an equal she could feel that the short dazzling glitter of her career was not illusory and had left her something solid not coin of the realm exactly but yet gold she could not feel this in the cogglesby saloons among pitiable bourgeoisesmiddle class people daily soiled by the touch of tradesmen they dragged her down their very homage was a mockery let the countess have due credit for still allowing evan to visit beckley court to follow up his chance if demogorgon betrayed her there the count was her protector a woman rises to her husband but a man is what he is and must stand upon that she was positive evan had committed himself in some manner as it did not suit her to think so she at once encouraged an imaginary conversation in which she took the argument that it was quite impossible evan could have been so mad and others instanced his youth his wrongheaded perversity his ungenerous disregard for his devoted sister and his known weakness she replying that undoubtedly they were right so far but that he could not have said he himself was that horrible thing because he was nothing of the sort which faith in evans stedfast adherence to facts ultimately silenced the phantom opposition and gained the day with admiration let us behold the countess de saldar alighting on the gravel sweep of beckley court the footman and butler of the enemy bowing obsequious welcome to the most potent visitor beckley court has ever yet embraced the despatches of a general being usually acknowledged to be the safest sources from which the historian of a campaign can draw i proceed to set forth a letter of the countess de saldar forwarded to her sister harriet cogglesby three mornings after her arrival at beckley court and which if it should prove false in a few particulars does nevertheless let us into the state of the countesss mind and gives the result of that generals first inspection of the field of action the countesss epistolary english does small credit to her fallowfield education but it is feminine and flows more than her ordinary speech besides leaders of men have always notoriously been above the honours of grammar my dearest harriet your note awaited me no sooner my name announced than servitors in yellow livery with powder and buckles started before me and bowing one presented it on a salver a venerable butlermost impressive led the way in future my dear let it be de saldar de sancorvo that is our title by rights and it may as well be so in england english countess is certainly best always put the de but let us be systematic as my poor silva says he would be in the way here and had better not come till i see something he can do silva has great reliance upon me the farther he is from lymport my dearand imagine me harriet driving through fallowfield to beckley court i gave one peep at dubbinss as i passed the school still goes on i saw three little girls skipping and the old swing pole seminary for young ladies as bright as ever i should have liked to have kissed the children and given them bonbons and a holiday how sparing you english are of your crests and arms i fully expected to see the jocelyns over my bed but nofour posts totally without ornament sleep indeed must be the result of dire fatigue in such a bed the jocelyn crest is a hawk in jesses the elburne arms are or three falcons on a field vert how heraldry reminds me of poor papa the evenings we used to spend with him when he stayed at home studying it so diligently under his directions we never shall again sir franks jocelyn is the third son of lord elburne made a baronet for his patriotic support of the ministry in a time of great trouble the people are sometimes grateful my dear lord elburne is the fourteenth of his lineoriginally simple country squires they talk of the roses but we need not go so very far back as that i do not quite understand why a lords son should condescend to a baronetcy precedence of some sort for his lady i suppose i have yet to learn whether she ranks by his birth or his present title if so a young baronetcy cannot possibly be a gain one thing is certain she cares very little about it she is most eccentric but remember what i have told you it will be serviceable when you are speaking of the family the dinner hour six it would no doubt be full seven in town i am convinced you are half an hour too early i had the post of honour to the right of sir franks evan to the right of lady jocelyn most fortunately he was in the best of spiritsquite brilliant i saw the eyes of that sweet rose glisten on the other side of me sat my pet diplomatist and i gave him one or two political secrets which astonished him of course my dear i was wheedled out of them his contempt for our weak intellects is ineffable but a woman must now and then ingratiate herself at the expense of her sex this is perfectly legitimate tory policy at the table the opposition as andrew says not represented so to show that we were human beings we differed among ourselves and it soon became clear to me that lady jocelyn is the rankest of radicals my secret suspicion is that she is a person of no birth whatever wherever her money came from a fine womanyes still to be admired i suppose by some kind of men but totally wanting in the essentially feminine attractions there was no party so to say i will describe the people present beginning with the insignifacants first mr parsley the curate of beckley he eats everything at table and agrees with everything a most excellent orthodox young clergyman except that he was nearly choked by a fish bone and could not quite conceal his distressand really rose should have repressed her desire to laugh till the time for our retirementhe made no sensation i saw her eyes watering and she is not clever in turning it off in that nobody ever equalled dear papa i attribute the attack almost entirely to the tightness of the white neck cloths the young clergymen of the established church wear but my dear i have lived too long away from them to wish for an instant the slightest change in anything they think say or do the mere sight of this young man was most refreshing to my spirit he may be the shepherd of a flock this poor mr parsley but he is a sheep to one young person mr drummond forth a great favourite of lady jocelyns an old friend he went with them to the east nothing improper she is too cold for that he is fair with regular features very self possessed and readyyour english notions of gentlemanly but none of your men treat a woman as a woman we are either angels or good fellows or heaven knows what that is bad no exquisite delicacy no insinuating softness mixed with respect none of that hovering over the border as papa used to say none of that happy indefiniteness of manner which seems to declare i would love you if i might or i do but i dare not tell even when engaged in the most trivial attentionshanding a footstool remarking on the soup etc you none of you know how to meet a womans smile or to engage her eyes without boldnessto slide off them as it were gracefully evan alone can look between the eyelids of a woman i have had to correct him for to me he quite exposes the state of his heart towards dearest rose she listens to mr forth with evident esteem in portugal we do not understand young ladies having male friends hamilton jocelynall politics the stiff englishman not a shade of manners he invited me to drink wine before i had finished my bow his glass was emptythe man was telling an anecdote of lord livelyston you may be sure my dear i did not say i had seen his lordship seymour jocelyn colonel of hussars he did nothing but sigh for the cold weather and hunting all i envied him was his moustache for evan will you believe that the ridiculous boy has shaved then there is melville my dear diplomatist and here is another instance of our harrington luck he has the gout in his right hand he can only just hold knife and fork and is interdicted port wine and penmanship the dinner was not concluded before i had arranged that evan should resume gratuitously you know his post of secretary to him so here is evan fixed at beckley court as long as melville stays talking of him i am horrified suddenly they call him the great mel sir franks is most estimable i am sure as a man and redolent of excellent qualitiesa beautiful disposition very handsome he has just as much and no more of the english polish one ordinarily meets when he has given me soup or fish bowed to me over wine and asked a conventional question he has done with me i should imagine his opinions to be extremely good for they are not a multitude then his ladybut i have not grappled with her yet now for the women for i quite class her with the opposite sex you must know that before i retired for the night i induced conning to think she had a bad head ache and rose lent me her ladys maidthey call the creature polly a terrible talker she would tell all about the family rose has been speaking of evan it would have looked better had she been quietbut then she is so english here the countess breaks off to say that from where she is writing she can see rose and evan walking out to the cypress avenue and that no eyes are on them great praise being given to the absence of suspicion in the jocelyn nature the communication is resumed the night of the same day two days at beckley court are over and that strange sensation i had of being an intruder escaped from dubbinss and expecting every instant the old schoolmistress to call for me and expose me and take me to the dark room is quite vanished and i feel quite at home quite happy evan is behaving well quite the young nobleman with the women i had no fear of him he is really admirable with the meneasy and talks of sport and politics and makes the proper use of portugal he has quite won the heart of his sister heaven smiles on us dearest harriet we must be favoured my dear for evan is very troublesomedistressingly inconsiderate i left him for a dayremaining to comfort poor mamaand on the road he picked up an object he had known at school and this creature in shameful garments is seen in the field where rose and evan are ridingin a dreadful hatrose might well laugh at ithe is seen running away from an old apple woman whose fruit he had consumed without means to liquidate but of course he rushes bolt up to evan before all his grand company and claims acquaintance and evan was base enough to acknowledge him he disengaged himself so far well by tossing his purse to the wretch but if he knows not how to cut i assure him it will be his ruin resolutely he must cast the dust off his shoes or he will be dragged down to their level by the way as to hands and feet comparing him with the jocelyn men he has every mark of better blood not a question about it as papa would saywe have natures proof looking out on a beautiful lawn and the moon and all sorts of trees i must now tell you about the ladies here conning undid me to night while conning remains unattached conning is likely to be serviceable if evan would only give her a crumb she would be his most faithful dog i fear he cannot be induced and conning will be snapped up by somebody else you know how susceptible she is behind her primnessshe will be of no use on earth and i shall find excuse to send her back immediately after all her appearance here was all that was wanted mrs melville and her dreadful juvenile are here as you may imaginethe complete englishwoman i smile on her but i could laugh to see the crows feet under her eyes on her white skin and those ringlets is really too ridiculous then there is a miss carrington lady jocelyns cousin aged thirty twoif she has not tampered with the register of her birth i should think her equal to it between dark and fair always in love with some man conning tells me she hears roses maid polly hinted the same she has a little money but my sympathies have been excited by a little cripplea niece of lady jocelyns and the favourite grand daughter of the rich old mrs bonneralso herejuliana bonner her age must be twenty you would take her for ten in spite of her immense expectations the jocelyns hate her they can hardly be civil to her it is the poor childs temper she has already begun to watch dear evancertainly the handsomest of the men here as yet though i grant you they are well grown men these jocelyns for an untravelled englishwoman i fear dear harriet we have been dreadfully deceived about rose the poor child has not in her own right much more than a tenth part of what we supposed i fear it was that mrs melville i have had occasion to notice her quiet boasts here she said this morning when mel is in the ministryhe is not yet in parliament i feel quite angry with the woman and she is not so cordial as she might be i have her profile very frequently while i am conversing with her with grandmama bonner i am excellent good friendsvenerable silver hair high caps etc more of this most interesting juliana bonner by and by it is clear to me that roses fortune is calculated upon the dear invalids death is not that harrowing it shocks me to think of it then there is mrs shorne she is a jocelynand such a history she married a wealthy manufacturerbartered her blood for his money and he failed and here she resides a bankrupt widow petitioning any man that may be willing for his love and a decent home andi say in charity mrs shorne comes here to morrow she is at present withguess my dearwith lady racial do not be alarmed i have met lady racial she heard evans name and by that and the likeness i saw she knew at once and i saw a truce in her eyes she gave me a tacit assurance of itshe was engaged to dine here yesterday and put it offprobably to grant us time for composure if she comes i do not fear her besides has she not reasons providence may have designed her for a staunch allyi will not say confederate would that providence had fixed this beautiful mansion five hundred miles from l though it were in a desolate region and that reminds me of the madre she is in health she always will be overbearingly robust till the day we are bereft of her there was some secret in the house when i was there which i did not trouble to penetrate that little jane f was therenot improved pray be firm about torquay estates mortgaged but hopes of saving a remnant of the property third son dont commit yourself there we dare not baronetize him you need not speak itimply more can be done that way and remember dear harriet that you must manage andrew so that we may positively promise his vote to the ministry on all questions when parliament next assembles i understood from lord livelyston that andrews vote would be thought much of a most amusing nobleman he pledged himself to nothing but we are above such a thing as a commercial transaction he must countenance silva women my dear have sent out armieswhy not fleets do not spare me your utmost aid in my extremity my dearest sister as for strike i refuse to speak of him he is insufferable and next to useless how can one talk with any confidence of relationship with a major of marines when i reflect on what he is and his conduct to caroline i have inscrutable longings to slap his face tell dear carry her husbands friendthe chairman or something of that wonderful company of strikesyou knowthe duke of belfield is coming here he is a blood relation of the elburnes therefore of the jocelyns it will not matter at all breweries i find are quite in esteem in your england it was highly commendable in his grace to visit you did he come to see the major of marines caroline is certainly the loveliest woman i ever beheld and i forgive her now the pangs of jealousy she used to make me feel andrew i hope has received the most kind invitations of the jocelyns he must come melville must talk with him about the votes of his abominable brother in fallowfield we must elect melville and have the family indebted to us but pray be careful that andrew speaks not a word to his odious brother about our location here it would set him dead against these hospitable jocelyns it will perhaps be as well dear harriet if you do not accompany andrew you would not be able to account for him quite thoroughly do as you likei do but advise and you know i may be trustedfor our sakes dear one i am working for carry to come with andrew beautiful women always welcome a prodigyif they wish to astonish the duke adieu heaven bless your babes the night passes and the countess pursues awakened by your fresh note from a dream of evan on horseback and a multitude hailing him count jocelyn for fallowfield a morning dream they might desire that he should change his name but count is preposterous though it may conceal something you say andrew will come and talk of his bringing caroline anything to give our poor darling a respite from her brute you deserve great credit for your managing of that dear little good natured piece of obstinate man i will at once see to prepare dear carolines welcome and trust her stay may be prolonged in the interest of common humanity they have her story here already conning has come in and says that young mr harry jocelyn will be here this morning from fallowfield where he has been cricketing the family have not spoken of him in my hearing he is not i think in good odour at homea scapegrace roses maid polly quite flew out when i happened to mention him and broke one of my laces these english maids are domesticated savage animals my chocolate is sent up exquisitely concocted in plate of the purest qualitylovely little silver cups i have already quite set the fashion for the ladies to have chocolate in bed the men i hear complain that there is no lady at the breakfast table they have miss carrington to superintend i read in the subdued satisfaction of her eyes completely without colour how much she thanks me and the institution of chocolate in bed poor miss carrington is no match for her opportunities one may give them to her without dread it is ten on the sabbath morn the sweet churchbells are ringing it seems like a dream there is nothing but the religion attaches me to england but thatis not that everything how i used to sigh on sundays to hear them in portugal i have an idea of instituting toilette receptions they will not please miss carrington so well now to the peaceful village church and divine worship adieu my dear i kiss my fingers to silva make no effort to amuse him he is always occupied breadhe asks no more adieu carry will be invited with your little man you unhappily unable she the sister i pine to see to show her worthy of my praises expectation and excitement adieu filled with pleasing emotions at the thought of the service in the quiet village church and worshipping in the principal pew under the blazonry of the jocelyn arms the countess sealed her letter and addressed it and then examined the name of cogglesby which plebeian name it struck her would not sound well to the menials of beckley court while she was deliberating what to do to conceal it she heard through her open window the voices of some young men laughing she beheld her brother pass these young men and bow to them she beheld them stare at him without at all returning his salute and then one of themthe same who had filled her ears with venom at fallowfieldturned to the others and laughed outrageously crying by jove this comes it strong fancy the snipocracy hereeh what the others said the countess did not wait to hear she put on her bonnet hastily tried the effect of a peculiar smile in the mirror and lightly ran down stairs chapter xv a capture the three youths were standing in the portico when the countess appeared among them she singled out him who was specially obnoxious to her and sweetly inquired the direction to the village post with the renowned gallantry of his nation he offered to accompany her but presently with a different exhibition of the same proposed that they should spare themselves the trouble by dropping the letter she held prominently in the bag thanks murmured the countess i will go upon which his eager air subsided and he fell into an awkward silent march at her side looking so like the victim he was to be that the countess could have emulated his power of laughter and you are mr harry jocelyn the very famous cricketer he answered glancing back at his friends that he was but did not know about the famous oh but i saw youi saw you hit the ball most beautifully and dearly wished my brother had an equal ability brought up in the court of portugal he is barely english there they have no manly sports you saw him pass you him who asked harry my brother on the lawn this moment your sweet sisters friend your uncle melvilles secretary whats his name said harry in blunt perplexity the countess repeated his name which in her pronunciation was hawington adding that was my brother i am his sister have you heard of the countess de saldar countess muttered harry dash it heres a mistake she continued with elegant fan like motion of her gloved fingers they say there is a likeness between us the dear queen of portugal often remarked it and in her it was a compliment to me for she thought my brother a model you i should have known from your extreme resemblance to your lovely young sister coarse food but then harry was a youthful englishman and the countess dieted the vanity according to the nationality with good wine to wash it down one can swallow anything the countess lent him her eyes for that purpose eyes that had a liquid glow under the dovelike drooping lids it was a principle of hers pampering our poor sex with swinish solids or the lightest ambrosia never to let the accompanying cordial be other than of the finest quality she knew that clowns even more than aristocrats are flattered by the inebriation of delicate celestial liquors now she said after harry had gulped as much of the dose as she chose to administer direct from the founts you must accord me the favour to tell me all about yourself for i have heard much of you mr harry jocelyn and you have excited my womans interest of me you know nothing havent i cried harry speaking to the pitch of his new warmth my uncle melville goes on about you tremendouslymakes his wife as jealous as fire how could i tell that was your brother your uncle has deigned to allude to me said the countess meditatively but not of himof you mr harry what does he say says youre so clever you ought to be a man ah generous exclaimed the countess the idea i think is novel to him is it not well i believe from what i hear he didnt back you for much over in lisbon said veracious harry i fear he is deceived in me now i fear i am but a womani am not to be backed but you are not talking of yourself oh never mind me was harrys modest answer but i do try to imagine me as clever as a man and talk to me of your doings indeed i will endeavour to comprehend you thus humble the countess bade him give her his arm he stuck it out with abrupt eagerness not against my cheek she laughed forgivingly and you need not start back half a mile she pursued with plain humour and please do not look irresolute and awkwardit is not necessary she added there and she settled her fingers on him i am glad i can find one or two things to instruct you in begin you are a great cricketer what else ay what else harry might well say he had no wish to talk of himself he did not know even how to give his arm to a lady the first flattery and the subsequent chiding clashed in his elated soul and caused him to deem himself one of the blest suddenly overhauled by an inspecting angel and found wanting or in his own more accurate style of reflection what a rattling fine woman this is and what a deuce of a fool she must think me the countess leaned on his arm with dainty languor you walk well she said harrys backbone straightened immediately no no i do not want you to be a drill sergeant can you not be told you are perfect without seeking to improve vain boy you can cricket and you can walk and will very soon learn how to give your arm to a lady i have hopes of you of your friends from whom i have ruthlessly dragged you i have not much am i personally offensive to them mr harry i saw them let my brother pass without returning his bow and they in no way acknowledged my presence as i passed are they gentlemen yes said harry stupefied by the question ones ferdinand laxley lord laxleys son heir to the title the others william harvey son of the chief justiceboth friends of mine but not of your manners interposed the countess i have not so much compunction as i ought to have in divorcing you from your associates for a few minutes i think i shall make a scholar of you in one or two essentials you do want polish have i not a right to take you in hand i have defended you already me cried harry none other than mr harry jocelyn will he vouchsafe to me his pardon it has been whispered in my ears that his ambition is to be the don juan of a country district and i have said for him that however grovelling his undirected tastes he is too truly noble to plume himself upon the reputation they have procured him why did i defend you women you know do not shrink from don juanseven provincial don juansas they should perhaps for their own sakes you are all of you dangerous if a woman is not strictly on her guard but you will respect your champion will you not harry was about to reply with wonderful briskness he stopped and murmured boorishly that he was sure he was very much obliged command of countenance the countess possessed in common with her sex those faces on which we make them depend entirely women can entirely control keenly sensible to humour as the countess was her face sidled up to his immovably sweet harry looked and looked away and looked again the poor fellow was so profoundly aware of his foolishness that he even doubted whether he was admired the countess trifled with his english nature quietly watched him bob between tugging humility and airy conceit and went on yes i will trust you and that is saying very much for what protection is a brother i am alone heredefenceless men of course grow virtuously zealous in an instant on behalf of the lovely dame who tells them bewitchingly she is alone and defenceless with pitiful dimples round the dewy mouth that entreats their guardianship and mercy the provincial don juan found wordsa sign of clearer sensations within he said upon my honour id look after you better than fifty brothers the countess eyed him softly and then allowed herself the luxury of a laugh no no it is not the sheep it is the wolf i fear and she went through a bit of the concluding portion of the drama of little red riding hood very prettily and tickled him so that he became somewhat less afraid of her are you truly so bad as report would have you to be mr harry she asked not at all in the voice of a censor pray dont think meaanything you wouldnt have me the youth stumbled into an apt response we shall see said the countess and varied her admiration for the noble creature beside her with gentle ejaculations on the beauty of the deer that ranged the park of beckley court the grand old oaks and beeches the clumps of flowering laurel and the rich air swarming summer she swept out her arm and this most magnificent estate will be yours how happy will she be who is led hither to reside by you mr harry mine no theres the bother he answered with unfeigned chagrin beckley isnt elburne property you know it belongs to old mrs bonner roses grandmama oh interjected the countess indifferently i shall never get itno chance harry pursued lost my luck with the old lady long ago he waxed excited on a subject that drew him from his shamefacedness it goes to juley bonner or to rosey its a toss up which if id stuck up to juley i might have had a pretty fair chance they wanted me to thats why i scout the premises but fancy juley bonner you couldnt upon your honour rhymed the countess and harry let loose a delighted ha ha as at a fine stroke of wit are we enamoured of a beautiful maiden senor harry not a bit he assured her eagerly i dont know any girl i dont care for em i dont really the countess impressively declared to him that he must be guided by her and that she might the better act his monitress she desired to hear the pedigree of the estate and the exact relations in which it at present stood toward the elburne family glad of any theme he could speak on harry informed her that beckley court was bought by his grandfather bonner from the proceeds of a successful oil speculation so we aint much on that side he said oil was the countesss weary exclamation i imagined beckley court to be your ancestral mansion oil harry deprecatingly remarked that oil was money yes she replied but you are not one to mix oil with your elburne blood let me seeoil that i conceive is grocery so you are grocers on one side oh come hang it cried harry turning red am i leaning on the grocers side or on the lords harry felt dreadfully taken down one ranks with ones father he said yes observed the countess but you should ever be careful not to expose the grocer when i beheld my brother bow to you and that your only return was to stare at him in that singular way i was not aware of this and could not account for it i declare im very sorry said harry with a nettled air do just let me tell you how it happened we were at an inn where there was an odd old fellow gave a supper and there was your brother and another fellowas thorough an upstart as i ever met and infernally impudent he got drinking and wanted to fight us now i see it your brother to save his friends bones said he was a tailor of course no gentleman could fight a tailor and it blew over with my saying wed order our clothes of him said he was a exclaimed the countess gazing blankly i dont wonder at your feeling annoyed returned harry i saw him with rosey next day and began to smell a rat then but laxley wont give up the tailor hes as proud as lucifer he wanted to order a suit of your brother to day but i saidnot while hes in the house however he came here the countess had partially recovered they were now in the village street and harry pointed out the post office your divination with regard to my brothers most eccentric behaviour was doubtless correct she said he wished to succour his wretched companion anywhereit matters not to him whathe allies himself with miserable mortals he is the modern samaritan you should thank him for saving you an encounter with some low creature swaying the letter to and fro she pursued archly i can read your thoughts you are dying to know to whom this dear letter is addressed instantly harry whose eyes had previously been quite empty of expression glanced at the letter wistfully shall i tell you yes do its to somebody i love are you in love then was his disconcerted rejoinder am i not married yes but every woman thats married isnt in love with her husband you know oh don juan of the provinces she cried holding the seal of the letter before him in playful reproof fie come who is it harry burst out i am not surely obliged to confess my correspondence to you remember she laughed lightly he already assumes the airs of a lord and master you are rapid mr harry wont you really tell me he pleaded she put a corner of the letter in the box must i all was done with the archest elegance the bewildering condescension of a goddess to a boor i dont say you must you know but i should like to see it returned harry there she showed him a glimpse of mrs cleverly concealing plebeian cogglesby and the letter slid into darkness are you satisfied yes said harry wondering why he felt a relief at the sight of mrs written on a letter by a lady he had only known half an hour and now said she i shall demand a boon of you mr harry will it be accorded she was hurriedly told that she might count upon him for whatever she chose to ask and after much trifling and many exaggerations of the boon in question he heard that she had selected him as her cavalier for the day and that he was to consent to accompany her to the village church is it so great a request the desire that you should sit beside a solitary lady for so short a space she asked noting his rueful visage harry assured her he would be very happy but hinted at the bother of having to sit and listen to that fool of a parsley again assuring her and with real earnestness which the lady now affected to doubt that he would be extremely happy you know i havent been there for ages he explained i hear it she sighed aware of the credit his escort would bring her in beckley and especially with harrys grandmama bonner they went together to the village church the countess took care to be late so that all eyes beheld her stately march up the aisle with her captive beside her nor was her captive less happy than he professed he would be charming comic side play at the expense of mr parsley she mingled with exceeding devoutness and a serious attention to mr parsleys discourse in her heart this lady really thought her confessed daily sins forgiven her by the recovery of the lost sheep to mr parsleys fold the results of this small passage of arms were that evans disclosure at fallowfield was annulled in the mind of harry jocelyn and the latter gentleman became the happy slave of the countess de saldar chapter xvi leads to a small skirmish between rose and evan lady jocelyn belonged properly to that order which the sultans and the roxalanas of earth combine to exclude from their little games under the designation of blues or strong minded women a kind if genuine the least dangerous and staunchest of the sex as poor fellows learn when the flippant and the frail fair have made mummies of them she had the frankness of her daughter the same direct eyes and firm step a face without shadows though no longer bright with youth it may be charged to her as one of the errors of her strong mind that she believed friendship practicable between men and women young or old she knew the world pretty well and was not amazed by extraordinary accidents but as she herself continued to be an example of her faith we must presume it natural that her delusion should cling to her she welcomed evan as her daughters friend walked half way across the room to meet him on his introduction to her and with the simple words i have heard of you let him see that he stood upon his merits in her house the young mans spirit caught something of hers even in their first interview and at once mounted to that level unconsciously he felt that she took and would take him for what he was and he rose to his worth in the society she presided over a youth like evan could not perceive that in loving this ladys daughter and accepting the place she offered him he was guilty of a breach of confidence or reflect that her entire absence of suspicion imposed upon him a corresponding honesty toward her he fell into a blindness without dreaming for a moment that she designed to encourage his passion for rose he yet beheld himself in the light she had cast on him and received as her daughters friend it seemed to him not so utterly monstrous that he might be her daughters lover a haughty a grand or a too familiar manner would have kept his eyes clearer on his true condition lady jocelyn spoke to his secret nature and eclipsed in his mind the outward aspects with which it was warring to her he was a gallant young man a fit companion for rose and when she and sir franks said and showed him that they were glad to know him his heart swam in a flood of happiness they little suspected this was another of the many forms of intoxication to which circumstances subjected the poor lover in fallowfield among impertinent young men evans pride proclaimed him a tailor at beckley court acted on by one genuine soul he forgot it and felt elate in his manhood the shades of tailordom dispersed like fog before the full south west breeze when i say he forgot it the fact was present enough to him but it became an outward fact he had ceased to feel it within him it was not a portion of his being hard as mrs mel had struck to fix it consequently though he was in a far worse plight than when he parted with rose on board the jocasta he felt much less of an impostor now this may have been partly because he had endured his struggle with the demogorgon the countess painted to him in such frightful colours and found him human after all but it was mainly owing to the hearty welcome lady jocelyn had extended to him as the friend of rose loving rose he nevertheless allowed his love no tender liberties the eyes of a lover are not his own but his hands and lips are till such time as they are claimed the sun must smile on us with peculiar warmth to woo us forth utterlypluck our hearts out rose smiled on many she smiled on drummond forth ferdinand laxley william harvey and her brother harry and she had the same eyes for all ages once previous to the arrival of the latter three there was a change in her look or evan fancied it they were going to ride out together and evan coming to his horse on the gravel walk saw her talking with drummond forth he mounted awaiting her and either from a slight twinge of jealousy or to mark her dainty tread with her riding habit drawn above her heels he could not help turning his head occasionally she listened to drummond with attention but presently broke from him crying its an absurdity speak to them yourselfi shall not on the ride that day she began prattling of this and that with the careless glee that became her well and then sank into a reverie between whiles her eyes had raised tumults in evans breast by dropping on him in a sort of questioning way as if she wished him to speak or wished to fathom something she would rather have unspoken ere they had finished their ride she tossed off what burden may have been on her mind as lightly as a stray lock from her shoulders he thought that the singular look recurred it charmed him too much for him to speculate on it the countesss opportune ally the gout which had reduced the hon melville jocelyns right hand to a state of uselessness served her with her brother equally for having volunteered his services to the invalided diplomatist it excused his stay at beckley court to himself and was a mask to his intimacy with rose besides earning him the thanks of the family harry jocelyn released from the wing of the countess came straight to him and in a rough kind of way begged evan to overlook his rudeness you took us all in at fallowfield except drummond he said drummond would have it you were joking i see it now and youre a confoundedly clever fellow into the bargain or you wouldnt be quill driving for uncle mel dont be uppish about itwill you you have nothing to fear on that point said evan with which promise the peace was signed between them drummond and william harvey were cordial and just laughed over the incident laxley however held aloof his retention of ideas once formed befitted his rank and station some trifling qualms attended evans labours with the diplomatist but these were merely occasioned by the iteration of a particular phrase mr goren an enthusiastic tailor had now and then thrown out to evan stirring hints of an invention he claimed the discovery of a balance in breeches apparently the philosophers stone of the tailor craft a secret that should ensure harmony of outline to the person and an indubitable accommodation to the most difficult legs since adams expulsion it seemed the tailors of this wilderness had been in search of it but like the doctors of this wilderness their science knew no specific like the babylonian workmen smitten with confusion of tongues they had but one word in common and that word was cut mr goren contended that to cut was not the key of the science but to find a balance was an artistic admirer of the frame of man mr goren was not wanting in veneration for the individual who had arisen to do it justice he spoke of his balance with supreme self appreciation nor less so the honourable melville who professed to have discovered the balance of power at home and abroad it was a capital balance but inferior to mr gorens the latter gentleman guaranteed a balance with motion whereas one step not only upset the honourable melvilles but shattered the limbs of europe let us admit that it is easier to fit a mans legs than to compress expansive empires evan enjoyed the doctoring of kingdoms quite as well as the diplomatist it suited the latent grandeur of soul inherited by him from the great mel he liked to prop austria and arrest the czar and keep a watchful eye on france but the honourable melvilles deep mouthed phrase conjured up to him a pair of colossal legs imperiously demanding their balance likewise at first the image scared him in time he was enabled to smile it into phantom vagueness the diplomatist diplomatically informed him it might happen that the labours he had undertaken might be neither more nor less than education for a profession he might have to follow out of this an ardent imagination with the countess de saldar for an interpreter might construe a promise of some sort evan soon had high hopes what though his name blazed on a shop front the sun might yet illumine him to honour where a young man is getting into delicate relations with a young woman the more of his sex the betterthey serve as a blind and the countess hailed fresh arrivals warmly there was sir john loring dorothys father who had married the eldest of the daughters of lord elburne a widower handsome and a flirt he capitulated to the countess instantly and was played off against the provincial don juan who had reached that point with her when youths of his description make bashful confidences of their successes and receive delicious chidings for their naughtinessrebukes which give immeasurable rebounds then came mr gordon graine with his daughter miss jenny graine an early friend of roses and numerous others for the present miss isabella current need only be chronicled among the visitorsa sprightly maid fifty years old without a wrinkle to show for itthe aunt bel of fifty houses where there were young women and little boys aunt bel had quick wit and capital anecdotes and tripped them out aptly on a sparkling tongue with exquisite instinct for climax and when to strike for a laugh no sooner had she entered the hall than she announced the proximate arrival of the duke of belfield at her heels and it was known that his grace was as sure to follow as her little dog who was far better paid for his devotion the dinners at beckley court had hitherto been rather languid to those who were not intriguing or mixing young love with the repast miss current was an admirable neutral sent as the countess fervently believed by providence till now the countess had drawn upon her own resources to amuse the company and she had been obliged to restrain herself from doing it with that unctuous feeling for rank which warmed her portuguese sketches in low society and among her sisters she retired before miss current and formed audience glad of a relief to her inventive labour while miss current and her ephemerals lightly skimmed the surface of human life the countess worked in the depths vanities passions prejudices beneath the surface gave her full employment how naturally poor juliana bonner was moved to mistake evans compassion for a stronger sentiment the countess eagerly assisted providence to shuffle the company into their proper places harry jocelyn was moodily happy but good greatly improved in the eyes of his grandmama bonner who attributed the change to the countess and partly forgave her the sinful consent to the conditions of her love match with the foreign count which his penitent wife had privately confessed to that strict churchwoman thank heaven that you have no children mrs bonner had said and the countess humbly replied it is indeed my remorseful consolation who knows that it is not your punishment added mrs bonner the countess weeping she went and attended morning prayers in mrs bonners apartments alone with the old lady to make up for lost time in catholic portugal she explained it to the household on the morning after miss current had come to shape the party most of the inmates of beckley court being at breakfast rose gave a lead to the conversation aunt bel i want to ask you something weve been making bets about you now answer honestly were all friends why did you refuse all your offers quite simple child replied the unabashed ex beauty a matter of taste i liked twenty shillings better than a sovereign rose looked puzzled but the men laughed and rose exclaimed now i see how stupid i am you mean you may have friends when you are not married well i think thats the wisest after all you dont lose them do you pray mr evan are you thinking aunt bel might still alter her mind for somebody if she knew his value i was presuming to hope there might be a place vacant among the twenty said evan slightly bowing to both am i pardoned i like you returned aunt bel nodding at him where do you come from a young man wholl let himself go for small coins a jewel worth knowing where do i come from drawled laxley who had been tapping an egg with a dreary expression aunt bel spoke to mr harrington said rose pettishly asked him where he came from laxley continued his drawl he didnt answer so i thought it polite for another of the twenty to strike in i must thank you expressly said evan and achieved a cordial bow rose gave evan one of her bright looks and then called the attention of ferdinand laxley to the fact that he had lost a particular bet made among them what bet asked laxley about the profession a stream of colour shot over roses face her eyes flew nervously from laxley to evan and then to drummond laxley appeared pleased as a man who has made a witty sally evan was outwardly calm while drummond replied to the mute appeal of rose by saying yes weve all lost but who could hit it the lady admits no sovereign in our sex so youve been betting about me said aunt bel ill settle the dispute let him who guessed latin pocket the stakes and if i guess him let him hand them over to me excellent cried rose one did guess latin aunt bel now tell us which one it was not you my dear you guessed temper no you dreadful aunt bel let me see said aunt bel seriously a young man would not marry a woman with latin but would not guess it the impediment gentlemen moderately aged are mad enough to slip their heads under any yoke but see the obstruction it was a man of forty guessed latin i request the hon hamilton everard jocelyn to confirm it amid laughter and exclamations hamilton confessed himself the man who had guessed latin to be the cause of miss currents remaining an old maid rose crying you really are too clever aunt bel a divergence to other themes ensued and then miss jenny graine said isnt juley learning latin i should like to join her while im here and so should i responded rose my friend evan is teaching her during the intervals of his arduous diplomatic labours will you take us into your class evan dont be silly girls interposed aunt bel do you want to graduate for my state with your eyes open evan objected his poor qualifications as a tutor and aunt bel remarked that if juley learnt latin at all she should have regular instruction i am quite satisfied said juley quietly of course you are rose snubbed her cousin so would anybody be but mama really was talking of a tutor for juley if she could find one theres a school at bodley but thats too far for one of the men to come over a school at bodley thought evan and his probationary years at the cudford establishment rose before him and therewith for the first time since his residence at beckley the figure of john raikes theres a friend of mine he said aloud i think if lady jocelyn does wish miss bonner to learn latin thoroughly he would do very well for the groundwork and would be glad of the employment he is very poor if hes poor and a friend of yours evan well have him said rose well ride and fetch him yes added miss carrington that must be quite sufficient qualification juliana was not gazing gratefully at evan for his proposal rose asked the name of evans friend his name is raikes answered evan i dont know where he is now he may be at fallowfield if lady jocelyn pleases i will ride over to day and see my dear evan cried rose you dont mean that absurd figure we saw on the cricket field she burst out laughing oh what fun it will be let us have him here by all means i shall not bring him to be laughed at said evan i will remember he is your friend rose returned demurely and again laughed as she related to jenny graine the comic appearance mr raikes had presented laxley waited for a pause and then said i have met this mr raikes as a friend of the family i should protest against his admission here in any office whatever into the upper part of the house at least he is not a gentleman we dont want teachers to be gentlemen observed rose this fellow is the reverse laxley pronounced and desired harry to confirm it but harry took a gulp of coffee oblige me by recollecting that i have called him a friend of mine said evan rose murmured to him pray forgive me i forgot laxley hummed something about taste aunt bel led from the theme by a lively anecdote after breakfast the party broke into knots and canvassed laxleys behaviour to evan which was generally condemned rose met the young men strolling on the lawn and with her usual bluntness accused laxley of wishing to insult her friend i speak to himdo i not said laxley what would you have more i admit the obligation of speaking to him when i meet him in your house out of itthats another matter but what is the cause for your conduct to him ferdinand by jove cried harry i wonder he puts up with it i wouldnt id have a shot with you my boy extremely honoured said laxley but neither you nor i care to fight tailors tailors exclaimed rose there was a sharp twitch in her body as if she had been stung or struck look here rose said laxley i meet him he insults me and to get out of the consequences tells me hes the son of a tailor and a tailor himself knowing that it ties my hands very well he puts himself hors de combat to save his bones let him unsay it and choose whether hell apologize or not and ill treat him accordingly at present im not bound to do more than respect the house i find he has somehow got admission to its clear it was that other fellow said harry casting a side glance up at the countesss window rose looked straight at laxley and abruptly turned on her heel in the afternoon lady jocelyn sent a message to evan that she wished to see him rose was with her mother lady jocelyn had only to say that if he thought his friend a suitable tutor for miss bonner they would be happy to give him the office at beckley court glad to befriend poor jack evan gave the needful assurances and was requested to go and fetch him forthwith when he left the room rose marched out silently beside him will you ride over with me rose he said though scarcely anxious that she should see mr raikes immediately the singular sharpness of her refusal astonished him none the less thank you no i would rather not a lover is ever ready to suspect that water has been thrown on the fire that burns for him in the bosom of his darling sudden as the change was it was very decided his sensitive ears were pained by the absence of his christian name which her lips had lavishly made sweet to him he stopped in his walk you spoke of riding to fallowfield is it possible you dont want me to bring my friend here theres time to prevent it judged by the countess de saldar the behaviour of this well born english maid was anything but well bred she absolutely shrugged her shoulders and marched a head of him into the conservatory where she began smelling at flowers and plucking off sere leaves in such cases a young man always follows as her womanly instinct must have told her for she expressed no surprise when she heard his voice two minutes after rose what have i done nothing at all she said sweeping her eyes over his a moment and resting them on the plants i must have uttered something that has displeased you no brief negatives are not re assuring to a lovers uneasy mind i beg yoube frank with me rose a flame of the vanished fire shone in her face but subsided and she shook her head darkly have you any objection to my friend her fingers grew petulant with an orange leaf eyeing a spot on it she said hesitatingly any friend of yours i am sure i should like to help butbut i wish you wouldnt associate with thatthat kind of friend it gives people all sorts of suspicions evan drew a sharp breath the voices of master alec and miss dorothy were heard shouting on the lawn alec gave dorothy the slip and approached the conservatory on tip toe holding his hand out behind him to enjoin silence and secrecy the pair could witness the scene through the glass before evan spoke what suspicions he asked rose looked up as if the harshness of his tone pleased her do you like red roses best or white was her answer moving to a couple of trees in pots cant make up your mind she continued and plucked both a white and red rose saying there choose your colour by and by and ask juley to sew the one you choose in your button hole she laid the roses in his hand and walked away she must have known that there was a burden of speech on his tongue she saw him move to follow her but this time she did not linger and it may be inferred that she wished to hear no more chapter xvii in which evan writes himself tailor the only philosophic method of discovering what a young woman means and what is in her mind is that zigzag process of inquiry conducted by following her actions for she can tell you nothing and if she does not want to know a particular matter it must be a strong beam from the central system of facts that shall penetrate her clearly there was a disturbance in the bosom of rose jocelyn and one might fancy that amiable mirror as being wilfully ruffled to confuse a thing it was asked by the heavens to reflect a good fight fought by all young people at a certain period and now and then by an old fool or two the young it seasons and strengthens the old it happily kills off and thus what is is made to work harmoniously with what we would have be after quitting evan rose hied to her friend jenny graine and in the midst of sweet millinery talk darted the odd question whether baronets or knights ever were tradesmen to which scottish jenny entirely putting aside the shades of beatified aldermen and the illustrious list of mayors that have welcomed royalty replied that it was a thing quite impossible rose then wished to know if tailors were thought worse of than other tradesmen jenny premising that she was no authority stated she imagined she had heard that they were why said rose no doubt because she was desirous of seeing justice dealt to that class but jennys bosom was a smooth reflector of facts alone rose pondered and said with compressed eagerness jenny do you think you could ever bring yourself to consent to care at all for anybody ever talked of as belonging to them tell me now jenny had come to beckley court to meet william harvey she was therefore sufficiently soft to think she could care for him whatever his origin were and composed in the knowledge that no natal stigma was upon him to try the strength of her affection designing to generalize as women do and seem tempted to do most when they are secretly speaking from their own emotions she said shyly moving her shoulders with a forefinger laying down the principle you know my dear if one esteemed such a person very very much and were quite sure without any doubt that he liked you in returnthat is completely liked you and was quite devoted and made no concealmenti mean if he was very superior and like other menyou know what i meanand had none of the cringing ways some of them havei mean supposing him gay and handsome taking just like william rose cut her short and we may guess her to have had some one in her head for her to conceive that jenny must be speaking of any one in particular a young lady who can have male friends as well as friends of her own sex is not usually pressing and secret in her confidences possibly because such a young lady is not always nursing baby passions and does not require her sexs coddling and posseting to keep them alive with rose love will be full grown when it is once avowed and will know where to go to be nourished merely an idea i had she said to jenny who betrayed her mental pre occupation by putting the question for the questions last her uncle melville next received a visit from the restless young woman to him she spoke not a word of the inferior classes but as a special favourite of the diplomatists begged a gift of him for her proximate birthday pushed to explain what it was she said its something i want you to do for a friend of mine uncle mel the diplomatist instanced a few of the modest requests little maids prefer to people they presume to have power to grant no its nothing nonsensical said rose i want you to get my friend evan an appointment you can if you like you know uncle mel and its a shame to make him lose his time when hes young and does his work so wellthat you cant deny now please be positive uncle mel you know i hatei have no faith in your nous verrons say you will and at once the diplomatist pretended to have his weather eye awakened you seem very anxious about feathering the young fellows nest rosey there cried rose with the maidens mature experience of us isnt that just like men they never can believe you can be entirely disinterested hulloa the diplomatist sung out i didnt say anything rosey she reddened at her hastiness but retrieved it by saying no but you listen to your wife you know you do uncle mel and now theres aunt shorne and the other women who make you think just what they like about me because they hate mama dont use strong words my dear but its abominable cried rose they asked mama yesterday what evans being here meant why of course hes your secretary and my friend and mama very properly stopped them and so will i as for me i intend to stay at beckley i can tell you dear old boy uncle mel had a soft arm round his neck and was being fondled and im not going to be bred up to go into a harem you may be sure the diplomatist whistled you talk your mother with a vengeance rosey and shes the only sensible woman i know said rose now promise mein earnest dont let them mislead you for you know youre quite a child out of your politics and i shall take you in hand myself why now think uncle mel wouldnt any girl as silly as they make me out hold her tonguenot talk of him as i do and because i really do feel for him as a friend see the difference between me and juley it was a sad sign if rose was growing a bit of a hypocrite but this instance of julianas different manner of showing her feelings toward evan would have quieted suspicion in shrewder men for juliana watched evans shadow and it was thought by two or three at beckley court that evan would be conferring a benefit on all by carrying off the romantically inclined but little presentable young lady the diplomatist with a placid well well ultimately promised to do his best for roses friend and then rose said now i leave you to the countess and went and sat with her mother and drummond forth the latter was strange in his conduct to evan while blaming laxleys unmannered behaviour he seemed to think laxley had grounds for it and treated evan with a sort of cynical deference that had for the last couple of days exasperated rose mama you must speak to ferdinand she burst upon the conversation drummond is afraid tohe can stand by and see my friend insulted ferdinand is insufferable with his pridehes jealous of everybody who has manners and drummond approves him and i will not bear it lady jocelyn hated household worries and quietly remarked that the young men must fight it out together no but its your duty to interfere mama said rose and i know you will when i tell you that ferdinand declares my friend evan is a tradesmanbeneath his notice why it insults me lady jocelyn looked out from a lofty window on such veritable squabbles of boys and girls as rose revealed cant you help them to run on smoothly while theyre here she said to drummond and he related the scene at the green dragon i think i heard he was the son of sir something harrington devonshire people said lady jocelyn yes he is cried rose or closely related im sure i understood the countess that it was so she brought the paper with the death in it to us in london and shed tears over it she showed it in the paper and shed tears over it said drummond repressing an inclination to laugh was her fathers title given in full sir abraham harrington replied rose i think she said father if the word wasnt too common place for her you can ask old tom when he comes if you are anxious to know said drummond to her ladyship his brother married one of the sisters by the way hes coming too he ought to clear up the mystery now youre sneering drummond said rose for you know theres no mystery to clear up drummond and lady jocelyn began talking of old tom cogglesby whom it appeared the former knew intimately and the latter had known the cogglesbys are sons of a cobbler rose said lady jocelyn you must try and be civil to them of course i shall mama rose answered seriously and help the poor countess to bear their presence as well as possible said drummond the harringtons have had to mourn a dreadful mesalliance pity the countess oh the countess the countess exclaimed rose to drummonds pathetic shake of the head she and drummond were fully agreed about the countess drummond mimicking the lady in verity she is most mellifluous while rose sugared her lips and leaned gracefully forward with de saldar let me petition yousince we must endure our titlesince it is not to be your louisa and her eyes sought the ceiling and her hand slowly melted into her drapery as the countess was wont to effect it lady jocelyn laughed but said youre too hard upon the countess the female euphuist is not to be met with every day its a different kind from the precieuse she is not a precieuse she has made a capital selection of her vocabulary from johnson and does not work it badly if we may judge by harry and melville euphuismaffectation dwin woman is the popular ideal of a duchess she has it by nature or she has studied it and if so you must respect her abilities yesharry said rose who was angry at a loss of influence over her rough brother any one could manage harry and uncle mels a goose you should see what a female euphuist dorry is getting she says in the countesss hearing rose i should in verity wish to play if it were pleasing to my sweet cousin im ready to die with laughing i dont do it mama the countess thus being discussed was closeted with old mrs bonner not idle like hannibal in italy she had crossed her alps in attaining beckley court and here in the enemys country the wary general found herself under the necessity of throwing up entrenchments to fly to in case of defeat sir abraham harrington of torquay who had helped her to cross the alps became a formidable barrier against her return meantime evan was riding over to fallowfield and as he rode under black visions between the hedgeways crowned with their hop garlands a fragrance of roses saluted his nostril and he called to mind the red and the white the peerless representative of the two had given him and which he had thrust sullenly in his breast pocket and he drew them out to look at them reproachfully and sigh farewell to all the roses of life when in company with them he found in his hand the forgotten letter delivered to him on the cricket field the day of the memorable match he smelt at the roses and turned the letter this way and that his name was correctly worded on the outside with an odd reluctance to open it he kept trifling over the flowers and then broke the broad seal and these are the words that met his eyes mr evan harrington you have made up your mind to be a tailor instead of a tomnoddy youre right not too many men in the worldplenty of nincompoops dont be made a weathercock of by a parcel of women i want to find a man worth something if you go on with it you shall end by riding in your carriage and cutting it as fine as any of them ill take care your belly is not punished while youre about it from the time your name is over your shop i give you per annum or stop theres nine of you they shall have per annum apiece times eh thats better than if you know how to reckon dont you wish it was ninety nine tailors to a man i could do that too and it would not break me so dont be a proud young ass or ill throw my money to the geese lots of them in the world how many geese to a tailor go on for five years and i double it give it up and i give you up no question about me the first tailor can be paid his in advance by applying at the offices of messrs grist grays inn square grays inn let him say he is tailor no and show this letter signed agreed with your name in full at bottom this will domoney will be paidno questions one side or other so onthe whole nine the end of the year they can give a dinner to their acquaintance send in bill to messrs grist the advice to you to take the cash according to terms mentioned is advice of a friend ps you shall have your wine consult among yourselves and carry it by majority what wine its to be five carries it dozen and half per tailor per annumthats the limit it was certainly a very hot day the pores of his skin were prickling and his face was fiery and yet he increased his pace and broke into a wild gallop for a mile or so then suddenly turned his horses head back for beckley the secret of which evolution was that he had caught the idea of a plotted insult of laxleys in the letter for when the blood is up we are drawn the way the tide sets strongest and evan was prepared to swear that laxley had written the letter because he was burning to chastise the man who had injured him with rose sure that he was about to confirm his suspicion he read it again gazed upon beckley court in the sultry light and turned for fallowfield once more devising to consult mr john raikes on the subject the letter had a smack of crabbed age hardly counterfeit the savour of an old eccentrics sour generosity was there evan fell into bitter laughter at the idea of rose glancing over his shoulder and asking him what nine of him to a man meant he heard her clear voice pursuing him he could not get away from the mocking sound of rose beseeching him to instruct her on that point how if the letter were genuine he began to abhor the sight and touch of the paper for it struck division cold as death between him and his darling he saw now the immeasurable hopes his residence at beckley had lured him to rose had slightly awakened him this letter was blank day to his soul he saw the squalid shop the good stern barren spirited mother the changeless drudgery the existence which seemed indeed no better than what the ninth of a man was fit for the influence of his mother came on him once more dared he reject the gift if true no spark of gratitude could he feel but chained dragged at the heels of his fate he submitted to think it true resolving the next moment that it was a fabrication and a trap but he flung away the roses as idle as a painted cavalier upon a painted drop scene the figure of mr john raikes was to be observed leaning with crossed legs against a shady pillar of the green dragon eyeing alternately with an indifference he did not care to conceal the assiduous pecking in the dust of some cocks and hens that had strayed from the yard of the inn and the sleepy blinking in the sun of an old dog at his feet nor did evans appearance discompose the sad sedateness of his demeanour yes i am here still he answered evans greeting with a flaccid gesture dont excite me too much a little at a time i cant bear it how now what is it now jack said evan mr raikes pointed at the dog ive made a bet with myself he wont wag his tail within the next ten minutes i beg of you harrington to remain silent for both our sakes evan was induced to look at the dog and the dog looked at him and gently moved his tail ive lost cried raikes in languid anguish hes getting excited hell go mad were not accustomed to this in fallowfield evan dismounted and was going to tell him the news he had for him when his attention was distracted by the sight of roses maid polly wheedle splendidly bonneted who slipped past them into the inn after repulsing jacks careless attempt to caress her chin which caused him to tell evan that he could not get on without the society of intellectual women evan called a boy to hold the horse have you seen her before jack jack replied once your pensioner up stairs she comes to visit i do suspect there kinship is betwixt them ay one might swear them sisters shes a relief to the monotony of the petrified streetthe old man with the brown gaitered legs and the doubled up old woman with the crutch i heard the london horn this morning evan thrust the letter in his hands telling him to read and form an opinion on it and went in the track of miss wheedle mr raikes resumed his station against the pillar and held the letter out on a level with his thigh acting as it was his nature to do off the stage he had not exaggerated his profound melancholy of a light soil and with a tropical temperament he had exhausted all lively recollection of his brilliant career and in the short time since evan had parted with him sunk abjectly down into the belief that he was fixed in fallowfield for life his spirit pitied for agitation and events the horn of the london coach had sounded distant metropolitan glories in the ears of the exile in rustic parts sighing heavily raikes opened the letter in simple obedience to the wishes of his friend for he would have preferred to stand contemplating his own state of hopeless stagnation the sceptical expression he put on when he had read the letter through must not deceive us john raikes had dreamed of a beneficent eccentric old gentleman for many years one against whom haply he had bumped in a crowded thoroughfare and had with cordial politeness begged pardon of had then picked up his walking stick restored it venturing a witty remark retired accidentally dropping his card case subsequently to his astonishment and gratification receiving a pregnant missive from that old gentlemans lawyer or it so happened that mr raikes met the old gentleman at a tavern and by the exercise of a signal dexterity relieved him from a bone in his throat and reluctantly imparted his address on issuing from the said tavern or perhaps it was a lonely highway where the old gentleman walked and john raikes had his name in the papers for a deed of heroism nor was man ungrateful since he had eaten up his uncle this old gentleman of his dreams walked in town and countryonly and alas mr raikes could never encounter him in the flesh the muscles of his face therefore are no index to the real feelings of the youth when he had thoroughly mastered the contents of the letter and reflected that the dream of his luckhis angelic old gentlemanhad gone and wantonly bestowed himself upon evan harrington instead of the expectant and far worthier john raikes worthier inasmuch as he gave him credence for existing long ere he knew of him and beheld him manifest raikes retreated to the vacant parlour of the green dragon and there evan found him staring at the unfolded letter his head between his cramped fists with a contraction of his mouth evan was troubled by what he had seen up stairs and did not speak till jack looked up and said oh there you are well what do you think jack yesits all right raikes rejoined in most matter of course tone and then he stepped to the window and puffed a very deep breath indeed and glanced from the straight line of the street to the heavens with whom injured as he was he felt more at home now that he knew them capable of miracles is it a bad joke played upon me said evan raikes upset a chair its quite childish youre made a gentleman for life and you ask if its a joke played upon you its maddening therethere goes my hat with a vehement kick mr raikes despatched his ancient head gear to the other end of the room saying that he must have some wine and would and disdainful was his look at evan when the latter attempted to reason him into economy he ordered the wine drank a glass which coloured a new mood in him and affecting a practical manner said i confess i have been a little hurt with you harrington you left me stranded on the desert isle i thought myself abandoned i thought i should never see anything but the lengthening of an endless bill on my landladys facemy sole planet i was resigned till i heard my friend to lool this morning he kindled recollection but this is a tidy port and that was a delectable sort of young lady that you were riding with when we parted last she laughs like the true metal i suppose you know its the identical damsel i met the day before and owe it to for my run on the downsive a compliment ready made for her you think that letter written in good faith said evan look here mr raikes put on a calmness you got up the other night and said you were a tailora devotee of the cabbage and the goose why the notion didnt strike me is extraordinaryi ought to have known my man however the old gentleman who gave the supperhes evidently one of your beastly rich old ruffianly republicansspent part of his time in america i dare say put two and two together but as harrington desired plain prose mr raikes tamed his imagination to deliver it he pointed distinctly at the old gentleman who gave the supper as the writer of the letter evan in return confided to him his history and present position and mr raikes without cooling to his fortunate friend became a trifle patronizing you said your fatheri think i remember at old cudfordswas a cavalry officer a bold dragoon i did replied evan i told a lie we knew it but we feared your prowess harrington then they talked over the singular letter uninterruptedly and evan weak among his perplexities of position and sentiment wanting money for the girl up stairs for this distasteful comrades bill at the green dragon and for his own immediate requirements and with the bee buzzing of rose in his ears she despises you consented in a desperation ultimately to sign his name to it and despatch jack forthwith to messrs grist youll find its an imposition he said beginning less to think it so now that his name was put to the hated monstrous thing which also now fell to pricking at curiosity for he was in the early steps of his career and if his lady holding to pride despised himas he was tortured into the hypocrisy of confessing she justly might why then unless he was the sport of a farceur here seemed a gilding of the path of duty he could be serviceable to friends his claim on fair young roses love had grown in the short while so prodigiously asinine that it was a minor matter to constitute himself an old eccentrics puppet no more an imposition than its of virgil quoth the rejected usher it smells of a plot said evan its the best joke that will be made in my time said mr raikes rubbing his hands and now listen to your luck said evan i wish mine were like it and jack heard of lady jocelyns offer he heard also that the young lady he was to instruct was an heiress and immediately inspected his garments and showed the sacred necessity there was for him to refit in london under the hands of scientific tailors evan wrote him an introduction to mr goren counted out the contents of his purse which jack had reduced in his study of the pastoral game of skittles he confessed and calculated in a niggardly way how far it would go to supply the fellows wants sighing as he did it to think of jack installed at beckley court while jack comparing his luck with evans had discovered it to be dismally inferior oh confound those bellows you keep blowing he exclaimed i wish to be decently polite harrington but you annoy me excuse me pray but the most unexampled case of a lucky beggar that ever was knownand to hear him panting and ready to whimperits outrageous youve only to put up your name and there you arean independent gentleman by jove this isnt such a dull world john raikes thou livest in times i feel warm in the sun of your prosperity harrington now listen to me propound thou no inquiries anywhere about the old fellow who gave the supper humour his whimhe wont have it all fallowfield is paid to keep him secret i know it for a fact i plied my rustic friends every night eat you yer victuals and drink yer beer and none o yer pryins and peerins among we thats my rebuff from farmer broadmead and that old boy knows more than he will tell i saw his cunning old eye on cock be silent harrington let discretion be the seal of thy luck you can reckon on my silence said evan i believe in no such folly men dont do these things ha went mr raikes contemptuously of the two he was the foolisher fellow but quacks have cured incomprehensible maladies and foolish fellows have an instinct for eccentric actions telling jack to finish the wine evan rose to go did you order the horse to be fed did i order the feeding of the horse said jack rising and yawning no i forgot him who can think of horses now poor brute muttered evan and went out to see to him the ostler had required no instructions to give the horse a feed of corn evan mounted and rode out of the yard to where jack was standing bare headed in his old posture against the pillar of which the shade had rounded and the evening sun shone full on him over a black cloud he now looked calmly gay im laughing at the agricultural broadmead he said none o yer pryins and peerins he thought my powers of amusing prodigious dang un he do maak a chap laugh well harrington that sort of homage isnt much i admit raikes pursued theres something in a pastoral life after all pastoral muttered evan i was speaking of you at beckley and hope when youre there you wont make me regret my introduction of you keep your mind on old cudfords mutton bone i perfectly understood you said jack im presumed to be in luck ingratitude is not my faultim afraid ambition is console yourself with it or what you can get till we meethere or in london but the dragon shall be the address for both of us evan said and nodded trotting off chapter xviii in which evan calls himself gentleman the young cavalier perused that letter again in memory genuine or a joke of the enemy it spoke wakening facts to him he leapt from the spell rose had encircled him with strange that he should have rushed into his dream with eyes open but he was fully awake now he would speak his last farewell to her and so end the earthly happiness he paid for in deep humiliation and depart into that gray cold mist where his duty lay it is thus that young men occasionally design to burst from the circle of the passions and think that they have done it when indeed they are but making the circle more swiftly here was evan mouthing his farewell to rose using phrases so profoundly humble that a listener would have taken them for bitter irony he said adieu to herpronouncing it with a pathos to melt scornful princesses he tried to be honest and was as much so as his disease permitted the black cloud had swallowed the sun and turning off to the short cut across the downs evan soon rode between the wind and the storm he could see the heavy burden breasting the beacon point round which curled leaden arms and a low internal growl saluted him advancing the horse laid back his ears a last gust from the opposing quarter shook the furzes and the clumps of long pale grass and straight fell columns of rattling white rain and in a minute he was closed in by a hissing ring men thus pelted abandon without protest the hope of retaining a dry particle of clothing on their persons completely drenched the track lost everything in dense gloom beyond the white enclosure that moved with him evan flung the reins to the horse and curiously watched him footing on for physical discomfort balanced his mental perturbation and he who had just been chafing was now quite calm was that a shepherd crouched under the thorn the place betokened a shepherd but it really looked like a bundle of the opposite sex and it proved to be a woman gathered up with her gown over her head apparently mr evan harrington was destined for these encounters the thunder rolled as he stopped by her side and called out to her she heard him for she made a movement but without sufficiently disengaging her head of its covering to show him a part of her face bellowing against the thunder evan bade her throw back her garment and stand and give him up her arms that he might lift her on the horse behind him there came a muffled answer on a big sob as it seemed and as if heaven paused to hear the storm was mute could he have heard correctly the words he fancied he had heard sobbed were best bonnet the elements hereupon crashed deep and long from end to end like a table of titans passing a jest rain drops hard as hail were spattering a pool on her head evan stooped his shoulder seized the soaked garment and pulled it back revealing the features of polly wheedle and the splendid bonnet in ruinsall limp and stained polly blinked at him penitentially oh mr harrington oh aint i punished she whimpered in truth the maid resembled a well watered poppy evan told her to stand up close to the horse and polly stood up close looking like a creature that expected a whipping she was suffering poor thing from that abject sense of the lack of a circumference which takes the pride out of women more than anything note that in all material fashions as in all moral observances women demand a circumference and enlarge it more and more as civilization advances respect the mighty instinct however mysterious it seem oh mr harrington dont laugh at me said polly evan assured her that he was seriously examining her bonnet its the bonnet of a draggletail said polly giving up her arms and biting her under lip for the lift with some display of strength evan got the lean creature up behind him and polly settled there and squeezed him tightly with her arms excusing the liberty she took they mounted the beacon and rode along the ridge whence the west became visible and a washed edge of red over beckley church spire and the woods of beckley court and what have you been doing to be punished what brought you here said evan somebody drove me to fallowfield to see my poor sister susan returned polly half crying well did he bring you here and leave you no he wasnt true to his appointment the moment i wanted to go back and i to pay him out i determined id walk it where he shouldnt overtake me and on came the storm and my gown spoilt and such a bonnet who was the somebody hes a mr nicholas frim sir mr nicholas frim will be very unhappy i should think yes thats one comfort said polly ruefully drying her eyes closely surrounding a young man as a young woman must be when both are on the same horse they as a rule talk confidentially together in a very short time his are you cold when polly shivered and her oh no not very and a slight screwing of her body up to him as she spoke to assure him and herself of it soon made them intimate i think mr nicholas frim mustnt see us riding into beckley said evan oh my gracious ought i to get down sir polly made no move however is he jealous only when i make him he is thats very naughty of you yes i know it isall the wheedles are mother says we never go right till weve once got in a pickle you ought to go right from this hour said evan its dizenzydoes it said polly and then were ashamed to show it my poor susan went to stay with her aunt at bodley and then at our cousins at hillford and then she was off to lymport to drown her poor self i do believe when you met her and all because we cant bear to be seen when were in any of our pickles i wish you wouldnt look at me mr harrington you look very pretty its quite impossible i can now said polly with a wretched effort to spread open her collar i can see myself a fright like my miss rose did making a face in the looking glass when i was undressing her last night but do you know i would much rather nicholas saw us than somebody whos that miss bonner shed never forgive me is she so strict she only uses servants for spies said polly and since my miss rose comethough im up a stepim still a servant and miss bonnerd be in a fury to see mythough im sure were quite respectable mr harringtonmy having hold of you as im obliged to and cant help myself but shed say i ought to tumble off rather than touch her engaged with a little finger her engaged cried evan aint you sir quoth polly i understand you were going to be from my lady the countess we all think so at beckley why look how miss bonner looks at you and shes sure to have plenty of money this was pollys innocent way of bringing out a word about her own young mistress evan controlled any denial of his pretensions to the hand of miss bonner he said is it your mistresss habit to make faces in the looking glass ill tell you how it happened said polly but im afraid im in your way sir shall i get off now not by any means said evan make your arm tighter will that do asked polly evan looked round and met her appealing face over which the damp locks of hair straggled the maid was fair it was fortunate that he was thinking of the mistress speak on said evan but polly put the question whether her face did not want washing and so earnestly that he had to regard it again and compromised the case by saying that it wanted kissing by nicholas frim which set pollys lips in a pout im sure it wants kissing by nobody she said adding with a spasm of passion oh i know the colours of my bonnet are all smeared over it and im a dreadful fright evan failed to adopt the proper measures to make miss wheedles mind easy with regard to her appearance and she commenced her story rather languidly my miss rosewhat was it i was going to tell ohmy miss rose you must know mr harrington shes very fond of managing i can see that though i havent known her long before she gave up short frocks and she said to mr laxley whos going to marry her some day she didnt like my lady the countess taking mr harry to herself like that i cant a bear to speak his name but i suppose hes not a bit more selfish than the rest of men so mr laxley saidjust like the jealousy of menthey neednt talk of women im sure nobody can tell what we have to put up with we mustnt look out of this eye or out of the other but theyre up andoh dear me theres such a to do as never was knownall for nothing my good girl said evan recalling her to the subject matter with all the patience he could command where was i polly travelled meditatively back i do feel a little cold come closer said evan take this handkerchiefits the only dry thing i havecover your chest with it the shoulders feel wettest polly replied and they cant be helped ill tie it round my neck if youll stop sir there now im warmer to show how concisely women can narrate when they feel warmer polly started off so you know mr harrington mr laxley saidhe said to miss rose you have taken her brother and she has taken yours and miss rose said that was her own business and nobody elses and mr laxley said he was glad she thought it a fair exchange i heard it all and then miss rose saidfor she can be in a passion about some thingswhat do you mean ferdinand was her words i insist upon your speaking out miss rose always will call gentlemen by their christian names when she likes them thats always a sign with her and he wouldnt tell her and miss rose got awful angry and shes clever is my miss rose for what does she do mr harrington but begins praising you up so that she knew it must make him mad only because men cant abide praise of another man when its a woman that says itmeaning young lady for my miss rose has my respect however familiar she lets herself be to us that she likes the others may go and drown themselves are you took ill sir no said evan i was only breathing the doctors say its bad to take such long breaths remarked artless polly perhaps my arms are pressing you its the best thing they can do murmured evan dejectedly what sir go and drown themselves polly screwed her lips as if she had a pin between them and continued miss rose was quite sensible when she praised you as her friend she meant itevery word and then sudden what does mr laxley do but say you was something else besides friendworse or better and she was silent which made him savage i could hear by his voice and he said mr harrington you meant it if she did not no says she i know better hes as honest as the day out he flew and said such things he said mr harrington you wasnt fit to be miss roses friend even then she said she heard he had told lies about you to her mama and her aunts but her mama my lady laughed at him and she at her aunts then he said youoh abominable of him what did he say asked evan waking up why if i were to tell my miss rose some things of him polly went on shed never so much as speak to him another instant what did he say evan repeated i hate him cried polly its mr laxley that misleads mr harry who has got his good nature and means no more harm than he can help oh i didnt hear what he said of you sir only i know it was abominable because miss rose was so vexed and you were her dearest friend well and about the looking glass that was at night mr harrington when i was undressing of her miss rose has a beautiful figure and no need of lacing but id better get down now for heavens sake stay where you are i tell her she stands as if shed been drilled for a soldier polly quietly continued youre squeezing my arm with your elbow mr harrington it didnt hurt me so when i had her nearly undressed we were talking about this and that and you amongst emand i you know rather like you sir if youll not think me too boldshe started off by asking me what was the nickname people gave to tailors it was one of her whims i told her they were called snipsim off polly gave a shriek the horse had reared as if violently stung go on said evan hold hard and go on snipsoh and i told her they were called snips it is a word that seems to make you hate the idea i shouldnt like to hear my intended called snip oh hes going to gallop and off in a gallop polly was borne well said evan well i cant mr harrington i have to press you so cried polly and im bounced soi shall bite my tongue after a sharp stretch the horse fell to a canter and then trotted slowly and allowed polly to finish so miss rose was standing sideways to the glass and she turned her neck and just as id said snip i saw her saying it in the glass and you never saw anything so funny it was enough to make anybody laugh but miss rose she seemed as if she couldnt forget how ugly it had made her look she covered her face with her hands and she shuddered it is a wordsnip that makes you seem to despise yourself beckley was now in sight from the edge of the downs lying in its foliage dark under the grey sky backed by motionless mounds of vapour miss wheedle to her great surprise was suddenly though safely dropped and on her return to the ground the damsel instantly knew her place and curtseyed becoming gratitude for his kindness but he was off in a fiery gallop the gall of demogorgon in his soul whats that the leaves of the proud old trees of beckley court hiss as he sweeps beneath them what has suddenly cut him short is he diminished in stature are the lackeys sneering the storm that has passed has marvellously chilled the air his sister the countess once explained to him what demogorgon was in the sensation it entailed you are skinned alive said the countess evan was skinned alive fly wretched young man summon your pride and fly fly noble youth for whom storms specially travel to tell you that your mistress makes faces in the looking glass fly where human lips and noses are not scornfully distorted and get thee a new skin and grow and attain to thy natural height in a more genial sphere you ladies and gentlemen who may have had a matter to conceal and find that it is oozing out you whose skeleton is seen stalking beside you you know what it is to be breathed upon you too are skinned alive but this miserable youth is not only flayed he is doomed calmly to contemplate the hideous image of himself burning on the face of her he loves making beauty ghastly in vainfor he is two hours behind the dinner bellmr burley the butler bows and offers him viands and wine how can he eat with the phantom of rose there covering her head shuddering loathing him but he must appear in company he has a coat if he has not a skin let him button it and march boldly our comedies are frequently youths tragedies we will smile reservedly as we mark mr evan harrington step into the midst of the fair society of the drawing room rose is at the piano near her reclines the countess de saldar fanning the languors from her cheeks with a word for the diplomatist on one side a whisper for sir john loring on the other and a very quiet pair of eyes for everybody providence she is sure is keeping watch to shield her sensitive cuticle and she is besides exquisitely happy albeit outwardly composed for in the room sits his grace the duke of belfield newly arrived he is talking to her sister mrs strike masked by miss current the wife of the major has come this afternoon and andrew cogglesby who brought her chats with lady jocelyn like an old acquaintance evan shakes the hands of his relatives who shall turn over the leaves of the fair singers music book the young men are in the billiard room drummond is engaged in converse with a lovely person with giorgione hair which the countess intensely admires and asks the diplomatist whether he can see a soupon of red in it the diplomatists taste is for dark beauties the countess is dark evan must do duty by rose and now occurred a phenomenon in him instead of shunning her as he had rejoiced in doing after the jocasta scene ere she had wounded him he had a curious desire to compare her with the phantom that had dispossessed her in his fancy unconsciously when he saw her he transferred the shame that devoured him from him to her and gazed coldly at the face that could twist to that despicable contortion he was in love and subtle love will not be shamed and smothered love sits we must remember mostly in two hearts at the same time and the one that is first stirred by any of the passions to wakefulness may know more of the other than its owner why had rose covered her head and shuddered would the girl feel that for a friend if his pride suffered love was not so downcast but to avenge him for the cold she had cast on him it could be critical and evan made his bearing to her a blank this somehow favoured him with rose sheeps eyes are a dainty dish for little maids and we know how largely they indulge in it but when they are just a bit doubtful of the quality of the sheep let the good animal shut his lids forthwith for a time had she not been a little unkind to him in the morning she had since tried to help him and that had appeased her conscience for in truth he was a good young man those very words she mentally pronounced while he was thinking would she feel it for a friend we dare but guess at the puzzle young women present now and then but i should say that evan was nearer the mark and that the good young man was a sop she threw to that within her which wanted quieting and was thereby passably quieted perhaps the good young man is offended let us assure him of our disinterested graciousness is your friend coming she asked and to his reply said im glad and pitched upon a new songone that by hazard did not demand his attentions and he surveyed the company to find a vacant seat with a neighbour juley bonner was curled up on the sofa looking like a damsel who has lost the third volume of an exciting novel and is divining the climax he chose to avoid miss bonner drummond was leaving the side of the giorgione lady evan passed leisurely and drummond said you know mrs evremonde let me introduce you he was soon in conversation with the glorious haired dame excellently done my brother thinks the countess de saldar rose sees the matter coolly what is it to her but she had finished with song jenny takes her place at the piano and as rose does not care for instrumental music she naturally talks and laughs with drummond and jenny does not altogether like it even though she is not playing to the ear of william harvey for whom billiards have such attractions but at the close of the performance rose is quiet enough and the countess observes her sitting alone pulling the petals of a flower in her lap on which her eyes are fixed is the doe wounded the damsel of the disinterested graciousness is assuredly restless she starts up and goes out upon the balcony to breathe the night air mayhap regard the moon and no one follows her had rose been guiltless of offence evan might have left beckley court the next day to cherish his outraged self love love of woman is strongly distinguished from pure egoism when it has got a wound for it will not go into a corner complaining it will fight its duel on the field or die did the young lady know his origin and scorn him he resolved to stay and teach her that the presumption she had imputed to him was her own mistake and from this evan graduated naturally enough the finer stages of self deception downward a lover must have his delusions just as a man must have a skin but here was another singular change in evan after his ale prompted speech in fallowfield he was nerved to face the truth in the eyes of all save rose now that the truth had enmeshed his beloved he turned to battle with it he was prepared to deny it at any moment his burnt flesh was as sensitive as the countesss let rose accuse him and he would say this is true miss jocelynwhat then and behold rose confused and dumb let not another dare suspect it for the fire that had scorched him was in some sort healing though horribly painful but contact with the general air was not to be enduredwas death this i believe is common in cases of injury by fire so it befell that evan meeting rose the next morning was playfully asked by her what choice he had made between the white and the red and he dropping on her the shallow eyes of a conventional smile replied that unable to decide and form a choice he had thrown both away at which miss jocelyn gave him a look in the centre of his brows let her head slightly droop and walked off she can look serious as well as grimace was all that evan allowed himself to think and he strolled out on the lawn with the careless serenity of lovers when they fancy themselves heart free rose whipping the piano in the drawing room could see him go to sit by mrs evremonde till they were joined by drummond when he left her and walked with harry and apparently shadowed the young gentlemans unreflective face after which harry was drawn away by the appearance of that dark star the countess de saldar whom rose was beginning to detest jenny glided by william harveys side far off rose the young queen of friendship was left deserted on her music stool for a throne and when she ceased to hammer the notes she was insulted by a voice that cried from below go on rose its nice in the sun to hear you causing her to close her performances and the instrument vigorously rose was much behind her age she could not tell what was the matter with her in these little torments young people have to pass through they gain a rapid maturity let a girl talk with her own heart an hour and she is almost a woman rose came down stairs dressed for riding laxley was doing her the service of smoking one of her rose trees evan stood disengaged prepared for her summons she did not notice him but beckoned to laxley drooping over a bud while the curled smoke floated from his lips the very gracefullest of chimney potsis he not says the countess to harry whose immense guffaw fails not to apprise laxley that something has been said of him for in his dim state of consciousness absence of the power of retort is the prominent feature and when he has the suspicion of malicious tongues at their work all he can do is silently to resent it probably this explains his conduct to evan some youths have an acute memory for things that have shut their mouths the countess observed to harry that his dear friend mr laxley appeared by the cast of his face to be biting a sour apple grapes you mean laughed harry never mind shell bite at him when he comes in for the title anything crude will do rejoined the countess why are you not courting mrs evremonde naughty don oh shes occupiedcastles in possession besides and harry tried hard to look sly come and tell me about her said the countess rose laxley and evan were standing close together you really are going alone rose said laxley didnt i say sounless you wish to join us she turned upon evan i am at your disposal said evan rose nodded briefly i think ill smoke the trees said laxley perceptibly huffing you wont come ferdinand i only offered to fill up the gap one does as well as another rose flicked her whip and then declared she would not ride at all and gathering up her skirts hurried back to the house as laxley turned away evan stood before him the unhappy fellow was precipitated by the devil of his false position i think one of us two must quit the field if i go i will wait for you he said oh i understand said laxley but if its what i suppose you to mean i must decline i beg to know your grounds you have tied my hands you would escape under cover of superior station escape you have only to unsaytell me you have a right to demand it the battle of the sophist victorious within him was done in a flash as evan measured his qualities beside this young mans and without a sense of lying said i have he spoke firmly he looked the thing he called himself now the countess too was a dazzling shield to her brother the beautiful mrs strike was a completer vindicator of him though he had queer associates and talked oddly of his family that night in fallowfield very well sir i admit you manage to annoy me said laxley i can give you a lesson as well as another if you want it presently the two youths were seen bowing in the stiff curt style of those cavaliers who defer a passage of temper for an appointed settlement harry rushed off to them with a shout and they separated laxley speaking a word to drummond evanmost judiciously the countess thoughtjoining his fair sister caroline whom the duke held in converse drummond returned laughing to the side of mrs evremonde nearing whom the countess while one ear was being filled by harrys eulogy of her brothers recent handling of laxley and while her intense gratification at the success of her patient management of her most difficult subject made her smiles no mask heard is it not impossible to suppose such a thing a hush ensuedthe countess passed in the afternoon the jocelyns william harvey and drummond met together to consult about arranging the dispute and deputations went to laxley and to evan the former demanded an apology for certain expressions that day and an equivalent to an admission that mr harrington had said in fallowfield that he was not a gentleman in order to escape the consequences all the jocelyns laughed at his tenacity and gentleman began to be bandied about in ridicule of the arrogant lean headed adolescent evan was placable enough but dogged he declined to make any admission though within himself he admitted that his antagonist was not in the position of an impostor which he for one honest word among them would be exposed as being and which a simple exercise of resolution to fly the place would save him from being further lady jocelyn enjoyed the fun and still more the serious way in which her relatives regarded it this comes of rose having friends emily said mrs shorne there would have been a dispute to arrange between lady jocelyn and mrs shorne had not her ladyship been so firmly established in her phlegmatic philosophy she said quelle enfantillage i dare say rose was at the bottom of it she can settle it best defer the encounter between the boys until they see they are in the form of donkeys they will and then theyll run on together as long as their goddess permits indeed emily said mrs shorne i desire you by all possible means to keep the occurrence secret from rose she ought not to hear of it no i dare say she ought not returned lady jocelyn but i wager you she does you can teach her to pretend not to if you like ecce signum her ladyship pointed through the library window at rose who was walking with laxley and showing him her pearly teeth in return for one of his jokes an exchange so manifestly unfair that lady jocelyns womanhood indifferent as she was could not but feel that rose had an object in view which was true for she was flattering laxley into a consent to meet evan half way the ladies murmured and hummed of these proceedings and of roses familiarity with mr harrington and the countess in trepidation took evan to herself and spoke to him seriously a thing she had not done since her residence in beckley she let him see that he must be on a friendly footing with everybody in the house or go which latter alternative evan told her he had decided on yes said the countess and then you give people full warrant to say it was jealousy drove you hence and you do but extinguish yourself to implicate dear rose in love evan when you run away you dont live to fight another day she was commanded not to speak of love whatever it may be my dear said the countess mr laxley has used you ill it may be that you put yourself at his feet and his sister looked at him sighing a great sigh she had with violence stayed her mouth concerning what she knew of the fallowfield business dreading to alarm his sensitiveness but she could not avoid giving him a little slap it was only to make him remember by the smart that he must always suffer when he would not be guided by her evan professed to the jocelyns that he was willing to apologize to laxley for certain expressions determining to leave the house when he had done it the countess heard and nodded the young men sounded on both sides were accordingly lured to the billiard room and pushed together and when he had succeeded in thrusting the idea of rose from the dispute it did seem such folly to evans common sense that he spoke with pleasant bonhommie about it that done he entered into his acted part and towered in his conceit considerably above these aristocratic boors who were speechless and graceless but tigers for their privileges and advantages it will not be thought that the countess intended to permit her brothers departure to have toiled and yet more to have lied and fretted her conscience for nothing was as little her principle as to quit the field of action till she is forcibly driven from it is that of any woman going my dear she said coolly to morrow oh very well you are the judge and this creaturethe insolvent to the apple woman who is coming whom you would push herewill expose us without a soul to guide his conduct for i shall not remain and carry will not remain carry the countess gave a semisob carry must return to her brute meaning the gallant marine her possessor and the countess knowing that evan loved his sister caroline incidentally related to him an episode in the domestic life of major and mrs strike greatly redounding to the credit of the noble martinet for the discipline he upholds the countess said smiling at the stunned youth i would advise you to give her time to recover from one bruise she added you will do as it pleases you evan was sent rushing from the countess to caroline with whom the countess was content to leave him the young man was daintily managed caroline asked him to stay as she did not see him often and she brought it in at the close her home was not very happy she did not entreat him but looking resigned her lovely face conjured up the major to evan and he thought can i drive her back to her tyrant for so he juggled with himself to have but another day in the sunshine of rose andrew too threw out genial hints about the brewery old tom intended to retire he said and then they would see what they would see he silenced every word about lymport called him a brewer already and made absurd jokes that were serviceable stuff nevertheless to the countess who deplored to this one and to that the chance existing that evan might by the urgent solicitations of his brother in law give up diplomacy and its honours for a brewery and lucre of course evan knew that he was managed the memoirs of a managed man have yet to be written but if he be sincere he will tell you that he knew it all the time he longed for the sugar plum he knew it was naughty to take it he dared not for fear of the devil and he shut his eyes while somebody else popped it into his mouth and assumed his responsibility being man driven or chicaned is different from being managed being managed implies being led the way this other person thinks you should go altogether for your own benefit mind you are to see with her eyes that you may not disappoint your own appetites which does not hurt the flesh certainly but does damage the conscience and from the moment you have once succumbed that function ceases to perform its office of moral strainer so well after all was he not happier when he wrote himself tailor than when he declared himself gentleman so he now imagined till rose wishing him good night on the balcony and abandoning her hand with a steady sweet voice and gaze said how generous of you to forgive my friend dear evan and the ravishing little glimpse of womanly softness in her set his heart beating if he thought at all it was that he would have sacrificed body and soul for her chapter xix second despatch of the countess we do not advance very far in this second despatch and it will be found chiefly serviceable for the indications it affords of our generals skill in mining and addiction to that branch of military science for the moment i must beg that a little indulgence be granted to her purely business great haste something has happened an event i know not but events may flow from it a lady is here who has run away from the conjugal abode and lady jocelyn shelters her and is hospitable to another who is more concerned in this ladys sad fate than he should be this may be morals my dear but please do not talk of portugal now a fineish woman with a great deal of hair worn as if her maid had given it one comb straight down and then rolled it up in a hurry round one finger malice would say carrots it is called gold mr forth is in a glass house and is wrong to cast his sneers at perfectly inoffensive people perfectly impossible we can remain at beckley court togetherif not dangerous any means that providence may designate i would employ it will be like exorcising a demon always excuseable i only ask a little more time for stupid evan he might have little bonner now i should not object but her family is not so good now do attend at once obtain a copy of strikes company people you understandprospectuses tell me instantly if the captain evremonde in it is captain lawson evremonde pump strike excuse vulgar words whether he is not lord laxleys half brother strike shall be of use to us whether he is not mad captain es address oh when i think of strikebrute and poor beautiful uncomplaining carry and her shoulder but let us indeed most fervently hope that his grace may be balm to it we must not pray for vengeance it is sinful providence will inflict that always know that providence is quite sure to it comforts exceedingly oh that strike were altogether in the past tense no knowing what the duke might doa widower and completely subjugated it makes my bosom bound the man tempts me to the wickedest frenchy ideas there we progress with dear venerable mrs bonner truly piousinterested in your louisa she dreads that my husband will try to convert me to his creed i can but weep and saynever i need not say i have my circle to hear this ridiculous boy harry jocelyn grunt under my nose when he has led me unsuspectingly away from companyharriet dearest he thinks it a sigh but there is no time for laughing my maxim in any house isnever to despise the good opinion of the nonentities they are the majority i think they all look up to me but then of course you must fix that by seducing the stars my diplomatist praises my abilitiessir john loring my stylethe rest follow and i do not withhold my smiles and they are happy and i should be but that for ungrateful evans sake i sacrificed my peace by binding myself to a dreadful sort of half story i know i did not quite say it it seems as if sir as ghost were going to haunt me and then i have the most dreadful fears that what i have done has disturbed him in the other world can it be so it is not money or estates we took at all dearest and these excellent young curatesi almost wish it was protestant to speak a word behind a board to them and imbibe comfort for after all it is nothing and a word even from this poor thin mopy mr parsley might be relief to a poor soul in trouble catholics tell you that what you do in a good cause is redeemable if not exactly right and you know the catholic is the oldest religion of the two i would listen to the pope staunch protestant as i am in preference to king henry the eighth though as a woman i bear him no rancour for his wives werefools point blank no man was ever so manageable my diplomatist is getting liker and liker to him every day leaner of course and does not habitually straddle whiskers and morals i mean we must be silent before our prudish sister not a prude we talk diplomacy dearest he complains of the exclusiveness of the port of oporto and would have strict alliance between portugal and england with mutual privileges i wish the alliance and think it better to maintain the exclusiveness very trifling but what is life adieu one word to leave you laughing imagine her situation this stupid miss carrington has offended me she has tried to pump conning who i do not doubt gave her as much truth as i chose she should have in her well but the quandary of the wretched creature she takes conning into her confidencea horrible malady just covered by high neck dress skin and impossible that she can tell her engagedwho isguessmr george up her name is louisa carrington there was a louisa harrington once similarity of names perhaps of course i could not let her come to the house and of course miss c is in a state of wonderment and bad passions i fear i went straight to lady racial my dear there was nothing else for it but to go and speak she is truly a noble womanserves us in every way as she shouldmuch affected by sight of evan and keeps aloof from beckley court the finger of providence is in all adieu but do pray think of miss carrington it was foolish of her to offend me drives and walksthe duke attentive description of him when i embrace you i give amiable sir franks portuguese dishes ah my dear if we had none but men to contend against and only women for our tools but this is asking for the world and nothing less open again she pursues dear carry just come in there are fairies i think where there are dukes where could it have come from could any human being have sent messengers post to london ordered and had it despatched here within this short time you shall not be mystified i do not think i even hinted but the afternoon walk i had with his grace on the first day of his arrival i did shadow it very delicately how much it was to be feared our poor carry could not that she dared not betray her liege lord in an evening dress nothing more upon my veracity and carry has this moment received the most beautiful green box containing two of the most heavenly old lace shawls that you ever beheld we divine it is to hide poor carrys matrimonial blue mark we know nothing will you imagine carry is for not accepting it priority of birth does not imply superior wits dearno allusion to you i have undertaken all arch looks but nothing pointed his grace will understand the exquisite expression of feminine gratitude it is so sweet to deal with true nobility carry has only to look as she always does one sees strike sitting on her her very pliability has rescued her from being utterly squashed long ere this the man makes one vulgar it would have been not the slightest use asking me to be a christian had i wedded strike but think of the fairy presents it has determined me not to be expelled by mr forthquite tell silva he is not forgotten but my dear between us alone men are so selfish that it is too evident they do not care for private conversations to turn upon a ladys husband not to be risked only now and then i hear that the young ladies and the young gentlemen have been out riding a race the poor little bonner girl cannot ride and she says to carry that rose wishes to break our brothers neck the child hardly wishes that but she is feelingless if evan could care for miss bonner he might have b c oh it is not so very long a shot my dear i am on the spot remember old mrs bonner is a most just minded spirit juliana is a cripple and her grandmother wishes to be sure that when she departs to her lord the poor cripple may not be chased from this home of hers rose cannot calculateharry is in disgracethere is really no knowing this is how i have reckoned extra to rose perhaps or nothing to h all the rest of ready moneya large sumno use guessingto lady jocelyn and b c to little bonnerit is worth then she sells or stopspermanent resident it might be so soon for i can see worthy mrs bonner to be breaking visibly but young men will not see with wiser eyes than their own here is evan risking his neck for an indifferenttheres some word for not soft in short rose is the cold blooded novice as i have always said the most selfish of the creatures on two legs adieu would you have dreamed that major nightmares gallantry to his wife would have called forth a gallantry so truly touching and delicate can you not see providence there out of evilthe catholics again address if lord laxs half brother if wrong in noddle this i know you will attend to scrupulously ridiculous words are sometimes the most expressive once more may heaven bless you all i thought of you in church last sunday i may tell you this young mr laxley is here hebut it was evans utter madness was the cause and i have not ventured a word to him he compelled evan to assert his rank and mr forths face has been one concentrated sneer since then he must know the origin of the cogglesbys or something now you will understand the importance i cannot be more explicit onlythe man must go ps i have just ascertained that lady jocelyn is quite familiar with andrews origin she must think my poor harriet an eccentric woman of course i have not pretended to rank here merely gentry it is gentry in reality for had poor papa been legitimized he would have been a nobleman you know that and between the two we may certainly claim gentry i twiddle your little good andrew to assert it for us twenty times a day of all the dear little manageable men it does you infinite credit that you respect him as you do what would have become of me i do not know ps i said two shawlsa black and a white the black not so costlyvery well and so delicate of him to think of the mourning but the white my dear must be familymust old english point exquisitely chaste so different from that brussels poor andrew surprised you with i know it cost money but this is a question of taste the duke reconciles me to england and all my troubles he is more like poor papa than any one of the men i have yet seen the perfect gentleman i do praise myself for managing an invitation to our carry she has been a triumph admire the concluding stroke the countess calls this letter a purely business communication commercial men might hardly think so but perhaps ladies will perceive it she rambles concentrically if i may so expound her full of luxurious enjoyment of her position her mind is active and you see her at one moment marking a plot the next with a light exclamation appeasing her conscience proud that she has one again she calls up rival forms of faith that she may show the protestant its little shortcomings and that it is slightly in debt to her like providence for her constancy notwithstanding the protestant you see does not confess and she has to absolve herself and must be doing it internally while she is directing outer matters hence her slap at king henry viii in fact there is much more business in this letter than i dare to indicate but as it is both impertinent and unpopular to dive for any length of time beneath the surface especially when there are few pearls to show for it we will discontinue our examination the countess when she had dropped the letter in the bag returned to her chamber and deputed dorothy loring whom she met on the stairs to run and request rose to lend her her album to beguile the afternoon with and dorothy dances to rose saying the countess de lispy lispy would be delighted to look at your album all the afternoon oh what a woman that is says rose countess de lazy lazy i think the countess had she been listening would have cared little for accusations on that head idlesse was fashionable exquisite languors were a sign of breeding and she always had an idea that she looked more interesting at dinner after reclining on a couch the whole of the afternoon the great mel and his mate had given her robust health and she was able to play the high born invalid without damage to her constitution anything amused her roses album even and the compositions of w h e h d f and f l the initials f l were diminutive and not unlike her own hand she thought they were appended to a piece of facetiousness that would not have disgraced the abilities of mr john raikes but we know that very stiff young gentlemen betray monkey minds when sweet young ladies compel them to disport on the whole it was not a lazy afternoon that the countess passed and it was not against her wish that others should think it was chapter xx break neck leap the august sun was in mid sky when a troop of ladies and cavaliers issued from the gates of beckley court and winding through the hopgardens emerged on the cultivated slopes bordering the downs foremost on her grey cob was rose having on her right her uncle seymour and on her left ferdinand laxley behind came mrs evremonde flanked by drummond and evan then followed jenny graine supported by harry and william harvey in the rear came an open carriage in which miss carrington and the countess de saldar were borne attended by lady jocelyn and andrew cogglesby on horseback the expedition had for its object the selection of a run of ground for an amateur steeple chase the idea of which had sprung from laxleys boasts of his horsemanship and rose quick as fire had backed herself and drummond and evan to beat him the mention of the latter was quite enough for laxley if he follows me let him take care of his neck said that youth why ferdinand he can beat you in anything exclaimed rose imprudently but the truth was she was now more restless than ever she was not distant with evan but she had a feverish manner and seemed to thirst to make him show his qualities and excel and shine billiards or jumping or classical acquirements it mattered notevan must come first he had crossed the foils with laxley and disarmed him for mel his father had seen him trained for a military career rose made a noise about the encounter and laxley was eager for his opportunity which he saw in the proposed mad gallop now mr george uplift who usually rode in buckskins whether he was after the fox or fresh air was out on this particular morning and it happened that as the cavalcade wound beneath the down mr george trotted along the ridge he was a fat faced rotund young squirea bully where he might be and an obedient creature enough where he must begood humoured when not interfered with fond of the table and brimful of all the jokes of the county the accent of which just seasoned his speech he had somehow plunged into a sort of half engagement with miss carrington at his age and to ladies of miss carringtons age men unhappily do not plunge head foremost or miss carrington would have had him long before but he was at least in for it half a leg and a desperate maiden on the criminal side of thirty may make much of that previous to the visit of the countess de saldar mr george had been in the habit of trotting over to beckley three or four times a week miss carrington had a little money mr george was heir to his uncle miss carrington was lean and blue eyed mr george was black eyed and obese by everybody except mr george the match was made but that exception goes for little in the country where half the population are talked into marriage and gossips entirely devote themselves to continuing the species mr george was certain that he had not been fighting shy of the fair carrington of late nor had he been unfaithful he had only been in an extraordinary state of occupation messages for lady racial had to be delivered and he had become her cavalier and escort suddenly the young squire was bewildered but as he was only one leg in loveif the sentiment may be thus spoken of figurativelyhis vanity in his present office kept him from remorse or uneasiness he rode at an easy pace within sight of the home of his treasure and his back turned to it presently there rose a cry from below mr george looked about the party of horsemen hallooed mr george yoicked rose set her horse to gallop up seymour jocelyn cried fox and gave the view hearing which mr george shouted and seemed inclined to surrender but the fun seized him and standing up in his stirrups he gathered his coat tails in a bunch and waggled them with a jolly laugh which was taken up below and the clamp of hoofs resounded on the turf as mr george led off after once more with a jocose twist in his seat showing them the brush mockingly away went fox and a mad chase began seymour acted as master of the hunt rose evan drummond and mrs evremonde and dorothy skirted to the right all laughing and full of excitement harry bellowed the direction from above the ladies in the carriage with lady jocelyn and andrew watched them till they flowed one and all over the shoulder of the down and who may the poor hunted animal be inquired the countess george uplift said lady jocelyn pulling out her watch i give him twenty minutes providence speed him breathed the countess with secret fervour oh he hasnt a chance said lady jocelyn the squire keeps wretched beasts is there not an attraction that will account for his hasty capture said the countess looking tenderly at miss carrington who sat a little straighter and the countess hating manifestations of stiff backedness could not forbear adding i am at war with my sympathies which should be with the poor brute flying from his persecutors she was in a bitter state of trepidation or she would have thought twice before she touched a nerve of the enamoured lady as she knew she did in calling her swain a poor brute and did again by pertinaciously pursuing does he then shun his captivity touching a nerve is one of those unforgivable small offences which in our civilized state produce the social vendettas and dramas that with savage nations spring from the spilling of blood instead of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth we demand a nerve for a nerve thou hast touched me where i am tender thee too will i touch miss carrington had been alarmed and hurt at the strange evasion of mr george nor could she see the fun of his mimicry of the fox and his flight away from instead of into her neighbourhood she had also or she now thought it remarked that when mr george had been spoken of casually the countess had not looked a natural look perhaps it was her present inflamed fancy at any rate the countess was offensive now she was positively vulgar in consequence to the mind of miss carrington and miss carrington was drawn to think of a certain thing ferdinand laxley had said he had heard from the mouth of this ladys brother when ale was in him alas how one seed of a piece of folly will lurk and sprout to confound us though like the cock in the eastern tale we peck up zealously all but that one the carriage rolled over the turf attended by andrew and lady jocelyn and the hunt was seen mr george some forty paces a head seymour gaining on him rose next whos that breasting rose said lady jocelyn lifting her glass my brother in law harrington returned andrew he doesnt ride badly said lady jocelyn a little too military he must have been set up in england oh evan can do anything said andrew enthusiastically his father was a capital horseman and taught him fencing riding and every accomplishment you wont find such a young fellow my lady the brother like him at all asked lady jocelyn still eyeing the chase brother he hasnt got a brother said andrew lady jocelyn continued i mean the present baronet she was occupied with her glass and did not observe the flush that took hold of andrews ingenuous cheeks and his hurried glance at and off the quiet eye of the countess miss carrington did observe it mr andrew dashed his face under the palm of his hand and murmured ohyes his brother in law isnt much like himha ha and then the poor little man rubbed his hands unconscious of the indignant pity for his wretched abilities in the gaze of the countess and he must have been exposedthere was a fear that the ghost of sir abraham would have darkened this day for miss carrington was about to speak when lady jocelyn cried theres a purl somebodys down the countess was unaware of the nature of a purl but she could have sworn it to be a piece of providence just by old nat hodges farm on squire coppings ground cried andrew much relieved by the particular individuals misfortune dear me my lady how old tom and i used to jump the brook there to be sure and when you were no bigger than little miss loringdo you remember old tom were all fools one time in our lives who can it be said lady jocelyn spying at the discomfited horseman im afraid its poor ferdinand they drove on to an eminence from which the plain was entirely laid open i hope my brother will enjoy his ride this day sighed the countess it will be his limit of enjoyment for a lengthened period she perceived that mr georges capture was inevitable and her heart sank for she was sure he would recognize her and at the moment she misdoubted her powers she dreamed of flight youre not going to leave us said lady jocelyn my dear countess what will the future member do without you we have your promise to stay till the election is over thanks for your extreme kind courtesy lady jocelyn murmured the countess but my husbandthe count the favour is yours returned her ladyship and if the count cannot come you at least are at liberty you are most kind said the countess andrew and his wife i should not dare to separate for more than a week said lady jocelyn he is the great british husband the proprietor my wife is his unanswerable excuse yes andrew replied cheerily i dont like division between man and wife i must say the countess dared no longer instance the count her husband she was heard to murmur that citizen feelings were not hers you suggested fallowfield to melville did you not asked lady jocelyn it was the merest suggestion said the countess smiling then you must really stay to see us through it said her ladyship where are they now they must be making straight for break neck fence theyll have him there george hasnt pluck for that hasnt what it was the countess who requested to know the name of this other piece of providence mr george uplift was deficient in pluckgo said her ladyship hastily and telling the coachman to drive to a certain spot trotted on with andrew saying to him im afraid we are thought vulgar by the countess andrew considered it best to reassure her gravely the young man her brother is well bred said lady jocelyn and andrew was very ready to praise evan lady jocelyn herself in slimmer days a spirited horsewoman had correctly estimated mr georges pluck he was captured by harry and evan close on the leap in the act of shaking his head at it and many who inspected the leap would have deemed it a sign that wisdom weighted the head that would shake long at it for it consisted of a post and rails with a double ditch seymour jocelyn mrs evremonde drummond jenny graine and william harvey rode with mr george in quest of the carriage and the captive was duly delivered over but wheres the brush said lady jocelyn laughing and introducing him to the countess who dropped her head and with it her veil oh they leave that on for my next run said mr george bowing civilly you are going to run again miss carrington severely asked this question and mr george protested secure him louisa said lady jocelyn see here whats the matter with poor dorothy dorothy came slowly trotting up to them along the green lane and thus expressed her grief between sobs isnt it a shame rose is such a tyrant theyre going to ride a race and a jump down in the field and its break neck leap and rose wont allow me to stop and see it though she knows im just as fond of evan as she is and if hes killed i declare it will be her fault and its all for her stupid dirty old pocket handkerchief break neck fence said lady jocelyn thats rather mad do lets go and see it darling aunty joey pleaded the little maid lady jocelyn rode on saying to herself that girl has a great deal of devil in her the ladys thoughts were of rose black lymportd take the leap said mr george following her with the rest of the troop whos that fellow on him his names harrington quoth drummond oh harrington mr george responded but immediately laughedharrington gad if he takes the leap itll be oddanother of the name thats where old mel had his spill who drummond inquired old mel harringtonthe lymport wonder old marquis mel said mr george havent ye heard of him what the gorgeous tailor exclaimed lady jocelyn how i regret never meeting that magnificent snob that efflorescence of sublime imposture ive seen the regent but ones life doesnt seem complete without having seen his twin brother you must give us warning when you have him down at croftlands again mr george gad hell have to come a long distancepoor old mel said mr george and was going on when seymour jocelyn stroked his moustache to cry look roseys starting em by jove the leap which did not appear formidable from where they stood was four fields distant from the point where rose with a handkerchief in her hand was at that moment giving the signal to laxley and evan miss carrington and the countess begged lady jocelyn to order a shout to be raised to arrest them but her ladyship marked her good sense by saying let them go now theyre about it for she saw that to make a fuss now matters had proceeded so far was to be uncivil to the inevitable the start was given and off they flew harry jocelyn behind them was evidently caught by the demon and clapped spurs to his horse to have his fling as well for the fun of the thing but rose farther down the field rode from her post straight across him to the imminent peril of a mutual overset and the party on the height could see harry fuming and rose coolly looking him down and letting him understand what her will was and her mother and drummond and seymour who beheld this had a common sentiment of admiration for the gallant girl but away went the rivals black lymport was the favourite though none of the men thought he would be put at the fence the excitement became contagious the countess threw up her veil lady jocelyn and seymour and drummond galloped down the lane and mr george was for accompanying them till the line of miss carringtons back gave him her unmistakeable opinion of such a course of conduct and he had to dally and fret by her side andrews arm was tightly grasped by the countess the rivals were crossing the second field laxley a little a head hes holding in the black marethat fellow said mr george gad it looks like going at the fence fancy harrington they were now in the fourth field a smooth shorn meadow laxley was two clear lengths in advance but seemed riding as mr george remarked more for pace than to take the jump the ladies kept plying random queries and suggestions the countess wishing to know whether they could not be stopped by a countryman before they encountered any danger in the midst of their chatter mr george rose in his stirrups crying bravo the black mare has he done it said andrew wiping his poll he no the mare shouted mr george and bolted off no longer to be restrained the countess doubly relieved threw herself back in the carriage and andrew drew a breath saying evan has beat himi saw that the others horse swerved right round i fear said mrs evremonde mr harrington has had a fall dont be alarmedit may not be much a fall exclaimed the countess equally divided between alarms of sisterly affection and a keen sense of the romance of the thing miss carrington ordered the carriage to be driven round they had not gone far when they were met by harry jocelyn riding in hot haste and he bellowed to the coachman to drive as hard as he could and stop opposite brooks farm the scene on the other side of the fence would have been a sweet one to the central figure in it had his eyes then been open surrounded by lady jocelyn drummond seymour and the rest evans dust stained body was stretched along the road and his head was lying in the lap of rose who pale heedless of anything spoken by those around her and with her lips set and her eyes turning wildly from one to the other held a gory handkerchief to his temple with one hand and with the other felt for the motion of his heart but heroes dont die you know chapter xxi tribulations and tactics of the countess you have murdered my brother rose jocelyn dont say so now such was the interchange between the two that loved the senseless youth as he was being lifted into the carriage lady jocelyn sat upright in her saddle giving directions about what was to be done with evan and the mare impartially stunned and a good deal shaken i suppose lymports knees are terribly cut she said to drummond who merely nodded and seymour remarked fifty guineas knocked off her value one added nothing worse i should think and another a little damage inside perhaps difficult to say whether they spoke of evan or the brute no violent outcries no reproaches cast on the cold blooded coquette no exclamations on the heroism of her brother they could absolutely spare a thought for the animal and evan had risked his life for this and might die unpitied the countess diversified her grief with a deadly bitterness against the heartless jocelyns oh if evan dies will it punish rose sufficiently andrew expressed emotion but not of a kind the countess liked a relative to be seen exhibiting for in emotion worthy andrew betrayed to her his origin offensively go away and puke if you must she said clipping poor andrews word about his dear boy she could not help speaking in that wayhe was so vulgar a word of sympathy from lady jocelyn might have saved her from the sourness into which her many conflicting passions were resolving and might also have saved her ladyship from the rancour she had sown in the daughter of the great mel by her selection of epithets to characterize him will it punish rose at all if evan dies rose saw that she was looked at how could the countess tell that rose envied her the joy of holding evan in the carriage there rose to judge by her face was as calm as glass not so well seen through however mrs evremonde rode beside her whose fingers she caught and twined her own with them tightly once for a fleeting instant mrs evremonde wanted no further confession of her state then rose said to her mother mama may i ride to have the doctor ready ordinarily rose would have clapped heel to horse the moment the thought came she waited for the permission and flew off at a gallop waving back laxley who was for joining her franks will be a little rusty about the mare the countess heard lady jocelyn say and harry just then stooped his head to the carriage and said in his blunt fashion after all it wont show much we are not cattle exclaimed the frenzied countess within her bosom alas it was almost a democratic outcry they made her guilty of but she was driven past patience and as a further provocation evan would open his eyes she laid her handkerchief over them with loving delicacy remembering in a flash that her own face had been all the while exposed to mr george uplift and then the terrors of his presence at beckley court came upon her and the fact that she had not for the last ten minutes been the serene countess de saldar and she quite hated andrew for vulgarity in others evoked vulgarity in her which was the reason why she ranked vulgarity as the chief of the deadly sins her countenance for harry and all the others save poor andrew was soon the placid heaven confiding sisters again not before lady jocelyn had found cause to observe to drummond your countess doesnt ruffle well but a lady who is at war with two or three of the facts of providence and yet will have providence for her ally can hardly ruffle well do not imagine that the countesss love for her brother was hollow she was assured when she came up to the spot where he fell that there was no danger he had but dislocated his shoulder and bruised his head a little hearing this she rose out of her clamorous heart and seized the opportunity for a small burst of melodrama unhappily lady jocelyn who gave the tone to the rest was a spartan in matters of this sort and as she would have seen those dearest to her bear the luck of the field she could see others when the call for active help reached her you beheld a different woman the demonstrativeness the countess thirsted for was afforded her by juley bonner and in a measure by her sister caroline who loved evan passionately the latter was in riding attire about to mount to ride and meet them accompanied by the duke caroline had hastily tied up her hair a rich golden brown lump of it hung round her cheek her limpid eyes and anxiously nerved brows impressed the countess wonderfully as she ran down the steps and bent her fine well filled bust forward to ask the first hurried question the countess patted her shoulder safe dear she said aloud as one who would not make much of it and in a whisper you look superb i must charge it to carolines beauty under the ducal radiance that a stream of sweet feelings entering into the countess made her forget to tell her sister that george uplift was by caroline had not been abroad and her skin was not olive hued she was a beauty and a majestic figure little altered since the day when the wooden marine marched her out of lymport the countess stepped from the carriage to go and cherish julianas petulant distress for that unhealthy little body was stamping with impatience to have the story told to her to burst into fits of pathos and while seymour and harry assisted evan to descend trying to laugh off the pain he endured caroline stood by soothing him with words and tender looks lady jocelyn passed him and took his hand saying not killed this time at your ladyships service to morrow he replied and his hand was kindly squeezed my darling evan you will not ride again caroline cried kissing him on the steps and the duke watched the operation and the countess observed the duke that providence should select her sweetest moments to deal her wounds was cruel but the countess just then distinctly heard mr george uplift ask miss carrington is that lady a harrington you perceive a likeness was the answer mr george went whewtit tit tit with the profound expression of a very slow mind the scene was quickly over there was barely an hour for the ladies to dress for dinner leaving evan in the doctors hand and telling caroline to dress in her room the countess met rose and gratified her vindictiveness while she furthered her projects by saying not till my brother is quite convalescent will it be adviseable that you should visit him i am compelled to think of him entirely now in his present state he is not fit to be played with rose stedfastly eyeing her seemed to swallow down something in her throat and said i will obey you countess i hoped you would allow me to nurse him quiet above all things rose jocelyn returned the countess with the suavity of a governess who must be civil in her sourness if you would not complete this mornings achievementstay away the countess declined to see that roses lip quivered she saw an unpleasantness in the bottom of her eyes and now that her brothers decease was not even remotely to be apprehended she herself determined to punish the cold unimpressionable coquette of a girl before returning to caroline she had five minutes conversation with juliana which fully determined her to continue the campaign at beckley court commence decisive movements and not to retreat though fifty george uplofts menaced her consequently having dismissed conning on a message to harry jocelyn to ask him for a list of the names of the new people they were to meet that day at dinner she said to caroline my dear i think it will be incumbent on us to depart very quickly much to the countesss chagrin and astonishment caroline replied i shall hardly be sorry not sorry why what now dear one is it true then that a flagellated female kisses the rod are you so eager for a repetition of strike caroline with some hesitation related to her more than the countess had ventured to petition for in her prayers oh how exceedingly generous the latter exclaimed how very refreshing to think that there are nobles in your england as romantic as courteous as delicate as our own foreign ones but his grace is quite an exceptional nobleman are you not touched dearest carry caroline pensively glanced at the reflection of her beautiful arm in the glass and sighed pushing back the hair from her temples but for mercys sake resumed the countess in alarm at the sigh do not be tootoo touched do pray preserve your wits you weep caroline caroline o my goodness it is just five and twenty minutes to the first dinner bell and you are crying for gods sake think of your face are you going to be a gorgon and you show the marks twice as long as any other you fair women squinnying like this caroline for your louisas sake do not hissing which half angrily and half with entreaty the countess dropped on her knees carolines fit of tears subsided the eldest of the sisters she was the kindest the fairest the weakest not said the blandishing countess when carolines face was clearer not that my best of carrys does not look delicious in her shower cry with your hair down and you would subdue any male creature on two legs and that reminds me of that most audacious marquis de remilla he saw a dirty drab of a fruit girl crying in lisbon streets one day as he was riding in the carriage of the duchesse de col da rosta and her husband and duena and he had a letter for herthe duchesse they loved how deliver the letter save me he cried to the duchesse catching her hand and pressing his heart as if very sick the duchesse felt the paperturned her hand over on her knee and he withdrew his what does my carry think was the excuse he tendered the duke thisand this gives you some idea of the wonderful audacity of those dear portuguesethat hehe must precipitate himself and marry any woman he saw weep and be her slave for the term of his natural life unless another womans hand at the same moment restrained him there and the countesss eyes shone brightly how excessively imbecile caroline remarked hitherto a passive listener to these lusitanian contes it was the first sign she had yet given of her late intercourse with a positive duke and the countess felt it and drew back no more anecdotes for caroline to whom she quietly said you are very english dear but now the dukehis grace she went on how did he inaugurate i spoke to him of evans position god forgive mei said that was the cause of my looks being sad you could have thought of nothing better interposed the countess yes he said if he might clear them he should be happy in exquisite language carry of course no just as others talk hum went the countess and issued again brightly from a cloud of reflection with the remark it was to seem business likethe commerciality of the english mind to the pointi know well you perceive my sweetest that evans interests are in your hands you dare not quit the field in one week i fondly trust he will be secure what more did his grace say may we not be the repository of such delicious secresies caroline gave tremulous indications about the lips and the countess jumped to the bell and rang it for they were too near dinner for the trace of a single tear to be permitted the bell and the appearance of conning effectually checked the flood while speaking to her sister the countess had hesitated to mention george uplifts name hoping that as he had no dinner suit he would not stop to dinner that day and would fall to the charge of lady racial once more conning however brought in a sheet of paper on which the names of the guests were written out by harry a daily piece of service he performed for the captivating dame and george uplifts name was in the list we will do the rest conningretire she said and then folding caroline in her arms murmured the moment they were alone will my carry dress her hair plain to day for the love of her louisa goodness what a request exclaimed caroline throwing back her head to see if her louisa could be serious most inexplicableis it not will she do it flat dear it makes a fright of me possibly may i beg it but why dearest why if i only knew why for the love of your louy plain along the temples and a knot behind and a band along the forehead gems if they meet your favour but my cheek bones louisa they are not too prominent carry curls relieve them the change will relieve the curls dear one caroline looked in the glass at the countess as polished a reflector and fell into a chair her hair was accustomed to roll across her shoulders in heavy curls the duke would find a change of the sort singular she should not at all know herself with her hair done differently and for a lovely woman to be transformed to a fright is hard to bear in solitude or in imagination really she petitioned reallyyes or no added the countess so unaccountable a whim caroline looked in the glass dolefully and pulled up her thick locks from one cheek letting them fall on the instant she will breathed the countess i really cannot said caroline with vehemence the countess burst into laughter replying my poor child it is not my whimit is your obligation george uplift dines here to day now do you divine it disguise is imperative for you mrs strike gazing in her sisters face answered slowly george but how will you meet him she hurriedly asked i have met him rejoined the countess boldly i defy him to know me i brazen him you with your hair in my style are equally safe you see there is no choice pooh contemptible puppy but i nevercaroline was going to say she never could face him i will not dine i will nurse evan you have faced him my dear said the countess and you are to change your head dress simply to throw him off his scent as she spoke the countess tripped about nodding her head like a girl triumph in the sense of her power over all she came in contact with rather elated the lady do you see why she worked her sister in this roundabout fashion she would not tell her george uplift was in the house till she was sure he intended to stay for fear of frightening her when the necessity became apparent she put it under the pretext of a whim in order to see how far caroline whose weak compliance she could count on and whose reticence concerning the duke annoyed her would submit to it to please her sister and if she rebelled positively why to be sure it was the duke she dreaded to shock and therefore the duke had a peculiar hold on her and therefore the countess might reckon that she would do more than she pleased to confess to remain with the duke and was manageable in that quarter all this she learnt without asking i need not add that caroline sighingly did her bidding we must all be victims in our turn carry said the countess evans prospectsit may be silvas restorationdepend upon your hair being dressed plain to day reflect on that poor caroline obeyed but she was capable of reflecting only that her face was unnaturally lean and strange to her the sisters tended and arranged one another taking care to push their mourning a month or two ahead and the countess animadverted on the vulgar mind of lady jocelyn who would allow a gentleman to sit down at a gentlewomans table in full company in pronounced undress and caroline utterly miserable would pretend that she wore a mask and kept grimacing as they do who are not accustomed to paint on the cheeks till the countess checked her by telling her she should ask her for that before the duke after a visit to evan the sisters sailed together into the drawing room uniformity is sometimes a gain murmured the countess as they were parting in the middle of the room she saw that their fine figures and profiles and resemblance in contrast produced an effect the duke wore one of those calmly intent looks by which men show they are aware of change in the heavens they study and are too devout worshippers to presume to disapprove mr george was standing by miss carrington and he also watched mrs strike to bewilder him yet more the countess persisted in fixing her eyes upon his heterodox apparel and mr george became conscious and uneasy miss carrington had to address her question to him twice before he heard melville jocelyn sir john loring sir franks and hamilton surrounded the countess and told her what they had decided on with regard to the election during the day for melville was warm in his assertion that they would not talk to the countess five minutes without getting a hint worth having call to us that man who is habited like a groom said the countess indicating mr george i presume he is in his right place up here whewtake care countessour best man hes good for a dozen said hamilton mr george was brought over and introduced to the countess de saldar so the oldest tory in the county is a fox she said in allusion to the hunt never did caroline strike admire her sisters fearful genius more than at that moment mr george ducked and rolled his hand over his chin with ah um and the like ended by a dry laugh are you our supporter mr uplift tory interest maummy lady and are you staunch and may be trusted pon my honour i think i have that reputation and you would not betray us if we give you any secrets say pon my honour again you launch it out so courageously the men laughed though they could not see what the countess was driving at she had for two minutes spoken as she spoke when a girl and georgeentirely off his guard and unsuspiciouslooked unenlightened if he knew there were hints enough for him in her words if he remained blind they might pass as air the appearance of the butler cut short his protestation as to his powers of secresy the countess dismissed him you will be taken into our confidence when we require you and she resumed her foreign air in a most elaborate and overwhelming bow she was now perfectly satisfied that she was safe from mr george and as she thoroughly detested the youthful squire she chose to propagate a laugh at him by saying with the utmost languor and clearness of voice as they descended the stairs after all a very clever fox may be a very dull dogdont you think gentlemen in front of her and behind heard it and at mr georges expense her reputation rose thus the genius of this born general prompted her to adopt the principle in tacticsboldly to strike when you are in the dark as to your enemys movements chapter xxii in which the daughters of the great mel have to digest him at dinner you must know if you would form an estimate of the countesss heroic impudence that a rumour was current in lymport that the fair and well developed louisa harrington in her sixteenth year did advisedly and with the intention of rendering the term indefinite entrust her guileless person to mr george uplifts honourable charge the rumour unflavoured by absolute malignity was such and it went on to say that the sublime mel alive to the honour of his family followed the fugitives with a pistol and with a horsewhip that he might chastise the offender according to the degree of his offence it was certain that he had not used the pistol it was said that he had used the whip the details of the interview between mel and mr george were numerous but at the same time various some declared that he put a pistol to mr georges ear and under pressure of that persuader got him into the presence of a clergyman when he turned sulky and when the pistol was again produced the ceremony would have been performed had not the outraged church cried out for help some vowed that mr george had referred all questions implying a difference between himself and mel to their mutual fists for decision at any rate mr george turned up in fallowfield subsequently the fair louisa unhurt and with a quiet mind in lymport and this amount of truth the rumours can be reduced tothat louisa and mr george had been acquainted rumour and gossip know how to build they always have some solid foundation however small upwards of twelve years had run since louisa went to the wife of the brewera period quite long enough for mr george to forget any one in and she was altogether a different creature and as it was true that mr george was a dull one she was after the test she had put him to justified in hoping that mels progeny might pass unchallenged anywhere out of lymport so with mr george facing her at table the countess sat down determined to eat and be happy a man with the education and tastes of a young country squire is not likely to know much of the character of women and of the marvellous power they have of throwing a veil of oblivion between themselves and what they dont want to remember few men know much mr george had thought when he saw mrs strike leaning to evan and heard she was a harrington that she was rather like the lymport family but the reappearance of mrs strike the attention of the duke of belfield to her and the splendid tactics of the countess which had extinguished every thought in the thought of himself drove lymport out of his mind there were some dinner guests at the tablepeople of fallowfield beckley and bodley the countess had the diplomatist on one side the duke on the other caroline was under the charge of sir franks the countess almost revelling in her position opposite mr george was ambitious to lead the conversation and commenced smiling at melville we are to be spared politics to day i think politics and cookery do not assimilate im afraid you wont teach the true briton to agree with you said melville shaking his head over the sums involved by this british propensity no said seymour election dinners are a part of the constitution and andrew laughed they make radicals pay as well as tories so its pretty square the topic was taken up flagged fell and was taken up again and then harry jocelyn said i say have you worked the flags yet the great mel must have his flags the flags were in the hands of ladies and ladies would look to the rosettes he was told then a lady of the name of barrington laughed lightly and said only pray my dear harry dont call your uncle the great mel at the election oh very well quoth harry why not youll get him laughed atthats all oh well then i wont said harry whose wits were attracted by the countesss visage mrs barrington turned to seymour her neighbour and resumed he really would be laughed at there was a tailorhe was called the great meland he tried to stand for fallowfield once i believe he had the support of squire upliftgeorges uncleand others they must have done it for fun of course he did not get so far as the hustings but i believe he had flags and principles and all sorts of things worked ready he certainly canvassed a tailorcanvassedfor parliament remarked an old dowager the mother of squire copping my what are we coming to next he deserved to get in quoth aunt bel after having his principles worked ready to eject the man was infamous amazed at the mine she had sprung the countess sat through it lamenting the misery of owning a notorious father happily evan was absent on his peaceful blessed bed bowing over wine with the duke she tried another theme while still like a pertinacious cracker the great mel kept banging up and down the table we are to have a feast in the open air i hear what you call pic nic the duke believed there was a project of the sort how exquisitely they do those things in portugal i suppose there would be no scandal in my telling something now at least we are out of court jurisdiction scandal of the court exclaimed his grace in mock horror the option is yours to listen the queen when young was sweetly pretty a divine complexion and a habit of smiling on everybody i presume that the young habral son of the first magistrate of lisbon was also smiled on most innocently i would swear but it operated on the wretched youth he spent all his fortune in the purchase and decoration of a fairy villa bordering on the val das rosas where the court enjoyed its rustic festivities and one day a storm all the ladies hurried their young mistress to the house where the young habral had been awaiting her for ages none so polished as he musicians started up the floors were ready and torches beneath themthere was a feast of exquisite wines and viands sparkling quite enchantment the girl queen was in ecstasies she deigned a dance with the young habral and then all sat down to supper and in the middle of it came the cry of fire the queen shrieked the flames were seen all around and if the arms of the young habral were opened to save her or perish could she cast a thought on royalty and refuse the queen was saved the villa was burnt the young habral was ruined but if i know a portuguese he was happy till he died and well remunerated for he had held a queen to his heart so that was a pic nic the duke slightly inclined his head vrai portughez derrendo he said they tell a similar story in spain of one of the queensi forget her name the difference between us and your peninsular cavaliers is that we would do as much for uncrowned ladies ah your grace the countess swam in the pleasure of a noblemans compliment whats the story interposed aunt bel an outline of it was given her thank heaven the table was now rid of the great mel for how could he have any the remotest relation with queens and peninsular pic nics you shall hear lady jocelyn happened to catch a word or two of the story why said she thats english franks you remember the ballet divertissement they improvised at the bodley race ball when the magnificent footman fired a curtain and caught up lady racial and carried her heaven knows where cried sir franks i remember it perfectly it was said that the magnificent footman did it on purpose to have that pleasure ay of course hamilton took him up they talked of prosecuting the magnificent footman ay followed seymour and nobody could tell where the magnificent footman bolted he vanished into thin air ay of course melville struck in and the magic enveloped the lady for some time at this point mr george uplift gave a horse laugh he jerked in his seat excitedly bodley race ball he cried and looking at lady jocelyn was your ladyship there then whyha ha why you have seen the great mel then that tremendous footman was old mel himself lady jocelyn struck both her hands on the table and rested her large grey eyes full of humorous surprise on mr george there was a pause and then the ladies and gentlemen laughed yes mr george went on that was old mel ill swear to him and thats how it began murmured lady jocelyn mr george nodded at his plate discreetly well said lady jocelyn leaning back and lifting her face upward in the discursive fulness of her fancy i feel i am not robbed il y a des miracles et jen ai vu ones life seems more perfect when one has seen what nature can do the fellow was stupendous i conceive him present wholl fire a house for me is it my deficiency of attraction or a total dearth of gallant snobs the countess was drowned the muscles of her smiles were horribly stiff and painful caroline was getting pale could it be accident that thus resuscitated mel their father and would not let the dead man die was not malice at the bottom of it the countess though she hated mr george infinitely was clear headed enough to see that providence alone was trying her no glances were exchanged between him and laxley or drummond again mel returned to his peace and again he had to come forth who was this singular man you were speaking about just now mrs evremonde asked lady jocelyn answered her the light of his age the embodied protest against our social prejudice combinesay mirabeau and alcibiades and the result is the lymport tailorhe measures your husband in the morning in the evening he makes love to you through a series of pantomimic transformations he was a colossal adonis and im sorry hes dead but did the man get into society said mrs evremonde how did he manage that yes indeed and what sort of a society the dowager copping interjected none but bachelor tables i can assure you oh i remember him they talked of fetching him to dox hall i said no thank you tom this isnt your vauxhall a sharp retort said lady jocelyn a most conclusive rhyme but youre mistaken many families were glad to see him i hear and he only consented to be treated like a footman when he dressed like one the fellow had some capital points he fought two or three duels and behaved like a man franks wouldnt have him here or i would have received him i hear that as a conteur he was inimitable in short he was a robust brummel and the regent of low life this should have been mels final epitaph unhappily mrs melville would remark in her mincing manner that the idea of the admission of a tailor into society seemed very unnatural and aunt bel confessed that her experience did not comprehend it as to that said lady jocelyn phenomena are unnatural the rules of society are lightened by the exceptions what i like in this mel is that though he was a snob and an impostor he could still make himself respected by his betters he was honest so far he acknowledged his tastes which were those of franks melville seymour and georgethe tastes of a gentleman i prefer him infinitely to your cowardly democrat who barks for what he cant get and is generally beastly in fact im not sure that i havent a secret passion for the great tailor after all old mel wasnt so bad mr george uplift chimed in granted a tailoryou didnt see a bit of it at table ive known him taken for a lord and when he once got hold of you you couldnt give him up the squire met him first in the coach one winter he took him for a russian noblemandidnt find out what he was for a month or so says mel yes i make clothes you find the notion unpleasant guess how disagreeable it is to me the old squire laughed and was glad to have him at croftlands as often as he chose to come old mel and i used to spar sometimes but hes gone and i should like to shake his fist again then mr george told the bath story and episodes in mels career as marquis and while he held the ear of the table rose who had not spoken a word and had scarcely eaten a morsel during dinner studied the sisters with serious eyes only when she turned them from the countess to mrs strike they were softened by a shadowy drooping of the eyelids as if for some reason she deeply pitied that lady next to rose sat drummond with a face expressive of cynical enjoyment he devoted uncommon attention to the countess whom he usually shunned and overlooked he invited her to exchange bows over wine in the fashion of that day and the countess went through the performance with finished grace and ease poor andrew had all the time been brushing back his hair and making strange deprecatory sounds in his throat like a man who felt bound to assure everybody at table he was perfectly happy and comfortable material enough for a sartoriad said drummond to lady jocelyn excellent pray write it forthwith drummond replied her ladyship and as they exchanged talk unintelligible to the countess this lady observed to the duke it is a relief to have buried that subject the duke smiled raising an eyebrow but the persecuted countess perceived she had been much too hasty when drummond added ill make a journey to lymport in a day or two and master his history do said her ladyship and flourishing her hand i sing the prince of snobs oh if its about old mel ill sing you material enough said mr george there you talk of its being unnatural his dining out at respectable tables why i believeupon my honour i believe its a facthes supped and thrown dice with the regent lady jocelyn clapped her hands a noble culmination drummond the mans an epic well i think old mel was equal to it mr george pursued he gave me pretty broad hints and this is how it was if it really happened you know old mel had a friend some say he was more well that was a fellow a great gambler i dare say youve heard of himburley bennethim that won ryelands park of one of the royal dukesdied worth upwards of and old mel swore he ought to have had it and would if he hadnt somehow offended him he left the money to admiral harrington and he was a relation of mels but are we then utterly mixed up with tailors exclaimed mrs barrington well those are the facts said mr george the wine made the young squire talkative it is my belief that his suspicions were not awake at that moment and that like any other young country squire having got a subject he could talk on he did not care to discontinue it the countess was past the effort to attempt to stop him she had work enough to keep her smile in the right place every dinner may be said to have its special topic just as every age has its marked reputation they are put up twice or thrice and have to contend with minor lights and to swallow them and then they command the tongues of men and flow uninterruptedly so it was with the great mel upon this occasion curiosity was aroused about him aunt bel agreed with lady jocelyn that she would have liked to know the mighty tailor mrs shorne but very imperceptibly protested against the notion and from one to another it ran his grace of belfield expressed positive approval of mel as one of the old school si ce nest pas le gentilhomme au moins cest le gentilhomme manqu said lady jocelyn he is to be regretted duke you are right the stuff was in him but the fates were unkind i stretch out my hand to the pauvre diable i think one learns more from the mock magnifico than from anything else observed his grace when the lion saw the donkey in his own royal skin said aunt bel add the rhyme at your discretionhe was a wiser lion thats all and the ape that strives to copy onehes an animal of judgement said lady jocelyn we will be tolerant to the tailor and the countess must not set us down as a nation of shopkeepers philosophically tolerant the countess started and ran a little broken oh affably out of her throat dipped her lips to her tablenapkin and resumed her smile yes pursued her ladyship old mel stamps the age gone by the gallant adventurer tied to his shop alternate footman and marquis out of intermediate tailor isnt there something fine in his buffoon imitation of the real thing i feel already that old mel belongs to me where is the great man buried where have they set the funeral brass that holds his mighty ashes lady jocelyns humour was fully entered into by the men the women smiled vacantly and had a common thought that it was ill bred of her to hold forth in that way at table and unfeminine of any woman to speak continuously anywhere oh come cried mr george who saw his own subject snapped away from him by sheer cleverness old mel wasnt only a buffoon my lady you know old mel had his qualities he was as much a no nonsense fellow in his way as a magistrate or a minister or a king or a constable aunt bel helped his illustration or a prince a poll parrot a perigord pie added drummond whose gravity did not prevent mr george from seeing that he was laughed at well then now listen to this said mr george leaning his two hands on the table resolutely dessert was laid and with a full glass beside him and a pear to peel he determined to be heard the countesss eyes went mentally up to the vindictive heavens she stole a glance at caroline and was alarmed at her excessive pallor providence had rescued evan from this now i know this to be true mr george began when old mel was alive he and i had plenty of sparring and thatbut hes dead and ill do him justice i spoke of burley bennet just now now my lady old burley was i think mels half brother and he came i know somewhere out of drury laneone of the courts near the theatrei dont know much of london however old mel wouldnt have that nothing less than being born in st jamess square would content old mel and he must have a marquis for his father i neednt be more particular before ladiesahem but burley was the shrewd hand of the two oh h h such a card he knew the way to get into company without false pretences well i told you he had lots more than some said twoand he gave up ryelands never asked for it though he won it consequence was he commanded the services of somebody pretty high and it was he got admiral harrington made a captain posted commodore admiral and kcb all in seven years in the army itd have been half the time for the hrh was stronger in that department now i know old burley promised mel to leave him his money and called the admiral an ungrateful dog he didnt give mel much at a timenow and then a twenty pounder or soi saw the cheques and old mel expected the money and looked over his daughters like a turkey cock nobody good enough for them whacking handsome galsthree used to be called the three graces of lymport and one day burley comes and visits mel and sees the girls and he puts his finger on the eldest i can tell you she was a spanker she was the handsomest gal i think ever i saw for the mothers a fine woman and what with the mother and what with old mel we wont enter into the mysteries of origin quoth lady jocelyn exactly my lady oh your servant of course before ladies a burley bennet i said long and short was he wanted to take her up to london says old mel londons a sad placeplace to make money says burley thats not work for a young gal says mel long and short was burley wanted to take her and mel wouldnt let her go mr george lowered his tone and mumbled dont know how to explain it very well before ladies what burley wanted wasit wasnt quite honourable you know though there was a good deal of spangles on it and whether a real hrh or a marquis or a viscount i cant say butthe offer was tempting to a tradesman no says mel like a chap planting his flagstaff and sticking to it i believe that to get her to go with him burley offered to make a will on the spot and to leave every farthing of his money and propertyupon my soul i believe it to be trueto mel and his family if hed let the gal go no says mel i like the old bird and burley got in a rage and said hed leave every farthing to the sailor says mel im a poor tradesman but i have and i always will have the feelings of a gentleman and theyre more to me than hard cash and the honour of my daughter sir is dearer to me than my blood out of the house cries mel and away old burley went and left every penny to the sailor admiral harrington who never noticed em an inch now there all had listened to mr george attentively and he had slurred the apologetic passages and emphasized the propitiatory before ladies in a way to make himself well understood a generation back bravo old mel rang the voice of lady jocelyn and a murmur ensued in the midst of which rose stood up and hurried round the table to mrs strike who was seen to rise from her chair and as she did so the ill arranged locks fell from their unnatural restraint down over her shoulders one great curl half forward to the bosom and one behind her right ear her eyes were wide her whole face neck and fingers white as marble the faintest tremor of a frown on her brows and her shut lips marked the continuation of some internal struggle as if with her last conscious force she kept down a flood of tears and a wild outcry which it was death to hold sir franks felt his arm touched and looked up and caught her as rose approached the duke and other gentlemen went to his aid and as the beautiful woman was borne out white and still as a corpse the countess had this dagger plunged in her heart from the mouth of mr george addressing miss carrington i swear i didnt do it on purpose shes carry harrington old mels daughter as sure as shes flesh and blood chapter xxiii treats of a handkerchief running through beckley park clear from the chalk a little stream gave light and freshness to its pasturage near where it entered a bathing house of white marble had been built under which the water flowed and the dive could be taken to a paved depth and you swam out over a pebbly bottom into sun light screened by the thick weeded banks loose strife and willow herb and mint nodding over you and in the later season long plumed yellow grasses here at sunrise the young men washed their limbs and here since her return home english rose loved to walk by night she had often spoken of the little happy stream to evan in portugal and when he came to beckley court she arranged that he should sleep in a bed room overlooking it the view was sweet and pleasant to him for all the babbling of the water was of rose and winding in and out to east to north it wound to embowered hopes in the lovers mind to tender dreams and often at dawn when dressing his restless heart embarked on it and sailed into havens the phantom joys of which coloured his life for him all the day but most he loved to look across it when the light fell the palest solitary gleam along its course spoke to him rich promise the faint blue beam of a star chained all his longings charmed his sorrows to sleep rose like a fairy had breathed her spirit here and it was a delight to the silly luxurious youth to lie down and fix some image of a flower bending to the stream on his brain and in the cradle of fancies that grew round it slide down the tide of sleep from the image of a flower bending to the stream like his own soul to the bosom of rose evan built sweet fables it was she that exalted him that led him through glittering chapters of adventure in his dream of deeds achieved for her sake you may be sure the young man behaved worthily though he was modest when she praised him and his limbs trembled when the land whispered of his great reward to come the longer he stayed at beckley the more he lived in this world within world and if now and then the harsh outer life smote him a look or a word from rose encompassed him again and he became sensible only of a distant pain at first his hope sprang wildly to possess her to believe that after he had done deeds that would have sent ordinary men in the condition of shattered hulks to the hospital she might be his then blow upon blow was struck and he prayed to be near her till he died no more then she herself struck him to the ground and sitting in his chamber sick and weary on the evening of his mishap evans sole desire was to obtain the handkerchief he had risked his neck for to have that and hold it to his heart and feel it as a part of her seemed much over a length of the stream the red round harvest moon was rising and the weakened youth was this evening at the mercy of the charm that encircled him the water curved and dimpled and flowed flat and the whole body of it rushed into the spaces of sad splendour the clustered trees stood like temples of darkness their shadows lengthened supernaturally and a pale gloom crept between them on the sward he had been thinking for some time that rose would knock at his door and give him her voice at least but she did not come and when he had gazed out on the stream till his eyes ached he felt that he must go and walk by it those little flashes of the hurrying tide spoke to him of a secret rapture and of a joy seeking impulse the pouring onward of all the blood of life to one illumined heart mournful from excess of love pardon me i beg enamoured young men have these notions ordinarily evan had sufficient common sense and was as prosaic as mankind could wish him but he has had a terrible fall in the morning and a young woman rages in his brain better indeed and more manly were he to strike and raise huge bosses on his forehead groan and so have done with it we must let him go his own way at the door he was met by the countess she came into the room without a word or a kiss and when she did speak the total absence of any euphuism gave token of repressed excitement yet more than her angry eyes and eager step evan had grown accustomed to her moods and if one moment she was the halcyon and another the petrel it no longer disturbed him seeing that he was a stranger to the influences by which she was affected the countess rated him severely for not seeking repose and inviting sympathy she told him that the jocelyns had one and all combined in an infamous plot to destroy the race of harrington and that caroline had already succumbed to their assaults that the jocelyns would repent it and sooner than they thought for and that the only friend the harringtons had in the house was miss bonner whom providence would liberally reward then the countess changed to a dramatic posture and whispered aloud hush she is here she is so anxious be generous my brother and let her see you she said evan faintly may she come louisa he hoped for rose i have consented to mask it returned the countess oh what do i not sacrifice for you she turned from him and to evans chagrin introduced juliana bonner five minutes remember said the countess i must not hear of more and then evan found himself alone with miss bonner and very uneasy this young lady had restless brilliant eyes and a contraction about the forehead which gave one the idea of a creature suffering perpetual headache she said nothing and when their eyes met she dropped hers in a manner that made silence too expressive feeling which evan began may i tell you that i think it is i who ought to be nursing you not you me miss bonner replied by lifting her eyes and dropping them as before murmuring subsequently would you do so most certainly if you did me the honour to select me the fingers of the young lady commenced twisting and intertwining on her lap suddenly she laughed it would not do at all you wont be dismissed from your present service till youre unfit for any other what do you mean said evan thinking more of the unmusical laugh than of the words he received no explanation and the irksome silence caused him to look through the window as an escape for his mind at least the waters streamed on endlessly into the golden arms awaiting them the low moon burnt through the foliage in the distance over a reach of the flood one tall aspen shook against the lighted sky are you in pain miss bonner asked and broke his reverie no i am going away and perhaps i sigh involuntarily you like these grounds i have never been so happy in any place with those cruel young men about you evan now laughed we dont call young men cruel miss bonner but were they not to take advantage of what rose told themit was base she had said more than she intended possibly for she coloured under his inquiring look and added i wish i could say the same as you of beckley do you know i am called roses thorn not by miss jocelyn herself certainly how eager you are to defend her but am i nottell medo i not look like a thorn in company with her there is but the difference that ill health would make ill health oh yes and rose is so much better born to that i am sure she does not give a thought not rose oh an exclamation properly lengthened convinces the feelings more satisfactorily than much logic though evan claimed only the hand kerchief he had won his heart sank at the sound miss bonner watched him and springing forward said sharply may i tell you something you may tell me what you please then whether i offend you or not you had better leave this i am going said evan i am only waiting to introduce your tutor to you she kept her eyes on him and in her voice as well there was a depth as she returned mr laxley mr forth and harry are going to lymport to morrow evan was looking at a figure whose shadow was thrown towards the house from the margin of the stream he stood up and taking the hand of miss bonner said i thank you i may perhaps start with them at any rate you have done me a great service which i shall not forget the figure by the stream he knew to be that of rose he released miss bonners trembling moist hand and as he continued standing she moved to the door after once following the line of his eyes into the moonlight outside the door a noise was audible andrew had come to sit with his dear boy and the countess had met and engaged and driven him to the other end of the passage where he hung remonstrating with her why van he said as evan came up to him i thought you were in a profound sleep louisa said silly andrew interposed the countess do you not observe he is sleep walking now and she left them with a light laugh to go to juliana whom she found in tears the countess was quite aware of the efficacy of a little bit of burlesque lying to cover her retreat from any petty exposure evan soon got free from andrew he was under the dim stars walking to the great fire in the east the cool air refreshed him he was simply going to ask for his own before he went and had no cause to fear what would be thought by any one a handkerchief a man might fairly win that and carry it out of a very noble family without having to blush for himself i cannot say whether he inherited his feeling for rank from mel his father or that the countess had succeeded in instilling it but evan never took republican ground in opposition to those who insulted him and never lashed his manhood to assert itself nor compared the fineness of his instincts with the behaviour of titled gentlemen rather he seemed to admit the distinction between his birth and that of a gentleman admitting it to his own soul as it were and struggled simply as men struggle against a destiny the news miss bonner had given him sufficed to break a spell which could not have endured another week and andrew besides had told him of carolines illness he walked to meet rose honestly intending to ask for his own and wish her good bye rose saw him approach and knew him in the distance she was sitting on a lower branch of the aspen that shot out almost from the root and stretched over the intervolving rays of light on the tremulous water she could not move to meet him she was not the rose whom we have hitherto known love may spring in the bosom of a young girl like hesper in the evening sky a grey speck in a field of grey and not be seen or known till surely as the circle advances the faint planet gathers fire and coming nearer earth dilates and will and must be seen and known when evan lay like a dead man on the ground rose turned upon herself as the author of his death and then she felt this presence within her and her heart all day had talked to her of it and was throbbing now and would not be quieted she could only lift her eyes and give him her hand she could not speak she thought him cold and he was cold enough to think that she and her cousin were not unlike in their manner though not deep enough to reflect that it was from the same cause she was the first to find her wits but not before she spoke did she feel and start to feel how long had been the silence and that her hand was still in his why did you come out evan it was not right i came to speak to you i shall leave early to morrow and may not see you alone you are going she checked her voice and left the thrill of it wavering in him yes rose i am going i should have gone before evan she grasped his hand and then timidly retained it you have not forgiven me i see now i did not think of any risk to you i only wanted you to beat i wanted you to be first and best if you knew how i thank god for saving you what my punishment would have been till her eyes were full she kept them on him too deep in emotion to be conscious of it he could gaze on her tears coldly i should be happy to take the leap any day for the prize you offered i have come for that for what evan but while she was speaking the colour mounted in her cheeks and she went on rapidly did you think it unkind of me not to come to nurse you i must tell you to defend myself it was the countess evan she is offended with mevery justly i dare say she would not let me come what could i do i had no claim to come rose was not aware of the import of her speech evan though he felt more in it and had some secret nerves set tingling and dancing was not to be moved from his demand do you intend to withhold it rose withhold what evan anything that you wish for is yours the handkerchief is not that mine rose faltered a word why did he ask for it because he asked for nothing else and wanted no other thing save that why did she hesitate because it was so poor a gift and so unworthy of him and why did he insist because in honour she was bound to surrender it and why did she hesitate still let her answer oh evan i would give you anything but that and if you are going away i should beg so much to keep it he must have been in a singular state not to see her heart in the refusal as was she not to see his in the request but love is blindest just when the bandage is being removed from his forehead then you will not give it me rose do you think i shall go about boasting this is miss jocelyns handkerchief and i poor as i am have won it the taunt struck aslant in roses breast with a peculiar sting she stood up i will give it you evan turning from him she drew it forth and handed it to him hurriedly it was warm it was stained with his blood he guessed where it had been nestling and now as if by revelation he saw that large sole star in the bosom of his darling and was blinded by it and lost his senses rose beloved like the flower of his nightly phantasy bending over the stream he looked and saw in her sweet face the living wonders that encircled his image she murmuring no you must hate me i love you rose and dare to say itand its unpardonable can you forgive me she raised her face to him forgive you for loving me she said holy to them grew the stillness the ripple suffused in golden moonlight the dark edges of the leaves against superlative brightness not a chirp was heard nor anything save the cool and endless carol of the happy waters whose voices are the spirits of silence nature seemed consenting that their hands should be joined their eyes intermingling and when evan with a lovers craving wished her lips to say what her eyes said so well rose drew his fingers up and with an arch smile and a blush kissed them the simple act set his heart thumping and from the look of love she saw an expression of pain pass through him her fealtyher guileless fearless truthwhich the kissing of his hand brought vividly before him conjured its contrast as well in this that was hidden from her or but half suspected did she knowknow and love him still he thought it might be but that fell dead on her asking shall i speak to mama to night a load of lead crushed him rose he said but could get no farther innocently or with well masked design rose branched off into little sweet words about his bruised shoulder touching it softly as if she knew the virtue that was in her touch and accusing her selfish self as she caressed it dearest evan you must have been sure i thought no one like you why did you not tell me before i can hardly believe it now do you know she hurried on they think me cold and heartlessam i i must be to have made you run such risk but yet im sure i could not have survived you dropping her voice rose quoted ruth as evan listened the words were like food from heaven poured into his spirit to morrow he kept saying to himself to morrow i will tell her all let her think well of me a few short hours but the passing minutes locked them closer each had a new linkin a word or a speechless breath or a touch and to break the marriage of their eyes there must be infinite baseness on one side or on the other disloyalty to love the moon was a silver ball high up through the aspen leaves evan kissed the hand of rose and led her back to the house he had appeased his conscience by restraining his wild desire to kiss her lips in the hall they parted rose whispered till death giving him her hands chapter xxiv the countess makes herself felt there is a peculiar reptile whose stroke is said to deprive men of motion on the day after the great mel had stalked the dinner table of beckley court several of the guests were sensible of the effect of this creatures mysterious touch without knowing what it was that paralyzed them drummond forth had fully planned to go to lymport he had special reasons for making investigations with regard to the great mel harry who was fond of drummond offered to accompany him and laxley for the sake of a diversion fell into the scheme mr george uplift was also to be of the party and promised them fun but when the time came to start not one could be induced to move laxley was pressingly engaged by rose harry showed the rope the countess held him by mr george made a singular face and seriously advised drummond to give up the project dont rub that woman the wrong way he said in a private colloquy they had by jingo shes a tartar she was as a gal and she isnt changed lou harrington fancy now she knew me and she faced me out and made me think her a stranger gad im glad i didnt speak to the others lords sake keep it quiet dont rouse that woman now if you want to keep a whole skin drummond laughed at his extreme earnestness in cautioning him and appeared to enjoy his dread of the countess mr george would not tell how he had been induced to change his mind he repeated his advice with a very emphatic shrug of the shoulder you seem afraid of her said drummond i am i aint ashamed to confess it shes a regular viper my boy said mr george she and i once were pretty thickleast said soonest mended you know i offended her wasnt quite up to her marka tailors daughter you know gad if she didnt set an irish dragoon captain on mei went about in danger of my life the fellow began to twist his damned black moustaches the moment he clapped eyes on mebullied me till upon my soul i was almost ready to fight him oh she was a little tripping tartar of a bantam hen then shes grown since shes been countessed and does it peacocky now i give you fair warning you know shes more than any mans match i dare say i shall think the same when she has beaten me quoth cynical drummond and immediately went and gave orders for his horse to be saddled thinking that he would tread on the head of the viper but shortly before the hour of his departure mrs evremonde summoned him to her and showed him a slip of paper on which was written in an uncouth small hand madam a friend warns you that your husband is coming here deep interest in your welfare is the cause of an anonymous communication the writer wishes only to warn you in time mrs evremonde told drummond that she had received it from one of the servants when leaving the breakfast room beyond the fact that a man on horseback had handed it to a little boy who had delivered it over to the footman drummond could learn nothing of course all thought of the journey to lymport was abandoned if but to excogitate a motive for the origin of the document drummond was forced to remain and now he had it and now he lost it again and as he was wandering about in his maze the countess met him with a good morning mr forth have i impeded your expedition by taking my friend mr harry to cavalier me to day drummond smilingly assured her that she had not in any way disarranged his projects and passed with so absorbed a brow that the countess could afford to turn her head and inspect him without fear that he would surprise her in the act knocking the pearly edge of her fan on her teeth she eyed him under her joined black lashes and deliberately read his thoughts in the mere shape of his back and shoulders she read him through and through and was unconscious of the effective attitude she stood in for the space of two full minutes and even then it required one of our unhappy sex to recall her this was harry jocelyn my friend she said to him with a melancholy smile my one friend here harry went through the form of kissing her hand which he had been taught and practised cunningly as the first step of the ladder i say you looked so handsome standing as you did just now he remarked and she could see how far beneath her that effective attitude had precipitated the youth ah she sighed walking on with the step of majesty in exile what the deuce is the matter with everybody to day cried harry im hanged if i can make it out theres the carrington as you call her i met her with such a pair of eyes and old george looking as if hed been licked at her heels and theres drummond and his lady fair moping about the lawn and my mother positively getting excitedtheres a miracle and juleys sharpening her nails for somebody and if ferdinand dont look out your brotherll be walking off with roseythats my opinion indeed said the countess you really think so well they come it pretty strong together and what constitutes the come it strong mr harry hold of hands you know the young gentleman indicated alas then must not we be more discreet oh but its different with young people one knows what that means deus exclaimed the countess tossing her head weariedly and harry perceived his slip and down he went again what wonder that a youth in such training should consent to fetch and carry to listen and relate to play the spy and know no more of his office than that it gave him astonishing thrills of satisfaction and now and then a secret sweet reward the countess had sealed miss carringtons mouth by one of her most dexterous strokes on leaving the dinner table over night and seeing that carolines attack would preclude their instant retreat the gallant countess turned at bay a word aside to mr george uplift and then the countess took a chair by miss carrington she did all the conversation and supplied all the smiles to it and when a lady has to do that she is justified in striking and striking hard for to abandon the pretence of sweetness is a gross insult from one woman to another the countess then led circuitously but with all the ease in the world to the story of a portuguese lady of a marvellous beauty and who was deeply enamoured of the chevalier miguel de rasadio and engaged to be married to him but alas for her in the insolence of her happiness she wantonly made an enemy in the person of a most unoffending lady and she repented it while sketching the admirable chevalier the countess drew a telling portrait of mr george uplift and gratified her humour and her wrath at once by strong truth to nature in the description and animated encomiums on the individual the portuguese lady too a little resembled miss carrington in spite of her marvellous beauty and it was odd that miss carrington should give a sudden start and a horrified glance at the countess just when the countess was pathetically relating the proceeding taken by the revengeful lady on the beautiful betrothed of the chevalier miguel de rasadio which proceeding was nothing other than to bring to the chevaliers knowledge that his beauty had a defect concealed by her apparel and that the specks in his fruit were not one or two but oh and the dreadful sequel to the story the countess could not tell preferring ingeniously to throw a tragic veil over it miss carrington went early to bed that night the courage that mounteth with occasion was eminently the attribute of the countess de saldar after that dreadful dinner she since the weaknesses of great generals should not be altogether ignored did pray for flight and total obscurity but caroline could not be left in her hysteric state and now that she really perceived that evan was progressing and on the point of sealing his chance the devoted lady resolved to hold her ground besides there was the pic nic the countess had one dress she had not yet appeared in and it was for the picnic she kept it that small motives are at the bottom of many illustrious actions is a modern discovery but i shall not adopt the modern principle of magnifying the small motive till it overshadows my noble heroine i remember that the small motive is only to be seen by being borne into the range of my vision by a powerful microscope and if i do more than seeif i carry on my reflections by the aid of the glass i arrive at conclusions that must be false men who dwarf human nature do this the gods are juster the countess though she wished to remain for the pic nic and felt warm in anticipation of the homage to her new dress was still a gallant general and a devoted sister and if she said to herself come what may i will stay for that pic nic and they shall not brow beat me out of it it is that trifling pleasures are noisiest about the heart of human nature not that they govern us absolutely there is mob rule in minds as in communities but the countess had her appetites in excellent drill this pic nic surrendered represented to her defeat in all its ignominy the largest longest headed of schemes ask occasionally for something substantial and immediate so the countess stipulated with providence for the pic nic it was a point to be passed thorough flood thorough fire in vain poor andrew cogglesby to whom the dinner had been torture and who was beginning to see the position they stood in at beckley begged to be allowed to take them away or to go alone the countess laughed him into submission as a consequence of her audacious spirits she grew more charming and more natural and the humour that she possessed but which like her other faculties was usually subordinate to her plans gave spontaneous bursts throughout the day and delighted her courtiers nor did the men at all dislike the difference of her manner with them and with the ladies i may observe that a woman who shows a marked depression in the presence of her own sex will be thought very superior by ours that is supposing she is clever and agreeable manhood distinguishes what flatters it a lady approaches we must be proper says the countess and her hearty laugh dies with suddenness and is succeeded by the maturest gravity and the countess can look a profound merriment with perfect sedateness when there appears to be an equivoque in company finely secret are her glances as if under every eye lash there lurked the shade of a meaning what she meant was not so clear all this was going on and lady jocelyn was simply amused and sat as at a play she seems to have stepped out of a book of french memoirs said her ladyship la vie galante et devotevoila la comtesse in contradistinction to the other ladies she did not detest the countess because she could not like her wheres the harm in her she asked she doesnt damage the men that i can see and a person you can laugh at and with is inexhaustible and how long is she to stay here mrs shorne inquired mrs melville remarking her visit appears to be inexhaustible i suppose shell stay till the election business is over said lady jocelyn the countess had just driven with melville to fallowfield in carolines black lace shawl upwards of four weeks longer mrs melville interjected lady jocelyn chuckled miss carrington was present she had been formerly sharp in her condemnation of the countessher affectedness her euphuism and her vulgarity now she did not say a word though she might have done it with impunity i suppose emily you see what rose is about said mrs melville i should not have thought it adviseable to have that young man here myself i think i let you know that one young mans as good as another responded her ladyship ive my doubts of the one thats much better i fancy rose is as good a judge by this time as you or i mrs melville made an effort or two to open lady jocelyns eyes and then relapsed into the confident serenity inspired by evil prognostications but there really does seem some infatuation about these people exclaimed mrs shorne turning to miss current can you understand it the duke my dear things seem to be going on in the house that reallyand so openly thats one virtue said miss current with her imperturbable metallic voice and face like a cold clear northern sky things done in secret throw on the outsiders the onus of raising a scandal you dont believe then suggested mrs shorne miss current replied i always wait for a thing to happen first but havent you seen my dear i never see anything my dear then you must be blind my dear on the contrary thats how i keep my sight my dear i dont understand you said mrs shorne its a part of the science of optics and requires study said miss current neither with the worldly nor the unworldly woman could the ladies do anything but they were soon to have their triumph a delicious morning had followed the lovely night the stream flowed under evans eyes like something in a lower sphere now his passion took him up as if a genie had lifted him into mid air and showed him the world on a palm of a hand and yet as he dressed by the window little chinks in the garden wall and nectarines under their shiny leaves and the white walks of the garden were stamped on his hot brain accurately and lastingly ruth upon the lips of rose that voice of living constancy made music to him everywhere thy god shall be my god he had heard it all through the night he had not yet broken the tender charm sufficiently to think that he must tell her the sacrifice she would have to make when partly he did the first excuse he clutched at was that he had not even kissed her on the forehead surely he had been splendidly chivalrous just as surely he would have brought on himself the scorn of the chivalrous or of the commonly balanced if he had been otherwise the grandeur of this or of any of his proceedings then was forfeited as it must needs be when we are in the false position we can have no glory though martyred the youth felt it even to the seeing of why it was and he resolved in justice to the dear girl that he would break loose from his fetters as we call our weakness behold rose met him descending the stairs and taking his hand sang unabashed by the tell tale colour coming over her face a stave of a little portuguese air that they had both been fond of in portugal and he listening to it and looking in her eyes saw that his feelings in the old time had been hers instantly the old time gave him its breath the present drew back rose now that she had given her heart out had no idea of concealment she would have denied nothing to her aunts she was ready to confide it to her mother was she not proud of the man she loved when evans hand touched hers she retained it and smiled up at him frankly as it were to make him glad in her gladness if before others his eyes brought the blood to her cheeks she would perhaps drop her eye lids an instant and then glance quickly level again to reassure him and who would have thought that this boisterous boyish creature had such depths of eye cold did they call her let others think her cold the tender knowledge of herthe throbbing secret they held in common sang at his heart rose made no confidante but she attempted no mystery evan should have risen to the height of the noble girl but the dearer and sweeter her bearing became the more conscious he was of the dead weight he was dragging in truth her behaviour stamped his false position to hard print the more he admired her for it and he had shrinkings from the feminine part it imposed on him to play chapter xxv in which the stream flows muddy and clear an irish retriever pup of the shannon breed pat by name was undergoing tuition on the sward close by the kennels roses hunting whip being passed through his collar to restrain erratic propensities the particular point of instruction which now made poor pat hang out his tongue and agitate his crisp brown curls was the performance of the down charge a ceremony demanding implicit obedience from the animal in the midst of volatile gambadoes and a simulation of profound repose when his desire to be up and bounding was mighty pats irish eyes were watching rose as he lay with his head couched between his forepaws in the required attitude he had but half learnt his lesson and something in his half humorous half melancholy look talked to rose more eloquently than her friend ferdinand at her elbow laxley was her assistant dog breaker rose would not abandon her friends because she had accepted a lover on the contrary rose was very kind to ferdinand and perhaps felt bound to be so to day to day also her face was lighted a readiness to colour and an expression of deeper knowledge which she now had made the girl dangerous to friends this was not roses fault but there is no doubt among the faculty that love is a contagious disease and we ought not to come within miles of the creatures in whom it lodges pats tail kept hinting to his mistress that a change would afford him satisfaction after a time she withdrew her wistful gaze from him and listened entirely to ferdinand and it struck her that he spoke particularly well to day though she did not see so much in his eyes as in pats the subject concerned his departure and he asked rose if she should be sorry rose to make him sure of it threw a music into her voice dangerous to friends for she had given heart and soul to evan and had a sense therefore of being irredeemably in debt to her old associates and wished to be doubly kind to them pat took advantage of the diversion to stand up quietly and have a shake he then began to kiss his mistresss hand to show that all was right on both sides and followed this with a playful pretence at a bite that there might be no subsequent misunderstanding and then a bark and a whine as no attention was paid to this amount of plain speaking pat made a bolt he got no farther than the length of the whip and all he gained was to bring on himself the terrible word of drill once more but pat had tasted liberty irish rebellion against constituted authority was exhibited pat would not his ears tossed over his head and he jumped to right and left and looked the raggedest rapparee that ever his ancestry trotted after rose laughed at his fruitless efforts to get free but ferdinand meditatively appeared to catch a sentiment in them down charge sir will you ah pat pat youll have to obey me my boy now down charge while rose addressed the language of reason to pat ferdinand slipped in a soft word or two presently she saw him on one knee pat wont and i will said he but pat shall and you had better not said she besides my dear ferdinand she added laughing you dont know how to do it do you want me to prostrate on all fours rose no i hope not do get up ferdinand youll be seen from the windows instead of quitting his posture he caught her hand and scared her with a declaration of all men you to be on your knees and to me ferdinand she cried in discomfort why shouldnt i rose was this youths answer he had got the idea that foreign cavalier manners would take with her but it was not so easy to make his speech correspond with his posture and he lost his opportunity which was pretty however he spoke plain english the interview ended by rose releasing pat from drill and running off in a hurry where was evan she must have his consent to speak to her mother and prevent a recurrence of these silly scenes evan was with caroline his sister it was contrary to the double injunction of the countess that caroline should receive evan during her absence or that he should disturb the dear invalid with a visit these two were not unlike both in organization and character and they had not sat together long before they found each other out now to further evans love suit the countess had induced caroline to continue yet awhile in the purgatory beckley court had become to her but evan in speaking of rose expressed a determination to leave her and caroline caught at it can youwill you oh dear van have you the courage ilook at meyou know the home i go to andand i think of it here as a place to be happy in what have our marriages done for us better that we had married simple stupid men who earn their bread and would not have been ashamed of us and my dearest it is not only that none can tell what our temptations are louisa has strength but i feel i have none and though dear for your true interest i would indeed sacrifice myselfi would van i wouldit is not good for you to stayi know it is not for you have papas sense of honourand oh if you should learn to despise me my dear brother she kissed him her nerves were agitated by strong mental excitement he attributed it to her recent attack of illness but could not help asking while he caressed her whats that despise you it may have been that caroline felt then that to speak of something was to forfeit something a light glimmered across the dewy blue of her beautiful eyes desire to breathe it to him and have his loving aid the fear of forfeiting it evil as it was to her and at the bottom of all that doubt we choose to encourage of the harm in a pleasant sin unaccomplished these might be read in the rich dim gleam that swept like sunlight over sea water between breaks of clouds dear van do you love her so much caroline knew too well that she was shutting her own theme with iron clasps when she once touched on evans love her love rose it became an endless carol with evan caroline sighed for him from her heart you knowyou understand me dont you he said after a breathless excursion of his fancy i believe you love her dear i think i have never loved any one but my one brother his love for rose he could pour out to caroline when it came to roses love for him his blood thickened and his tongue felt guilty he must speak to her he saidtell her all yes tell her all echoed caroline do do tell her trust a woman utterly if she loves you dear go to her instantly could you bear it said evan he began to think it was for the sake of his sisters that he had hesitated bear it bear anything rather than perpetual imposture what have i not borne tell her and then if she is cold to you let us go let us go i shall be glad to ah van i love you so carolines voice deepened i love you so my dear you wont let your new love drive me out shall you always love me of that she might be sure whatever happened should you love me van if evil befel me thrice as well he swore to her but if iif i van oh my life is intolerable supposing i should ever disgrace you in any way and not turn out all you fancied me i am very weak and unhappy evan kissed her confidently with a warm smile he said a few words of the great faith he had in her words that were bitter comfort to caroline this brother who might save her to him she dared not speak did she wish to be saved she only knew that to wound evans sense of honour and the high and chivalrous veneration for her sex and pride in himself and those of his blood would be wicked and unpardonable and that no earthly pleasure could drown it thinking this with her hands joined in pale dejection caroline sat silent and evan left her to lay bare his heart to rose on his way to find rose he was stopped by the announcement of the arrival of mr raikes who thrust a bundle of notes into his hand and after speaking loudly of his curricle retired on important business as he said with a mysterious air im beaten in many things but not in the article luck he remarked you will hear of me though hardly as a tutor in this academy scanning the bundle of notes without a reflection beyond the thought that money was in his hand and wondering at the apparition of the curricle evan was joined by harry jocelyn and harry linked his arm in evans and plunged with extraordinary spontaneity and candour into the state of his money affairs what the deuce he was to do for money he did not know from the impressive manner in which he put it it appeared to be one of natures great problems that the whole human race were bound to set their heads together to solve a hundred poundsharry wanted no more and he could not get it his uncles they were as poor as rats and all the spare money they could club was going for mels election expenses a hundred and fifty was what harry really wanted but he could do with a hundred ferdinand who had plenty would not even lend him fifty ferdinand had dared to hint at a debt already unsettled and he called himself a gentleman you wouldnt speak of money matters now would you harrington i dislike the subject i confess said evan and so do i harry jumped at the perfect similarity between them you cant think how it bothers one to have to talk about it you and i are tremendously alike evan might naturally suppose that a subject harry detested he would not continue but for a whole hour harry turned it over and over with grim glances at jewry you see he wound up im in a fix i want to help that poor girl and one or two things its for that you want it cried evan brightening to him accept it from me it is a thing familiar to the experience of money borrowers that your last chance is the man who is to accommodate you but we are always astonished nevertheless and harry was when notes to the amount of the largest sum named by him were placed in his hand by one whom he looked upon as the last to lend what a trump you are harrington was all he could say and then he was for hurrying evan into the house to find pen and paper and write down a memorandum of the loan but evan insisted upon sparing him the trouble though harry with the admirable scruples of an inveterate borrower begged hard to be allowed to bind himself legally to repay the money pon my soul harrington you make me remember i once doubted whether you were one of usrather your own fault you know said harry bury that wont you till your doubts recur evan observed and harry burst out gad if you werent such a melancholy beggar youd be the jolliest fellow i know there go after rosey dashed if i dont think youre ahead of ferdinand long chalks your style does for girls i like women with a chuckle and a wink harry swung off evan had now to reflect that he had just thrown away part of the price of his bondage to tailordom the mention of rose filled his mind where was she both were seeking one another rose was in the cypress walk he saw the star like figure up the length of it between the swelling tall dark pillars and was hurrying to her resolute not to let one minute of deception blacken further the soul that loved so true a soul she saw him and stood smiling when the countess issued shadow like from a side path and declared that she must claim her brother for a few instants would her sweet rose pardon her rose bowed coolly the hearts of the lovers were chilled not that they perceived any malice in the countess but their keen instincts felt an evil fate the countess had but to tell evan that she had met the insolvent in apples and recognized him under his change of fortune and had no doubt that at least he would amuse the company then she asked her brother the superfluous question whether he loved her which evan answered satisfactorily enough as he thought but practical ladies require proofs quick said evan seeing rose vanish what do you want ill do anything anything ah but this will be disagreeable to you name it at once i promise beforehand the countess wanted evan to ask andrew to be the very best brother in law in the world and win unknown to himself her cheerful thanks by lending evan to lend to her the sum of one hundred pounds as she was in absolute distress for money really louisa this is a thing you might ask him yourself evan remonstrated it would not become me to do so dear said the countess demurely and inasmuch as she had already drawn on andrew in her own person pretty largely her views of propriety were correct in this instance evan had to consent before he could be released he ran to the end of the walk through the portal into the park rose was not to be seen she had gone in to dress for dinner the opportunity might recur but would his courage come with it his courage had sunk on a sudden or it may have been that it was worst for this young man to ask for a loan of money than to tell his beloved that he was basely born vile and unworthy and had snared her into loving him for when he and andrew were together money was not alluded to andrew however betrayed remarkable discomposure he said plainly that he wanted to leave beckley court and wondered why he didnt leave and whether he was on his head or his feet and how he had been such a fool as to come do you mean that for me said sensitive evan oh you youre a young buck returned andrew evasively we common place business menwere out of our element and theres poor carry cant sit down to their dinners without an upset i thank god im a radical van one mans the same as another to me how hes born as long as hes honest and agreeable but a chap like that george uplift to look down on anybody gad ive a good mind to bring in a bill for the abolition of the squirearchy ultimately andrew somehow contrived to stick a hint or two about the terrible dinner in evans quivering flesh he did it as delicately as possible half begging pardon and perspiring profusely evan grasped his hand and thanked him carolines illness was now explained to him ill take caroline with me to morrow he said louisa wishes to staytheres a pic nic will you look to her and bring her with you my dear van replied andrew stop with louisa now in confidence its as bad as a couple of wives no disrespect to my excellent good harry at home but louisai dont know how it isbut louisa you lose your head youre in a whirl youre an automaton a teetotum i havent a notion of what ive been doing or saying since i came here my belief is ive been lying right and left i shall be found out to a certainty oh if shes made her mind up for the pic nic somebody must stop i can only tell you van its one perpetual vapour bath to me therell be room for two in my trousers when i get back i shall have to get the tailor to take them in a full half here occurred an opening for one of those acrid pleasantries which console us when there is horrid warfare within you must give me the work said evan partly pleased with his hated self for being able to jest on the subject as a piece of preliminary self conquest aha went andrew as if the joke were too good to be dwelt on hem and by way of diverting from it cleverly and naturally he remarked that the weather was fine this made evan allude to his letter written from lymport upon which andrew said tush pish humbug nonsense wont hear a word dont know anything about it van youre going to be a brewer i say you are youre afraid you cant i tell you sir ive got a bet on it youre not going to make me lose are youeh i have and a stiff bet too you must and shall so theres an end only we cant make arrangements just yet my boy old tomvery good old fellowbut you knowmust get old tom out of the way first now go and dress for dinner and lord preserve us from the great mel to day andrew mumbled as he turned away evan could not reach his chamber without being waylaid by the countess had he remembered the sister who sacrificed so much for him there there cried evan and her hand closed on the delicious golden whispers of bank notes and oh generous andrew dear good evan were the exclamations of the gratified lady there remained nearly another hundred evan laid out the notes and eyed them while dressing they seemed to say to him we have you now he was clutched by a beneficent or a most malignant magician the former seemed due to him considering the cloud on his fortunes this enigma might mean that by submitting to a temporary humiliation for a trial of himin fact by his acknowledgement of the fact loathed though it washe won a secret overlookers esteem gained a powerful ally here was the proof he held the proof he had read arabian tales and could believe in marvels especially could he believe in the friendliness of a magical thing that astounded without hurting him he sat down in his room at night and wrote a fairly manful letter to rose and it is to be said of the wretch he then saw himself that he pardoned her for turning from so vile a pretender he heard a step in the passage it was polly wheedle polly had put her young mistress to bed and was retiring to her own slumbers he made her take the letter and promise to deliver it immediately would not to morrow morning do she asked as miss rose was very sleepy he seemed to hesitatehe was picturing how rose looked when very sleepy why should he surrender this darling and subtler questionwhy should he make her unhappy why disturb her at all in her sweet sleep well said evan to morrow will dono take it to night for gods sake he cried as one who bursts the spell of an opiate go at once the temptation had almost overcome him polly thought his proceedings queer and what could the letter contain a declaration of course she walked slowly along the passage meditating on love and remotely on its slave mr nicholas frim nicholas had never written her a letter but she was determined that he should some day she wondered what love letters were like like valentines without the cupids practical valentines one might say not vapoury and wild but hot and to the point delightful things no harm in peeping at a love letter if you do it with the eye of a friend polly spelt just a word when a door opened at her elbow she dropped her candle and curtsied to the countesss voice the countess desired her to enter and all in a tremble polly crept in her air of guilt made the countess thrill she had merely called her in to extract daily gossip the corner of the letter sticking up under pollys neck attracted her strangely and beginning with the familiar well child she talked of things interesting to polly and then exhibited the pic nic dress it was a lovely half mourning airy sorrows gauzy griefs you might imagine to constitute the wearer white delicately striped exquisitely trimmed and of a stuff to make the feminine mouth water could polly refuse to try it on when the flattering proposal met her ears blushing shame faced adoring the lady who made her look adorable polly tried it on and the countess complimented her and made a doll of her and turned her this way and that way and intoxicated her a rich husband polly child and you are a lady ready made infamous poison to poor polly but as the thunder destroys small insects exalted schemers are to be excused for riding down their few thousands moreover the countess really looked upon domestics as being only half souls dressed in her own attire again polly felt in her pockets and at her bosom and sang out oh myoh where oh the letter was lost the letter could not be found the countess grew extremely fatigued and had to dismiss polly in spite of her eager petitions to be allowed to search under the carpets and inside the bed in the morning came evans great trial there stood rose she turned to him and her eyes were happy and unclouded you are not changed he said changed what could change me the god of true hearts bless her he could hardly believe it you are the rose i knew yesterday yes evan but youyou look as if you had not slept you will not leave me this morning before i go rose oh my darling this that you do for me is the work of an angelnothing less i have been a coward and my beloved to feel vile is agony to meit makes me feel unworthy of the hand i press now all is clear between us i go i am forgiven rose repeated his last words and then added hurriedly all is clear between us shall i speak to mama this morning dear evan it will be right that i should for the moment he could not understand why but supposing a scrupulous honesty in her said yes tell lady jocelyn all and then evan you will never need to go they separated the deep toned sentence sang in evans heart rose and her mother were of one stamp and rose might speak for her mother to take the hands of such a pair and be lifted out of the slough he thought no shame and all through the hours of the morning the image of two angels stooping to touch a leper pressed on his brain like a reality and went divinely through his blood toward mid day rose beckoned to him and led him out across the lawn into the park and along the borders of the stream evan she said shall i really speak to mama you have not yet he answered no i have been with juliana and with drummond look at this evan she showed a small black speck in the palm of her hand which turned out on your viewing it closely to be a brand of the letter l mama did that when i was a little girl because i told lies i never could distinguish between truth and falsehood and mama set that mark on me and i have never told a lie since she forgives anything but that she will be our friend she will never forsake us evan if we do not deceive her oh evan it never is of any use but deceive her and she cannot forgive you it is not in her nature evan paused before he replied you have only to tell her what i have told you you know everything rose gave him a flying look of pain everything evan what do i know ah rose do you compel me to repeat it bewildered rose thought have i slept and forgotten it he saw the persistent grieved interrogation of her eyebrows well she sighed resignedly i am yours you know that evan but he was a lover and quarrelled with her sigh it may well make you sad now rose sad no that does not make me sad no but my hands are tied i cannot defend you or justify myself and induce mama to stand by us oh evan you love me why can you not open your heart to me entirely and trust me more cried evan can i trust you more he spoke of the letter rose caught his hand i never had it evan you wrote it last night and all was written in it i never saw itbut i know all their eyes fronted the gates of roses were wide open and he saw no hurtful beasts or lurking snakes in the happy garden within but love like a fixed star then you know why i must leave rose leave leave me on the contrary you must stay by me and support me why evan we have to fight a battle much as he worshipped her this intrepid directness of soul startled himalmost humbled him and her eyes shone with a firm cheerful light as she exclaimed it makes me so happy to think you were the first to mention this you meant to be and thats the same thing i heard it this morning you wrote it last night its you i love evan your birth and what you were obliged to dothats nothing of course im sorry for it dear but im more sorry for the pain i must have sometimes put you to it happened through my mothers father being a merchant and that side of the family the men and women are quite sordid and unendurable and thats how it came that i spoke of disliking tradesmen i little thought i should ever love one sprung from that class she turned to him tenderly and in spite of what my birth is you love me rose theres no spite in it evan i do hard for him while his heart was melting to caress her the thought that he had snared this bird of heaven in a net rose gave him no time for reflection or the moony imagining of their raptures lovers love to dwell upon you gave the letter to polly of course yes oh naughty polly i must punish you rose apostrophized her you might have divided us for ever well we shall have to fight a battle you understand that will you stand by me would he not risk his soul for her very well evan thenbut dont be sensitive oh how sensitive you are i see it all now this is what we shall have to do we shall have to speak to mama to daythis morning drummond has told me he is going to speak to her and we must be first thats decided i begged a couple of hours you must not be offended with drummond he does it out of pure affection for us and i can see hes rightor at least not quite wrong he ought i think to know that he cannot change me very well we shall win mama by what we do my mother has ten times my wits and yet i manage her like a feather i have only to be honest and straightforward then mama will gain over papa papa of course wont like it hes quiet and easy but he likes blood but he also likes peace better and i think he loves roseyas well as somebodyalmost look dear there is our seat where wewhere you would rob me of my handkerchief i cant talk any more rose had suddenly fallen from her prattle soft and short breathed then dear she went on we shall have to fight the family aunt shorne will be terrible my poor uncles i pity them but they will come round they always have thought what i did was right and why should they change their minds now i shall tell them that at their time of life a change of any kind is very unwise and bad for them then there is grandmama bonner she can hurt us really if she pleases oh my dear evan if you had only been a curate why isnt your name parsley then my grandmama the countess of elburne well we have a countess on our side havent we and that reminds me evan if were to be happy and succeed you must promise one thing you will not tell the countess your sister dont confide this to her will you promise evan assured her he was not in the habit of pouring secrets into any bosom the countesss as little as anothers very well then evan its unpleasant while it lasts but we shall gain the day uncle melville will give you an appointment and then yes rose he said i will do this though i dont think you can know what i shall have to endurenot in confessing what i am but in feeling that i have brought you to my level does it not raise me she cried he shook his head but in reality evanapart from mere appearancesin reality it does it does men will not think so rose nor can i oh my rose how different you make me up to this hour i have been so weak torn two ways you give me double strength then these lovers talked of distant dayscompared their feelings on this and that occasion with mutual wonder and delight then the old hours lived anew anddid you really think that evan andoh rose was that your dream and the meaning of that by gone look was it what they fancied and such and such a tone of voice would it bear the wished interpretation thus does love avenge himself on the unsatisfactory past and call out its essence could evan do less than adore her she knew all and she loved him since he was too shy to allude more than once to his letter it was natural that he should not ask her how she came to know and how much the all that she knew comprised in his letter he had told all the condition of his parents and his own honestly now what with his dazzled state of mind his deep inward happiness and loves endless delusions he abstained from touching the subject further honestly therefore as far as a lover can be honest so they toyed and then rose setting her fingers loose whispered are you ready and evan nodded and rose to make him think light of the matter in hand laughed pluck not quite up yet quite my rose said evan and they walked to the house not quite knowing what they were going to do on the steps they met drummond with mrs evremonde little imagining how heart and heart the two had grown and that evan would understand him drummond called to rose playfully times up is it rose answered and to mrs evremonde give drummond a walk poor drummond is going silly evan looked into his eyes calmly as he passed where are you going rose said mrs evremonde going to give my maid polly a whipping for losing a letter she ought to have delivered to me last night said rose in a loud voice looking at drummond and then going to mama pleasure firstduty after isnt that the proverb drummond she kissed her fingers rather scornfully to her old friend chapter xxvi mrs mel makes a bed for herself and family the last person thought of by her children at this period was mrs mel nor had she been thinking much of them till a letter from mr goren arrived one day which caused her to pass them seriously in review always an early bird and with maxims of her own on the subject of rising and getting the worm she was standing in a small perch in the corner of the shop dictating accounts to mrs fiske who was copying hurriedly that she might earn sweet intervals for gossip when dandy limped up and delivered the letter mrs fiske worked hard while her aunt was occupied in reading it for a great deal of fresh talk follows the advent of the post and may be reckoned on without looking up however she could tell presently that the letter had been read through such being the case and no conversation coming of it her curiosity was violent her aunts face too was an index of something extraordinary that inflexible woman instead of alluding to the letter in any way folded it up and renewed her dictation it became a contest between them which should show her human nature first mrs mel had to repress what she knew mrs fiske to control the passion for intelligence the close neighbourhood of one anxious to receive and one capable of giving waxed too much for both i think anne you are stupid this morning said mrs mel well i am aunt said mrs fiske pretending not to see which was the first to unbend i dont know what it is the figures seem all dazzled like i shall really be glad when evan comes to take his proper place ah went mrs mel and mrs fiske heard her muttering then she cried out are harriet and caroline as great liars as louisa mrs fiske grimaced that would be difficult would it not aunt and i have been telling everybody that my son is in town learning his business when hes idling at a country house and trying to play his father over again upon my word what with liars and fools if you go to sleep a minute you have a months work on your back what is it aunt mrs fiske feebly inquired a gentleman i suppose he wouldnt take an order if it was offered upon my word when tailors think of winning heiresses its time we went back to adam and eve do you mean evan aunt interposed mrs fiske who probably did not see the turns in her aunts mind thereread for yourself said mrs mel and left her with the letter mrs fiske read that mr goren had been astonished at evans non appearance and at his total silence which he did not consider altogether gentlemanly behaviour and certainly not such as his father would have practised mr goren regretted his absence the more as he would have found him useful in a remarkable invention he was about to patent being a peculiar red cross upon shirtsa fortune to the patentee but as mr goren had no natural heirs of his body he did not care for that what affected him painfully was the news of evans doings at a noble house beckley court to wit where according to the report of a rich young gentleman friend mr raikes for whose custom mr goren was bound to thank evan the youth who should have been learning the science of tailoring had actually passed himself off as a lord or the son of one or something of the kind and had got engaged to a wealthy heiress and would no doubt marry her if not found out where the chances of detection were so numerous mr goren saw much to condemn in the idea of such a marriage but like father like son said mr goren he thanked the lord that an honest tradesman was not looked down upon in this country and in fact gave mrs mel a few quiet digs to waken her remorse in having missed the man that he was when mrs fiske met her aunt again she returned her the letter and simply remarked louisa mrs mel nodded she understood the implication the general who had schemed so successfully to gain evan time at beckley court in his own despite and against a hundred obstructions had now another enemy in the field and one who if she could not undo her work could punish her by the afternoon coach mrs mel accompanied by dandy her squire was journeying to fallowfield bent upon things the faithful squire was kept by her side rather as a security for others than for his particular services dandys arms were crossed and his countenance was gloomy he had been promised a holiday that afternoon to give his mistress sally kilnes cook an airing and dandy knew in his soul that sally when she once made up her mind to an excursion would go and would not go alone and that her very force of will endangered her constancy he had begged humbly to be allowed to stay but mrs mel could not trust him she ought to have told him so perhaps explanations were not approved of by this well intended despot and however beneficial her resolves might turn out for all parties it was natural that in the interim the children of her rule should revolt and dandy picturing his sally flaunting on the arm of some accursed low marine haply kicked against mrs mels sovereignty though all that he did was to shoot out his fist from time to time and grunt through his set teeth iron to express the character of her awful rule mrs mel alighted at the dolphin the landlady of which was a mrs hawkshaw a rival of mrs sockley of the green dragon she was welcomed by mrs hawkshaw with considerable respect the great mel had sometimes slept at the dolphin ah that black she sighed indicating mrs mels dress and the story it told i cant give you his room my dear mrs harrington wishing i could im sorry to say its occupied for all i ought to be glad i dare say for hes an old gentleman who does you a good turn if you study him but there id rather have had poor dear mr harrington in my best bed than old or youngprinces or nobodies i wouldhe was that grand and pleasant mrs mel had her tea in mrs hawkshaws parlour and was entertained about her husband up to the hour of supper when a short step and a querulous voice were heard in the passage and an old gentleman appeared before them whos to carry up my trunk maam no man here mrs hawkshaw bustled out and tried to lay her hand on a man failing to find the growth spontaneous she returned and begged the old gentleman to wait a few moments and the trunk would be sent up parcel o women was his reply regularly bedevilled gets worse and worse ill carry it up myself with a wheezy effort he persuaded the trunk to stand on one end and then looked at it the exertion made him hot which may account for the rage he burst into when mrs hawkshaw began flutteringly to apologize youre sure maam surewhat are you sure of ill tell you what i am sure ofeh this keeping clear of mens a damned pretence you dont impose upon me dont believe in your pothouse nunneriesnot a bit just like you when you are virtuous its deuced inconvenient let one of the maids try no dont believe in em having thus relieved his spleen the old gentleman addressed himself to further efforts and waxed hotter he managed to tilt the trunk over and thus gained a length and by this method of progression arrived at the foot of the stairs where he halted and wiped his face blowing lustily mrs mel had been watching him with calm scorn all the while she saw him attempt most ridiculously to impel the trunk upwards by a similar process and thought it time to interfere dont you see you must either take it on your shoulders or have a help the old gentleman sprang up from his peculiarly tight posture to blaze round at her he had the words well peppered on his mouth but somehow he stopped and was subsequently content to growl wheres the help in a parcel of petticoats mrs mel did not consider it necessary to give him an answer she went up two or three steps and took hold of one handle of the trunk saying there i think it can be managed this way and she pointed for him to seize the other end with his hand he was now in that unpleasant state of prickly heat when testy old gentlemen could commit slaughter with ecstasy had it been the maid holding a candle who had dared to advise he would have overturned her undoubtedly and established a fresh instance of the impertinence the uselessness and weakness of women mrs mel topped him by half a head and in addition stood three steps above him towering like a giantess the extreme gravity of her large face dispersed all idea of an assault the old gentleman showed signs of being horribly injured nevertheless he put his hand to the trunk it was lifted and the procession ascended the stairs in silence the landlady waited for mrs mel to return and then said really mrs harrington you are clever that lifting that trunks as good as a lock and bolt on him youve as good as made him a dolphinhim that was one o the oldest green dragons in fallifield my thanks to you most sincere mrs mel sent out to hear where dandy had got to after which she said who is the man i told you mrs harringtonthe oldest green dragon his name you mean do you know if i was to breathe it out i believe hed jump out of the window hed be off that you might swear to oh such a whimsical not ill meaningquite the contrary study his whims and youll never want theres mrs sockleyshes took ill he wont go therethats how ive caught him my dearbut he pays her medicine and she looks to him the same he hate a sick house but he pity a sick woman now if i can only please him i can always look on him as half a dolphin to say the least and perhaps to morrow ill tell you who he is and what but not to night for theres his supper to get over and that they say can be as bad as the busting of one of his own vats awful what does he eat said mrs mel a pair o chops that seem simple now dont it and yet they chops make my heart go pitty pat the commonest things are the worst done said mrs mel it aint that but they must be done his particular way do you see mrs harrington laid close on the fire he say so as to keep in the juice but he ups and bounces in a minute at a speck o black so one thing or the other there you are no blacks no juices i say toast the chops said mrs mel the landlady of the dolphin accepted this new idea with much enlightenment but ruefully declared that she was afraid to go against his precise instructions mrs mel then folded her hands and sat in quiet reserve she was one of those numerous women who always know themselves to be right she was also one of those very few whom providence favours by confounding dissentients she was positive the chops would be ill cooked but what could she do she was not in command here so she waited serenely for the certain disasters to enthrone her not that the matter of the chops occupied her mind particularly nor could she dream that the pair in question were destined to form a part of her history and divert the channel of her fortunes her thoughts were about her own immediate work and when the landlady rushed in with the chops under a cover and said look at em dear mrs harrington she had forgotten that she was again to be proved right by the turn of events oh the chops she responded send them while they are hot send em why you dont think id have risked their cooling i have sent em and what do he do but send em travelling back and here they be and what objections his is i might study till i was blind and i shouldnt see em no i suppose not said mrs mel he wont eat em wont eat anything but his bed room candle immediately and whether his sheets are aired and mary says he sniffed at the chops and that gal really did expect hed fling them at her i told you what he was oh dear the bell was heard ringing in the midst of the landladys lamentations go to him yourself said mrs mel no christian man should go to sleep without his supper ah but he aint a common christian returned mrs hawkshaw the old gentleman was in a hurry to know when his bed room candle was coming up or whether they intended to give him one at all that night if not let them say so as he liked plain speaking the moment mrs hawkshaw touched upon the chops he stopped her mouth go about your business maam you cant cook em i never expected you could i was a fool to try you it requires at least ten years instruction before a man can get a woman to cook his chop as he likes it but what was your complaint sir said mrs hawkshaw imploringly thats right and he rubbed his hands and brightened his eyes savagely thats the way opportunity for gossip things well donedown it goes you know that you cant have a word over iteh things done fit to toss on a dungheap aha then theres a cackle my belief is you do it on purpose cant be such rank idiots you do it on purpose all done for gossip oh sir no the landlady half curtsied oh maam yes the old gentleman bobbed his head no indeed sir the landlady shook hers damn it maam i swear you do symptoms of wrath here accompanied the declaration and with a sigh and a very bitter feeling mrs hawkshaw allowed him to have the last word apparently thiswhich i must beg to call the ladys morselcomforted his irascible system somewhat for he remained in a state of composure eight minutes by the clock and mark how little things hang together another word from the landlady precipitating a retort from him and a gesture or muttering from her and from him a snapping outburst and from her a sign that she held out still in fact had she chosen to battle for that last word as in other cases she might have done then would he have exploded gone to bed in the dark and insisted upon sleeping the consequence of which would have been to change this history now while mrs hawkshaw was upstairs mrs mel called the servant who took her to the kitchen where she saw a prime loin of mutton off which she cut two chops with a cunning hand and these she toasted at a gradual distance putting a plate beneath them and a tin behind and hanging the chops so that they would turn without having to be pierced the bell rang twice before she could say the chops were ready the first time the maid had to tell the old gentleman she was taking up his water her next excuse was that she had dropped her candle the chops readywho was to take them really mrs harrington you are so clever you ought if i might be so bold as say so you ought to end it yourself said the landlady i cant ask him to eat them he was all but on the busting point when i left him and that there candle did for him quite said mary the maid im afraid its chops cooked for nothing added the landlady mrs mel saw them endangered the maid held back the landlady feared we can but try she said oh i wish mum youd face him stead o me said mary i do dread that old bears den here i will go said mrs mel has he got his ale better draw it fresh if he drinks any and upstairs she marched the landlady remaining below to listen for the commencement of the disturbance an utterance of something certainly followed mrs mels entrance into the old bears den then silence then what might have been question and answer thenwas mrs mel assaulted and which was knocked down it really was a chair being moved to the table the door opened yes maam do what you like the landlady heard mrs mel descended saying send him up some fresh ale and you have made him sit down obedient to those chops cried the landlady well might poor dear mr harringtonpleasant man as he wassay as he used to say theres lovely women in the world mrs hawkshaw hed say and theres duchesses hed say and theres they that can sing and can dance and some he says that can cook but hed look sly as hed stoop his head and shake it roll em into one he says and not any of your grand ladies can match my wife at home and indeed mrs harrington he told me he thought so many a time in the great company he frequented perfect peace reigning above mrs hawkshaw and mrs mel sat down to supper below and mrs hawkshaw talked much of the great one gone his relict did not care to converse about the dead save in their practical aspect as ghosts but she listened and that passed the time by and by the old gentleman rang and sent a civil message to know if the landlady had ships rum in the house dear heres another trouble cried the poor woman nonone say yes said mrs mel and called dandy and charged him to run down the street to the square and ask for the house of mr coxwell the maltster and beg of him in her name a bottle of his ships rum and dont you tumble down and break the bottle dandy accidents with spirit bottles are not excused dandy went on the errand after an energetic grunt in due time he returned with the bottle whole and sound and mr coxwells compliments mrs mel examined the cork to see that no process of suction had been attempted and then said carry it up to him dandy let him see theres a man in the house besides himself why my dear the landlady turned to her it seems natural to you to be mistress where you go i dont at all mind for aint it my profit but you do take us off our legs then the landlady warmed by gratitude told her that the old gentleman was the great london brewer who brewed there with his brother and brewed for himself five miles out of fallowfield half of which and a good part of the neighbourhood he owned and his name was mr tom cogglesby oh said mrs mel and his brother is mr andrew thats it said the landlady and because he took it into his head to go and to choose for himself and be married no getting his brother mr tom to speak to him why not indeed if theres to be no marrying the sooner we lay down and give up the better i think but thats his way he do hate us women mrs harrington i have heard he was crossed some say it was the lady of beckley court who was a beauty when he was only a poor cobblers son mrs mel breathed nothing of her relationship to mr tom but continued from time to time to express solicitude about dandy they heard the door open and old tom laughing in a capital good temper and then dandy came down evidently full of ships rum hes pumped me said dandy nodding heavily at his mistress mrs mel took him up to his bed room and locked the door on her way back she passed old toms chamber and his chuckles were audible to her they finished the rum said mrs hawkshaw i shall rate him for that to morrow said mrs mel giving that poor beast liquor rate mr tom oh mrs harrington why hell snap your head off for a word mrs mel replied that her head would require a great deal of snapping to come off during this conversation they had both heard a singular intermittent noise above mrs hawkshaw was the first to ask what can it be more trouble with him hes in his bed room now mad with drink like dandy perhaps said mrs mel hark cried the landlady oh it seemed that old tom was bouncing about in an extraordinary manner now came a pause as if he had sworn to take his rest now the room shook and the windows rattled oned think really his bed was a frying pan and him a live fish in it said the landlady ohthere again my goodness have he got a flea the thought was alarming mrs mel joined in or a dont dont my dear she was cut short oh one o them little thingsd be ruin to me to think o that hark at him it must be and whats to do ive sent the maids to bed we havent a man if i was to go and knock at his door and ask better try and get him to be quiet somehow ah i dare say i shall make him fire out fifty times worse mrs hawkshaw stipulated that mrs mel should stand by her and the two women went up stairs and stood at old toms door there they could hear him fuming and muttering imprecations and anon there was an interval of silence and then the room was shaken and the cursings recommenced it must be a fight hes having with a flea said the landlady oh pray heaven it is a flea for a flea my deargentlemen may bring that theirselves but a b thats a stationary and born of a bed dont you hear the other thingd give him a minutes rest but a fleas hop hop off and on and he sound like an old gentleman worried by a flea what are you doing mrs mel had knocked at the door the landlady waited breathlessly for the result it appeared to have quieted old tom whats the matter said mrs mel severely the landlady implored her to speak him fair and reflect on the desperate things he might attempt whats the matter can anything be done for you mr tom cogglesbys reply comprised an insinuation so infamous regarding women when they have a solitary man in their power that it cannot be placed on record is anything the matter with your bed anything yes anything is the matter maam hope twenty live geese inside its enougheh bed do you call it its the rack its damnation bed ha after delivering this he was heard stamping up and down the room my very best bed whispered the landlady would it please you sir to changei can give you another im not a man of experiments maamspecially in strange houses so very very sorry what the deuce old tom came close to the door you whimpering you put a man in a beast of a bedyou drive him half madand then begin to blubber go away i am so sorry sir if you dont go away maam i shall think your intentions are improper oh my goodness cried poor mrs hawkshaw what can one do with him mrs mel put mrs hawkshaw behind her are you dressed she called out in this way mrs mel tackled old tom he was told that should he consent to cover himself decently she would come into his room and make his bed comfortable and in a voice that dispersed armies of innuendoes she bade him take his choice either to rest quiet or do her bidding had old tom found his master at last and in one of the hated sex breathlessly mrs hawkshaw waited his answer and she was an astonished woman when it came very well maam wait a couple of minutes do as you like on their admission to the interior of the chamber old tom was exhibited in his daily garb sufficiently subdued to be civil and explain the cause of his discomfort lumps in his bed he was bruised by them he supposed he couldnt ask women to judge for themselvestheyd be shriekingbut he could assure them he was blue all down his back mrs mel and mrs hawkshaw turned the bed about and punched it and rolled it ha went old tom whats the good of that thats just how i found it moment i got into bed geese began to put up their backs mrs mel seldom indulged in a joke and then only when it had a proverbial cast on the present occasion the truth struck her forcibly and she said one fool makes many and so no doubt does one goose accompanied by a smile the words would have seemed impudent but spoken as a plain fact and with a grave face it set old tom blinking like a small boy ten minutes after the whip now she pursued speaking to him as to an old child look here this is how you manage knead down in the middle of the bed then jump into the hollow lie there and you neednt wake till morning old tom came to the side of the bed he had prepared himself for a wretched night an uproar and eternal complaints against the house its inhabitants and its foundations but a woman stood there who as much as told him that digging his fist into the flock and jumping into the holeinto that hole under his eyeswas all that was wanted that he had been making a noise for nothing and because he had not the wit to hit on a simple contrivance then too his jest about the geesethis woman had put a stop to that he inspected the hollow cynically a man might instruct him on a point or two old tom was not going to admit that a woman could oh very well thank you maam thats your idea ill try it good night good night returned mrs mel dont forget to jump into the middle head foremost maam as you weigh said mrs mel and old tom trumped his lips silenced if not beaten beaten one might almost say for nothing more was heard of him that night he presented himself to mrs mel after breakfast next morning slept well maam oh then you did as i directed you said mrs mel those chops too very good i got through em eating like scratching only wants a beginning said mrs mel ha youve got your word then as well as everybody else wheres your dandy this morning maam locked up you ought to be ashamed to give that poor beast liquor he wont get fresh air to day ha may i ask you where youre going to day maam i am going to beckley so am i maam what d ye say if we join company care for insinuations i want a conveyance of some sort returned mrs mel object to a donkey maam not if hes strong and will go good said old tom and while he spoke a donkey cart stopped in front of the dolphin and a well dressed man touched his hat get out of that damned bad habit will you growled old tom what do you mean by wearing out the brim o your hat in that way help this woman in mrs mel helped herself to a part of the seat we are too much for the donkey she said ha thats right what i have maam is good i cant pretend to horses but my donkeys the best are you going to cry about him no when hes tired i shall either walk or harness you said mrs mel this was spoken half way down the high street of fallowfield old tom looked full in her face and bawled out deuce take it are you a woman i have borne three girls and one boy said mrs mel what sort of a husband he is dead ha thats an opening but taint an answer im off to beckley on a marriage business im the son of a cobbler so i go in a donkey cart no damned pretences for me im going to marry off a young tailor to a gal hes been playing the lord to if she cares for him shell take him if not theyre all the luckier both of em whats the tailors name said mrs mel you are a woman returned old tom now come maam dont you feel ashamed of being in a donkeycart im ashamed of men sometimes said mrs mel never of animals shamed o me perhaps i dont know you ha well im a man with no pretences do you like em how have you brought up your three girls and one boy no pretenceseh mrs mel did not answer and old tom jogged the reins and chuckled and asked his donkey if he wanted to be a racer should you take me for a gentleman maam i dare say you are sir at heart not from your manner of speech i mean appearances maam i judge by the disposition you do maam then deuce take it if you are a woman youre old tom had no time to conclude a great noise of wheels and a horn blown caused them both to turn their heads and they beheld a curricle descending upon them vehemently and a fashionably attired young gentleman straining with all his might at the reins the next instant they were rolling on the bank about twenty yards ahead the curricle was halted and turned about to see the extent of the mischief done pardon a thousand times my worthy couple cried the sonorous mr raikes what we have seen we swear not to divulge franco and fredyour pledge we swear exclaimed this couple but suddenly the cheeks of mr john raikes flushed he alighted from the box and rushing up to old tom was shouting my bene do you want my toe on your plate old tom stopped him with the mysterious words completely changed the aspect of mr john raikes he bowed obsequiously and made his friend franco step down and assist in the task of reestablishing the donkey who fortunately had received no damage chapter xxvii exhibits roses generalship evans performance on the second fiddle and the wretchedness of the countess we left rose and evan on their way to lady jocelyn at the library door rose turned to him and with her chin archly lifted sideways said i know what you feel you feel foolish now the sense of honour and of the necessity of acting the part it imposes on him may be very strong in a young man but certainly as a rule the sense of ridicule is more poignant and evan was suffering horrid pangs we none of us like to play second fiddle to play second fiddle to a young woman is an abomination to us all but to have to perform upon that instrument to the darling of our heartswould we not rather die nay almost rather end the duet precipitately and with violence evan when he passed drummond into the house and quietly returned his gaze endured the first shock of this strange feeling there could be no doubt that he was playing second fiddle to rose and what was he about to do oh horror to stand like a criminal and say or worse have said for him things to tip the ears with fire to tell the young ladys mother that he had won her daughters love and meantwhat did he mean he knew not alas he was second fiddle he could only mean what she meant evan loved rose deeply and completely but noble manhood was strong in him you may sneer at us if you please ladies we have been educated in a theory that when you lead off with the bow the order of nature is reversed and it is no wonder therefore that having stript us of one attribute our fine feathers moult and the majestic cock like march which distinguishes us degenerates you unsex us if i may dare to say so ceasing to be men what are we if we are to please you rightly always allow us to play first poor evan did feel foolish whether rose saw it in his walk or had a loving feminine intuition of it and was aware of the golden rule i have just laid down we need not inquire she hit the fact and he could only stammer and bid her open the door no she said after a slight hesitation it will be better that i should speak to mama alone i see walk out on the lawn dear and wait for me and if you meet drummond dont be angry with him drummond is very fond of me and of course i shall teach him to be fond of you he only thinks what is not true because he does not know you i do thoroughly and there you see i give you my hand evan drew the dear hand humbly to his lips rose then nodded meaningly and let her eyes dwell on him and went in to her mother to open the battle could it be that a flame had sprung up in those grey eyes latterly once they were like morning before sunrise how soft and warm and tenderly transparent they could now be assuredly she loved him and he beloved by the noblest girl ever fashioned why should he hang his head and shrink at the thought of human faces like a wretch doomed to the pillory he visioned her last glance and lightning emotions of pride and happiness flashed through his veins the generous brave heart yes with her hand in his he could stand at baymeet any fate evan accepted rose because he believed in her love and judged it by the strength of his own her sacrifice of her position he accepted because in his soul he knew he should have done no less he mounted to the level of her nobleness and losing nothing of the beauty of what she did it was not so strange to him still there was the baleful reflection that he was second fiddle to his beloved no harmony came of it in his mind how could he take an initiative he walked forth on the lawn where a group had gathered under the shade of a maple consisting of drummond forth mrs evremonde mrs shorne mr george uplift seymour jocelyn and ferdinand laxley a little apart juliana bonner was walking with miss carrington juliana when she saw him left her companion and passing him swiftly said follow me presently into the conservatory evan strolled near the group and bowed to mrs shorne whom he had not seen that morning the ladys acknowledgement of his salute was constrained and but a shade on the side of recognition they were silent till he was out of earshot he noticed that his second approach produced the same effect in the conservatory juliana was awaiting him it is not to give you roses i called you here mr harrington she said not if i beg one he responded ah but you do not want them from it depends on the person pluck this said evan pointing to a white rose she put her fingers to the stem what folly she cried and turned from it are you afraid that i shall compromise you asked evan you care for me too little for that my dear miss bonner how long did you know rose before you called her by her christian name evan really could not remember and was beginning to wonder what he had been called there for the little lady had feverish eyes and fingers and seemed to be burning to speak but afraid i thought you had gone she dropped her voice without wishing me good bye i certainly should not do that miss bonner formal she exclaimed half to herself miss bonner thanks you do you think i wish you to stay no friend of yours would wish it you do not know the selfishnessbrutalof these people of birth as they call it i have met with nothing but kindness here said evan then go while you can feel that she answered for it cannot last another hour here is the rose she broke it from the stem and handed it to him you may wear that and they are not so likely to call you an adventurer and names of that sort i am hardly considered a lady by them an adventurer the full meaning of the phrase struck evans senses when he was alone miss bonner knew something of his condition evidently perhaps it was generally known and perhaps it was thought that he had come to win rose for his worldly advantage the idea was overwhelmingly new to him up started self love in arms he would renounce her it is no insignificant contest when love has to crush self love utterly at moments it can be done love has divine moments there are times also when love draws part of his being from self love and can find no support without it but how could he renounce her when she came forth to himsmiling speaking freshly and lightly and with the colour on her cheeks which showed that she had done her part how could he retract a step i have told mama evan thats over she heard it first from me and she dear evan if you are going to be sensitive ill run away you that fear no danger and are the bravest man i ever knew i think you are really trembling she will speak to papa and thenand then i suppose they will both ask you whether you intend to give me up or no im afraid youll do the former your motherlady jocelyn listened to you rose you told her all every bit and what does she think of me thinks you very handsome and astonishing and me very idiotic and natural and that there is a great deal of bother in the world and that my noble relatives will lay the blame of it on her no dear not all that but she talked very sensibly to me and kindly you know she is called a philosopher nobody knows how deep hearted she is though my mother is true as steel i cant separate the kindness from the sense or i would tell you all she said when i say kindness i dont mean any oh my child and tears and kisses and maundering you know you mustnt mind her thinking me a little fool you want to know what she thinks of you she said nothing to hurt you evan and we have gained ground so far and now well go and face our enemies uncle mel expects to hear about your appointment in a day or two and oh rose evan burst out what is it why must i owe everything to you why dear why because if you do its very much better than your owing it to anybody else proud again not proud only second fiddle you know dear evan when two people love there is no such thing as owing between them rose i have been thinking it is not too late i love you god knows i did in portugal i do nowmore and more but oh my bright angel he ended the sentence in his breast well butwhat evan sounded down the meaning of his but stripped of the usual heroics it was what will be thought of me not a small matter to any of us he caught a distant glimpse of the little bit of bare selfishness and shrank from it too late cried rose the battle has commenced now and mr harrington i will lean on your arm and be led to my dear friends yonder do they think that i am going to put on a mask to please them not for anybody what they are to know they may as well know at once she looked in evans face do you hesitate he felt the contrast between his own and hers between the niggard spirit of the beggarly receiver and the high bloom of the exalted giver nevertheless he loved her too well not to share much of her nature and wedding it suddenly he said rose tell me now if you were to see the place where i was born could you love me still yes evan if you were to hear me spoken of with contempt who dares cried rose never to me contempt of what i spring from rose names used names are used tushnames said rose reddening how cowardly that is have you finished oh faint heart i suppose im not a fair lady or you wouldnt have won me now come remember evan i conceal nothing and if anything makes you wretched here do think how i love you in his own firm belief he had said everything to arrest her in her course and been silenced by transcendent logic she thought the same rose made up to the conclave under the maple the voices hushed as they approached capital weather said rose does harry come back from london to morrowdoes anybody know not aware laxley was heard to reply i want to speak a word to you rose said mrs shorne with the greatest pleasure my dear aunt and rose walked after her my dear rose mrs shorne commenced your conduct requires that i should really talk to you most seriously you are probably not aware of what you are doing nobody likes ease and natural familiarity more than i do i am persuaded it is nothing but your innocence you are young to the worlds ways and perhaps a little too headstrong and vain conceited and wilful added rose if you like the words better but i must sayi do not wish to trouble your fatheryou know he cannot bear worrybut i must say that if you do not listen to me he must be spoken to why not mama i should naturally select my brother first no doubt you understand me any distant allusion to mr harrington pertness will not avail you rose so you want me to do secretly what i am doing openly you must and shall remember you are a jocelyn rose only half my dear aunt and by birth a lady rose and i ought to look under my eyes and blush and shrink whenever i come near a gentleman aunt ah my dear no doubt you will do what is most telling since you have spoken of this mr harrington i must inform you that i have it on certain authority from two or three sources that he is the son of a small shopkeeper at lymport mrs shorne watched the effect she had produced indeed aunt cried rose and do you know this to be true so when you talk of gentlemen rose please be careful whom you include i mustnt include poor mr harrington then my grandpapa bonner is out of the list and such numbers of good worthy men mrs shorne understood the hit at the defunct manufacturer she said you must most distinctly give me your promise while this young adventurer remains herei think it will not be longnot to be compromising yourself further as you now do orindeed i musti shall let your parents perceive that such conduct is ruin to a young girl in your position and certainly you will be sent to elburne house for the winter rose lifted her hands crying ye godsas harry says but im very much obliged to you my dear aunt concerning mr harrington wonderfully obliged son of a small is it a t t tailor aunt it isi have heard and that is much worse cloth is viler than cotton and dont they call these creatures sn snips some word of that sort it makes little difference what they are called well aunt i sincerely thank you as this subject seems to interest you go and see mama now she can tell you a great deal more and if you want her authority come back to me rose then left her aunt in a state of extreme indignation it was a clever move to send mrs shorne to lady jocelyn they were antagonistic and rational as lady jocelyn was and with her passions under control she was unlikely to side with mrs shorne now rose had fought against herself and had as she thought conquered in portugal evans half insinuations had given her small suspicions which the scene on board the jocasta had half confirmed and since she came to communicate with her own mind she bore the attack of all that rose against him bit by bit she had not been too blind to see the unpleasantness of the fresh facts revealed to her they did not change her on the contrary drew her to him fasterand she thought she had completely conquered whatever could rise against him but when juliana bonner told her that day that evan was not only the son of the thing but the thing himself and that his name could be seen any day in lymport and that he had come from the shop to beckley poor rosey had a sick feeling that almost sank her for a moment she looked back wildly to the doors of retreat her eyes had to feed on evan she had to taste some of the luxury of love before she could gain composure and then her arrogance towards those she called her enemies did not quite return in that letter you told me allallall evan yes allreligiously oh why did i miss it would it give you pleasure she feared to speak being tender as a mother to his sensitiveness the expressive action of her eyebrows sufficed she could not bear concealment or doubt or a shadow of dishonesty and he gaining force of soul to join with hers took her hands and related the contents of the letter fully she was pale when he had finished it was some time before she was able to get free from the trammels of prejudice but when she did she did without reserve saying evan there is no man who would have done so much these little exaltations and generosities bind lovers tightly he accepted the credit she gave him and at that we need not wonder it helped him further to accept herself otherwise could hehis name known to be on a shop fronthave aspired to her still but as an unexampled man princely in soul as he felt why he might kneel to rose jocelyn so they listened to one another and blinded the world by putting bandages on their eyes after the fashion of little boys and girls meantime the fair being who had brought these two from the ends of the social scale into this happy tangle the beneficent countess was wretched when you are in the enemys country you are dependent on the activity and zeal of your spies and scouts and the best of thesepolly wheedle to withad proved defective recalcitrant even and because a letter had been lost in her room as the countess exclaimed to herself though polly gave her no reasons the countess had therefore to rely chiefly upon personal observation upon her intuitions upon her sensations in the proximity of the people to whom she was opposed and from these she gathered that she was to use the word which seemed fitting to her betrayed still to be sweet still to smile and to amusestill to give her zealous attention to the business of the diplomatists election still to go through her church services devoutly required heroism she was equal to it for she had remarkable courage but it was hard to feel no longer at one with providence had not providence suggested sir abraham to her killed him off at the right moment in aid of her and now providence had turned and the assistance she had formerly received from that power and given thanks for so profusely was the cause of her terror it was absolutely as if she had been borrowing from a jew and were called upon to pay fifty fold interest evan she writes in a gasp to harriet we must pack up and depart abandon everything he has disgraced us all and ruined himself impossible that we can stay for the pic nic we are known dear think of my position one day in this house particulars when i embrace you i dare not trust a letter here if evan had confided in me he is impenetrable he will be low all his life and i refuse any more to sully myself in attempting to lift him for silvas sake i must positively break the connection heaven knows what i have done for this boy and will support me in the feeling that i have done enough my conscience at least is safe like many illustrious generals the countess had for the hour lost heart we find her however the next day writing oh harriet what trials for sisterly affection can i possiblyweather the gale as the old l sailors used to say it is dreadful i fear i am by duty bound to stop on little bonner thinks evan quite a dukes son has been speaking to her grandmama and to day this morning the venerable old lady quite as much as gave me to understand that an union between our brother and her sons child would sweetly gratify her and help her to go to her rest in peace can i chase that spark of comfort from one so truly pious dearest juliana i have anticipated evans feeling for her and so she thinks his conduct cold indeed i told her point blank he loved her that you know is different from saying dying of love which would have been an untruth but evan of course no getting him should juliana ever reproach me i can assure the child that any man is in love with any womanwhich is really the case it is you dear humdrum what the dictionary calls nascent i never liked the word but it stands for a fact the countess here exhibits the weakness of a self educated intelligence she does not comprehend the joys of scholarship in her employment of latinisms it will be pardoned to her by those who perceive the profound piece of feminine discernment which precedes it i do think i shall now have courage to stay out the pic nic she continues i really do not think all is known very little can be known or i am sure i could not feel as i do it would burn me up george up does not dare and his most beautiful lady love had far better not mr forth may repent his whispers but oh what evan may do rose is almost detestable manners my dear totally deficient an ally has just come evans good fortune is most miraculous his low friend turns out to be a young fortunatus very original sparkling and in my hands to be made much of i do think he willfor he is most zealoushe will counteract that hateful mr forth who may soon have work enough mr raikes evans friend met a mad captain in fallowfield dear mr raikes is ready to say anything not from love of falsehood but because he is ready to think it he has confessed to me that evan told him louisa de saldar has changed his opinion and much impressed this eccentric young gentleman do you know any young girl who wants a fortune and would be grateful dearest i have decided on the pic nic let your conscience be clear and providence cannot be against you so i feel mr parsley spoke very beautifully to that purpose last sunday in the morning service a little too much through his nose perhaps but the poor young mans nose is a great organ and we will not cast it in his teeth more than nature has done i said so to my diplomatist who was amused if you are sparklingly vulgar with the english you are aristocratic oh what principle we women require in the thorny walk of life i can show you a letter when we meet that will astonish humdrum not so diplomatic as the writer thought mrs melville sweet woman must continue to practise civility for a woman who is a wife my dear in verity she lives in a glass house and let her fling no stones let him who is without sin how beautiful that christian sentiment i hope i shall be pardoned but it always seems to me that what we have to endure is infinitely worse than any other suffering for you find no comfort for the children of ts in scripture nor any defence of their dreadful position robbers thieves magdalens but no the unfortunate offspring of that class are not even mentioned at least in my most diligent perusal of the scriptures i never lighted upon any remote allusion and we know the jews did wear clothing outcasts verily and evan could go and writebut i have no patience with him he is the blind tool of his mother and anybodys puppet the letter concludes with horrid emphasis the madre in beckley has sent for evan from a low public house i have intercepted the messenger evan closeted with sir franks andrews horrible old brother with lady jocelyn the whole house from garret to kitchen full of whispers a prayer to providence closes the communication chapter xxviii tom coggleseys proposition the appearance of a curricle and a donkey cart within the gates of beckley court produced a sensation among the men of the lower halls and a couple of them rushed out with the left calf considerably in advance to defend the house from violation toward the curricle they directed what should have been a bow but was a nod their joint attention was then given to the donkey cart in which old tom cogglesby sat alone bunchy in figure bunched in face his shrewd grey eyes twinkling under the bush of his eyebrows oy siryou my man exclaimed the tallest of the pair resolutely this wont do dont you know driving this sort of conveyance slap along the gravel ere up to the pillars s unparliamentary cant be allowed now right about this address accompanied by a commanding elevation of the dexter hand seemed to excite mr raikes far more than old tom he alighted from his perch in haste and was running up to the stalwart figure crying fellow when as you tell a dog to lie down old tom called out be quiet sir and raikes halted with prompt military obedience the sight of the curricle acting satellite to the donkey cart staggered the two footmen are you lords sang out old tom a burst of laughter from the friends of mr raikes in the curricle helped to make the powdered gentlemen aware of a sarcasm and one with no little dignity replied that they were not lords oh then come and hold my donkey great irresolution was displayed at the injunction but having consulted the face of mr raikes one fellow evidently half overcome by what was put upon him with the steps of adam into exile descended to the gravel and laid his hand on the donkeys head hold hard cried old tom whisper in his ear hell know your language may i have the felicity of assisting you to terra firma interposed mr raikes with the bow of deferential familiarity done that once too often returned old tom jumping out there whats the fee theres a crown for you that aint afraid of a live donkey and theres a sixpenny bit for you that areto keep up your courage and when hes dead you shall have his skinto shave by excellent shouted raikes thomas he addressed a footman hand in my card mr john feversham raikes and tell my lady tom cogglesbys come added the owner of that name we will follow tom cogglesby as he chooses to be called lady jocelyn rose on his entering the library and walking up to him encountered him with a kindly full face so i see you at last tom she said without releasing his hand and old tom mounted patches of red in his wrinkled cheeks and blinked and betrayed a singular antiquated bashfulness which ended after a mumble of yes there he was and he hoped her ladyship was well by his seeking refuge in a chair where he sat hard and fixed his attention on the leg of a table well tom do you find much change in me she was woman enough to continue he was obliged to look up cant say i do my lady dont you see the grey hairs tom better than a wig rejoined he was it true that her ladyship had behaved rather ill to old tom in her youth excellent women have been naughty girls and young beauties will have their train it is also very possible that old tom had presumed upon trifles and found it difficult to forgive her his own folly preferable to a wig well i would rather see you with your natural thatch youre bent too you look as if you had kept away from beckley a little too long told you my lady i should come when your daughter was marriageable oho thats it i thought it was the election election be hembeg pardon

in our teeth i hope old tom wriggled in his chair well my lady im not going to make a fool of myself at my time o life neednt be alarmed now youve got the bell rope handy and a husband on the premises lady jocelyn smiled stood up and went to him i like an honest fist she said taking his were not going to be doubtful friends and we wont snap and snarl thats for people whore independent of wigs tom i find for my part that a little grey on the top of any head cools the temper amazingly i used to be rather hot once you could be peppery my lady now im cool tom and so must you be or if you fight it must be in my cause as you did when you thrashed that saucy young carter do you remember if youll sit ye down my lady ill just tell you what im come for said old tom who plainly showed that he did remember and was alarmingly softened by her ladyships retention of the incident lady jocelyn returned to her place youve got a marriageable daughter my lady i suppose we may call her so said lady jocelyn with a composed glance at the ceiling gaged to be married to any young chap you must put the question to her tom ha i dont want to see her at this lady jocelyn looked slightly relieved old tom continued happen to have got a little moneynot so much as many a lords got i dare say such as tis there tis young fellow i know wants a wife and he shall have best part of it will that suit ye my lady lady jocelyn folded her hands certainly ive no objection what it has to do with me i cant perceive ahem went old tom it wont hurt your daughter to be married now will it oh my daughter is the destined bride of your young fellow said lady jocelyn is that how its to be sheold tom cleared his throat she wont marry a lord my lady but shehemif she dont mind thatll have a deuced sight more hard cash than many lords sond give her and a young fellow for a husband sound in wind and limb good bone and muscle speaks grammar and two or three languages and stop cried lady jocelyn i hope this is not a prize young man if he belongs at his age to the unco quid i refuse to take him for a son in law and i think rose will too old tom burst out vehemently hes a damned good young fellow though he isnt a lord well said lady jocelyn ive no doubt youre in earnest tom its curious for this morning rose has come to me and given me the first chapter of a botheration which she declares is to end in the common rash experiment what is your young fellows name who is he what is he wont take my guarantee my lady roseif she marriesmust have a name you know old tom hit his knee then theres a pill for ye to swallow for he aint the son of a lord thats swallowed tom what is he hes the son of a tradesman then my lady and old tom watched her to note the effect he had produced mores the pity was all she remarked and hell have his thousand a year to start with and hes a tailor my lady her ladyship opened her eyes harringtons his name my lady dont know whether you ever heard of it lady jocelyn flung herself back in her chair the queerest thing i ever met said she thousand a year to start with old tom went on and if she marriesi mean if he marries her ill settle a thousand per ann on the first baby boy or gal hum is this gross collusion mr tom lady jocelyn inquired what does that mean have you spoken of this before to any one i havent my lady decided on it this morning hem you got a son too hes fond of a young gal or he ought to be ill settle him when ive settled the daughter harry is strongly attached to a dozen i believe said his mother well tom well think of it i may as well tell you rose has just been here to inform me that this mr harrington has turned her head and that she has given her troth and all that sort of thing i believe such was not to be laid to my charge in my day you were open enough my lady said old tom shes fond of the young fellow shell have a pill to swallow poor young woman old tom visibly chuckled lady jocelyn had a momentary temptation to lead him out but she did not like the subject well enough to play with it apparently rose has swallowed it she said goose shears cabbage and all muttered old tom got a stomachshe knows hes a tailor then the young fellow told her he hasnt been playing the lord to her as far as hes concerned i think he has been tolerably honest tom for a man and a lover and told her he was born and bound a tailor rose certainly heard it from him slapping his knee old tom cried bravo for though one part of his nature was disappointed and the best part of his plot disarranged he liked evans proceeding and felt warm at what seemed to him roses scorn of rank she must be a good gal my lady she couldnt have got it from t other side got it from you not that you no said lady jocelyn apprehending him im afraid i have no republican virtues im afraid i should have rejected the pill dont be angry with me for old tom looked sour again i like birth and position and worldly advantages and notwithstanding roses pledge of the instrument she calls her heart and in spite of your offer i shall i tell you honestly counsel her to have nothing to do with anything less than lords old tom struck in very well are you going to lock her up my lady no nor shall i whip her with rods leave her free to her choice she will have my advice that i shall give her and i shall take care that before she makes a step she shall know exactly what it leads to her father of course will exercise his judgement lady jocelyn said this to uphold the honour of sir franks knowing at the same time perfectly well that he would be wheedled by rose i confess i like this mr harrington but its a great misfortune for him to have had a notorious father a tailor should certainly avoid fame and this young man will have to carry his father on his back hell never throw the great mel off tom cogglesby listened and was really astonished at her ladyships calm reception of his proposal shameful of him shameful he muttered perversely for it would have made him desolate to have had to change his opinion of her ladyship after cherishing it and consoling himself with it five and twenty years fearing the approach of softness he prepared to take his leave nowyour servant my lady i stick to my word mind and if your people here are willing iive got a candidate up for fallfieldill knock him down and you shall sneak in your tory servant my lady old tom rose to go lady jocelyn took his hand cordially though she could not help smiling at the humility of the cobblers son in his manner of speaking of the tory candidate wont you stop with us a few days id rather not i thank ye wont you see rose i wont not till shes married well tom were friends now not aware ive ever done you any harm my lady look me in the face the trial was hard for him though she had been five and twenty years a wife she was still very handsome but he was not going to be melted and when the perverse old fellow obeyed her it was with an aspect of resolute disgust that would have made any other woman indignant lady jocelyn laughed why tom your brother andrews here and makes himself comfortable with us we rode by brooks farm the other day do you remember coppings pondhow we dragged it that night what days we had old tom tugged once or twice at his imprisoned fist while these youthful frolics of his too stupid self and the wild and beautiful miss bonner were being recalled i remember he said savagely and reaching the door hurled out and i remember the bull dogs too servant my lady with which he effected a retreat to avoid a ringing laugh he heard in his ears lady jocelyn had not laughed she had done no more than look and smile kindly on the old boy it was at the bull dogs a fall of water on the borders of the park that tom cogglesby then a hearty young man had been guilty of his folly had mistaken her frank friendliness for a return of his passion and his stubborn vanity still attributed her rejection of his suit to the fact of his descent from a cobbler or as he put it to her infernal worship of rank poor old tom said her ladyship when alone hes rough at the rind but sound at the core she had no idea of the long revenge old tom cherished and had just shaped into a plot to be equal with her for the bull dogs chapter xxix prelude to an engagement money was a strong point with the elburne brood the jocelyns very properly respected blood but being as harry their youngest representative termed them poor as rats they were justified in considering it a marketable stuff and when they married they married for money the hon miss jocelyn had espoused a manufacturer who failed in his contract and deserved his death the diplomatist melville had not stepped aside from the family traditions in his alliance with miss black the daughter of a bold bankrupt educated in affluence and if he touched nothing but and some very pretty ringlets that was not his fault sir franks too mixed his pure stream with gold as yet however the gold had done little more than shine on him and belonging to expectancy it might be thought unsubstantial beckley court was in the hands of mrs bonner who with the highest sense of duty toward her only living child was the last to appreciate lady jocelyns entire absence of demonstrative affection and severely reprobated her daughters philosophic handling of certain serious subjects sir franks no doubt came better off than the others her ladyship brought him twenty thousand pounds and harry had ten in the past tense and rose ten in the future but living as he had done a score of years anticipating the demise of an incurable invalid he though an excellent husband and father could scarcely be taught to imagine that the jocelyn object of his bargain was attained he had the semblance of wealth without the personal glow which absolute possession brings it was his habit to call himself a poor man and it was his dream that rose should marry a rich one harry was hopeless he had been his grandmothers pet up to the years of adolescence he was getting too old for any prospect of a military career he had no turn for diplomacy no taste for any of the walks open to blood and birth and was in headlong disgrace with the fountain of goodness at beckley court where he was still kept in the tacit understanding that should juliana inherit the place he must be at hand to marry her instantly after the fashion of the jocelyns they were an injured family for what they gave was good and the commercial world had not behaved honourably to them now ferdinand laxley was just the match for rose born to a title and fine estate he was evidently fond of her and there had been a gentle hope in the bosom of sir franks that the family fatality would cease and that rose would marry both money and blood from this happy delusion poor sir franks was awakened to hear that his daughter had plighted herself to the son of a tradesman that as the climax to their evil fate she who had some blood and some money of her ownthe only jocelyn who had ever united the twowas desirous of wasting herself on one who had neither the idea was so utterly opposed to the principles sir franks had been trained in that his intellect could not grasp it he listened to his sister mrs shorne he listened to his wife he agreed with all they said though what they said was widely diverse he consented to see and speak to evan and he did so and was much the most distressed for sir franks liked many things in life and hated one thing alonewhich was bother a smooth world was his delight rose knew this and her instruction to evan was you cannot give me upyou will go but you cannot give me up while i am faithful to you tell him that she knew that to impress this fact at once on the mind of sir franks would be a great gain for in his detestation of bother he would soon grow reconciled to things monstrous and hearing the same on both sides the matter would assume an inevitable shape to him mr second fiddle had no difficulty in declaring the eternity of his sentiments but he toned them with a despair rose did not contemplate and added also his readiness to repair in any way possible the evil done he spoke of his birth and position sir franks with a gentlemanly delicacy natural to all lovers of a smooth world begged him to see the main and the insurmountable objection birth was to be desired of course and position and so forth but without money how can two young people marry evans heart melted at this generous way of putting it he said he saw it he had no hope he would go and be forgotten and begged that for any annoyance his visit might have caused sir franks and lady jocelyn they would pardon him sir franks shook him by the hand and the interview ended in a dialogue on the condition of the knees of black lymport and on horseflesh in portugal and spain following evan rose went to her father and gave him a good hours excitement after which the worthy gentleman hurried for consolation to lady jocelyn whom he found reading a book of french memoirs in her usual attitude with her feet stretched out and her head thrown back as in a distant survey of the lively people screening her from a troubled world her ladyship read him a piquant story and sir franks capped it with another from memory whereupon her ladyship held him wrong in one turn of the story and sir franks rose to get the volume to verify and while he was turning over the leaves lady jocelyn told him incidentally of old tom cogglesbys visit and proposal sir franks found the passage and that her ladyship was right which it did not move her countenance to hear ah said he finding it no use to pretend there was no bother in the world heres a pretty pickle rose says she will have that fellow hum replied her ladyship and if she keeps her mind a couple of years it will be a wonder very bad for her this sort of thingtalked about muttered sir franks ferdinand was just the man well yes i suppose its her mistake to think brains an absolute requisite said lady jocelyn opening her book again and scanning down a column sir franks being imitative adopted a similar refuge and the talk between them was varied by quotations and choice bits from the authors they had recourse to both leaned back in their chairs and spoke with their eyes on their books julias going to write to her mother said he very filial and proper said she therell be a horrible hubbub you know emily most probably i shall get the blame cela se conoit young harrington goes the day after to morrow thought it better not to pack him off in a hurry and just before the pic nic no certainly i suppose it would look odd how are we to get rid of the countess eh this bautru is amusing franks but hes nothing to vandy homme incomparable on the whole i find menage rather dull the countess what an accomplished liar that woman is she seems to have stepped out of tallemants gallery concerning the countess i suppose you had better apply to melville where the deuce did this young harrington get his breeding from he comes of a notable sire yes but theres no sign of the snob in him and i exonerate him from the charge of adventuring after rose george uplift tells mei had him in just nowthat the mother is a woman of mark and strong principle she has probably corrected the too luxuriant nature of mel in her offspring that is to say in this one pour les autres je ne dis pas well the young man will go and if rose chooses to become a monument of constancy we can do nothing i shall give my advice but as she has not deceived me and she is a reasonable being i shant interfere putting the case at the worst they will not want money i have no doubt tom cogglesby means what he says and will do it so there we will leave the matter till we hear from elburne house sir franks groaned at the thought how much does he offer to settle on them he asked a thousand a year on the marriage and the same amount to the first child i daresay the end would be that they would get all sir franks nodded and remained with one eye brow pitiably elevated above the level of the other anything but a tailor he exclaimed presently half to himself there is a prejudice against that craft her ladyship acquiesced brangerlet me seeyour favourite frenchman franks wasnt it his fatherno his grandfather mon pauvre et humble grandpre i think was a tailor hum the degrees of the thing i confess dont affect me one trade i imagine to be no worse than another ferdinands allowance is about a thousand said sir franks meditatively and wont be a farthing more till he comes to the title added her ladyship well resumed sir franks its a horrible bother his wife philosophically agreed with him and the subject was dropped lady jocelyn felt with her husband more than she chose to let him know and sir franks could have burst into anathemas against fate and circumstances more than his love of a smooth world permitted he however was subdued by her calmness and she with ten times the weight of brain was manoeuvred by the wonderful dash of general rose jocelyn for her ladyship thinking i shall get the blame of all this rather sided insensibly with the offenders against those who condemned them jointly and seeing that rose had been scrupulously honest and straightforward in a very delicate matter this lady was so constituted that she could not but applaud her daughter in her heart a worldly woman would have acted if she had not thought differently but her ladyship was not a worldly woman evans bearing and character had during his residence at beckley court become so thoroughly accepted as those of a gentleman and one of their own rank that after an allusion to the origin of his breeding not a word more was said by either of them on that topic besides rose had dignified him by her decided conduct by the time poor sir franks had read himself into tranquillity mrs shorne who knew him well and was determined that he should not enter upon his usual negociations with an unpleasantness that is to say to forget it joined them in the library bringing with her sir john loring and hamilton jocelyn her first measure was to compel sir franks to put down his book lady jocelyn subsequently had to do the same well what have you done franks said mrs shorne done answered the poor gentleman what is there to be done ive spoken to young harrington spoken to him he deserves horsewhipping have you not told him to quit the house instantly lady jocelyn came to her husbands aid it wouldnt do i think to kick him out in the first place he hasnt deserved it not deserved it emilythe commonest low vile adventuring tradesman in the second place pursued her ladyship its not adviseable to do anything that will make rose enter into the young womans sublimities its better not to let a lunatic see that you think him stark mad and the same holds with young women afflicted with the love mania the sound of sense even if they cant understand it flatters them so as to keep them within bounds otherwise you drive them into excesses best avoided really emily said mrs shorne you speak almost one would say as an advocate of such unions you must know perfectly well that i entirely condemn them replied her ladyship who had once and once only delivered her opinion of the nuptials of mr and mrs shorne in self defence and to show the total difference between the cases mrs shorne interjected an utterly penniless young adventurer oh no theres money remarked sir franks money is there quoth hamilton respectfully and theres wit added sir john if he has half his sisters talent astonishing woman hamilton chimed in adding with a shrug but egad well we dont want him to resemble his sister said lady jocelyn i acknowledge shes amusing amusing emily mrs shorne never encountered her sister in laws calmness without indignation i could not rest in the house with such a person knowing her what she is a vile adventuress as i firmly believe what does she do all day with your mother depend upon it you will repent her visit in more ways than one a prophecy asked lady jocelyn smiling on the grounds of common sense on the grounds of propriety and consideration of what was due to themselves all agreed to condemn the notion of rose casting herself away on evan lady jocelyn agreed with mrs shorne sir franks with his brother and sir john but as to what they were to do they were divided lady jocelyn said she should not prevent rose from writing to evan if she had the wish to do so folly must come out said her ladyship its a combustible material i wont have her health injured she shall go into the world more she will be presented at court and if its necessary to give her a dose or two to counteract her vanity i dont object this will wear off or si cest veritablement une grande passion eh bien we must take what providence sends us and which we might have prevented if we had condescended to listen to the plainest worldly wisdom added mrs shorne yes said lady jocelyn equably you know you and i julia argue from two distinct points girls may be shut up as you propose i dont think nature intended to have them the obverse of men im sure their mothers never designed that they should run away with footmen riding masters chance curates as they occasionally do and wouldnt if they had points of comparison my opinion is that prospero was just saved by the prince of naples being wrecked on his island from a shocking mis alliance between his daughter and the son of sycorax i see it clearly poetry conceals the extreme probability but from what i know of my sex i should have no hesitation in turning prophet also as to that what could mrs shorne do with a mother who talked in this manner mrs melville when she arrived to take part in the conference which gradually swelled to a family one was equally unable to make lady jocelyn perceive that her plan of bringing up rose was in the present result of it other than unlucky now the two generalsrose jocelyn and the countess de saldarhad brought matters to this pass and from the two tactical extremes the former by openness and dash the latter by subtlety and her own interpretations of the means extended to her by providence i will not be so bold as to state which of the two i think right good and evil work together in this world if the countess had not woven the tangle and gained evan time rose would never have seen his bloodnever have had her spirit hurried out of all shows and forms and habits of thought up to the gates of existence as it were where she took him simply as god created him and her and clave to him again had rose been secret when this turn in her nature came she would have forfeited the strange power she received from it and which endowed her with decision to say what was in her heart and stamp it lastingly there the two generals were quite antagonistic but no two in perfect ignorance of one anothers proceedings ever worked so harmoniously toward the main result the countess was the skilful engineer rose the general of cavalry and it did really seem that with tom cogglesby and his thousands in reserve the victory was about to be gained the male jocelyns an easy race decided that if the worst came to the worst and rose proved a wonder there was money which was something but social prejudice was about to claim its champion hitherto there had been no general on the opposite side love aided by the countess had engaged an inert mass the champion was discovered in the person of the provincial don juan mr harry jocelyn harry had gone on a mysterious business of his own to london he returned with a green box under his arm which five minutes after his arrival was entrusted to conning in company with a genial present for herself of a kind not perhaps so fit for exhibition at least they both thought so for it was given in the shades harry then went to pay his respects to his mother who received him with her customary ironical tolerance his father to whom he was an incarnation of bother likewise nodded to him and gave him a finger duty done harry looked round him for pleasure and observed nothing but glum faces even the face of john raikes was heavy he had been hovering about the duke and miss current for an hour hoping the countess would come and give him a promised introduction the countess stirred not from above and jack drifted from group to group on the lawn and grew conscious that wherever he went he brought silence with him his isolation made him humble and when harry shook his hand and said he remembered fallowfield and the fun there mr raikes thanked him harry made his way to join his friend ferdinand and furnished him with the latest london news not likely to appear in the papers laxley was distant and unamused from the fact too that harry was known to be the countesss slave his presence produced the same effect in the different circles about the grounds as did that of john raikes harry began to yawn and wish very ardently for his sweet lady she however had too fine an instinct to descend an hour before dinner juliana sent him a message that she desired to see him jove i hope that girls not going to be blowing hot again sighed the conqueror he had nothing to fear from juliana the moment they were alone she asked him have you heard of it harry shook his head and shrugged they havent told you rose has engaged herself to mr harrington a tradesman a tailor pooh have you got hold of that story said harry but im sorry for old ferdy he was fond of rosey heres another bother you dont believe me harry harry was mentally debating whether in this new posture of affairs his friend ferdinand would press his claim for certain moneys lent oh i believe you he said harrington has the knack with you women why you made eyes at him it was a toss up between you and rosey once juliana let this accusation pass he is a tradesman he has a shop in lymport i tell you harry and his name on it and he came here on purpose to catch rose and now he has caught her he tells her and his mother is now at one of the village inns waiting to see him go to mr george uplift he knows the family yes the countess has turned your head of course but she has schemed and schemed and told such storiesgod forgive her the girl had to veil her eyes in a spasm of angry weeping oh come juley murmured her killing cousin harry boasted an extraordinary weakness at the sight of feminine tears i say juley you know if you begin crying im done for and it isnt fair he dropped his arm on her waist to console her and generously declared to her that he always had been very fond of her these scenes were not foreign to the youth her fits of crying from which she would burst in a frenzy of contempt at him had made harry say stronger things and the assurances of profound affection uttered in a most languid voice will sting the hearts of women harry still went on with his declarations heating them rapidly so as to bring on himself the usual outburst and check she was longer in coming to it this time and he had a horrid fear that instead of dismissing him fiercely and so annulling his words the strange little person was going to be soft and hold him to them there were her tears however which she could not stop well then juley look i do upon my honour yesthere dont cry any morei do love you harry held his breath in awful suspense juliana quietly disengaged her waist and looking at him said poor harry you need not lie any more to please me such was harrys astonishment that he exclaimed it isnt a lie i say i do love you and for an instant he thought and hoped that he did love her well then harry i dont love you said juliana which revealed to our friend that he had been mistaken in his own emotions nevertheless his vanity was hurt when he saw she was sincere and he listened to her a moody being this may account for his excessive wrath at evan harrington after juliana had given him proofs of the truth of what she said but the countess was harringtons sister the image of the countess swam before him was it possible harry went about asking everybody he met the initiated were discreet those who had the whispers were open a bare truth is not so convincing as one that discretion confirms harry found the detestable news perfectly true stop it by all means if you can said his father yes try a fall with rose said his mother and i must sit down to dinner to day with a confounded fellow the son of a tailor whos had the impudence to make love to my sister cried harry im determined to kick him out of the househalf to what is the modification of your determination due lady jocelyn inquired probably suspecting the sweet and gracious person who divided harrys mind her ladyship treated her children as she did mankind generally from her intellectual eminence harry was compelled to fly from her cruel shafts he found comfort with his aunt shorne and she as much as told harry that he was the head of the house and must take up the matter summarily it was expected of him now was the time for him to show his manhood harry could think of but one way to do that yes and if i doall up with the old lady he said and had to explain that his grandmama bonner would never leave a penny to a fellow who had fought a duel a duel said mrs shorne no there are other ways insist upon his renouncing her and rosetreat her with a high hand as becomes you your mother is incorrigible and as for your father one knows him of old this devolves upon you our family honour is in your hands harry considering harrys reputation the family honour must have got low harry of course was not disposed to think so he discovered a great deal of unused pride within him for which he had hitherto not found an agreeable vent he vowed to his aunt that he would not suffer the disgrace and while still that blandishing olive hued visage swam before his eyes he pledged his word to mrs shorne that he would come to an understanding with harrington that night quietly said she no scandal pray oh never mind how i do it returned harry manfully how am i to do it then he added suddenly remembering his debt to evan mrs shorne instructed him how to do it quietly and without fear of scandal the miserable champion replied that it was very well for her to tell him to say this and that butand she thought him dementedhe must previous to addressing harrington in those terms have money money echoed the lady money yes money he iterated doggedly and she learnt that he had borrowed a sum of harrington and the amount of the sum it was a disastrous plight for mrs shorne was penniless she cited ferdinand laxley as a likely lender oh im deep with him already said harry in apparent dejection how dreadful are these everlasting borrowings of yours exclaimed his aunt unaware of a trifling incongruity in her sentiments you must speak to him withoutpay him by and by we must scrape the money together i will write to your grandfather yes speak to him how can i when i owe him i cant tell a fellow hes a blackguard when i owe him and i cant speak any other way i aint a diplomatist dashed if i know what to do juliana murmured his aunt cant ask her you know mrs shorne combated the one prominent reason for the objection but there were two harry believed that he had exhausted julianas treasury reproaching him further for his wastefulness mrs shorne promised him the money should be got by hook or by crook next day and you will speak to this mr harrington to night harry no allusion to the loan till you return it appeal to his sense of honour the dinner bell assembled the inmates of the house evan was not among them he had gone as the countess said aloud on a diplomatic mission to fallowfield with andrew cogglesby the truth being that he had finally taken andrew into his confidence concerning the letter the annuity and the bond upon which occasion andrew had burst into a laugh and said he could lay his hand on the writer of the letter trust old tom for plots van hell blow you up in a twinkling the cunning old dog he pretends to be hardhes as soft as i am if it wasnt for his crotchets well hand him back the cash and thats ended andeh what a dear girl she is not that im astonished my harry might have married a lordsit at top of any table in the land and youre as good as any man thats my opinion but i say shes a wonderful girl to see it chattering thus andrew drove with the dear boy into fallowfield evan was still in his dream to him the generous love and valiant openness of rose though they were matched in his own bosom seemed scarcely human almost as noble to him were the gentlemanly plainspeaking of sir franks and lady jocelyns kind commonsense but the more he esteemed them the more unbounded and miraculous appeared the prospect of his calling their daughter by the sacred name and kneeling with her at their feet did the dear heavens have that in store for him the horizon edges were dimly lighted harry looked about under his eye lids for evan trying at the same time to compose himself for the martyrdom he had to endure in sitting at table with the presumptuous fellow the countess signalled him to come within the presence as he was crossing the room rose entered and moved to meet him with ah harry back again glad to see you harry gave her a blunt nod to which she was inattentive what whispered the countess after he pressed the tips of her fingers have you brought back the grocer now this was hard to stand harry could forgive her her birth and pass it utterly by if she chose to fall in love with him but to hear the grocer mentioned when he knew of the tailor was a little too much and what harry felt his ingenuous countenance was accustomed to exhibit the countess saw it she turned her head from him to the diplomatist and he had to remain like a sentinel at her feet he did not want to be thanked for the green box still he thought she might have favoured him with one of her much embracing smiles in the evening after wine when he was warm and had almost forgotten the insult to his family and himself the countess snubbed him it was unwise on her part but she had the ghastly thought that facts were oozing out and were already half known she was therefore sensitive tenfold to appearances savage if one failed to keep up her lie to her and was guilty of a shadow of difference of behaviour the pic nic over our general would evacuate beckley court and shake the dust off her shoes and leave the harvest of what she had sown to providence till then respect and the honours of war so the countess snubbed him and he being full of wine fell into the hands of juliana who had witnessed the little scene she has made a fool of others as well as of you said juliana how has she he inquired never mind do you want to make her humble and crouch to you i want to see harrington said harry he will not return to night from fallowfield he has gone there to get mr andrew cogglesbys brother to do something for him you wont have such another chance of humbling them bothboth i told you his mother is at an inn here the countess has sent mr harrington to fallowfield to be out of the way and she has told her mother all sorts of falsehoods how do you know all that quoth harry by jove juley talk about plotters no keeping anything from you ever never mind the mother is here she must be a vulgar woman oh if you could manage harry to get this woman to comeyou could do it so easily while they are at the pie nic tomorrow it would have the best effect on rose she would then understand and the countess i could send the old woman a message cried harry rushing into the scheme inspired by julianas fiery eyes send her a sort of message to say where we all were let her know that her son is here in some way juley resumed and egad what an explosion pursued harry but suppose no one shall know if you leave it to meif you do just as i tell you harry you wont be treated as you were this evening after that if you bring down her pride and harry i hear you want moneyi can give you some youre a perfect trump juley exclaimed her enthusiastic cousin but no i cant take it i must kiss you though he put a kiss upon her cheek once his kisses had left a red waxen stamp she was callous to these compliments now will you do what i advise you to morrow she asked after a slight hesitation during which the olive hued visage flitted faintly in the distances of his brain harry said itll do rose good and make harrington cut yes i declare i will then they parted juliana went to her bed room and flung herself upon the bed hysterically as the tears came thick and fast she jumped up to lock the door for this outrageous habit of crying had made her contemptible in the eyes of lady jocelyn and an object of pity to rose some excellent and noble natures cannot tolerate disease and are mystified by its ebullitions it was very sad to see the slight thin frame grasped by those wan hands to contain the violence of the frenzy that possessed her the pale hapless face rigid above the torment in her bosom she had prayed to be loved like other girls and her readiness to give her heart in return had made her a by word in the house she went to the window and leaned out on the casement looking towards fallowfield over the downs weeping bitterly with a hard shut mouth one brilliant star hung above the ridge and danced on her tears will he forgive me she murmured oh my god i wish we were dead together her weeping ceased and she closed the window and undressed as far away from the mirror as she could get but its force was too much for her and drew her to it some undefined hope had sprung in her suddenly with nervous slow steps she approached the glass and first brushing back the masses of black hair from her brow looked as for some new revelation long and anxiously she perused her features the wide bony forehead the eyes deep set and rounded with the scarlet of recent tears the thin nosesharp as the dead the weak irritable mouth and sunken cheeks she gazed like a spirit disconnected from what she saw presently a sort of forlorn negative was indicated by the motion of her head i can pardon him she said and sighed how could he love such a face chapter xxx the battle of the bull dogs part i at the south western extremity of the park with a view extending over wide meadows and troubled mill waters yellow barn roofs and weather gray old farm walls two grassy mounds threw their slopes to the margin of the stream here the bull dogs held revel the hollow between the slopes was crowned by a bending birch which rose three stemmed from the root and hung a noiseless green shower over the basin of green it shadowed beneath it the interminable growl sounded pleasantly softly shot the sparkle of the twisting water and you might dream things half fulfilled knots of fern were about but the tops of the mounds were firm grass evidently well rolled and with an eye to airy feet olympus one eminence was called parnassus the other olympus a little overlooked parnassus but parnassus was broader and altogether better adapted for the games of the muses round the edges of both there was a well trimmed bush of laurel obscuring only the feet of the dancers from the observing gods for on olympus the elders reclined great efforts had occasionally been made to dispossess and unseat them and their security depended mainly on a hump in the middle of the mound which defied the dance watteau like groups were already couched in the shade there were ladies of all sorts town bred and country bred farmers daughters and daughters of peers for this pic nic as lady jocelyn disgusting the countess would call it was in reality a fte champtre given annually to which the fair offspring of the superior tenants were invited the brothers and fathers coming to fetch them in the evening it struck the eye of the countess de saldar that olympus would be a fitting throne for her and a point whence her shafts might fly without fear of a return like another illustrious general at salamanca she directed a detachment to take possession of the height courtly sir john loring ran up at once and gave the diplomatist an opportunity to thank her flatteringly for gaining them two minutes to themselves sir john waved his handkerchief in triumph welcoming them under an awning where carpets and cushions were spread and whence the countess could eye the field she was dressed ravishingly slightly in a foreign style the bodice being peaked at the waist as was then the portuguese persuasion the neck too was deliciously veiled with fine laceand thoroughly veiled for it was a feature the countess did not care to expose to the vulgar daylight off her gentle shoulders as it were some fringe of cloud blown by the breeze this sweet lady opened her bosom to curled a lovely black lace scarf not carolines if she laughed the tinge of mourning lent her laughter new charms if she sighed the exuberant array of her apparel bade the spectator be of good cheer was she witty men surrendered reason and adored her only when she entered the majestic mood and assumed the languors of greatness and recited musky anecdotes of her intimacy with it only then did mankind as represented at beckley court open an internal eye and reflect that it was wonderful in a tailors daughter and she felt that mankind did so reflect her instincts did not deceive her she knew not how much was known in the depths of her heart she kept low the fear that possibly all might be known and succeeding in this she said to herself that probably nothing was known after all george uplift miss carrington and rose were the three she abhorred partly to be out of their way and to be out of the way of chance shots for she had heard names of people coming that reminded her of dubbinss where in past days there had been on one awful occasion a terrific discovery made the countess selected olympus for her station it was her last day and she determined to be happy doubtless she was making a retreat but have not illustrious generals snatched victory from their pursuers fair then sweet and full of grace the countess moved as the restless shifting of colours to her motions was the constant interchange of her semisorrowful manner and ready archness sir john almost capered to please her and the diplomatist in talking to her forgot his diplomacy and the craft of his tongue it was the last day also of caroline and the duke the countess clung to caroline and the duke more than to evan and rose she could see the first couple walking under an avenue of limes and near them that young man or monkey raikes as if in ambush twice they passed him and twice he doffed his hat and did homage a most singular creature exclaimed the countess it is my constant marvel where my brother discovered such a curiosity do notice him that man raikes said the diplomatist do you know he is our rival harry wanted an excuse for another bottle last night and proposed the member for fallowfield up got this mr raikes and returned thanks yes the countess negligently interjected in a way she had caught from lady jocelyn cogglesbys nominee apparently i know it all said the countess we need have no apprehension he is docile my brother in laws brother you see is most eccentric we can manage him best through this mr raikes for a personal application would be ruin he quite detests our family and indeed all the aristocracy melvilles mouth pursed and he looked very grave sir john remarked he seems like a monkey just turned into a man and doubtful about the tail added the countess the image was tolerably correct but other causes were at the bottom of the air worn by john raikes the countess had obtained an invitation for him with instructions that he should come early and he had followed them so implicitly that the curricle was flinging dust on the hedges between fallowfield and beckley but an hour or two after the chariot of apollo had mounted the heavens and mr raikes presented himself at the breakfast table fortunately for him the countess was there after the repast she introduced him to the duke and he bowed to the duke and the duke bowed to him and now to instance the peculiar justness in the mind of mr raikes he though he worshipped a coronet and would gladly have recalled the feudal times to a corrupt land could not help thinking that his bow had beaten the dukes and was better he would rather not have thought so for it upset his preconceptions and threatened a revolution in his ideas for this reason he followed the duke and tried if possible to correct or at least chasten the impressions he had of possessing a glaring advantage over the nobleman the dukes second notice of him was hardly a nod well mr raikes reflected if this is your duke why egad for figure and style my friend harrington beats him hollow and raikes thought he knew who could conduct a conversation with superior dignity and neatness the torchlight of a delusion was extinguished in him but he did not wander long in that gloomy cavernous darkness of the disenchanted as many of us do and as evan had done when after a week at beckley court he began to examine of what stuff his brilliant father the great mel was composed on the contrary as the light of the duke dwindled raikes gained in lustre in fact he said theres nothing but the title wanting he was by this time on a level with the duke in his elastic mind olympus had been held in possession by the countess about half an hour when lady jocelyn mounted it quite unconscious that she was scaling a fortified point the countess herself fired off the first gun at her it has been so extremely delightful up alone here lady jocelyn to look at everybody below i hope many will not intrude on us none but the dowagers who have breath to get up replied her ladyship panting by the way countess you hardly belong to us yet you dance indeed i do not oh then you are in your right place a dowager is a woman who doesnt dance and her male attendant iswhat is he we will call him a fogy lady jocelyn directed a smile at melville and sir john who both protested that it was an honour to be the countesss fogy rose now joined them with laxley morally dragged in her wake another dowager and fogy cried the countess musically do you not dance my child not till the music strikes up rejoined rose i suppose we shall have to eat first that is the hamlet of the pic nic play i believe said her mother of course you dance dont you countess rose inquired for the sake of amiable conversation the countesss head signified oh no quite out of the question she held up a little bit of her mournful draperies adding besides you dear child know your company and can select i do not and cannot do so i understand we have a most varied assembly rose shut her eyes and then looked at her mother lady jocelyns face was undisturbed but while her eyes were still upon the countess she drew her head gently back imperceptibly if anything she was admiring the lady but rose could be no placid philosophic spectator of what was to her a horrible assumption and hypocrisy for the sake of him she loved she had swallowed a nauseous cup bravely the countess was too much for her she felt sick to think of being allied to this person she had a shuddering desire to run into the ranks of the world and hide her head from multitudinous hootings with a pang of envy she saw her friend jenny walking by the side of william harvey happy untried unoffending full of hope and without any bitter draughts to swallow aunt bel now came tripping up gaily take the alternative douairiere or demoiselle cried lady jocelyn we must have a sharp distinction or olympus will be mobbed entre les deux sil vous plait responded aunt bel rose hurry down and leaven the mass i see ten girls in a bunch its shocking ferdinand pray disperse yourself why is it emily that we are always in excess at pic nics is man dying out from what i can see remarked lady jocelyn harry will be lost to his species unless some one quickly relieves him hes already half eaten up by the conley girls countess isnt it your duty to rescue him the countess bowed and murmured to sir john a dismissal i fear my fascinations lady jocelyn may not compete with those fresh young persons ha ha fresh young persons laughed sir john for the ladies in question were romping boisterously with mr harry the countess inquired for the names and condition of the ladies and was told that they sprang from farmer conley a well to do son of the soil who farmed about a couple of thousand acres between fallowfield and beckley and bore a good reputation at the county bank but i do think observed the countess it must indeed be pernicious for any youth to associate with that class of woman a deterioration of manners rose looked at her mother again she thought those girls would scorn to marry a tradesmans son the feeling grew in rose that the countess lowered and degraded her her mothers calm contemplation of the lady was more distressing than if she had expressed the contempt rose was certain according to her young ideas lady jocelyn must hold now the countess had been considering that she would like to have a word or two with mr harry and kissing her fingers to the occupants of olympus and fixing her fancy on the diverse thoughts of the ladies and gentlemen deduced from a rapturous or critical contemplation of her figure from behind she descended the slope was it going to be a happy day the well imagined opinions of the gentleman on her attire and style made her lean to the affirmative but roses demure behaviour and somethingsomething would come across her hopes she had as she now said to herself stopped for the pic nic mainly to give caroline a last opportunity of binding the duke to visit the cogglesby saloons in london let caroline cleverly contrive this as she might without any compromise and the stay at beckley court would be a great gain yes caroline was still with the duke they were talking earnestly the countess breathed a short appeal to providence that caroline might not prove a fool overnight she had said to caroline do not be so english can one not enjoy friendship with a nobleman without wounding ones conscience or breaking with the world my dear the duke visiting you you cow that infamous strike of yours he will be utterly obsequious i am not telling you to pass the line the contrary but we continentals have our grievous reputation because we dare to meet as intellectual beings and defy the imputation that ladies and gentlemen are no better than animals it sounded very lofty to caroline who accepting its sincerity replied i cannot do things by halves i cannot live a life of deceit a life of miserynot deceit whereupon pitying her poor english nature the countess gave her advice and this advice she now implored her familiars to instruct or compel caroline to follow the countesss garment was plucked at she beheld little dorothy loring glancing up at her with the roguish timidity of her years may i come with you asked the little maid and went off into a prattle i spent that five shillingsi bought a shillings worth of sweet stuff and nine pennorth of twine and a shilling for small wax candles to light in my room when im going to bed because i like plenty of light by the looking glass always and they do make the room so hot my jane declared she almost fainted but i burnt them out then i only had very little left for a horse to mount my doll on and i wasnt going to get a screw so i went to papa and he gave me five shillings and oh do you know rose cant bear me to be with you jealousy i suppose for youre very agreeable and do you know your mama is coming to day ive got a papa and no mama and youve got a mama and no papa isnt it funny but i dont think so much of it as youre grown up oh im quite sure she is coming because i heard harry telling juley she was and juley said it would be so gratifying to you a bribe and a message relieved the countess of dorothys attendance on her what did this mean were people so base as to be guilty of hideous plots in this house her mother coming the countesss blood turned deadly chill had it been her father she would not have feared but her mother was so vilely plain of speech she never opened her mouth save to deliver facts which was to the countess the sign of atrocious vulgarity but her mother had written to say she would wait for evan in fallowfield the countess grasped at straws did dorothy hear that and if harry and juliana spoke of her mother what did that mean that she was hunted and must stand at bay oh papa papa why did you marry a dawley she exclaimed plunging to what was in her idea the root of the evil she had no time for outcries and lamentations it dawned on her that this was to be a day of battle where was harry still in the midst of the conley throng apparently pooh poohing something to judge by the twist of his mouth the countess delicately signed for him to approach her the extreme delicacy of the signal was at least an excuse for harry to perceive nothing it was renewed and harry burst into a fit of laughter at some fun of one of the conley girls the countess passed on and met juliana pacing by herself near the lower gates of the park she wished only to see how juliana behaved the girl looked perfectly trustful as much so as when the countess was pouring in her ears the tales of evans growing but bashful affection for her he will soon be here whispered the countess has he told you he will come by this entrance no replied juliana you do not look well sweet child i was thinking that you did not countess oh indeed yes with reason alas all our visitors have by this time arrived i presume they come all day the countess hastened away from one who when roused could be almost as clever as herself and again stood in meditation near the joyful harry this time she did not signal so discreetly harry could not but see it and the conley girls accused him of cruelty to the beautiful dame which novel idea stung harry with delight and he held out to indulge in it a little longer his back was half turned and as he talked noisily he could not observe the serene and resolute march of the countess toward him the youth gaped when he found his arm taken prisoner by the insertion of a small deliciously gloved and perfumed hand through it i must claim you for a few moments said the countess and took the startled conley girls one and all in her beautiful smile of excuse why do you compromise me thus sir these astounding words were spoken out of the hearing of the conley girls compromise you muttered harry masterly was the skill with which the countess contrived to speak angrily and as an injured woman while she wore an indifferent social countenance i repeat compromise me no mr harry jocelyn you are not the jackanapes you try to make people think you you understand me the countess might accuse him but harry never had the ambition to make people think him that his natural tendency was the reverse and he objected to the application of the word jackanapes to himself and was ready to contest the fact of people having that opinion at all however all he did was to repeat compromise is not open unkindness to me compromising me how asked harry would you dare to do it to a strange lady would you have the impudence to attempt it with any woman here but me no i am innocent it is my consolation i have resisted you but you by this cowardly behaviour place meand my reputation which is moreat your mercy noble behaviour mr harry jocelyn i shall remember my young english gentleman the view was totally new to harry i really had no idea of compromising you he said upon my honour i cant see how i did it now oblige me by walking less in the neighbourhood of those fat faced glaring farm girls the countess spoke under her breath and dont look as if you were being whipped the art of it is evidentyou are but carrying on the gamelisten if you permit yourself to exhibit an unkindness to me you show to any man who is a judge and to every woman that there has been something between us you know my innocenceyes but you must punish me for having resisted you thus long harry swore he never had such an idea and was much too much of a man and a gentleman to behave in that wayand yet it seemed wonderfully clever and here was the countess saying take your reward mr harry jocelyn you have succeeded i am your humble slave i come to you and sue for peace to save my reputation i endanger myself this is generous of you am i such a clever fellow thought the young gentleman deuced lucky with women he knew that still a fellow must be wonderfully miraculously clever to be able to twist and spin about such a woman as this in that way he did not object to conceive that he was the fellow to do it besides here was the countess de saldarworth five hundred of the conley girlsalmost at his feet mollified he said now didnt you begin it evasion was the answer it would be such pleasure to you so see a proud woman weep and if yesterday persecuted as i am with dreadful falsehoods abroad respecting me and mine if yesterday i did seem cold to your great merits is it generous of you to take this revenge harry began to scent the double meaning in her words she gave him no time to grow cool over it she leaned half abandoned on his arm arts feminine and irresistible encompassed him it was a fatal mistake of julianas to enlist harry jocelyn against the countess de saldar he engaged still without any direct allusion to the real business to move heaven and earth to undo all that he had done and the countess implied an engagement to dowhat more than she intended to fulfil ten minutes later she was alone with caroline tie yourself to the duke at the dinner she said in the forcible phrase she could use when necessary dont let them scheme to separate you never mind looksdo it caroline however had her reasons for desiring to maintain appearances the countess dashed at her hesitation there is a plot to humiliate us in the most abominable way the whole family have sworn to make us blush publicly publicly blush they have written to mama to come and speak out now will you attend to me caroline you do not credit such atrocity i know it to be true i never can believe that rose would do such a thing said caroline we can hardly have to endure more than has befallen us already her speech was pensive as of one who had matter of her own to ponder over a swift illumination burst in the countesss mind no have you dear darling carry not that i intend that you should but to day the duke would be such ineffable support to us may i deem you have not been too cruel to day you dear silly english creature duck i used to call you when i was your little louy all is not yet lost but i will save you from the ignominy if i can i will caroline denied nothingconfirmed nothing just as the countess had stated nothing yet they understood one another perfectly women have a subtler language than ours the veil pertains to them morally as bodily and they see clearer through it the countess had no time to lose wrath was in her heart she did not lend all her thoughts to self defence without phrasing a word or absolutely shaping a thought in her head she slanted across the sun to mr raikes who had taken refreshment and in obedience to his instinct notwithstanding his enormous pretensions had commenced a few preliminary antics dear mr raikes she said drawing him aside not before dinner i really cant contain the exuberant flow returned that gentleman my animal spirits always get the better of me he added confidentially suppose you devote your animal spirits to my service for half an hour yours countess from the os frontis to the chine was the exuberant rejoinder the countess made a wry mouth your curricle is in beckley behold said jack two juveniles not half so blest as i do from the seat regard the festive scene oer yon park palings they are there even franko and fred im afraid i promised to get them in at a later period of the day which sadly sore my conscience doth disturb but what is to be done about the curricle my countess mr raikes said the countess smiling on him fixedly you are amusing but in addressing me you must be precise and above all things accurate i am not your countess he bowed profoundly oh that i might say my queen the countess replied a conviction of your lunacy would prevent my taking offence though i might wish you enclosed and guarded without any further exclamations raikes acknowledged a superior and now attend to me said the countess listen you go yourself or send your friends instantly to fallowfield bring with you that girl and her child stop there is such a person tell her she is to be spoken to about the prospects of the poor infant i leave that to your inventive genius evan wishes her here bring her and should you see the mad captain who behaves so oddly favour him with a ride he says he dreams his wife is here and he will not reveal his name suppose it should be my own beloved husband i am quite anxious the countess saw him go up to the palings and hold a communication with his friends franko and fred one took the whip and after mutual flourishes drove away now mused the countess if captain evremonde should come it would break up the pic nic alas the countess had surrendered her humble hopes of a days pleasure but if her mother came as well what a diversion that would be if her mother came before the captain his arrival would cover the retreat if the captain preceded her she would not be noticed suppose her mother refrained from coming in that case it was a pity but the jocelyns had brought it on themselves this mapping out of consequences followed the countesss deeds and did not inspire them her passions sharpened her instincts which produced her actions the reflections ensued as in nature the consequences were all seen subsequently observe the difference between your male and female generals on reflection too the countess praised herself for having done all that could be done she might have written to her mother but her absence would have been remarked her messenger might have been overhauled and lastly mrs melgorgon of a mother the countess cried out for mrs mel was like a fate to her she could remember only two occasions in her whole life when she had been able to manage her mother and then by lying in such a way as to distress her conscience severely if mama has conceived this idea of coming nothing will impede her my prayers will infuriate her said the countess and she was sure that she had acted both rightly and with wisdom she put on her armour of smiles she plunged into the thick of the enemy since they would not allow her to taste human happinessshe had asked but for the pic nic a small truce since they denied her that rather than let them triumph by seeing her wretched she took into her bosom the joy of demons she lured mr george uplift away from miss carrington and spoke to him strange hints of matrimonial disappointments looking from time to time at that apprehensive lady doating on her terrors and mr george seconded her by his clouded face for he was ashamed not to show that he did not know louisa harrington in the countess de saldar and had not the courage to declare that he did the countess spoke familiarly but without any hint of an ancient acquaintance between them what a post her husbands got thought mr george not envying the count he was wrong she was an admirable ally all over the field the countess went watching for her mother praying that if she did come providence might prevent her from coming while they were at dinner how clearly mrs shorne and mrs melville saw her vulgarity now by the new light of knowledge how certain they were that they had seen her ungentle training in a dozen little instances she is not well bred cela se voit said lady jocelyn bred its the stage how could such a person be bred said mrs shorne accept in the countess the heroine who is combating class prejudices and surely she is pre eminently noteworthy true she fights only for her family and is virtually the champion of the opposing institution misplaced that does not matter the fates may have done it purposely by conquering she establishes a principle a duke adores her sister the daughter of the house her brother and for herself she has many protestations in honour of her charms nor are they empty ones she can confound mrs melville if she pleases to by exposing an adorer to lose a friend issuing out of tailordom she a countess has done all this and it were enough to make her glow did not little evils and angers and spites and alarms so frightfully beset her the sun of the pic nic system is dinner hence philosophers may deduce that the pic nic is a british invention there is no doubt that we do not shine at the pic nic until we reflect the face of dinner to this then all who were not lovers began seriously to look forward and the advance of an excellent county band specially hired to play during the entertainment gave many of the guests quite a new taste for sweet music and indeed we all enjoy a thing infinitely more when we see its meaning about this time evan entered the lower park gates with andrew the first object he encountered was john raikes in a state of great depression he explained his case just look at my frill now upon my honour you know im good tempered i pass their bucolic habits but this is beyond bearing i was near the palings there and a fellow calls out hi will you help the lady over holloa thinks i an adventure however i advised him to take her round to the gates the beast burst out laughing now then says he and i heard a scrambling at the pales and up came the head of a dog oh the dog first says i catch by the ears says he i did so pull says he gad pull indeed the beast gave a spring and came slap on my chest with his dirty wet muzzle on my neck i felt instantly it was the death of my frill but gallant as you know me i still asked for the lady if you will please or as it meet your favour to extend your hand to me i confess i did think it rather odd the idea of a lady coming in that way over the palings but my curst love of adventure always blinds me it always misleads my better sense harrington well instead of a lady i see a fellowhe may have been a lineal descendant of cedric the saxon wheres the lady says i lady says he and stares and then laughs lady why he jumps over and points at his beast of a dog dont you know a bitch when you see one i was in the most ferocious rage if he hadnt been a big burly bully down hed have gone why didnt you say what it was i roared why says he the word isnt considered polite i gave him a cut there i said i rejoice to be positively assured that you uphold the laws and forms of civilization sir my belief is he didnt feel it the thrust sinned in its shrewdness remarked evan ending a laugh hem went mr raikes more contentedly after all what are appearances to the man of wit and intellect dress and women will approve you but i assure you they much prefer the man of wit in his slouched hat and stockings down i was introduced to the duke this morning it is a curious thing that the seduction of a duchess has always been one of my dreams at this andrew cogglesby fell into a fit of laughter your servant said mr raikes turning to him and then he muttered extraordinary likeness good heavens powers from a state of depression mr raikeschanged into one of bewilderment evan paid no attention to him and answered none of his hasty undertoned questions just then as they were on the skirts of the company the band struck up a lively tune and quite unconsciously the legs of raikes affected it may be by supernatural reminiscences loosely hornpiped it was but a moment he remembered himself the next but in that fatal moment eyes were on him he never recovered his dignity in beckley court he was fatally mercurial what is the joke against this poor fellow asked evan of andrew never mind van youll roar old tom again well see by and by after the champagne hethis young raikes ha habut i cant tell you and andrew went away to drummond to whom he was more communicative then he went to melville and one or two others and the eyes of many became concentrated on raikes and it was observed as a singular sign that he was constantly facing about and flushing the fiercest red once he made an effort to get hold of evans arm and drag him away as one who had an urgent confession to be delivered of but evan was talking to lady jocelyn and other ladies and quietly disengaged his arm without even turning to notice the face of his friend then the dinner was announced and men saw the dinner the countess went to shake her brothers hand and with a very gratulatory visage said through her half shut teeth if mama appears rise up and go away with her before she has time to speak a word an instant after evan found himself seated between mrs evremonde and one of the conley girls the dinner had commenced the first half of the battle of the bull dogs was as peaceful as any ordinary pic nic and promised to the general company as calm a conclusion chapter xxxi the battle of the bull dogs part ii if it be a distinct point of wisdom to hug the hour that is then does dinner amount to a highly intellectual invitation to man for it furnishes the occasion and britons are the wisest of their race for more than all others they take advantage of it in this nature is undoubtedly our guide seeing that he who while feasting his body allows to his soul a thought for the morrow is in his digestion curst and becomes a house of evil humours now though the epicure may complain of the cold meats a dazzling table a buzzing company blue sky and a band of music are incentives to the forgetfulness of troubles past and imminent and produce a concentration of the faculties they may not exactly prove that peace is established between yourself and those who object to your carving of the world but they testify to an armistice aided by these observations you will understand how it was that the countess de saldar afflicted and menaced was inspired on taking her seat to give so graceful and stately a sweep to her dress that she was enabled to conceive woman and man alike to be secretly overcome by it you will not refuse to credit the fact that mr raikes threw care to the dogs heavy as was that mysterious lump suddenly precipitated on his bosom and you will think it not impossible that even the springers of the mine about to explode should lose their subterranean countenances a generous abandonment to one idea prevailed as for evan the first glass of champagne rushed into reckless nuptials with the music in his head bringing rose warm almost as life on his heart sublime are the visions of lovers he knew he must leave her on the morrow he feared he might never behold her again and yet he tasted bliss for it seemed within the contemplation of the gods that he should dance with his darling before darkhaply waltz with her oh heaven he shuts his eyes blinded the band wheels off meltingly in a tune all cadences and twirls and risings and sinkings and passionate outbursts trippingly consoled ah how sweet to waltz through life with the right partner and what a singular thing it is to look back on the day when we thought something like it never mind there may be spheres where it is so manageddoubtless the planets have their hanwell and bedlam i confess that the hand here writing is not insensible to the effects of that first glass of champagne the poetry of our countesss achievements waxes rich in manifold colours i see her by the light of her own pleas to providence i doubt almost if the hand be mine which dared to make a hero play second fiddle and to his beloved i have placed a bushel over his light certainly poor boy it was enough that he should have tailordom on his shoulders i ought to have allowed him to conquer nature and so come out of his eclipse this shall be said of him that he can play second fiddle without looking foolish which for my part i call a greater triumph than if he were performing the heroics we are more accustomed to he has steady eyes can gaze at the right level into the eyes of others and commands a tongue which is neither struck dumb nor set in a flutter by any startling question the best instances to be given that he does not lack merit are that the jocelyns whom he has offended by his birth cannot change their treatment of him and that the hostile women whatever they may say do not think rose utterly insane at any rate rose is satisfied and her self love makes her a keen critic the moment evan appeared the sickness produced in her by the countess passed and she was ready to brave her situation with no mock humility she permitted mrs shorne to place her in a seat where glances could not be interchanged she was quite composed calmly prepared for conversation with any one indeed her behaviour since the hour of general explanation had been so perfectly well contained that mrs melville said to lady jocelyn i am only thinking of the damage to her it will pass overthis fancy you can see she is not serious it is mere spirit of opposition she eats and drinks just like other girls you can see that the fancy has not taken such very strong hold of her i cant agree with you replied her ladyship i would rather have her sit and sigh by the hour and loathe roast beef that would look nearer a cure she has the notions of a silly country girl said mrs shorne exactly lady jocelyn replied a season in london will give her balance so the guests were tolerably happy or at least with scarce an exception open to the influences of champagne and music perhaps juliana was the wretchedest creature present she was about to smite on both cheeks him she loved as well as the woman she despised and had been foiled by still she had the consolation that rose seeing the vulgar mother might turn from evan a poor distant hope meagre and shapeless like herself her most anxious thoughts concerned the means of getting money to lockup harrys tongue she could bear to meet the countesss wrath but not evans offended look hark to that countess why do you denominate this a pic nic lady jocelyn it is in verity a fte i suppose we ought to lie down la grecque to come within the term was the reply on the whole i prefer plain english for such matters but this is assuredly too sumptuous for a pic nic lady jocelyn from what i can remember pic nic implies contribution from all the guests it is true i left england a child mr george uplift could not withhold a sharp grimace the countess had throttled the inward monitor that tells us when we are lying so grievously had she practised the habit in the service of her family yes said mrs melville i have heard of that fashion and very stupid it is extremely vulgar murmured miss carrington possibly lady jocelyn observed but good fun i have been to pic nics in my day i invariably took cold pie and claret i clashed with half a dozen but all the harm we did was to upset the dictum that there can be too much of a good thing i know for certain that the bottles were left empty and this woman thought the countess this woman with a soul so essentially vulgar claims rank above me the reflection generated contempt of english society in the first place and then a passionate desire for self assertion she was startled by a direct attack which aroused her momentarily lulled energies a lady quite a stranger a dry simpering lady caught the countesss benevolent passing gaze and leaning forward said i hope her ladyship bears her affliction as well as can be expected in military parlance the countess was taken in flank another would have askedwhat ladyship to whom do you allude may i beg to inquire the countess knew better rapid as light it shot through her that the relict of sir abraham was meant and this she divined because she was aware that devilish malignity was watching to trip her a little conversation happening to buzz at the instant the countess merely turned her chin to an angle agitated her brows very gently and crowned the performance with a mournful smile all that a woman must feel at the demise of so precious a thing as a husband was therein eloquently expressed and at the same time if explanations ensued there were numerous ladyships in the world whom the countess did not mind afflicting should she be hard pressed i knew him so well resumed the horrid woman addressing anybody it was so sad so unexpected but he was so subject to affection of the throat and i was so sorry i could not get down to him in time i had not seen him since his marriage when i was a girland to meet one of his childrenbut my dear in quinsey i have heard that there is nothing on earth like a good hearty laugh mr raikes hearing this sucked down the flavour of a glass of champagne and with a look of fierce jollity interposed as if specially charged by providence to make plain to the persecuted countess his mission and business there then our vocation is at last revealed to us quinsey doctor i remember when a boy wandering over the paternal mansion and envying the life of a tinker which my mother did not think a good omen in me but the traps of a quinsey doctor are even lighter say twenty good jokes and two or three of a practical kind a man most enviable it appears he remarked aloud to one of the conley girls that quinsey is needed before a joke is properly appreciated i like fun said she but had not apparently discovered it what did that odious woman mean by perpetually talking about sir abraham the countess intercepted a glance between her and the hated juliana she felt it was a malignant conspiracy still the vacuous vulgar air of the woman told her that most probably she was but an instrument not a confederate and was only trying to push herself into acquaintance with the great a proceeding scorned and abominated by the countess who longed to punish her for her insolent presumption the bitterness of her situation stung her tenfold when she considered that she dared not meantime the champagne became as regular in its flow as the bull dogs and the monotonous bass of these latter sounded through the music like life behind the murmur of pleasure if you will the countess had a not unfeminine weakness for champagne and old mr bonners cellar was well and choicely stocked but was this enjoyment to the countessthis dreary station in the background may i emerge she as much as implored providence the petition was infinitely tender she thought she might or it may be that nature was strong and she could not restrain herself taking wine with sir john she said this bowing do you know how amusing it is deemed by us portuguese why not embrace as the dear queen used to say to me i am decidedly of her majestys opinion observed sir john with emphasis and the countess drew back into a mingled laugh and blush her fiendish persecutor gave two or three nods and you know the queen she said she had to repeat the remark whereupon the countess murmured intimately ah we have lost a staunch old tory in sir abraham said the lady performing lamentation what did it mean could design lodge in that empty looking head with its crisp curls button nose and diminishing simper was this pic nic to be made as terrible to the countess by her putative father as the dinner had been by the great mel the deep hard level look of juliana met the countesss smile from time to time and like flimsy light horse before a solid array of infantry the countess fell back only to be worried afresh by her perfectly unwitting tormentor his last dayswithout pain oh i hope so came after a lapse of general talk arent we getting a little funereal mrs perkins lady jocelyn asked and then rallied her neighbours miss carrington looked at her vexedly for the fiendish perkins was checked and the countess in alarm about to commit herself was a pleasant sight to miss carrington the worst of these indiscriminate meetings is that there is no conversation whispered the countess thanking providence for the relief just then she saw juliana bend her brows at another person this was george uplift who shook his head and indicated a shrewd eyed thin middle aged man of a lawyer like cast and then juliana nodded and george uplift touched his arm and glanced hurriedly behind for champagne the countesss eyes dwelt on the timid young squire most affectionately you never saw a fortress more unprepared for dread assault hem was heard terrific but the proper pause had evidently not yet come and now to prevent it the countess strained her energies and tasked her genius intensely have you an idea of the difficulty of keeping up the ball among a host of ill assorted stupid country people who have no open topics and can talk of nothing continuously but scandal of their neighbours and who moreover feel they are not up to the people they are mixing with darting upon seymour jocelyn the countess asked touchingly for news of the partridges it was like the unlocking of a machine seymour was not blythe in his reply but he was loud and forcible and when he came to the statisticsoh then you would have admired the countessfor comparisons ensued braces were enumerated numbers given were contested and the shooting of this one jeered at and anothers sure mark respectfully admitted and how lay the coveys and what about the damage done by last winters floods and was there good hope of the pheasants outside this latter the countess hovered twice the awful hem was heard she fought on she kept them at it if it flagged she wished to know this or that and finally thought that really she should like herself to try one shot the women had previously been left behind this brought in the women lady jocelyn proposed a female expedition for the morrow i believe i used to be something of a shot formerly she said you peppered old tom once my lady remarked andrew and her ladyship laughed and that foolish andrew told the story and the countess to revive her subject had to say may i be enrolled to shoot though she detested and shrank from fire arms here are two said the hearty presiding dame ladies apply immediately to have your names put down the possibility of an expedition of ladies now struck seymour vividly and said he ill be secretary and began applying to the ladies for permission to put down their names many declined with brevity muttering either aloud or to themselves unwomanly varied by unladylike some confessed cowardice some a horror of the noise close to their ears and there was the plea of nerves but the names of half a dozen ladies were collected and then followed much laughter and musical hubbub and delicate banter so the ladies and gentlemen fell one and all into the partridge pit dug for them by the countess and that horrible hem equal in force and terror to the roar of artillery preceding the charge of ten thousand dragoons was silencedthe pit appeared impassable did the countess crow over her advantage mark her the ladys face is entirely given up to partridges english sports are so much envied abroad she says but what she dreads is a reflection for that leads off from the point a portion of her mind she keeps to combat them in lady jocelyn and others who have the tendency the rest she divides between internal prayers for succour and casting about for another popular subject to follow partridges now mere talent as critics say when they are lighting candles round a genius mere talent would have hit upon pheasants as the natural sequitur and then diverged to sportsa great theme for it ensures a chorus of sneers at foreigners and so on probably to a discussion of birds and beasts best adapted to enrapture the palate of man stories may succeed but they are doubtful and not to be trusted coming after cookery after an exciting subject which has made the general tongue to wag and just enough heated the brain to cause it to cry out for spiced foodthen start your story taking care that it be mild for one too marvellous stops the tide the sense of climax being strongly implanted in all bosoms so the countess told an anecdoteone of mels mr george uplift was quite familiar with it and knew of one passage that would have abashed him to relate before ladies the sylph like ease with which the countess floated over this foul abysm was miraculous mr george screwed his eye lids queerly and closed his jaws with a report completely beaten the anecdote was of the character of an apologue and pertained to game this was as it happened a misfortune for mr raikes had felt himself left behind by the subject and the stuff that was in this young man being naturally ebullient he lay by to trip it and take a lead his remarks brought on him a shrewd cut from the countess which made matters worse for a pun may also breed puns as doth an anecdote the countesss stroke was so neat and perfect that it was something for the gentlemen to think over and to punish her for giving way to her cleverness and to petty vexation hem sounded once more and then may i ask you if the present baronet is in england now lady jocelyn perceived that some attack was directed against her guest she allowed the countess to answer the eldest was drowned in the lisbon waters and then said but who is it that persists in serving up the funeral baked meats to us mrs shorne spoke for her neighbour mr farnleys cousin was the steward of sir abraham harringtons estates the countess held up her head boldly there is a courageous exaltation of the nerves known to heroes and great generals in action when they feel sure that resources within themselves will spring up to the emergency and that over simple mortals success is positive i had a great respect for sir abraham mr farnley explained very great i heard that this lady bowing to the countess was his daughter lady jocelyns face wore an angry look and mrs shorne gave her the shade of a shrug and an expression implying i didnt evan was talking to miss jenny graine at the moment rather earnestly with a rapid glance at him to see that his ears were closed the countess breathed not the elder branchcadet the sort of noisy silence produced by half a dozen people respirating deeply and moving in their seats was heard the countess watched mr farnleys mystified look and whispered to sir john est ce quil comprenne le franais lui it was the final feather like touch to her triumph she saw safety and a clear escape and much joyful gain and the pleasure of relating her sufferings in days to come this vista was before her when harsh as an execution bell telling her that she had vanquished man but that providence opposed her mrs melchisedec harrington was announced to lady jocelyn perfect stillness reigned immediately as if the pic nic had heard its doom oh i will go to her said her ladyship whose first thought was to spare the family andrew come and give me your arm but when she rose mrs mel was no more than the length of an arm from her elbow in the midst of the horrible anguish she was enduring the countess could not help criticizing her mothers curtsey to lady jocelyn fine but a shade too humble still it was fine all might not yet be lost mama she softly exclaimed and thanked heaven that she had not denied her parent mrs mel did not notice her or any of her children there was in her bosom a terrible determination to cast a devil out of the one she best loved for this purpose heedless of all pain to be given or of impropriety she had come to speak publicly and disgrace and humiliate that she might save him from the devils that had ruined his father my lady said the terrible woman thanking her in reply to an invitation that she should be seated i have come for my son i hear he has been playing the lord in your house my lady i humbly thank your ladyship for your kindness to him but he is nothing more than a tailors son and is bound a tailor himself that his father may be called an honest man i am come to take him away mrs mel seemed to speak without much effort though the pale flush of her cheeks showed that she felt what she was doing juliana was pale as death watching rose intensely bright with the gem like light of her gallant spirit roses eyes fixed on evan he met them the words of ruth passed through his heart but the countess who had given rose to evan and the duke to caroline where was her supporter the duke was entertaining caroline with no less dexterity and roses eyes said to evan feel no shame that i do not feel but the countess stood alone it is ever thus with genius to quote the numerous illustrious authors who have written of it what mattered it now that in the dead hush lady jocelyn should assure her mother that she had been misinformed and that mrs mel was presently quieted and made to sit with others before the fruits and wines all eyes were hatefulthe very thought of providence confused her brain almost reduced to imbecility the countess imagined as a reality that sir abraham had borne with her till her public announcement of relationship and that then the outraged ghost would no longer be restrained and had struck this blow the crushed pic nic tried to get a little air and made attempts at conversation mrs mel sat upon the company with the weight of all tailordom and now a messenger came for harry everybody was so zealously employed in the struggle to appear comfortable under mrs mel that his departure was hardly observed the general feeling for evan and his sisters by their superiors in rank was one of kindly pity laxley however did not behave well he put up his glass and scrutinized mrs mel and then examined evan and rose thought that in his interchange of glances with any one there was a lurking revival of the scene gone by she signalled with her eyebrows for drummond to correct him but drummond had another occupation andrew made the diversion he whispered to his neighbour and the whisper went round and the laugh and mr raikes grew extremely uneasy in his seat and betrayed an extraordinary alarm but he also was soon relieved a messenger had come from harry to mrs evremonde bearing a slip of paper this the lady glanced at and handed it to drummond a straggling pencil had traced these words just running by sw gatessaw the captain coming incouldnt stop to stop himtremendous hurryimportant harry j drummond sent the paper to lady jocelyn after her perusal of it a scout was despatched to the summit of olympus and his report proclaimed the advance in the direction of the bull dogs of a smart little figure of a man in white hat and white trousers who kept flicking his legs with a cane mrs evremonde rose and conferred with her ladyship an instant and then drummond took her arm quietly and passed round olympus to the east and lady jocelyn broke up the sitting juliana saw rose go up to evan and make him introduce her to his mother she turned lividly white and went to a corner of the park by herself and cried bitterly lady jocelyn sir franks and sir john remained by the tables but before the guests were out of ear shot the individual signalled from olympus presented himself there are times when one cant see what else to do but to lie said her ladyship to sir franks and when we do lie the only way is to lie intrepidly turning from her perplexed husband she exclaimed ah lawson captain evremonde lifted his hat declining an intimacy where is my wife madam have you just come from the arctic regions i have come for my wife madam his unsettled grey eyes wandered restlessly on lady jocelyns face the countess standing near the duke felt some pity for the wife of that cropped headed tight skinned lunatic at large but deeper was the countesss pity for lady jocelyn in thinking of the account she would have to render on the day of judgement when she heard her ladyship reply evelyn is not here captain evremonde bowed profoundly trailing his broad white hat along the sward do me the favour to read this madam he said and handed a letter to her lady jocelyn raised her brows as she gathered the contents of the letter ferdinands handwriting she exclaimed i accuse no one madami make no accusation i have every respect for you madamyou have my esteem i am sorry to intrude madam an intrusion is regretted my wife runs away from her bed madam and i have the law madam the law is with the husband no force he lashed his cane sharply against his white legs the law madam no brute force his cane made a furious whirl cracking again on his legs as he reiterated the law does the law advise you to strike at a tangent all over the country in search for her inquired lady jocelyn captain evremonde became ten times more voluble and excited mrs mel was heard by the countess to say her ladyship does not know how to treat madmen nor did sir franks and sir john they began expostulating with him a madman gets madder when you talk reason to him said mrs mel and now the countess stepped forward to lady jocelyn and hoped she would not be thought impertinent in offering her opinion as to how this frantic person should be treated the case indeed looked urgent many gentlemen considered themselves bound to approach and be ready in case of need presently the countess passed between sir franks and sir john and with her hand put up as if she feared the furious cane said you will not strike me strike a lady madam the cane and hat were simultaneously lowered lady jocelyn permits me to fetch for you a gentleman of the law or will you accompany me to him in a moment captain evremondes manners were subdued and civilized and in perfectly sane speech he thanked the countess and offered her his arm the countess smilingly waved back sir john who motioned to attend on her and away she went with the captain with all the glow of a woman who feels that she is heaping coals of fire on the heads of her enemies was she not admired now upon my honour said lady jocelyn they are a remarkable family meaning the harringtons what farther she thought she did not say but she was a woman who looked to natural gifts more than the gifts of accidents and evans chance stood high with her then so the battle of the bull dogs was fought and cruelly as the countess had been assailed and wounded she gained a victory yea though demogorgon aided by the vindictive ghost of sir abraham took tangible shape in the ranks opposed to her true lady jocelyn forgetting her own recent intrepidity condemned her as a liar but the fruits of the countesss victory were plentiful drummond forth fearful perhaps of exciting unjust suspicions in the mind of captain evremonde disappeared altogether harry was in a mess which threw him almost upon evans mercy as will be related and lastly ferdinand laxley that insufferable young aristocrat was thus spoken to by lady jocelyn this letter addressed to lawson telling him that his wife is here is in your handwriting ferdinand i dont say you wrote iti dont think you could have written it but to tell you the truth i have an unpleasant impression about it and i think we had better shake hands and not see each other for some time laxley after one denial of his guilt disdained to repeat it he met her ladyships hand haughtily and bowing to sir franks turned on his heel so then in glorious complete victory the battle of the bull dogs ended of the close of the pic nic more remains to be told for the present i pause in observance of those rules which demand that after an exhibition of consummate deeds time be given to the spectator to digest what has passed before him chapter xxxii in which evans light begins to twinkle again the dowagers were now firmly planted on olympus along the grass lay the warm strong colours of the evening sun reddening the pine stems and yellowing the idle aspen leaves for a moment it had hung in doubt whether the pic nic could survive the two rude shocks it had received happily the youthful element was large and when the band refreshed by chicken and sherry threw off half a dozen bars of one of those irresistible waltzes that first catch the ear and then curl round the heart till on a sudden they invade and will have the legs a rush up parnassus was seen and there were shouts and laughter and commotion as over other great fields of battle the corn will wave gaily and mark the reestablishment of natures reign how fair the sight approach the twirling couples they talk as they whirl fancy the run away tailor is the males remark and he expects to be admired for it and is that make up countesshis sister you knowdidnt you see her she turned green says creations second effort almost occupying the place of a rib isnt there a run away wife too now you mustnt be naughty they laugh and flatter one another the power to give and take flattery to any amount is the rare treasure of youth undoubtedly they are a poetical picture but some poetical pictures talk dreary prose so we will retire now while the dancers carried on their business and distance lent them enchantment rose stood by juliana near an alder which hid them from the rest i dont accuse you she was saying but who could have done this but you ah juley you will never get what you want if you plot for it i thought once you cared for evan if he had loved you would i not have done all that i could for you both i pardon you with all my heart keep your pardon was the angry answer i have done more for you rose he is an adventurer and i have tried to open your eyes and make you respect your family you may accuse me of what you like i have my conscience and the friendship of the countess added rose julianas figure shook as if she had been stung go and be happydont stay here and taunt me she said with a ghastly look i suppose he can lie like his sister and has told you all sorts of tales not a wordnot a word cried rose do you think my lover could tell a lie the superb assumption of the girl and the true portrait of evans character which it flashed upon juliana were to the latter such intense pain that she turned like one on the rack exclaiming you think so much of him you are so proud of him then yes i love him too ugly beastly as i am to look at oh i know what you think i loved him from the first and i knew all about him and spared him pain i did not wait for him to fall from a horse i watched every chance of his being exposed i let them imagine he cared for me drummond would have told what he knew long beforeonly he knew there would not be much harm in a tradesmans son marrying me and i have played into your hands and now you taunt me rose remembered her fretful unkindness to evan on the subject of his birth when her feelings toward him were less warm dwelling on that alone she put her arms round julianas stiffening figure and said i dare say i am much more selfish than you forgive me dear staring at her juliana replied now you are acting no said rose with a little effort to fondle her i only feel that i love you better for loving him generous as her words sounded and were juliana intuitively struck to the root of them which was comfortless for how calm in its fortune how strong in its love must roses heart be when she could speak in this unwonted way go and leave me pray she said rose kissed her burning cheek i will do as you wish dear try and know me better and be sister juley as you used to be i know i am thoughtless and horribly vain and disagreeable sometimes do forgive me i will love you truly half melting juliana pressed her hand we are friends said rose good bye and her countenance lighted and she moved away so changed by her happiness juliana was jealous of a love strong as she deemed her own to overcome obstacles she called to her rose rose you will not take advantage of what i have told you and repeat it to any one instantly rose turned with a glance of full contempt over her shoulder to whom she asked to any one to him he would not love me long if i did juliana burst into fresh tears but rose walked into the sunbeams and the circle of the music mounting olympus she inquired whether ferdinand was within hail as they were pledged to dance the first dance together a few hints were given and then rose learnt that ferdinand had been dismissed and where is he she cried with her accustomed impetuosity mamaof course you did not accuse himbut mama could you possibly let him go with the suspicion that you thought him guilty of writing an anonymous letter not at all lady jocelyn replied only the handwriting was so extremely like and he was the only person who knew the address and the circumstances and who could have a motivethough i dont quite see what it isi thought it as well to part for a time but thats sophistry said rose you accuse or you exonerate nobody can be half guilty if you do not hold him innocent you are unjust lady jocelyn rejoined yes its singular what a stock of axioms young people have handy for their occasions rose loudly announced that she would right this matter i cant think where rose gets her passion for hot water said her mother as rose ran down the ledge two or three young gentlemen tried to engage her for a dance she gave them plenty of promises and hurried on till she met evan and almost out of breath told him the shameful injustice that had been done to her friend mama is such an epicurean i really think she is worse than papa this disgraceful letter looks like ferdinands writing and she tells him so and evan will you believe that instead of being certain its impossible any gentleman could do such a thing she tells ferdinand she shall feel more comfortable if she doesnt see him for some time poor ferdinand he has had so much to bear too sure of his darling to be envious now of any man she pitied evan said i would forfeit my hand on his innocence and so would i echoed rose come to him with me dear or no she added with a little womanly discretion perhaps it would not be so wellyoure not very much cast down by what happened at dinner my darling i think of you of me dear concealment is never of any service what there is to be known people may as well know at once theyll gossip for a month and then forget it your mother is dreadfully outspoken certainly but she has better manners than many ladiesi mean people in a position you understand me but suppose dear this had happened and i had said nothing to mama and then we had to confess ah youll find im wiser than you imagine mr evan havent i submitted to somebodys lead yes but with a sort of under protest i saw it by the mouth not quite natural you have been moody ever sincejust a little i suppose its our manly pride but im losing time will you promise me not to brood over that occurrence think of me think everything of me i am yours and dearest if i love you need you care what anybody else thinks we will soon change their opinion i care so little said evan somewhat untruthfully that till you return i shall go and sit with my mother oh she has gone she made her dear old antiquated curtsey to mama and the company if my son has not been guilty of deception i will leave him to your good pleasure my lady thats what she said mama likes her i know but i wish she didnt mouth her words so precisely it reminds me of the countess rose checked herself from saying good bye thank heaven the worst has happened do you know what i should do if i were you and felt at all distressed i should keep repeating rose looked archly and deeply up under his eyelids i am the son of a tradesman and rose loves me over and over and then if you feel ashamed what is it of she nodded adieu laughing at her own idea of her great worth an idea very firmly fixed in her fair bosom notwithstanding mrs melville said of her i used to think she had pride lady jocelyn answered so she has the misfortune is that it has taken the wrong turning evan watched the figure that was to him as that of an angelno less she spoke so frankly to them as she passed or here and there went on with a light laugh it seemed an act of graciousness that she should open her mouth to one and indeed by virtue of a pride which raised her to the level of what she thought it well to do rose was veritably on higher ground than any present she no longer envied her friend jenny who emerging from the shades allured by the waltz dislinked herself from williams arm and whispered exclamations of sorrow at the scene created by mr harringtons mother rose patted her hand and said thank you jenny dear but dont be sorry im glad it prevents a number of private explanations still dear jenny suggested oh of course i should like to lay my whip across the shoulders of the person who arranged the conspiracy said rose and afterwards i dont mind returning thanks to him or her or them william cried out im always on your side rose and ill be jennys bridesmaid rejoined rose stepping blithely away from them evan debated whither to turn when rose was lost to his eyes he had no heart for dancing presently a servant approached and said that mr harry particularly desired to see him from harrys looks at table evan judged that the interview was not likely to be amicable he asked the direction he was to take and setting out with long strides came in sight of raikes who walked in gloom and was evidently labouring under one of his mountains of melancholy he affected to be quite out of the world but finding that evan took the hint in his usual prosy manner was reduced to call after him and finally to run and catch him havent you one single spark of curiosity he began what about said evan why about my amazing luck you havent asked a question a matter of course evan complimented him by asking a question saying that jacks luck certainly was wonderful wonderful you call it said jack witheringly and whats more wonderful is that id give up all for quiet quarters in the green dragon i knew i was prophetic i knew i should regret that peaceful hostelry diocletian if you like i beg you to listen i cant walk so fast without danger well speak out man whats the matter with you cried evan impatiently jack shook his head i see a total absence of sympathy he remarked i cant then stand out of the way jack let him pass exclaiming with cold irony i will pay homage to a loftier nine mr raikes could not in his soul imagine that evan was really so little inquisitive concerning a business of such importance as the trouble that possessed him he watched his friend striding off incredulously and then commenced running in pursuit harrington i give in i surrender you reduce me to prose thy nine have conquered my ninepardon me old fellow im immensely upset this is the first day in my life that i ever felt what indigestion is egad ive got something to derange the best digestion going look here harrington what happened to you today i declare i think nothing of you owe me your assistance you do indeed for if it hadnt been for the fearful fascinations of your sisterthat divine countessi should have been engaged to somebody by this time and profited by the opportunity held out to me and which is now gone im disgraced im known and the worst of it is i must face people i darent turn tail did you ever hear of such a dilemma ay quoth evan what is it raikes turned pale then you havent heard of it not a word then its all for me to tell i called on messrs grist i dined at the aurora afterwards depend upon it harrington were led by a star i mean fellows with anything in them are i recognized our fallowfield host and thinking to draw him out i told our mutual histories next day i went to these messrs grist they proposed the membership for fallowfield five hundred a year and the loan of a curricle on condition its singular harrington before anybody knew of the condition i didnt care about it a bit it seemed to me childish who would think of minding wearing a tin plate but nowthe sufferings of oresteswhat are they to mine he wasnt tied to his furies they did hover a little above him but as for me im scorched and i mustnt say where my mouth is locked the social laws which forbid the employment of obsolete words arrest my exclamations of despair what do you advise evan stared a moment at the wretched object whose dream of meeting a beneficent old gentleman had brought him to be the sport of a cynical farceur he had shivers on his own account seeing something of himself magnified and he loathed the fellow only to feel more acutely what a stigma may be its a case i cant advise in he said as gently as he could i should be off the grounds in a hurry and then im where i was before i met the horrid old brute raikes moaned i told him over a pint of portand noble stuff is that aurora porti told himi amused him till he was on the point of burstingi told him i was such a gentleman as the world hadnt seenminus money so he determined to launch me he said i should lead the life of such a gentleman as the world had not yet seenon that simple condition which appeared to me childish a senile whim rather an indulgence of his evan listened to the tribulations of his friend as he would to those of a dollthe sport of some experimental child by this time he knew something of old tom cogglesby and was not astonished that he should have chosen john raikes to play one of his farces on jack turned off abruptly the moment he saw they were nearing human figures but soon returned to evans side as if for protection hoy harrington shouted harry beckoning to him come make haste im in a deuce of a mess the two wheedlessusan and pollywere standing in front of him and after his call to evan he turned to continue some exhortation or appeal to the common sense of women largely indulged in by young men when the mischief is done harrington do speak to her she looks upon you as a sort of parson i cant make her believe i didnt send for her of course she knows im fond of her my dear fellow he whispered i shall be ruined if my grandmother hears of it get her away please promise anything evan took her hand and asked for the child quite well sir faltered susan you should not have come here susan stared and commenced whimpering didnt you wish it sir oh shes always thinking of being made a lady of cried polly as if mr harry was going to do that it wants a gentleman to do that the carriage came for me sir in the afternoon said susan plaintively with your compliments and would i come i thought what carriage asked evan raikes who was ogling polly interposed grandly mine and you sent in my name for this girl to come here evan turned wrathfully on him my dear harrington when you hit you knock down the wise require but one dose of experience the countess wished it and i did dispatch the countess harry exclaimed jove do you mean to say that the countess de saldar added jack in britain none were worthy found harry gave a long whistle leave at once said evan to susan whatever you may want send to me for and when you think you can meet your parents i will take you to them remember that is what you must do make her give up that stupidness of hers about being made a lady of mr harrington said the inveterate polly susan here fell a weeping i would go sir she said im sure i would obey you but i cant i cant go back to the inn theyre beginning to talk about me becausebecause i cantcant pay them and im ashamed evan looked at harry i forgot the latter mumbled but his face was crimson he put his hands in his pockets do you happen to have a note or so he asked evan took him aside and gave him what he had and this amount without inspection or reserve harry offered to susan she dashed his hand impetuously from her sight there give it to me said polly oh mr harry what a young man you are whether from the rebuff or the reproach or old feelings reviving harry was moved to go forward and lay his hand on susans shoulder and mutter something in her ear that softened her polly thrust the notes into her bosom and with a toss of her nose as who should say heres nonsense theyre at again tapped susan on the other shoulder and said imperiously come miss hurrying out a dozen sentences in one harry ended by suddenly kissing susans cheek and then polly bore her away and harry with great solemnity said to evan pon my honour i think i ought to i declare i think i love that girl whats ones family why shouldnt you button to the one that just suits you that girl when shes dressed and in good trim by jove nobodyd know her from a born lady and as for grammar id soon teach her that harry began to whistle a sign in him that he was thinking his hardest i confess to being considerably impressed by the maid wheedle said raikes would you throw yourself away on her evan inquired apparently forgetting how he stood mr raikes replied you ask perhaps a little too much of me one owes consideration to ones position in the worlds eyes a matrimonial slip outweighs a peccadillo no to much the maid might wheedle me but to hymen shes decidedly fresh and pertthe most delicious little fat lips and cocky nose but cease we to dwell on her or of us two to one will be undone harry burst into a laugh is this the tp for fallowfield mp i think you mean quoth raikes serenely but a curious glance being directed on him and pursuing him pertinaciously it was as if the pediment of the lofty monument he topped were smitten with violence he stammered an excuse and retreated somewhat as it is the fashion to do from the presence of royalty followed by harrys roar of laughter in which evan cruelly joined gracious powers exclaimed the victim of ambition im laughed at by the son of a tailor and he edged once more into the shade of trees it was a strange sight for harrys relatives to see him arm in arm with the man he should have been kicking challenging denouncing or whatever the code prescribes to see him talking to this young man earnestly clinging to him affectionately and when he separated from him heartily wringing his hand well might they think that there was something extraordinary in these harringtons convicted of tailordom these harringtons appeared to shine with double lustre how was it they were at a loss to say they certainly could say that the countess was egregiously affected and vulgar but who could be altogether complacent and sincere that had to fight so hard a fight in this struggle with society i see one of the instances where success is entirely to be honoured and remains a proof of merit for however boldly antagonism may storm the ranks of society it will certainly be repelled whereas affinity cannot be resisted and they who against obstacles of birth claim and keep their position among the educated and refined have that affinity it is on the whole rare so that society is not often invaded i think it will have to front jack cade again before another old mel and his progeny shall appear you refuse to believe in old mel you know not natures cunning mrs shorne mrs melville miss carrington and many of the guests who observed evan moving from place to place after the exposure as they called it were amazed at his audacity there seemed such a quietly superb air about him he would not look out of his element and this knowing what they knew was his offence he deserved some commendation for still holding up his head but it was love and rose who kept the fires of his heart alive the sun had sunk the figures on the summit of parnassus were seen bobbing in happy placidity against the twilight sky the sun had sunk and many of mr raikes best things were unspoken wandering about in his gloom he heard a feminine voice yes i will trust you you will not repent it was answered recognizing the duke mr raikes cleared his throat a hem your grace this is how the days should pass i think we should diurnally station a good london band on high and play his majesty to bedthe sun my opinion is it would improve the crops im not as yet a landed proprietor the duke stepped aside with him and raikes addressed no one for the next twenty minutes when he next came forth parnassus was half deserted it was known that old mrs bonner had been taken with a dangerous attack and under this third blow the pic nic succumbed simultaneously with the messenger that brought the news to lady jocelyn one approached evan and informed him that the countess de saldar urgently entreated him to come to the house without delay he also wished to speak a few words to her and stepped forward briskly he had no prophetic intimations of the change this interview would bring upon him chapter xxxiii the hero takes his rank in the orchestra the countess was not in her dressing room when evan presented himself she was in attendance on mrs bonner conning said and the primness of conning was a thing to have been noticed by any one save a dreamy youth in love conning remained in the room keeping distinctly aloof her duties absorbed her but a presiding thought mechanically jerked back her head from time to time being the mute form of well i never in connings rank of life and intellectual capacity evan remained quite still in a chair and conning was certainly a number of paces beyond suspicion when the countess appeared and hurling at the maid one of those feminine looks which contain huge quartos of meaning vented the cold query pray why did you not come to me as you were commanded i was not aware my lady conning drew up to reply and performed with her eyes a lofty rejection of the volume cast at her and a threat of several for offensive operations if need were the countess spoke nearer to what she was implying you know i object to this it is not the first time would your ladyship please to say what your ladyship means in return for this insolent challenge to throw off the mask the countess felt justified in punishing her by being explicit your irregularities are not of yesterday she said kindly making use of a word of double signification still thank you my lady conning accepted the word in its blackest meaning i am obliged to you if your ladyship is to be believed my character is not worth much but i can make distinctions my lady something very like an altercation was continued in a sharp brief undertone and then evan waking up to the affairs of the hour heard conning say i shall not ask your ladyship to give me a character the countess answering with pathos it would indeed be to give you one he was astonished that the countess should burst into tears when conning had departed and yet more so that his effort to console her should bring a bolt of wrath upon himself now evan now see what you have done for usdo and rejoice at it the very menials insult us you heard what that creature said she can make distinctions oh i could beat her they know it all the servants know it i can see it in their faces i feel it when i pass them the insolent wretches treat us as impostors and this conningto defy me oh it comes of my devotion to you i am properly chastized i passed roses maid on the stairs and her reverence was barely perceptible evan murmured that he was very sorry adding foolishly do you really care louisa for what servants think and say the countess sighed deeply oh you are too thickskinned your mother from top to toe it is too dreadful what have i done to deserve it oh evan evan her head dropped in her lap there was something ludicrous to evan in this excess of grief on account of such a business but he was tender hearted and wrought upon to declare that whether or not he was to blame for his mothers intrusion that afternoon he was ready to do what he could to make up to the countess for her sufferings whereat the countess sighed again asked him what he possibly could do and doubted his willingness to accede to the most trifling request no i do in verity believe that were i to desire you to do aught for your own good alone you would demur van he assured her that she was mistaken we shall see she said and if once or twice i have run counter to you louisa abominable language cried the countess stopping her ears like a child do not excruciate me so you laugh my goodness what will you come to evan checked his smile and taking her hand said i must tell you that on the whole i see nothing to regret in what has happened to day you may notice a change in the manners of the servants and some of the country squiresses but i find none in the bearing of the real ladies the true gentlemen to me because the change is too fine for you to perceive it interposed the countess rose then and her mother and her father evan cried impetuously as for lady jocelyn the countess shrugged and sir franks her head shook and rose rose is simply self willed a she will or she wont sort of little person no criterion henceforth the world is against us we have to struggle with it it does not rank us of it your feeling on the point is so exaggerated my dear louisa said evan one cant bring reason to your ears the tattle we shall hear we shall outlive i care extremely for the good opinion of men but i prefer my own and i do not lose it because my father was in trade and your own name evan harrington is on a shop the countess struck in and watched him severely from under her brow glad to mark that he could still blush oh heaven she wailed to increase the effect on a shop a brother of mine yes louisa it may not last i did itis it not better that a son should blush than cast dishonour on his fathers memory ridiculous boy notion rose has pardoned it louisacannot you i find that the naturally vulgar and narrow headed people and cowards who never forego mean advantages are those only who would condemn me and my conduct in that and you have joy in your fraction of the world left to you exclaimed his female elder changeing her manner to a winning softness she said let me also belong to the very small party you have been really romantic and most generous and noble only the shop smells but never mind promise me you will not enter it i hope not said evan you do hope that you will not officiate oh evan the eternal contemplation of gentlemens legs think of that think of yourself sculptured in that attitude innumerable little prickles and stings shot over evans skin therethere louisa he said impatiently spare your ridicule we go to london to morrow and when there i expect to hear that i have an appointment and that this engagement is over he rose and walked up and down the room i shall not be prepared to go to morrow remarked the countess drawing her figure up stiffly oh well if you can stay andrew will take charge of you i dare say no my dear andrew will nota nonentity cannotyou must impossible louisa said evan as one who imagines he is uttering a thing of little consequence i promised rose you promised rose that you would abdicate and retire sweet loving girl evan made no answer you will stay with me evan i really cant he said in his previous careless tone come and sit down cried the countess imperiously the first trifle is refused it does not astonish me i will honour you now by talking seriously to you i have treated you hitherto as a child or no she stopped her mouth it is enough if i tell you dear that poor mrs bonner is dying and that she desires my attendance on her to refresh her spirit with readings on the prophecies and scriptural converse no other soul in the house can so soothe her then stay said evan unprotected in the midst of enemies truly i think louisa if you can call lady jocelyn an enemy you must read the scriptures by a false light the woman is an utter heathen interjected the countess an infidel can be no friend she is therefore the reverse her opinions embitter her mothers last days but now you will consent to remain with me dear van an implacable negative responded to the urgent appeal of her eyes by the way he said for a diversion did you know of a girl stopping at an inn in fallowfield know a barmaid the countesss eyes and mouth were wide at the question did you send raikes for her to day did mr raikesah evan that creature reminds me you have no sense of contrast for a brazilian apehe resembles if he is not truly onewhat contrast is he to an english gentleman his proximity and acquaintancerich as he may bedisfigure you study contrast evan had to remind her that she had not answered him whereat she exclaimed one would really think you had never been abroad have you not evaded me rather the countess commenced fanning her languid brows and then pursued now my dear brother i may conclude that you will acquiesce in my moderate wishes you remain my venerable friend cannot last three days she is on the brink of a better world i will confide to you that it is of the utmost importance we should be here on the spot until the sad termination that is what i summoned you for you are now at liberty ta ta as soon as you please she had baffled his little cross examination with regard to raikes but on the other point he was firm she would listen to nothing she affected that her mandate had gone forth and must be obeyed tapped with her foot fanned deliberately and was a consummate queen till he turned the handle of the door when her complexion deadened she started up trembling and tripping towards him caught him by the arm and said stop after all that i have sacrificed for you as well try to raise the dead as a dawley from the dust he grovels in why did i consent to visit this place it was for you i came i heard that you had disgraced yourself in drunkenness at fallowfield and i toiled to eclipse that and i did young jocelyn thought you were what you are i could spit the word at you and i dazzled him to give you time to win this minx who will spin you like a top if you get her that mr forth knew it as well and that vile young laxley they are gone why are they gone because they thwarted methey crossed your interestsi said they should go george uplift is going to day the house is left to us and i believe firmly that mrs bonners will contains a memento of the effect of our frequent religious conversations so you would leave now i suspect nobody but we are all human and wills would not have been tampered with for the first time besides and the countesss imagination warmed till she addressed her brother as a confederate we shall then see to whom beckley court is bequeathed either way it may be yours yours and you suffer their plots to drive you forth do you not perceive that mama was brought here to day on purpose to shame us and cast us out we are surrounded by conspiracies but if our faith is pure who can hurt us if i had not that consolationwould that you had it toowould it be endurable to me to see those menials whispering and showing their forced respect as it is i am fortified to forgive them i breathe another atmosphere oh evan you did not attend to mr parsleys beautiful last sermon the church should have been your vocation from vehemence the countess had subsided to a mournful gentleness she had been too excited to notice any changes in her brothers face during her speech and when he turned from the door and still eyeing her fixedly led her to a chair she fancied from his silence that she had subdued and convinced him a delicious sense of her power succeeded by a weary reflection that she had constantly to employ it occupied her mind and when presently she looked up from the shade of her hand it was to agitate her head pitifully at her brother all this you have done for me louisa he said yes evanall she fell into his tone and you are the cause of laxleys going did you know anything of that anonymous letter he was squeezing her handwith grateful affection as she was deluded to imagine perhaps deara little her conceit prompted her to admit did you write it he gazed intently into her eyes and as the question shot like a javelin she tried ineffectually to disengage her fingers her delusion waned she took fright but it was too late he had struck the truth out of her before she could speak her spirit writhed like a snake in his hold innumerable things she was ready to say and strove to the words would not form on her lips i will be answered louisa the stern manner he had assumed gave her no hope of eluding him with an inward gasp and a sensation of nakedness altogether new to her dismal and alarming she felt that she could not lie like a creature forsaken of her staunchest friend she could have flung herself to the floor the next instant her natural courage restored her she jumped up and stood at bay yes i did and now he was weak and she was strong and used her strength i wrote it to save you yes call on your creator and be my judge if you dare never never will you meet a soul more utterly devoted to you evan this mr forth this laxley i said should go because they were resolved to ruin you and make you base they are gone the responsibility i take on myself nightlyduring the remainder of my daysi will pray for pardon he raised his head to ask sombrely is your handwriting like laxleys it seems so she answered with a pitiful sneer for one who could arrest her exaltation to inquire about minutiae right or wrong it is done and if you choose to be my judge think whether your own conscience is clear why did you come here why did you stay you have your free willdo you deny that oh i will take the entire blame but you must not be a hypocrite van you know you were aware we had no confidences i was obliged to treat you like a child but for you to pretend to suppose that roses grow in your pathoh that is paltry you are a hypocrite or an imbecile if that is your course was he not something of the former the luxurious mist in which he had been living dispersed before his sisters bitter words and as she designed he should he felt himself her accomplice but again reason struggled to enlighten him for surely he would never have done a thing so disproportionate to the end to be gained it was the unconnected action of his brain that thus advised him no thoroughly fashioned clear spirited man conceives wickedness impossible to him but wickedness so largely mixed with folly the best of us may reject as not among our temptations evan since his love had dawned had begun to talk with his own nature and though he knew not yet how much it would stretch or contract he knew that he was weak and could not perform moral wonders without severe struggles the cynic may add if he likesor without potent liquors could he be his sisters judge it is dangerous for young men to be too good they are so sweeping in their condemnations so sublime in their conceptions of excellence and the most finished puritan cannot out do their demands upon frail humanity evans momentary self examination saved him from this and he told the countess with a sort of cold compassion that he himself dared not blame her his tone was distinctly wanting in admiration of her but she was somewhat over wrought and leaned her shoulder against him and became immediately his affectionate only too zealous sister dearly to be loved to be forgiven to be prized and on condition of inserting a special petition for pardon in her orisons to live with a calm conscience and to be allowed to have her own way with him during the rest of her days it was a happy uniona picture that the countess was lured to admire in the glass sad that so small a murmur should destroy it for ever what cried the countess bursting from his arm go she emphasized with the hardness of determined unbelief as if plucking the words one by one out of her reluctant ears go to lady jocelyn and tell her i wrote the letter you can do no less i fear said evan eyeing the floor and breathing a deep breath then i did hear you correctly oh you must be madidiotic there pray go away evan come in the morning you are too much for my nerves evan rose putting out his hand as if to take hers and plead with her she rejected the first motion and repeated her desire for him to leave her saying cheerfully good night dear i dare say we shant meet till the morning you cant let this injustice continue a single night louisa said he she was deep in the business of arrangeing a portion of her attire go go please she responded lingering he said if i go it will be straight to lady jocelyn she stamped angrily only go and then she found him gone and she stooped lower to the glass to mark if the recent agitation were observable under her eyes there looking at herself her heart dropped heavily in her bosom she ran to the door and hurried swiftly after evan pulling him back speechlessly where are you going evan to lady jocelyn the unhappy victim of her devotion stood panting if you go ii take poison it was for him now to be struck but he was suffering too strong an anguish to be susceptible to mock tragedy the countess paused to study him she began to fear her brother i will she reiterated wildly without moving him at all and the quiet inflexibility of his face forbade the ultimate hope which lies in giving men a dose of hysterics when they are obstinate she tried by taunts and angry vituperations to make him look fierce if but an instant to precipitate her into an exhibition she was so well prepared for evan what after all my love my confidence in youi need not have told youto expose us brother would you oh i will not let this last another hour said evan firmly at the same time seeking to caress her she spurned his fruitless affection feeling nevertheless how cruel was her fate for with any other save a brother she had arts at her disposal to melt the manliest resolutions the glass showed her that her face was pathetically pale the tones of her voice were rich and harrowing what did they avail with a brother promise me she cried eagerly promise me to stop hereon this spottill i return the promise was extracted the countess went to fetch caroline evan did not count the minutes one thought was mounting in his brainthe scorn of rose he felt that he had lost her lost her when he had just won her he felt it without realizing it the first blows of an immense grief are dull and strike the heart through wool as it were the belief of the young in their sorrow has to be flogged into them on the good old educational principle could he do less than this he was about to do rose had wedded her noble nature to him and it was as much her spirit as his own that urged him thus to forfeit her to be worthy of her by assuming unworthiness there he sat neither conning over his determination nor the cause for it revolving roses words about laxley and nothing else the words were so sweet and so bitter every now and then the heavy smiting on his heart set it quivering and leaping as the whip starts a jaded horse meantime the countess was participating in a witty conversation in the drawing room with sir john and the duke miss current and others and it was not till after she had displayed many graces and as one or two ladies presumed to consider marked effrontery that she rose and drew caroline away with her returning to her dressing room she found that evan had faithfully kept his engagement he was on the exact spot where she had left him caroline came to him swiftly and put her hand to his forehead that she might the better peruse his features saying in her mellow caressing voice what is this dear van that you will do why do you look so wretched has not louisa told you she has told me something dear but i dont know what it is that you are going to expose us what further exposure do we need im sure van my pridewhat i hadis gone i have none left evan kissed her brows warmly an explanation full of the countesss passionate outcries of justification necessity and innocence in higher than fleshly eyes was given and then the three were silent but van caroline commenced deprecatingly my darling of what usenow whether right or wrong why should you why should you when the thing is done dearthink and you too would let another suffer under an unjust accusation said evan but dearest it is surely your duty to think of your family first have we not been afflicted enough why should you lay us under this fresh burden because its better to bear all now than a life of remorse answered evan but this mr laxleyi cannot pity him he has behaved so insolently to you throughout let him suffer lady jocelyn said evan has been unintentionally unjust to him and after her kindnessapart from the right or wrongi will noti cant allow her to continue so after her kindness echoed the countess who had been fuming at carolines weak expostulations kindness have i not done ten times for these jocelyns what they have done for us o mio deus why i have bestowed on them the membership for fallowfield i have saved her from being a convicted liar this very day worse for what would have been talked of the morals of the house supposing the scandal oh indeed i was tempted to bring that horrid mad captain into the house face to face with his flighty doll of a wife as i perhaps should have done acting by the dictates of my conscience i lied for lady jocelyn and handed the man to a lawyer who withdrew him and this they owe to me kindness they have given us bed and board as the people say i have repaid them for that pray be silent louisa said evan getting up hastily for the sick sensation rose had experienced came over him his sisters plots her untruth her coarseness clung to him and seemed part of his blood he now had a personal desire to cut himself loose from the wretched entanglement revealed to him whatever it cost are you really truly going caroline exclaimed for he was near the door at a quarter to twelve at night sneered the countess still imagining that he like herself must be partly acting but van is itdearest think is it manly for a brother to go and tell of his sister and how would it look evan smiled is it that that makes you unhappy louisas name will not be mentionedbe sure of that caroline was stooping forward to him her figure straightened good heaven evan you are not going to take it on yourself roseshe will hate you god help me he cried internally oh evan darling consider reflect she fell on her knees catching his hand it is worse for us that you should suffer dearest think of the dreadful meanness and baseness of what you will have to acknowledge yes sighed the youth and his eyes in his extreme pain turned to the countess reproachfully think dear caroline hurried on he gains nothing for whom you do thisyou lose all it is not your deed you will have to speak an untruth your ideas are wrongwrong i know they are you will have to lie but if you are silent the little little blame that may attach to us will pass away and we shall be happy in seeing our brother happy you are talking to evan as if he had religion said the countess with steady sedateness and at that moment from the sublimity of his pagan virtue the young man groaned for some pure certain light to guide him the question whether he was about to do right made him weak he took carolines head between his two hands and kissed her mouth the act brought rose to his senses insufferably and shehis goddess of truth and his sole guiding lightspurred him afresh my familys dishonour is mine caroline say nothing moredont think of me i go to lady jocelyn tonight to morrow we leave and theres the end louisa if you have any new schemes for my welfare i beg you to renounce them gratitude i never expected from a dawley the countess retorted oh louisa he is going cried caroline kneel to him with me stop him rose loves him and he is going to make her hate him you cant talk reason to one whos mad said the countess more like the dawley she sprang from than it would have pleased her to know my darling my own evan it will kill me caroline exclaimed and passionately imploring him she looked so hopelessly beautiful that evan was agitated and caressed her while he said softly where our honour is not involved i would submit to your smallest wish it involves my lifemy destiny murmured caroline could he have known the double meaning in her words and what a saving this sacrifice of his was to accomplish he would not have turned to do it feeling abandoned of heaven and earth the countess stood rigidly as he went forth caroline was on her knees sobbing chapter xxxiv a pagan sacrifice three steps from the countesss chamber door the knot of evans resolution began to slacken the clear light of his simple duty grew cloudy and complex his pride would not let him think that he was shrinking but cried out in him will you be believed and whispered that few would believe him guilty of such an act yet while something said that full surely lady jocelyn would not a vague dread that rose might threw him back on the luxury of her love and faith in him he found himself hoping that his statement would be laughed at then why make it no that was too blind a hope many would take him at his word allall save lady jocelyn rose the first because he stood so high with her now he feared the fall ah dazzling pinnacle our darlings shoot us up on a wondrous jugglers pole and we talk familiarly to the stars and are so much above everybody and try to walk like creatures with two legs forgetting that we have but a pins point to stand on up there probably the absence of natural motion inspires the prophecy that we must ultimately come down our unused legs wax morbidly restless evan thought it good that rose should lift her head to look at him nevertheless he knew that rose would turn from him the moment he descended from his superior station nature is wise in her young children though they wot not of it and are always trying to rush away from her they escape their wits sooner than their instincts but was not rose involved in him and part of him had he not sworn never to renounce her what was this but a betrayal go on young man fight your fight the little imps pluck at you the big giant assails you the seductions of the soft mouthed siren are not wanting slacken the knot an instant and they will all have play and the worst is that you may be wrong and they may be right for is it can it be proper for you to stain the silvery whiteness of your skin by plunging headlong into yonder pitch bath consider the defilement contemplate your hideous aspect on issuing from that black baptism as to the honour of your family mr evan harrington pray of what sort of metal consists the honour of a tailors family one little impertinent imp ventured upon that question on his own account the clever beast was torn back and strangled instantaneously by his experienced elders but not before evans pride had answered him exalted by love he could dread to abase himself and strip off his glittering garments lowered by the world he fell back upon his innate worth yes he was called on to prove it he was on his way to prove it surrendering his dearest and his best casting aside his dreams his desires his aspirations for this stern duty he at least would know that he made himself doubly worthy of her who abandoned him and the world would scorn him by reason of his absolute merit coming to this point the knot of his resolve tightened again he hugged it with the furious zeal of a martyr religion the lack of which in him the countess deplored would have guided him and silenced the internal strife but do not despise a virtue purely pagan the young who can act readily up to the christian light are happier doubtless but they are led they are passive i think they do not make such capital christians subsequently they are never in such danger we know but some in the flock are more than sheep the heathen ideal it is not so very easy to attain and those who mount from it to the christian have in my humble thought a firmer footing so evan fought his hard fight from the top of the stairs to the bottom a pagan which means our poor unsupported flesh is never certain of his victory now you will see him kneeling to his gods and anon drubbing them or he makes them fight for him and is complacent at the issue evan had ceased to pick his knot with one hand and pull it with the other but not finding lady jocelyn below and hearing that she had retired for the night he mounted the stairs and the strife recommenced from the bottom to the top strange to say he was almost unaware of any struggle going on within him the suggestion of the foolish little imp alone was loud in the heart of his consciousness the rest hung more in his nerves than in his brain he thought well i will speak it out to her in the morning and thought so sincerely while an ominous sigh of relief at the reprieve rose from his over burdened bosom hardly had the weary deep breath taken flight when the figure of lady jocelyn was seen advancing along the corridor with a lamp in her hand she trod heavily in a kind of march as her habit was her large fully open grey eyes looking straight ahead she would have passed him and he would have let her pass but seeing the unusual pallor on her face his love for this lady moved him to step forward and express a hope that she had no present cause for sorrow hearing her mothers name lady jocelyn was about to return a conventional answer recognizing evan she said ah mr harrington yes i fear its as bad as it can be she can scarcely outlive the night again he stood alone his chance was gone how could he speak to her in her affliction her calm sedate visage had the beauty of its youth when lighted by the animation that attends meetings or farewells in her bow to evan he beheld a lovely kindness more unique if less precious than anything he had ever seen on the face of rose half exultingly he reflected that no opportunity would be allowed him now to teach that noble head and truest of human hearts to turn from him the clear eyed morrow would come the days of the future would be bright as other days wrapped in the comfort of his cowardice he started to see lady jocelyn advancing to him again mr harrington she said rose tells me you leave us early in the morning i may as well shake your hand now we part very good friends i shall always be glad to hear of you evan pressed her hand and bowed i thank you madam was all he could answer it will be better if you dont write to rose her tone was rather that of a request than an injunction i have no right to do so my lady she considers that you have i wish her to have a fair trial his voice quavered the philosophic lady thought it time to leave him so good bye i can trust you without extracting a promise if you ever have need of a friend you know you are at liberty to write to me you are tired my lady he put this question more to dally with what he ought to be saying tolerably your sister the countess relieves me in the night i fancy my mother finds her the better nurse of the two lady jocelyns face lighted in its gracious pleasant way as she just inclined her head but the mention of the countess and her attendance on mrs bonner had nerved evan the contrast of her hypocrisy and vile scheming with this most open noble nature acted like a new force within him he begged lady jocelyns permission to speak with her in private marking his fervid appearance she looked at him seriously is it really important i cannot rest madam till it is spoken i mean it doesnt pertain to the delirium we may sleep upon that he divined her sufficiently to answer it concerns a piece of injustice done by you madam and which i can help you to set right lady jocelyn stared somewhat follow me into my dressing room she said and led the way escape was no longer possible he was on the march to execution and into the darkness of his brain danced john raikes with his grotesque tribulations it was the harsh savour of reality that conjured up this flighty being who probably never felt a sorrow or a duty the farce jack lived was all that evans tragic bitterness could revolve and seemed to be the only light in his mind you might have seen a smile on his mouth when he was ready to ask for a bolt from heaven to crush him now said her ladyship and he found that the four walls enclosed them what have i been doing she did not bid him be seated her brevity influenced him to speak to the point you have dismissed mr laxley my lady he is innocent how do you know that becausea whirl of sensations beset the wretched youth because i am guilty his words had run ahead of his wits and in answer to lady jocelyns singular exclamation he could but simply repeat them her head drew back her face was slightly raised she looked as he had seen her sometimes look at the countess with a sort of speculative amazement and why do you come to tell me for the reason that i cannot allow you to be unjust madam what on earth was your motive evan stood silent flinching from her frank eyes well well well her ladyship dropped into a chair and thumped her knees there was lawyers blood in lady jocelyns veins she had the judicial mind a confession was to her a confession she tracked actions up to a motive but one who came voluntarily to confess needed no sifting she had the habit of treating things spoken as facts you absolutely wrote that letter to mrs evremondes husband evan bowed to avoid hearing his own lie you discovered his address and wrote to him and imitated mr laxleys handwriting to effect the purpose you may have had her credulity did require his confirmation of it and he repeated it is my deed hum and you sent that premonitory slip of paper to her to mrs evremonde somebody else was the author of that perhaps it is all on me in that case mr harrington i can only say that its quite right you should quit this house to morrow morning her ladyship commenced rocking in her chair and then added may i ask have you madness in your family no because when one cant discern a motive its natural to ascribe certain acts to madness had mrs evremonde offended you or ferdinandbut one only hears of such practices towards fortunate rivals and now you have come to undo what you did i must admit that taking the monstrousness of the act and the inconsequence of your proceedings together the whole affair becomes more incomprehensible to me than it was before would it be unpleasant to you to favour me with explanations she saw the pain her question gave him and passing it said of course you need not be told that rose must hear of this yes said evan she must hear it you know what thats equivalent to but if you like i will not speak to her till you have left us instantly cried evan nowto night i would not have her live a minute in a false estimate of me had lady jocelyns intellect been as penetrating as it was masculine she would have taken him and turned him inside out in a very short time for one who would bear to see his love look coldly on him rather than endure a minutes false estimate of his character and who could yet stoop to concoct a vile plot must either be mad or simulating the baseness for some reason or other she perceived no motive for the latter and she held him to be sound in the head and what was spoken from the mouth she accepted perhaps also she saw in the complication thus offered an escape for rose and was the less inclined to elucidate it herself but if her intellect was baffled her heart was unerring a man proved guilty of writing an anonymous letter would not have been allowed to stand long in her room she would have shown him to the door of the house speedily and evan was aware in his soul that he had not fallen materially in her esteem he had puzzled and confused her and partly because she had the feeling that this young man was entirely trustworthy and because she never relied on her feelings she let his own words condemn him and did not personally discard him in fact she was a veritable philosopher she permitted her fellows to move the world on as they would and had no other passions in the contemplation of the show than a cultured audience will usually exhibit strangemost strange i thought i was getting old she said and eyed the culprit as judges generally are not wont to do it will be a shock to rose i must tell you that i cant regret it i would not have employed force with her but i should have given her as strong a taste of the world as it was in my power to give girls get their reason from society but come if you think you can make your case out better to her you shall speak to her first yourself no my lady said evan softly you would rather not i could not but i suppose shell want to speak to you when she knows it i can take death from her hands but i cannot slay myself the language was natural to his condition though the note was pitched high lady jocelyn hummed till the sound of it was over and an idea striking her she said ah by the way have you any tremendous moral notions i dont think i have madam people act on that mania sometimes i believe do you think it an outrage on decency for a wife to run away from a mad husband whom they wont shut up and take shelter with a friend is that the cause mr forth is an old friend of mine i would trust my daughter with him in a desert and stake my hand on his honour oh lady jocelyn cried evan would to god you might ever have said that of me madam i love you i shall never see you again i shall never meet one to treat me so generously i leave you blackened in characteryou cannot think of me without contempt i can never hope that this will change but for your kindness let me thank you and as speech is poor where emotion is extremeand he knew his own to be especially sohe took her hand with petitioning eyes and dropping on one knee reverentially kissed it lady jocelyn was human enough to like to be appreciated she was a veteran pagan and may have had the instinct that a peculiar virtue in this young one was the spring of his conduct she stood up and said dont forget that you have a friend here the poor youth had to turn his head from her you wish that i should tell rose what you have told me at once mr harrington yes my lady i beg that you will do so well and the queer look lady jocelyn had been wearing dimpled into absolute wonder a stranger to loves cunning she marvelled why he should desire to witness the scorn rose would feel for him if shes not asleep then she shall hear it now said her ladyship you understand that it will be mentioned to no other person except to mr laxley madam to whom i shall offer the satisfaction he may require but i will undertake that just as you think proper on that matter remarked her philosophical ladyship who held that man was a fighting animal and must not have his nature repressed she lighted him part of the way and then turned off to roses chamber would rose believe it of him love combated his dismal foreboding strangely too now that he had plunged into his pitch bath the guilt seemed to cling to him and instead of hoping serenely or fearing steadily his spirit fell in a kind of abject supplication to rose and blindly trusted that she would still love even if she believed him base in his weakness he fell so low as to pray that she might love that crawling reptile who could creep into a house and shrink from no vileness to win her chapter xxxv rose wounded the light of morning was yet cold along the passages of the house when polly wheedle hurrying to her young mistress met her loosely dressed and with a troubled face whats the matter polly i was coming to you o miss rose and i was coming to you miss bonners gone back to her convulsions again shes had them all night her hair wont last till thirty if she keeps on giving way to temper as i tell her and i know that from a barber tush you stupid polly does she want to see me you neednt suspect that miss but you quiet her best and i thought id come to you but gracious rose pushed past her without vouchsafing any answer to the look in her face and turned off to julianas chamber where she was neither welcomed nor repelled juliana said she was perfectly well and that polly was foolishly officious whereupon rose ordered polly out of the room and said to juliana kindly you have not slept dear and i have not either i am so unhappy whether rose intended by this communication to make juliana eagerly attentive and to distract her from her own affair cannot be said but something of the effect was produced you care for him too cried rose impetuously tell me juley do you think him capable of any base action do you think he would do what any gentleman would be ashamed to own tell me juliana looked at rose intently but did not reply rose jumped up from the bed you hesitate juley what could you think so young women after a common game are shrewd juliana may have seen that rose was not steady on the plank she walked and required support i dont know she said turning her cheek to her pillow what an answer rose exclaimed have you no opinion what did you say yesterday its silent as the grave with me but if you do care for him you must think one thing or the other i suppose not thenno said juliana repeating the languid words bitterly rose continued what is it to love without having faith in him you love you make my mind easier juliana caught the implied taunt and said fretfully im ill youre so passionate you dont tell me what it is how can i answer you never mind said rose moving to the door wondering why she had spoken at all but when juliana sprang forward and caught her by the dress to stop her and with a most unwonted outburst of affection begged of her to tell her all the wound in roses breast began to bleed and she was glad to speak juley do youcan you believe that he wrote that letter which poor ferdinand wasaccused of writing juliana appeared to muse and then responded why should he do such a thing o my goodness what a girl rose interjected well then to please you rose of course i think he is too honourable you do think so juley but if he himself confessed itwhat then you would not believe him would you oh then i cant say why should he condemn himself but you would knowyou would know that he was a man to suffer death rather than be guilty of the smallest baseness his birthwhat is that rose filliped her fingers but his actswhat he is himself you would be sure of would you not dear juley oh for heavens sake speak out plainly to me a wily look had crept over julianas features certainly she said in a tone that belied it and drawing rose to her bosom the groan she heard there was passing sweet to her he has confessed it to mama sobbed rose why did he not come to me first he has confessed itthe abominable thing has come out of his own mouth he went to her last night juliana patted her shoulders regularly as they heaved when words were intelligible between them juliana said at least dear you must admit that he has redeemed it redeemed it could he do less rose dried her eyes vehemently as if the tears shamed her a man who could have let another suffer for his crimei could never have lifted my head again i think i would have cut off this hand that plighted itself to him as it is i hardly dare look at myself but you dont think it dear you know it to be false false false why should mr harrington confess it said juliana oh dont speak his name cried rose her cousin smiled so many strange things happen she said and sighed dont sigh i shall think you believe it cried rose an appearance of constrained repose was assumed rose glanced up studied for an instant and breathlessly uttered you do you do believe it juley for answer juliana hugged her with much warmth and recommenced the patting i dare say its a mistake she remarked he may have been jealous of ferdinand you know i have not seen the letter i have only heard of it in love they say you ought to excuse and the want of religious education his sister rose interrupted her with a sharp shudder might it not be possible that one who had the same blood as the countess would stoop to a momentary vileness how changed was rose from the haughty damsel of yesterday do you think my lover could tell a lie hewould not love me long if i did these phrases arose and rang in julianas ears while she pursued the task of comforting the broken spirit that now lay prone on the bed and now impetuously paced the room rose had come thinking the moment julianas name was mentioned that here was the one to fortify her faith in evan one who because she loved could not doubt him she moaned in a terror of distrust loathing her cousin not asking herself why she needed support and indeed she was too young for much clear self questioning and her blood was flowing too quickly for her brain to perceive more than one thing at a time does your mother believe it said juliana evading a direct assault mama she never doubts what you speak answered rose disconsolately she does yes whereat juliana looked most grave and rose felt that it was hard to breathe she had grown very cold and calm and juliana had to be expansive unprovoked believe nothing dear till you hear it from his own lips if he can look in your face and say that he did it well then but of course he cannot it must be some wonderful piece of generosity to his rival so i thought juley so i thought cried rose at the new light and juliana smiled contemptuously and the light flickered and died and all was darker than before in the bosom of rose she had borne so much that this new drop was poison of course it must be that if it is anything juliana pursued you were made to be happy rose and consider if it is true people of very low birth till they have lived long with other people and if they have no religion are so very likely to do things you do not judge them as you do real gentlemen and one must not be too harshi only wish to prepare you for the worst a dim form of that very idea had passed through rose giving her small comfort let him tell you with his own lips that what he has told your mother is true and then and not till then believe him juliana concluded and they kissed kindly and separated rose had suddenly lost her firm step but no sooner was juliana alone than she left the bed and addressed her visage to the glass with brightening eyes as one who saw the glimmer of young hope therein she love him not if he told me so ten thousand times would i believe it and before he has said a syllable she doubts him asking me in that frantic way as if i couldnt see that she wanted me to help her to her faith in him as she calls it not name his name mr harrington i may call him evan some day half uttered half mused the unconscious exclamations issued from her and for many a weary day since she had dreamed of love and studied that which is said to attract the creature she had not been so glowingly elated or looked so much farther in the glass than its pale reflection chapter xxxvi before breakfast cold through the night the dark fringed stream had whispered under evans eyes and the night breeze voiced fool fool to him not without a distant echo in his heart by symbols and sensations he knew that rose was lost to him there was no moon the water seemed aimless passing on carelessly to oblivion now and then the trees stirred and talked or a noise was heard from the pastures he had slain the life that lived in them and the great glory they were to bring forth and the end to which all things moved had less than the loss of rose been involved the young man might have found himself looking out on a world beneath notice and have been sighing for one more worthy of his clouded excellence but the immense misery present to him in the contemplation of roses sad restrained contempt saved him from the silly elation which is the last and generally successful struggle of human nature in those who can so far master it to commit a sacrifice the loss of that brave high young soulrose who had lifted him out of the mire with her own white hands rose the image of all that he worshipped rose so closely wedded to him that to be cut away from her was to fall like pallid clay from the soaring spirit surely he was stunned and senseless when he went to utter the words to her mother now that he was awake and could feel his self inflicted pain he marvelled at his rashness and foolishness as perhaps numerous mangled warriors have done for a time when the battle field was cool and they were weak and the uproar of their jarred nerves has beset them lying uncherished by degrees he grew aware of a little consolatory touch like the point of a needle in his consciousness laxley would certainly insult him in that case he would not refuse to fight him the darkness broke and revealed this happy prospect and evan held to it an hour and could hardly reject it when better thoughts conquered for would it not be sweet to make the strength of his arm respected he took a stick and ran his eye musingly along the length trifling with it grimly the great mel had been his sons instructor in the chivalrous science of fence and a matre darmes in portugal had given him polish in mels time duels with swords had been occasionally fought and evan looked on the sword as the weapon of combat face to face with his adversarywhat then were birth or position actionaction he sighed for it as i have done since i came to know that his history must be morally developed a glow of bitter pleasure exalted him when after hot passages and parryings and thrusts he had disarmed ferdinand laxley and bestowing on him his life said accept this worthy gift of the son of a tailor and he wiped his sword haply bound up his wrist and stalked off the ground the vindicator of mans natural dignity and then he turned upon himself with laughter discovering a most wholesome power barely to be suspected in him yet but of all the children of glittering mel and his solid mate evan was the best mixed compound of his parents he put the stick back in its corner and eyed his wrist as if he had really just gone through the pretty scene he had just laughed at it was nigh upon reality for it suggested the employment of a handkerchief and he went to a place and drew forth one that had the stain of his blood on it and the name of rose at one end the beloved name was half blotted by the dull red mark and at that sight a strange tenderness took hold of evan his passions became dead and of old date this then would be his for ever love for whom earth had been too small crept exultingly into a nut shell he clasped the treasure on his breast and saw a life beyond his parting with her strengthened thus he wrote by the morning light to laxley the letter was brief and said simply that the act of which laxley had been accused evan harrington was responsible for the latter expressed regret that laxley should have fallen under a false charge and at the same time indicated that if laxley considered himself personally aggrieved the writer was at his disposal a messenger had now to be found to convey it to the village inn footmen were stirring about the house and one meeting evan close by his door observed with demure grin that he could not find the gentlemans nether garments the gentleman it appeared was mr john raikes who according to report had been furnished with a bed at the house because of a discovery made at a late period over night that farther the gentleman could not go evan found him sleeping soundly how much the poor youth wanted a friend fortune had given him instead a born buffoon and it is perhaps the greatest evil of a position like evans that with cultured feelings you are likely to meet with none to know you society does not mix well in money pecking spheres here however was john raikes and evan had to make the best of him eh yawned jack awakened i was dreaming i was napoleon bonapartes right hand man i want you to be mine for half an hour said evan without replying the distinguished officer jumped out of bed at a bound mounted a chair and peered on tip toe over the top from which with a glance of self congratulation he pulled the missing piece of apparel sighed dejectedly as he descended while he exclaimed safe but no distinction can compensate a man for this state of intolerable suspicion of everybody i assure you harrington i wouldnt be napoleon himselfand i have always been his peculiar admirerto live and be afraid of my valet i believe it will develop cancer sooner or later in me i feel singular pains already last night after crowning champagne with ale which produced a sort of french revolution in my interiorby the way that must have made me dream of napoleon last night with my lower members in revolt against my head i had to sit and cogitate for hours on a hiding place for thesecall them what you will depend upon it harrington this world is no such funny affair as we fancy then it is true that you could let a man play pranks on you said evan i took it for one of your jokes just as i cant believe that youre a tailor returned jack its not a bit more extraordinary but jack if you cause yourself to be contemptible contemptible cried jack this is not the tone i like contemptible why its my eccentricity among my equals if i dread the profane vulgar that only proves that im above them odi etc besides achilles had his weak point and egad it was when he faced about by jingo i wish id had that idea yesterday i should have behaved better evan could see that the creature was beginning to rely desperately on his humour come he said be a man to day throw off your motley when i met you that night so oddly you had been acting like a worthy fellow trying to earn your bread in the best way you could and precisely because i met you of all men ive been going round and round ever since said jack a clown or pantaloon would have given me balance say no more you couldnt help it we met because we were the two extremes sighing what a jolly old inn raikes rolled himself over in the sheets and gave two or three snug jolts indicative of his determination to be comfortable while he could do you intend to carry on this folly jack say sacrifice was the answer i feel it as much as you possibly could mr harrington hear the facts jack turned round again why did i consent to this absurdity because of my ambition that old fellow whom i took to be a clerk of messrs grist said you want to cut a figure in the worldyoure armed now a sort of fortunatuss joke it was his way of launching me but did he think i intended this for more than a lift i his puppet he sir was my tool well i came all my efforts were strained to shorten the period of penance i had the best linen and put on captivating manners i should undoubtedly have won some girl of station and cast off my engagement like an old suit but just marknow mark how fortune tricks us after the pic nic yesterday the domestics of the house came to clear away and the band being there i stopped them and bade them tune up and at the same time seizing the maid wheedle away we flew we danced we whirled we twirled ale upon this my head was lost why dont it last for ever says i i wish it did says she the naivete enraptured me oooo i cried hugging her and then you know there was no course open to a man of honour but to offer marriage and make a lady of her i proposed she accepted me and here i am eternally tied to this accurst insignia if im to keep my promise isnt that a sacrifice friend h theres no course open to me the poor girl is madly in love she called me a rattle as a gentleman i cannot recede evan got up and burst into damnable laughter at this burlesque of himself telling the fellow the service he required and receiving a groaning assurance that the letter should without loss of time be delivered in proper style the egoist as jack heartily thought him fell behind his knitted brows and after musing abstractedly went forth to light upon his fate but a dread of meeting had seized both rose and evan she had exhausted her first sincerity of unbelief in her interview with juliana and he had begun to consider what he could say to her more than the three words i did it would not be possible and if she made him repeat them facing her truthful eyes would he be man enough to strike her bared heart twice and ah the sullen brute he must seem standing before her dumb hearing her sigh seeing her wretched effort not to show how unwillingly her kind spirit despised him the reason for the actshe would ask for that rose would not be so philosophic as her mother she would grasp at every chance to excuse the deed he cried out against his scheming sister in an agony and while he did so encountered miss carrington and miss bonner in deep converse juliana pinched her arm whereupon miss carrington said you look merry this morning mr harrington for he was unawares smiling at the image of himself in the mirror of john raikes that smile transformed to a chuckling grimace travelled to rose before they met why did she not come to him a soft voice at his elbow made his blood stop it was caroline she kissed him answering his greeting is it good morning certainly said he by the way dont forget that the coach leaves early my darling evan you make me so happy for it was really a mistaken sense of honour for what can at all excuse a falsehood you know evan caroline took his arm and led him into the sun watching his face at times presently she said i want just to be assured that you thought more wisely than when you left us last night more wisely evan turned to her with a playful smile my dear brother you did not do what you said you would do have you ever known me not to do what i said i would do evan good heaven you did it then how can you remain here an instant oh no nosay no darling where is louisa he inquired she is in her room she will never appear at breakfast if she knows this perhaps more solitude would do her good said evan remember if this should prove true think how you punish her on that point evan had his own opinion well i shall never have to punish you in this way my love he said fondly and caroline dropped her eyelids dont think that i am blaming her he added trying to feel as honestly as he spoke i was mad to come here i see it all now let us keep to our place we are all the same before god till we disgrace ourselves possibly with that sense of shame which some young people have who are not professors of sounding sentences or affected by missionary zeal when they venture to breathe the holy name evan blushed and walked on humbly silent caroline murmured yes yes oh brother and her figure drew to him as if for protection pale she looked up shall you always love me evan whom else have i to love but alwaysalways under any circumstances more and more dear i always have and shall i look to you now i have no home but in your heart now she was agitated and he spoke warmly to calm her the throb of deep emotion rang in her rich voice i will live any life to be worthy of your love evan and she wept to him they were words and tears without a history nothing further passed between them caroline went to the countess evan waited for rose the sun was getting high the face of the stream glowed like metal why did she not come she believed him guilty from the mouth of another if so there was something less for him to lose and now the sacrifice he had made did whisper a tale of mortal magnificence in his ears feelings that were not his noblest stood up exalted he waited till the warm meadow breath floating past told that the day had settled into heat and then he waited no more but quietly walked into the house with the strength of one who has conquered more than human scorn chapter xxxvii the retreat from beckley never would the countess believe that brother of hers idiot as by nature he might be and heir to unnumbered epithets would so far forget what she had done for him as to drag her through the mud for nothing and so she told caroline again and again vehemently it was about ten minutes before the time for descending to the breakfast table she was dressed and sat before the glass smoothing her hair and applying the contents of a pot of cold cream to her forehead between whiles with perfect sincerity she repeated that she could not believe it she had only trusted evan once since their visit to beckley and that this once he should when treated as a man turn traitor to their common interests and prove himself an utter baby was a piece of nonsense her great intelligence indignantly rejected then if true she answered carolines assurances finally if true he is not his fathers son by which it may be seen that she had indeed taken refuge in the castle of negation against the whole army of facts he is acting carry he is acting the ideas of his ridiculous empty noddle no said caroline mournfully he is not i have never known evan to lie then you must forget the whipping he once had from his motherlittle dolt little selfish pig he obtains his reputation entirely from his abominable selfishness and then stands tall and asks us to admire him he bursts with vanity but if you lend your credence to it carry how in the name of goodness are you to appear at the breakfast i was going to ask you whether you would come said caroline coldly if i can get my hair to lie flat by any means at all of course returned the countess this dreadful horrid country pomade why did we not bring a larger stock of the andalugian regenerator upon my honour my dear you use a most enormous quantity i must really tell you that conning here entered to say that mr evan had given orders for the boxes to be packed and everything got ready to depart by half past eleven oclock when the fly would call for them and convey them to fallowfield in time to meet the coach for london the countess turned her head round to caroline like an astonished automaton given orders she interjected i have very little to get ready remarked caroline be so good as to wait outside the door one instant said the countess to conning with particular urbanity conning heard a great deal of vigorous whispering within and when summoned to re appear a note was handed to her to convey to mr harrington immediately he was on the lawn read it and wrote back three hasty lines in pencil louisa you have my commands to quit this house at the hour named this day you will go with me e h conning was again requested to wait outside the countesss door she was the bearer of another note evan read it likewise tore it up and said that there was no answer the castle of negation held out no longer ruthless battalions poured over the walls blew up the countesss propriety made frightful ravages in her complexion down fell her hair you cannot possibly go to breakfast said caroline i must i must cried the countess why my dear if he has done itwretched creature dont you perceive that by withholding our presences we become implicated with him and the countess from a burst of frenzy put this practical question so shrewdly that carolines wits succumbed to her but he has not done it he is acting she pursued restraining her precious tears for higher purposes as only true heroines can thinks to frighten me into submission do you not think evan is right in wishing us to leave afterafter caroline humbly suggested say before my venerable friend has departed this life the countess took her up no i do not if he is a fool i am not no carry i do not jump into ditches for nothing i will have something tangible for all that i have endured we are now tailors in this place remember if that stigma is affixed to us let us at least be remunerated for it come carolines own hard struggle demanded all her strength yet she appeared to hesitate you will surely not disobey evan louisa disobey the countess amazedly dislocated the syllables why the boy will be telling you next that he will not permit the duke to visit you just your english order of mind that cannotbrutesconceive of friendship between high born men and beautiful women beautiful as you truly are carry five years more will tell on you but perhaps my dearest is in a hurry to return to her maxwell at least he thwacks well carolines arm was taken the countess loved an occasional rhyme when a point was to be made and went off nodding and tripping till the time for stateliness arrived near the breakfast room door she indeed was acting at the bottom of her heart there was a dismal rage of passions hatred of those who would or might look tailor in her face terrors concerning the possible re visitation of the vengeful sir abraham dread of evan and the efforts to despise him the shocks of many conflicting elements above it all her countenance was calmly sadly sweet even as you may behold some majestic lighthouse glimmering over the tumult of a midnight sea an unusual assemblage honoured the breakfast that morning the news of mrs bonners health was more favourable how delighted was the countess to hear that mrs bonner was the only firm ground she stood on there and after receiving and giving gentle salutes she talked of mrs bonner and her night watch by the sick bed in a spirit of doleful hope this passed off the moments till she could settle herself to study faces decidedly every lady present looked glum with the single exception of miss current evan was by lady jocelyns side her ladyship spoke to him but the countess observed that no one else did to herself however the gentlemen were as attentive as ever evan sat three chairs distant from her if the traitor expected his sister to share in his disgrace by noticing him he was in error on the contrary the countess joined the conspiracy to exclude him and would stop a mild laugh if perchance he looked up presently rose entered she said good morning to one or two and glided into a seat that evan was under lady jocelyns protection soon became generally apparent and also that her ladyship was angry an exhibition so rare with her that it was the more remarked rose could see that she was a culprit in her mothers eyes she glanced from evan to her lady jocelyns mouth shut hard the girls senses then perceived the something that was afloat at the table she thought with a pang of horror has juliana told juliana smiled on her but the aspect of mrs shorne and of miss carrington spoke for their knowledge of that which must henceforth be the perpetual reproof to her headstrong youth at what hour do you leave us said lady jocelyn to evan when i leave the table my lady the fly will call for my sisters at half past eleven there is no necessity for you to start in advance i am going over to see my mother rose burned to speak to him now oh why had she delayed why had she swerved from her good rule of open instant explanations but evans heart was stern to his love not only had she by not coming shown her doubt of himshe had betrayed him between the countess melville sir john and the duke an animated dialogue was going on over which miss current played like a lively iris they could not part with the countess melville said he should be left stranded and numerous pretty things were uttered by other gentlemen by the women not a word glancing from certain of them lingeringly to her admirers the countess smiled her thanks and then andrew pressed to remain said he was willing and happy and so forth and it seemed that her admirers had prevailed over her reluctance for the countess ended her little protests with a vanquished bow then there was a gradual rising from table evan pressed lady jocelyns hand and turning from her bent his head to sir franks who without offering an exchange of cordialities said at arms length good bye sir melville also gave him that greeting stiffly harry was perceived to rush to the other end of the room in quest of a fly apparently poor carolines heart ached for her brother to see him standing there in the shadow of many faces but he was not left to stand alone andrew quitted the circle of sir john seymour jocelyn mr george uplift and others and linked his arm to evans rose had gone while evan looked for her despairingly to say his last word and hear her voice once more sir franks said to his wife see that rose keeps up stairs i want to speak to her was her ladyships answer and she moved to the door evan made way for her bowing you will be ready at half past eleven louisa he said with calm distinctness and passed from that purgatory now honest andrew attributed the treatment evan met with to the exposure of yesterday he was frantic with democratic disgust why the devil dont they serve me like that eh cause i got a few coppers there van im a man of peace but if youll call any man of em out ill stand your secondpon my soul i will they must be cowards so there isnt much to fear confound the fellows i tell em every day im the son of a cobbler and egad they grow civiller what do they mean are cobblers ranked over tailors perhaps thats it said evan hang your gentlemen andrew cried let us have breakfast first uttered a melancholy voice near them in the passage jack said evan where have you been i didnt know the breakfast room jack returned and the fact is my spirits are so down i couldnt muster up courage to ask one of the footmen i delivered your letter nothing hostile took place i bowed fiercely to let him know what he might expect that generally stops it you see i talk prose i shall never talk anything else andrew recommenced his jests of yesterday with jack the latter bore them patiently as one who had endured worse she has rejected me he whispered to evan talk of the ingratitude of women ten minutes ago i met her she perked her eyebrows at metried to run away miss wheedle i said if you please id rather not says she to cut it short the sacrifice i made to her was the cause its all over the house she gave the most excruciating hint those low born females are so horribly indelicate i stood confounded commending his new humour evan persuaded him to breakfast immediately and hunger being one of jacks solitary incitements to a sensible course of conduct the disconsolate gentleman followed its dictates go with him andrew said evan he is here as my friend and may be made uncomfortable yes yesha ha ill follow the poor chap said andrew but what is it all about louisa wont go you know has the girl given you up because she saw your mother van i thought it was all right why the deuce are you running away because ive just seen that i ought never to have come i suppose evan replied controlling the wretched heaving of his chest but louisa wont go van understand my dear andrew that i know it to be quite imperative be ready yourself with caroline louisa will then make her choice pray help me in this we must not stay a minute more than is necessary in this house its an awful duty breathed andrew after a pause i see nothing but hot water at home whybut its no use asking questions my love to your mother i say vannow isnt lady jocelyn a trump god bless her said evan and the moisture in andrews eyes affected his own shes the staunchest piece of woman goods i everi know a hundred cases of her i know one and thats enough said evan not a sign of rose can love die without its dear farewell on which it feeds away from the light dying by bits in evans heart love seemed to die and all the pangs of a death were there as he trod along the gravel and stepped beneath the gates of beckley court meantime the gallant countess was not in any way disposed to retreat on account of evans defection the behaviour toward him at the breakfast table proved to her that he had absolutely committed his egregious folly and as no general can have concert with a fool she cut him off from her affections resolutely her manifest disdain at his last speech said as much to everybody present besides the lady was in her element here and compulsion is required to make us relinquish our element lady jocelyn certainly had not expressly begged of her to remain the countess told melville so who said that if she required such an invitation she should have it but that a guest to whom they were so much indebted was bound to spare them these formalities what am i to do the countess turned piteously to the diplomatists wife she answered retiringly indeed i cannot say upon this the countess accepted melvilles arm and had some thoughts of punishing the woman they were seen parading the lawn mr george uplift chuckled singularly just the old style he remarked but corrected the inadvertence with a hem committing himself more shamefully the instant after ill wager she has the old dip down on his knee before she cuts bet cant be taken observed sir john loring it requires a spy harry however had heard the remark and because he wished to speak to her let us hope and reproach her for certain things when she chose to be disengaged he likewise sallied out being forlorn as a youth whose sweet vanity is much hurt the duke had paired off with mrs strike the lawn was fair in sunlight where they walked the air was rich with harvest smells and the scent of autumnal roses caroline was by nature luxurious and soft the thought of that drilled figure to which she was returning in bondage may have thrown into bright relief the polished and gracious nobleman who walked by her side shadowing forth the chances of a splendid freedom two lovely tears fell from her eyes the duke watched them quietly do you know they make me jealous he said caroline answered him with a faint smile reassure me my dear lady you are not going with your brother this morning your grace i have no choice may i speak to you as your warmest friend from what i hear it appears to be right that your brother should not stay to the best of my ability i will provide for him but i sincerely desire to disconnect you from those who are unworthy of you have you not promised to trust in me pray let me be your guide caroline replied to the heart of his words i dare not what has changed you i am not changed but awakened said caroline the duke paced on in silence pardon me if i comprehend nothing of such a change he resumed i asked you to sacrifice much all that i could give in return i offered is it the world you fear what is the world to such as i am can you consider it a duty to deliver yourself bound to that man again heaven pardon me my lord i think of that too little the dukes next question then what can it be stood in his eyes oh carolines touch quivered on his arm do not suppose me frivolous ungrateful oror cowardly for myself you have offered more happiness than i could have hoped for to be allied to one so generous i could bear anything yesterday you had my word give it me back to day very curiously the duke gazed on her for there was evidence of internal torture across her forehead i may at least beg to know the cause for this request she quelled some throbbing in her bosom yes he waited and she said there is oneif i offended him i could not live if now i followed my wishes he would lose his faith in the last creature that loves him he is unhappy i could bear what is called disgrace my lordi shudder to say iti could sin against heaven but i dare not do what would make him despise me she was trembling violently yet the nobleman in his surprise could not forbear from asking who this person might be whose influence on her righteous actions was so strong it is my brother my lord she said still more astonished your brother the duke exclaimed my dearest lady i would not wound you but is not this a delusion we are so placed that we must speak plainly your brother i have reason to feel sure is quite unworthy of you unworthy my brother evan oh he is noble he is the best of men and how between yesterday and to day has he changed you it is that yesterday i did not know him and to day i do her brother a common tradesman a man guilty of forgery and the utmost basenessall but kicked out of the house the duke was too delicate to press her further moreover caroline had emphasized the yesterday and to day showing that the interval which had darkened evan to everybody else had illumined him to her he employed some courtly eloquence better unrecorded but if her firm resolution perplexed him it threw a strange halo round the youth from whom it sprang the hour was now eleven and the countess thought it full time to retire to her entrenchment in mrs bonners chamber she had great things still to do vast designs were in her hand awaiting the sanction of providence alas that little idle promenade was soon to be repented she had joined her sister thinking it safer to have her upstairs till they were quit of evan the duke and the diplomatist loitering in the rear these two fair women sailed across the lawn conscious doubtless over all their sorrows and schemes of the freight of beauty they carried what meant that gathering on the steps it was fortuitous like everything destined to confound us there stood lady jocelyn with andrew fretting his pate harry leant against a pillar miss carrington mrs shorne and mrs melville supported by mr george uplift held watchfully by juliana with master alec and miss dorothy were in the background why did our general see herself cut off from her stronghold as by a hostile band she saw it by that sombre light in julianas eyes which had shown its ominous gleam whenever disasters were on the point of unfolding turning to caroline she said is there a back way too late andrew called come along louisa just time and no more carry are you packed this in reality was the first note of the retreat from beckley and having blown it the hideous little trumpeter burst into scarlet perspirations mumbling to lady jocelyn now my lady mind you stand by me the countess walked straight up to him dear andrew this sun is too powerful for you i beg you withdraw into the shade of the house she was about to help him with all her gentleness yes yes all right louisa rejoined andrew come go and pack the flyll be here you knowtoo late for the coach if you dont mind my lass aint you packed yet the horrible fascination of vulgarity impelled the wretched lady to answer are we herrings and then she laughed but without any accompaniment i am now going to dear mrs bonner she said with a tender glance at lady jocelyn my mother is sleeping her ladyship remarked come carry my darling cried andrew caroline looked at her sister the countess divined andrews shameful trap i was under an engagement to go and canvass this afternoon she said why my dear louisa weve settled that in here this morning said andrew old tom only stuck up a puppet to play with weve knocked him over and march in victoriouseh my lady oh exclaimed the countess if mr raikes shall indeed have listened to my inducements deuce a bit of inducements returned andrew the fellows ashamed of himselfha ha now then louisa while they talked juliana had loosed dorothy and alec and these imps were seen rehearsing a remarkable play in which the damsel held forth a hand and the cavalier advanced and kissed it with a loud smack being at the same time reproached for his lack of grace you are so english cried dorothy with perfect languor and a malicious twitter passed between two or three mr george spluttered indiscreetly the countess observed the performance not to convert the retreat into a total rout she with that dark flush which was her manner of blushing took formal leave of lady jocelyn who in return simply said good bye countess mrs strikes hand she kindly shook the few digs and slaps and thrusts at gloomy harry and prim miss carrington and boorish mr george wherewith the countess torn with wrath thought it necessary to cover her retreat need not be told she struck the weak alone juliana she respected masterly tactics for they showed her power gratified her vengeance and left her unassailed on the road she had andrew to tear to pieces o delicious operation and o shameful brother to reduce her to such joys and o providence may a poor desperate soul betrayed through her devotion unremunerated for her humiliation and absolute hard work accuse thee the countess would have liked to she felt it to be the instigation of the devil and decided to remain on the safe side still happily for evan she was not ready with her packing by half past eleven it was near twelve when he pacing in front of the inn observed polly wheedle followed some yards in the rear by john raikes advancing towards him now polly had been somewhat delayed by jacks persecutions and evan declining to attend to the masked speech of her mission which directed him to go at once down a certain lane in the neighbourhood of the park some minutes were lost why mr harrington said polly its miss rose shes had leave from her ma can you stop away when its quite proper evan hesitated before he could conquer the dark spirit lo rose appeared walking up the village street polly and her adorer fell back timidly unlike herself rose neared him i have offended you evan you would not come to me i have come to you i am glad to be able to say good bye to you rose was his pretty response could she have touched his hand then the blood of these lovers rushing to one channel must have made all clear at least he could hardly have struck her true heart with his miserable lie but that chance was lost they were in the street where passions have no play tell me evanit is not true he refining on his misery thought she would not ask it if she trusted me and answered her you have heard it from your mother rose but i will not believe it from any lips but yours evan oh speak speak it pleased him to think how could one who loved me believe it even then he said it can scarcely do good to make me repeat it rose and then seeing her dear bosom heave quickly he was tempted to fall on his knees to her with a wild outcry of love the chance was lost the inexorable street forbade it there they stood in silence gasping at the barrier that divided them suddenly a noise was heard stop stop cried the voice of john raikes when a lady and gentleman are talking together sir do you lean your long ears over themha looking round evan beheld laxley a step behind and jack rushing up to him seizing his collar and instantly undergoing ignominious prostration for his heroic defence of the privacy of lovers stand aside said laxley imperiously rosey so youve come for me take my arm you are under my protection another forlorn is it true rose cast toward evan with her eyes he wavered under them did you receive my letter he demanded of laxley i decline to hold converse with you said laxley drawing roses hand on his arm you will meet me to day or to morrow i am in the habit of selecting my own company rose disengaged her hand evan grasped it no word of farewell was uttered her mouth moved but her eyes were hard shut and nothing save her hands strenuous pressure equalling his own told that their parting had been spoken the link violently snapped mr john raikes had been picked up and pulled away by polly she now rushed to evan good bye and god bless you dear mr harrington ill find means of letting you know how she is and he shant have her mind rose was walking by laxleys side but not leaning on his arm evan blessed her for this ere she was out of sight the fly rolled down the street she did not heed it did not once turn her head ah bitter unkindness when love is hurt it is self love that requires the opiate conning gave it him in the form of a note in a handwriting not known to him it said i do not believe it and nothing will ever make me juliana evan could not forget these words they coloured his farewell to beckley the dear old downs the hopgardens the long grey farms walled with clipped yew the home of his lost love he thought of them through weary nights when the ghostly image with the hard shut eyelids and the quivering lips would rise and sway irresolutely in air till a shape out of the darkness extinguished it pride is the god of pagans juliana had honoured his god the spirit of juliana seemed to pass into the body of rose and suffer for him as that ghostly image visibly suffered chapter xxxviii in which we have to see in the dark so ends the fourth act of our comedy after all her heroism and extraordinary efforts after as she feared offending providenceafter facing tailordomthe countess was rolled away in a dingy fly unrewarded even by a penny for what she had gone through for she possessed eminently the practical nature of her sex and though she would have scorned and would have declined to handle coin so base its absence was upbraidingly mentioned in her spiritual outcries not a penny nor was there as in the miseries of retreat she affected indifferently to imagine a duke fished out of the ruins of her enterprise to wash the mud off her garments and edge them with radiance caroline it became clear to her had been infected by evans folly caroline she subsequently learnt had likewise been a fool instead of marvelling at the genius that had done so much in spite of the pair of fools that were the right and left wing of her battle array the simple minded lady wept she wanted success not genius admiration she was ever ready to forfeit for success nor did she say to the tailors of earth weep for i sought to emancipate you from opprobrium by making one of you a gentleman i fought for a great principle and have failed heroic to the end she herself shed all the tears took all the sorrow where was consolation would any protestant clergyman administer comfort to her could he might he do so he might listen and quote texts but he would demand the harsh rude english for everything and the countesss confessional thoughts were all innuendoish aerial too delicate to live in our shameless tongue confession by implication and absolution she could know this to be what she wished for and yet not think it she could see a haven of peace in that picture of the little brown box with the sleekly reverend figure bending his ear to the kneeling beauty outside thrice ravishing as she half lifts the veil of her sins and her visageyet she started alarmed to hear it whispered that the fair penitent was the countess de saldar urgently she prayed that no disgraceful brother might ever drive her to that never let it be a catholic priestshe almost fashioned her petition into words who was to save her alas alas in her dire distressin her sense of miserable pennilessness she clung to mr john raikes of the curricle the mysteriously rich young gentleman and on that picture with andrew roguishly contemplating it and evan with feelings regarding his sister that he liked not to own the curtain commiseratingly drops as in the course of a stream you come upon certain dips where but here and there a sparkle or a gloom of the full flowing water is caught through deepening foliage so the history that concerns us wanders out of day for a time and we must violate the post and open written leaves to mark the turn it takes first we have a letter from mr goren to mrs mel to inform her that her son has arrived and paid his respects to his future instructor in the branch of science practised by mr goren he has arrived at last says the worthy tradesman his appearance in the shop will be highly gentlemanly and when he looks a little more pleasing and grows fond of it nothing will be left to be desired the ladies his sisters have not thought proper to call i had hopes of the custom of mr andrew cogglesby of course you wish him to learn tailoring thoroughly mrs mel writes back thanking mr goren and saying that she had shown the letter to inquiring creditors and that she does wish her son to learn his business from the root this produces a second letter from mr goren which imparts to her that at the root of the tree of tailoring the novitiate must sit no less than six hours a day with his legs crossed and doubled under him cheerfully plying needle and thread and that without this probation to undergo which the son resolutely objects all hope of his climbing to the top of the lofty tree and viewing mankind from an eminence must be surrendered if you do not insist my dear mrs harrington i tell you candidly your son may have a shop but he will be no tailor mrs mel understands her son and his state of mind well enough not to insist and is resigned to the melancholy consequence then mr goren discovers an extraordinary resemblance between evan and his father remarking merely that the youth is not the gentleman his father was in a shop while he admits that had it been conjoined to business habits he should have envied his departed friend he has soon something fresh to tell and it is that young mr harrington is treating him cavalierly that he should penetrate the idea or appreciate the merits of mr gorens balance was hardly to be expected at present the world did not and mr goren blamed no young man for his ignorance still a proper attendance was requisite mr goren thought it very singular that young mr harrington should demand all the hours of the day for his own purposes up to half past four he found it difficult to speak to him as a master and begged that mrs harrington would as a mother the reply of mrs mel is dashed with a trifle of cajolery she has heard from her son and seeing that her son takes all that time from his right studies to earn money wherewith to pay debts of which mr goren is cognizant she trusts that their oldest friend will overlook it mr goren rejoins that he considers that he need not have been excluded from young mr harringtons confidence moreover it is a grief to him that the young gentleman should refrain from accepting any of his suggestions as to the propriety of requesting some at least of his rich and titled acquaintance to confer on him the favour of their patronage which they would not repent adds mr goren and might learn to be very much obliged to him for in return for kindnesses extended to him notwithstanding all my efforts you see the poor boy is thrust into the shop there he is without a doubt he sleeps under mr gorens roof he since one cannot be too positive in citing the punishment of such a pagan stands behind a counter he and oh choke young loves that have hovered around him shrink from him in natural horror gentle ladies handles the shears it is not my fault he would be a pagan if you can think him human enough still to care to know how he feels it i must tell you that he feels it hardly at all after a big blow a very little one scarcely counts what are outward forms and social ignominies to him whose heart has been struck to the dust his gods have fought for him and there he is he deserves no pity but he does not ask it of you the callous pagan despise him if you please and rank with the countess who despises him most heartily dipping further into the secrets of the post we discover a brisk correspondence between juliana bonner and mrs strike a thousand thanks to you my dear miss bonner writes the latter lady the unaffected interest you take in my brother touches me deeply i know him to be worthy of your good opinion yes i will open my heart to you dearest juliana and it shall as you wish be quite secret between us not to a soul he is quite alone my sisters harriet and louisa will not see him and i can only do so by stealth his odd other little friend sometimes drives me out on sundays to a place where i meet him and the duke of belfield kindly lends me his carriage oh that we might never part i am only happy with him ah do not doubt him juliana for anything he does you say that now the duke has obtained for him the secretaryship to my husbands company he should not stoop to that other thing and you do not understand why i will tell you our poor father died in debt and evan receives money which enables him by degrees to liquidate these debts on condition that he consents to be what i dislike as much as you can he bears it you can have no idea of his pride he is too proud to own to himself that it debases himtoo proud to complain it is a tanglea net that drags him down to it but whatever he is outwardly he is the noblest human being in the world to me and but for him oh what should i be let me beg you to forgive it if you can my darling has no friends is his temper as sweet as ever i can answer that yes only he is silent and lookswhen you look into his eyescolder as men look when they will not bear much from other men he has not mentioned her name i am sure she has not written pity him and pray for him juliana then makes a communication which draws forth the following mistress of all the beckley propertydearest dearest juliana oh how sincerely i congratulate you the black on the letter alarmed me so i could hardly open it my fingers trembled so for i esteem you all at beckley but when i had opened and read it i was recompensed you say you are sorry for rose but surely what your grandmama has done is quite right it is just in every sense but why am i not to tell evan i am certain it would make him very happy and happiness of any kind he needs so much i will obey you of course but i cannot see why do you know my dear child you are extremely mysterious and puzzle me evan takes a pleasure in speaking of you you and lady jocelyn are his great themes why is he to be kept ignorant of your good fortune the spitting of blood is bad you must winter in a warm climate i do think that london is far better for you in the late autumn than hampshire may i ask my sister harriet to invite you to reside with her for some weeks nothing i know would give her greater pleasure juliana answers this if you love mei sometimes hope that you dobut the feeling of being loved is so strange to me that i can only believe it at timesbut carolinethere i have mustered up courage to call you by your christian name at lastoh dear caroline if you do love me do not tell mr harrington i go on my knees to you to beg you not to tell him a word i have no reasons indeed not any but i implore you again never even to hint that i am anything but the person he knew at beckley rose has gone to elburne house where ferdinand her friend is to meet her she rides and sings the same and keeps all her colour she may not as you imagine have much sensibility perhaps not enough i am afraid that rose is turning into a very worldly woman as to what you kindly say about inviting me to london i should like it and i am my own mistress do you know i think i am older than your brother i am twenty three pray when you write tell me if he is older than that but should i not be a dreadful burden to you sometimes i have to keep to my chamber whole days and days when that happens now i think of you entirely see how i open my heart to you you say that you do to me i wish i could really think it a postscript begs caroline not to forget about the ages in this fashion the two ladies open their hearts and contrive to read one another perfectly in their mutual hypocrisies some letters bearing the signatures of mr john raikes and miss polly wheedle likewise pass polly inquires for detailed accounts of the health and doings of mr harrington jack replies with full particulars of her own proceedings and mild corrections of her grammar it is to be noted that polly grows much humbler to him on paper which being instantly perceived by the mercurial one his caressing condescension to her is very beautiful she is taunted with mr nicholas frim and answers after the lapse of a week that the aforesaid can be nothing to her as he went in a passion to church last sunday and got married it appears that they had quarrelled because i danced with you that night to this mr raikes rejoins in a style that would be signified by ahem in language and an arrangement of the shirt collar before the looking glass in action chapter xxxix in the domain of tailordom there was peace in mr gorens shop badgered ministers bankrupt merchants diplomatists with a headacheany of our modern grandees under difficulties might have envied that peace over which mr goren presided and he was an enviable man he loved his craft he believed that he had not succeeded the millions of antecedent tailors in vain and excepting that trifling coquetry with shirt fronts viz the red crosses which a shrewd rival had very soon eclipsed by representing nymphs triangularly posed he devoted himself to his business from morning to night as rigid in demanding respect from those beneath him as he was profuse in lavishing it on his patrons his public boast was that he owed no man a farthing his secret comfort that he possessed two thousand pounds in the funds but mr goren did not stop here behind these external characteristics he nursed a passion evan was astonished and pleased to find in him an enthusiastic fern collector not that mr harrington shared the passion but the sight of these brown roots spread out ticketed on the stained paper after supper when the shutters were up and the house defended from the hostile outer world the old man poring over them and naming this and that spot where during his solitary saturday afternoon and sunday excursions he had lighted on the rare samples exhibited this contrast of the quiet evening with the sordid day humanized mr goren to him he began to see a spirit in the rigid tradesman not so utterly dissimilar to his own and he fancied that he too had a taste for ferns round beckley how they abounded he told mr goren so and mr goren said some day well jog down there together as the saying goes mr goren spoke of it as an ordinary event likely to happen in the days to come not as an incident the mere mention of which as being probable stopped the breath and made the pulses leap for now evans education taught him to feel that he was at his lowest degree never now could rose stoop to him he carried the shop on his back she saw the brand of it on his forehead well and what was rose to him beyond a blissful memory a star that he had once touched self love kept him strong by day but in the darkness of night came his misery wakening from tender dreams he would find his heart sinking under a horrible pressure and then the fair fresh face of rose swam over him the hours of beckley were revived with intolerable anguish he saw that she was blamelessthat he alone was to blame yet worse was it when his closed eyelids refused to conjure up the sorrowful lovely nightmare and he lay like one in a trance entombedwretched pagan feeling all that had been blindly when the past lay beside him like a corpse that he had slain these nightly torments helped him to brave what the morning brought insensibly also as time hardened his sufferings evan asked himself what the shame of his position consisted in he grew stiff necked his pagan virtues stood up one by one to support him andrew courageously evading the interdict that forbade him to visit evan would meet him by appointment at city taverns and flatly offered him a place in the brewery evan declined it on the pretext that having received old toms money for the year he must at least work out that term according to the conditions andrew fumed and sneered at tailordom evan said that there was peace in mr gorens shop his sharp senses discerned in andrews sneer a certain sincerity and he revolted against it mr john raikes too burlesqued society so well that he had the satisfaction of laughing at his enemy occasionally the latter gentleman was still a pensioner flying about town with the countess de saldar in deadly fear lest that fascinating lady should discover the seat of his fortune happy notwithstanding in the mirror of evans little world he beheld the great one from which he was banished now the dusk of a winters afternoon was closing over london when a carriage drew up in front of mr gorens shop out of which to mr gorens chagrin a lady stepped with her veil down the lady entered and said that she wished to speak to mr harrington mr goren made way for her to his pupil and was amazed to see her fall into his arms and hardly gratified to hear her say pardon me darling for coming to you in this place evan asked permission to occupy the parlour my place said mr goren with humble severity over his spectacles is very poor such as it is it is at the ladys service alone with her evan was about to ease his own feelings by remarking to the effect that mr goren was human like the rest of us but caroline cried with unwonted vivacity yes yes i know but i thought only of you i have such news for you you will and must pardon my comingthats my first thought sensitive darling that you are she kissed him fondly juliana bonner is in town staying with us is that your news asked evan pressing her against his breast no dear lovebut still you have no idea what her fortunemrs bonner has died and left herbut i mustnt tell you oh my darling how she admires you sheshe could recompense you if you would we will put that by for the present dear the duke has begged you through me to accepti think its to be a sort of bailiff to his estatesi dont know rightly its a very honourable post that gentlemen take and the income you are to have evan will be near a thousand a year now what do i deserve for my news she put up her mouth for another kiss out of breath true looked evans eyes true she said smiling and feasting on his bewilderment after the bubbling in his brain had a little subsided evan breathed as a man on whom fresh air is blown were not these tidings of release his ridiculous pride must nevertheless inquire whether caroline had been begging this for him no dearindeed caroline asserted with more than natural vehemence its something that you yourself have done that has pleased him i dont know what only he says he believes you are a man to be trusted with the keys of anythingand so you are you are to call on him to morrow will you while evan was replying her face became white she had heard the majors voice in the shop his military step advanced and caroline exclaiming dont let me see him bustled to a door evan nodded and she slipped through the next moment he was facing the stiff marine well young man the major commenced and seating himself added be seated i want to talk to you seriously sir you didnt think fit to wait till i had done with the directors today youre devilishly out in your discipline whatever you are at two and two i suppose theres no fear of being intruded on here none of your acquaintances likely to be introducing themselves to me there is not one that i would introduce to you said evan the major nodded a brief recognition of the compliment and then throwing his back against the chair fired out come sir is this your doing in military phrase evan now changed front his first thought had been that the major had come for his wife he perceived that he himself was the special object of his visitation i must ask you what you allude to he answered you are not at your office but you will speak to me as if there was some distinction between us said the major my having married your sister does not reduce me to the ranks i hope the major drummed his knuckles on the table after this impressive delivery hem he resumed now sir understand before you speak a word that i can see through any number of infernal lies i see that youre prepared for prevarication by george it shall come out of you if i get it by main force the duke compelled me to give you that appointment in my company now sir did you or did you not go to him and deliberately state to him that you believed the affairs of the company to be in a bad conditioninfamously handled likely to involve his honour as a gentleman i ask you sir did you do this or did you not do it evan waited till the sharp rattle of the majors close had quieted if i am to answer the wording of your statement i may say that i did not very good very good that will do are you aware that the duke has sent in his resignation as a director of our company i hear of it first from you confound your familiarity cried the irritable officer rising am i always to be told that i married your sister address me sir as becomes your duty evan heard the words beggarly tailor mumbled out of the gutters and cursed connection he stood in the attitude of attention while the major continued now young man listen to these facts you came to me this day last week and complained that you did not comprehend some of our transactions and affairs i explained them to your damned stupidity you went away three days after that you had an interview with the duke stop sir what the devil do you mean by daring to speak while i am speaking you saw the duke i say now what took place at that interview the major tried to tower over evan powerfully as he put this query they were of a common height and to do so he had to rise on his toes so that the effect was but momentary i think i am not bound to reply said evan very well sir that will do the majors fingers were evidently itching for an absent rattan confess it or not you are dismissed from your post do you hear you are kicked in the street a beggarly tailor you were born and a beggarly tailor you will die i must beg you to stop now said evan i told you that i was not bound to reply but i will if you will sit down major strike you shall hear what you wish to know this being presently complied with though not before a glare of the majors eyes had shown his doubt whether it might not be construed into insolence evan pursued i came to you and informed you that i could not reconcile the cash accounts of the company and that certain of the later proceedings appeared to me to jeopardize its prosperity your explanations did not satisfy me i admit that you enjoined me to be silent but the duke as a director had as strong a right to claim me as his servant and when he questioned me as to the position of the company i told him what i thought just as i had told you you told him we were jobbers and swindlers sir the duke inquired of me whether i would under the circumstances while proceedings were going on which i did not approve of take the responsibility of allowing my name to remain ha ha ha the major burst out this was too good a joke the name of a miserable young tailor go on sir go on he swallowed his laughter like oil on his rage i have said sufficient jumping up the major swore by the lord that he had said sufficient now look you here young man he squared his finger before evan eyeing him under a hard frown you have been playing your game again as you did down at that place in hampshire i heard of itdeserved to be shot by heaven you think you have got hold of the duke and you throw me over you imagine i dare say that i will allow my wife to be talked about to further your interestsyou self seeking young dog as long as he lent the company his name i permitted a great many things do you think me a blind idiot sir but now she must learn to be satisfied with people whove got no titles or carriages and who cant give hundred guinea compliments youre all of a piecea set of the major paused for half a word was on his mouth which had drawn lightning to evans eyes not to be baffled he added but look you sir i may be ruined i dare say the company will go to the dogsevery ass will follow a duke but mark this goes on no more i will be no womans tally mind sir i take excellent care that you dont traffic in your sister the major delivered this culminating remark with a well timed deflection of his forefinger and slightly turned aside when he had done you might have seen evans figure rocking as he stood with his eyes steadily levelled on his sisters husband the major who whatever he was was physically no coward did not fail to interpret the look and challenge it evan walked to the door opened it and said between his teeth you must go at once eh sir eh whats this exclaimed the warrior but the door was open mr goren was in the shop the scandal of an assault in such a house and the consequent possibility of his matrimonial alliance becoming bruited in the newspapers held his arm after it had given an involuntary jerk he marched through with becoming dignity and marched out into the street and if necks unelastic and heads erect may be taken as the sign of a proud soul and of nobility of mind my artist has the major for his model evan displayed no such a presence he returned to the little parlour shut and locked the door to the shop and forgetting that one was near sat down covered his eyes and gave way to a fit of tearless sobbing with one foot in the room caroline hung watching him a pain that she had never known wrung her nerves his whole manhood seemed to be shaken as if by regular pulsations of intensest misery she stood in awe of the sight till her limbs failed her and then staggering to him she fell on her knees clasping his passionately kissing them chapter xl in which the countess still scents game mr raikes and his friend frank remand surnamed franko to suit the requirements of metre in which they habitually conversed were walking arm in arm along the drive in societys park on a fine frosty sunday afternoon of midwinter the quips and jokes of franko were lively and he looked into the carriages passing as if he knew that a cheerful countenance is not without charms for their inmates raikes face on the contrary was barren and bleak being of that nature that when a pun was made he must perforce outstrip it he fell into frankos humour from time to time but albeit aware that what he uttered was good and by comparison transcendent he refused to enjoy it nor when franko started from his arm to declaim a passage did he do other than make limp efforts to unite himself to franko again a further sign of immense depression in him was that instead of the creative it was the critical faculty he exercised and rather than reply to franko in his form of speech he scanned occasional lines and objected to particular phrases he had clearly exchanged the sanguine for the bilious temperament and was fast stranding on the rocky shores of prose franko bore this very well for he like raikes in happier days claimed all the glances of lovely woman as his own and on his right there flowed a stream of beauties at last he was compelled to observe this change is sudden wherefore so downcast with tigrine claw thou mangiest my speech thy cheeks are like decembers pippin and thy tongue most sour then of it make a farce said raikes for the making of farces was frankos profession wherefore so downcast what a line there lets walk on let us the left foot forward stout advance i care not for the herd tis love cried franko ay an it be jack gloomily returned for ever cruel is the sweet saldar raikes winced at this name a truce to banter franko he said sternly but the subject was opened and the wound love he pursued mildly groaning suppose you adored a fascinating woman and she knewpositively knewyour manly weakness and you saw her smiling upon everybody and she told you to be happy and egad when you came to reflect you found that after three months suit you were nothing better than her errand boy a thing to boast of is it not quotha loves yellow fever jealousy methinks franko commenced in reply but raikes spat at the emphasized word jealousywhos jealous of clergymen and that crew not i by pluto i carried five messages to one fellow with a coat tail straight to his heels last week she thought i should drive my curriclei couldnt afford an omnibus i had to run when i returned to her i was dirty she made remarks thy sufferings are severebut such is woman said franko gad its a good idea though he took out a note book and pencilled down a point or two raikes watched the process sardonically my tragedy is then thy farce he exclaimed well be it so i believe i shall come to song writing again myself shortlybeneath the shield of catnach ill a nations ballads frame ive spent my income in four months and now im living on my curricle i underlet it its like tradeits as bad as poor old harrington by jove but that isnt the worst franko jack dropped his voice i believe im furiously loved by a poor country wench morals was frankos most encouraging reproof oh i dont think ive even kissed her rejoined raikes who doubted because his imagination was vivid its my intellect that dazzles her ive got lettersshe calls me clever by jove since i gave up driving ive had thoughts of rushing down to her and making her mine in spite of home family fortune friends name positioneverything i have indeed franko looked naturally astonished at this amount of self sacrifice the countess he shrewdly suggested id rather be my pollys prince than yon great ladys errand boy raikes burst into song he stretched out his hand as if to discard all the great ladies who were passing by the strangest misfortune ever known the direction taken by his fingers was toward a carriage wherein beautifully smiling opposite an elaborately reverend gentleman of middle age the countess de saldar was sitting this great lady is not to be blamed for deeming that her errand boy was pointing her out vulgarly on a public promenade ineffable disdain curled off her sweet olive visage she turned her head ill go down to that girl to night said raikes with compressed passion and then he hurried franko along to the bridge where behold the countess alighted with the gentleman and walked beside him into the gardens follow her said raikes in agitation do you see her by yon long tailed ravens side follow her franko see if he kisses her handanything and meet me here in half an hour ill have evidence franko did not altogether like the office but raikes dinners singular luck and superiority in the encounter of puns gave him the upper hand with his friend and so franko went turning away from the last glimpse of his countess raikes crossed the bridge and had not strolled far beneath the bare branches of one of the long green walks when he perceived a gentleman with two ladies leaning on him now there moralized this youth now what do you say to that do you call that fair he cant be happy and its not in nature for them to be satisfied and yet if i went up and attempted to please them all by taking one away the probabilities are that he would knock me down such is life we wont be made comfortable nevertheless he passed them with indifference for it was merely the principle he objected to and indeed he was so wrapped in his own conceptions that his name had to be called behind him twice before he recognized evan harrington mrs strike and miss bonner the arrangement he had previously thought good was then spontaneously adopted mrs strike reposed her fair hand upon his arm and juliana with a timid glance of pleasure walked ahead in evans charge close neighbourhood between the couples was not kept the genius of mr raikes was wasted in manoeuvres to lead his beautiful companion into places where he could be seen with her and envied it was perhaps more flattering that she should betray a marked disposition to prefer solitude in his society but this idea illumined him only near the moment of parting then he saw it then he groaned in soul and besought evan to have one more promenade saying with characteristic cleverness in the masking of his real thoughts it gives us an appetite you know in evans face and julianas there was not much sign that any protraction of their walk together would aid this beneficent process of nature he took her hand gently and when he quitted it it dropped the rose the rose of beckley court raikes sang aloud why this is a day of meetings behold john thomas in the reara tower of plush and powder shall i rushshall i pluck her from the aged stem on the gravel walk above them rose passed with her aristocratic grandmother muffled in furs she marched deliberately looking coldly before her evans face was white and juliana whose eyes were fixed on him shuddered im chilled she murmured to caroline let us go caroline eyed evan with a meaning sadness we will hurry to our carriage she said they were seen to make a little circuit so as not to approach rose after whom thoughtless of his cruelty evan bent his steps slowly halting when she reached her carriage he believedrather he knew that she had seen him there was a consciousness in the composed outlines of her face as she passed the indifference was too perfect let her hate him if she pleased it recompensed him that the air she wore should make her appearance more womanly and that black dress and crape bonnet in some way touched him to mournful thoughts of her that helped a partial forgetfulness of wounded self rose had driven off he was looking at the same spot where carolines hand waved from her carriage juliana was not seen caroline requested her to nod to him once but she would not she leaned back hiding her eyes and moving a petulant shoulder at carolines hand has he offended you my child juliana answered harshly no no the wheels rolled on and caroline tried other subjects knowing possibly that they would lead juliana back to this of her own accord you saw how she treated him the latter presently said without moving her hand from before her eyes yes dear he forgives her and will forget it oh she clenched her long thin hand i pray that i may not die before i have made her repent it she shall juliana looked glitteringly in carolines face and then fell a weeping and suffered herself to be folded and caressed the storm was long subsiding dearest you are better now said caroline she whispered yes my brother has only to know you dear hush thats past juliana stopped her and on a deep breath that threatened to break to sobs she added in a sweeter voice than was common to her ah whywhy did you tell him about the beckley property caroline vainly strove to deny that she had told him julianas head shook mournfully at her and now caroline knew what juliana meant when she begged so earnestly that evan should be kept ignorant of her change of fortune some days after this the cold struck julianas chest and she sickened the three sisters held a sitting to consider what it was best to do with her caroline proposed to take her to beckley without delay harriet was of opinion that the least they could do was to write to her relatives and make them instantly aware of her condition but the countess said no to both her argument was that juliana being independent they were by no means bound to bundle her in her state back to a place where she had been so shamefully maltreated that here she would live while there she would certainly die that absence of excitement was her medicine and that here she had it mrs andrew feeling herself responsible as the young ladys hostess did not acquiesce in the countesss views till she had consulted juliana and then apologies for giving trouble were breathed on the one hand sympathy condolences and professions of esteem on the other juliana said she was but slightly ill would soon recover entreated not to leave them before she was thoroughly re established and to consent to be looked on as one of the family she sighed and said it was the utmost she could hope of course the ladies took this compliment to themselves but evan began to wax in importance the countess thought it nearly time to acknowledge him and supported the idea by a citation of the doctrine that to forgive is christian it happened however that harriet who had less art and more will than her sisters was inflexible she living in a society but a few steps above tailordom however magnificent in expenditure and resources abhorred it solemnly from motives of prudence as well as personal disgust she continued firm in declining to receive her brother she would not relent when the countess pointed out a dim a dazzling prospect growing out of evans proximity to the heiress of beckley court she was not to be moved when caroline suggested that the specific for the frail invalid was evans presence as to this juliana was sufficiently open though as she conceived her art was extreme do you know why i stay to vex and trouble you she asked caroline well then it is that i may see your brother united to you all and then i shall go happy the pretext served also to make him the subject of many conversations twice a week a bunch of the best flowers that could be got were sorted and arranged by her and sent namelessly to brighten evans chamber i may do such a thing as this you know without incurring blame she said the sight of a love so humble in its strength and affluence sent caroline to evan on a fruitless errand what availed it that accused of giving lead to his pride in refusing the heiress evan should declare that he did not love her he did not caroline admitted as possible but he might he might learn to love her and therefore he was wrong in wounding her heart she related flattering anecdotes she drew tearful pictures of julianas love for him and noticing how he seemed to prize his bouquet of flowers said do you love them for themselves or the hand that sent them evan blushed for it had been a struggle for him to receive them as he thought from rose in secret the flowers lost their value the song that had arisen out of them thou livest in my memory ceased but they came still how many degrees from love gratitude may be i have not reckoned i rather fear it lies on the opposite shore from a youth to a girl it may yet be very tender the more so because their ages commonly exclude such a sentiment and nature seems willing to make a transition stage of it evan wrote to juliana incidentally he expressed a wish to see her juliana was under doctors interdict but she was not to be prevented from going when evan wished her to go they met in the park as before and he talked to her five minutes through the carriage window was it worth the risk my poor child said caroline pityingly juliana cried oh i would give anything to live a man might have thought that she made no direct answer dont you think i am patient dont you think i am very patient she asked caroline winningly on their way home caroline could scarcely forbear from smiling at the feverish anxiety she showed for a reply that should confirm her words and hopes so we must all be she said and that common place remark caused juliana to exclaim prisoners have lived in a dungeon on bread and water for years whereat caroline kissed her so tenderly that juliana tried to look surprised and failing her thin lips quivered she breathed a soft hush and fell on carolines bosom she was transparent enough in one thing but the flame which burned within her did not light her through others on other matters were quite as transparent to her caroline never knew that she had as much as told her the moral suicide evan had committed at beckley so cunningly had she been probed at intervals with little casual questions random interjections that one who loved him could not fail to meet petty doubts requiring elucidations and the countess kind as her sentiments had grown toward the afflicted creature was compelled to proclaim her densely stupid in material affairs for the countess had an itch of the simplest feminine curiosity to know whether the dear child had any notion of accomplishing a certain holy duty of the perishable on this earth who might possess worldly goods and no hintsnot even plain speaking would do juliana did not understand her at all the countess exhibited a mourning ring on her finger mrs bonners bequest to her how fervent is my gratitude to my excellent departed friend for this a legacy however trifling embalms our dear lost ones in the memory it was of no avail juliana continued densely stupid was she not worse the countess could not in decency as she observed reveal to her who had prompted mrs bonner so to bequeath the beckley estates as to ensure sweet julianas future but ought not juliana to divine itjuliana at least had hints sufficient cold spring winds were now blowing juliana had resided no less than two months with the cogglesbys she was entreated still to remain and she did from lady jocelyn she heard not a word of remonstrance but from miss carrington and mrs shorne she received admonishing letters finally mr harry jocelyn presented himself in london and without any of that needful subsistence which a young gentleman feels the want of in london more than elsewhere harry began to have thoughts of his own without any instigation from his aunts about devoting himself to business so he sent his card up to his cousin and was graciously met in the drawing room by the countess who ruffled him and smoothed him and would possibly have distracted his soul from business had his circumstances been less straitened juliana was declared to be too unwell to see him that day he called a second time and enjoyed a similar greeting his third visit procured him an audience alone with juliana when at once despite the warnings of his aunts the frank fellow plunged medias res mrs bonner had left him totally dependent on his parents and his chances a desperate state of things isnt it juley i think i shall go for a soldiercommon you know instead of shrieking out against such a debasement of his worth and gentility as was to be expected juliana said thats what mr harrington thought of doing he if hed had the pluck he would his duty forbade it and he did not duty a confounded tailor what fools we were to have him at beckley has the countess been unkind to you harry i havent seen her to day and dont want to its my little dear old juley i came for dear harry she thanked him with eyes and hands come often wont you why aint you coming back to us juley not yet they are very kind to me here how is rose oh quite jolly she and ferdinand are thick again balls every night she dances like the deuce they want me to go but i aint the sort of figure for those places and besides i shant dance till i can lead you out a spur of laughter at harrys generous nod brought on julianas cough harry watched her little body shaken and her reddened eyes some real emotionperhaps the fear which healthy young people experience at the sight of deadly diseasemade harry touch her arm with the softness of a childs touch dont be alarmed harry she said its nothingonly winter im determined to get well thats right quoth he recovering i know youve got pluck or you wouldnt have stood that operation let me see when was that she asked slyly harry coloured for it related to a time when he had not behaved prettily to her there juley thats all forgotten i was a foola scoundrel if you like im sorry for it now do you want money harry oh money have you repaid mr harrington yet thereno i havent bother it that fellows names always on your tongue ill tell you what juleybut its no use hes a low vulgar adventurer dear harry said juliana softly dont bring your aunts with you when you come to see me well then ill tell you juley its enough that hes a beastly tailor quite enough she responded and he is neither a fool nor a scoundrel harrys memory for his own speech was not quick when julianas calm glance at him called it up he jumped from his chair crying upon my honour ill tell you what juley if i had money to pay him to morrow id insult him on the spot juliana meditated and said then all your friends must wish you to continue poor this girl had once been on her knees to him she had looked up to him with admiring love and he had given her a crumb or so occasionally thinking her something of a fool and more of a pest but now he could not say a word to her without being baffled in an elderly sisterly tone exasperating him so far that he positively wished to marry her and coming to the point offered himself with downright sincerity and was rejected harry left in a passion juliana confided the secret to caroline who suggested interested motives which juliana would not hear of ah said the countess when caroline mentioned the case to her of course the poor thing cherishes her first offer she would believe a curate to be disinterested but mind that evan has due warning when she is to meet him mind that he is dressed becomingly caroline asked why because my dear she is enamoured of his person these little unhealthy creatures are always attracted by the person she thinks it to be evans qualities i know better it is his person beckley court may be lost by a shabby coat the countess had recovered from certain spiritual languors into which she had fallen after her retreat ultimate victory hung still in the balance oh if evan would only marry this little sufferer who was so sure to die within a year or if she lived for marriage has often been as a resurrection to some poor female invalids there was beckley court a splendid basis for future achievements reflecting in this fashion the countess pardoned her brother glowing hopes hung fresh lamps in her charitable breast she stepped across the threshold of tailordom won mr gorens heart by her condescension and worked evan into a sorrowful mood concerning the invalid was not juliana his only active friend in return he said things which only required a little colouring to be very acceptable to her the game waxed exciting again the enemy the jocelyn party was alert but powerless the three sisters were almost wrought to perform a sacrifice far exceeding evans they nearly decided to summon him to the house but the matter being broached at table one evening major strike objected to it so angrily that they abandoned it with the satisfactory conclusion that if they did wrong it was the majors fault meantime juliana had much on her conscience she knew evan to be innocent and she allowed rose to think him guilty could she bring her heart to join them that was not in her power but desiring to be lulled by a compromise she devoted herself to make his relatives receive him and on days of bitter winds she would drive out to meet him answering all expostulations withi should not go if he were here the game waxed hot it became a question whether evan should be admitted to the house in spite of the major juliana now made an extraordinary move having the count with her in the carriage one day she stopped in front of mr gorens shop and evan had to come out the count returned home extremely mystified once more the unhappy countess was obliged to draw bills on the fabulous and as she had recommenced the system which was not without its fascinations to her juliana who had touched the spring had the full benefit of it the countess had deceived her beforewhat of that she spoke things sweet to hear who could be false that gave her heart food on which it lived one night juliana returned from her drive alarmingly ill she was watched through the night by caroline and the countess alternately in the morning the sisters met she has consented to let us send for a doctor said caroline her chief desire seems to be a lawyer said the countess yes but the doctor must be sent for first yes indeed but it behoves us to previse that the doctor does not kill her before the lawyer comes caroline looked at louisa and said are you ignorant nowhat cried the countess eagerly evan has written to tell lady jocelyn the state of her health and and that naturally has aggravated her malady the countess cramped her long fingers the child heard it from him yesterday oh i could swear at that brother she dropped into a chair and sat rigid and square jawed a sculpture of unutterable rage in the afternoon lady jocelyn arrived the doctor was therethe lawyer had gone without a word of protest juliana accompanied her ladyship to beckley court here was a blow but andrew was preparing one more mighty still what if the cogglesby brewery proved a basis most unsound where must they fall then alas on that point whence they sprang if not to perditiontailordom chapter xliv reveals an abominable plot of the brothers cogglesby a lively april day with strong gusts from the southwest and long sweeping clouds saluted the morning coach from london to lymport thither tailordom triumphant was bearing its victim at a rattling pace to settle him and seal him for ever out of the ranks of gentlemen society meantime howling exclusion to him in the background out of our halls degraded youth the smiles of turbaned matrons the sighs of delicate maids genial wit educated talk refined scandal vice in harness dinners sentineled by stately plush these the flavour of life are not for you though you stole a taste of them wretched impostor pay for it with years of remorse the coach went rushing against the glorious high wind it stirred his blood freshened his cheeks gave a bright tone of zest to his eyes as he cast them on the young green country not banished from the breath of heaven or from self respect or from the appetite for the rewards that are to follow duties done not banished from the help that is always reached to us when we have fairly taken the right road and that for him is the road to lymport let the kingdom of gilt gingerbread howl as it will we are no longer children but men men who have bitten hard at experience and know the value of a tooth who have had our hearts bruised and cover them with armour who live not to feed but look to food that we may live what matters it that yonder high spiced kingdom should excommunicate such as we are we have rubbed off the gilt and have assumed the command of our stomachs we are men from this day now you would have thought evans companions right and left of him were the wretches under sentence to judge from appearances in contrast with his look of insolent pleasure andrew the moment an eye was on him exhibited the cleverest impersonation of the dumps ever seen while mr raikes was from head to foot nothing better than a moan made visible nevertheless they both agreed to rally evan and bid him be of good cheer dont be down van dont be down my boy said andrew rubbing his hands gloomily i do i look it evan answered laughing capital acting exclaimed raikes try and keep it up well i hope youre acting too said evan raikes let his chest fall like a collapsing bellows at the end of five minutes he remarked ive been sitting on it the whole morning theres violent inflammation im persuaded another hour and i jump slap from the summit of the coach evan turned to andrew do you think hell be let off mr raikes cant say you see van it depends upon how old tom has taken his bad luck ahem perhaps hell be all the stricter and as a man of honour mr raikes you see cant very well by jove i wish i wasnt a man of honour raikes interposed heavily you see van old toms circumstancesandrew ducked to smother a sort of laughterare now such that hed be glad of the money to let him off no doubt but mr raikes has spent it i cant lend it and you havent got it and there we all are at the end of the year hes free and heha ha im not a bit the merrier for laughing i can tell you catching another glimpse of evans serious face andrew fell into louder laughter checking it with doleful solemnity up hill and down hill and past little homesteads shining with yellow crocuses across wide brown heaths whose outlines raised in evans mind the night of his funeral walk and tossed up old feelings dead as the whirling dust at last raikes called out the towers of fallowfield heigho and andrew said now then van if old toms anywhere hes here you get down at the dragon and dont you talk to me but let me go in itll be just the hour he dines in the country isnt it a shame of him to make me face every man of the creditorseh evan gave andrews hand an affectionate squeeze at which andrew had to gulp down somethingreciprocal emotion doubtless hark said raikes as the horn of the guard was heard once that sound used to set me caracoling before an abject multitude i did wonders all london looked on me it had more effect on me than champagne now i hear itthe whole charm has vanished i cant see a single old castle would you have thought it possible that a small circular bit of tin on a mans person could produce such changes in him you are a donkey to wear it said evan i pledged my word as a gentleman and thought it small for the money said raikes this is the first coach i ever travelled on without making the old whip burst with laughing im not myself im haunted im somebody else the three passengers having descended a controversy commenced between evan and andrew as to which should pay evan had his money out andrew dashed it behind him evan remonstrated well you mustnt pay for us two andrew i would have let you do it once but stuff cried andrew i aint payingits the creditors of the estate my boy evan looked so ingenuously surprised and hurt at his lack of principle that andrew chucked a sixpence at a small boy saying if you dont let me have my own way van ill shy my purse after it what do you mean sir by treating me like a beggar our friend harrington cant humour us quoth raikes for myself i candidly confess i prefer being paid for and he leaned contentedly against one of the posts of the inn till the filthy dispute was arranged to the satisfaction of the ignobler mind there andrew left them and went to mrs sockley who recovered from her illness smiled her usual placid welcome to a guest you know me maam oh yes the london mr cogglesby now maam look here ive come for my brother dont be alarmed no danger as yet but mind if you attempt to conceal him from his lawful brother ill summon here the myrmidons of the law mrs sockley showed a serious face you know his habits mr cogglesby and one doesnt go against any one of his whimsies or theres consequences but the house is open to you sir i dont wish to hide him andrew accepted this intelligent evasion of tom cogglesbys orders as sufficient and immediately proceeded upstairs a door shut on the first landing andrew went to this door and knocked no answer he tried to open it but found that he had been forestalled after threatening to talk business through the key hole the door was unlocked and old tom appeared so now youre dogging me into the country be off make an appointment saturdays my holiday you know that andrew pushed through the doorway and by way of an emphatic reply and a silencing one delivered a punch slap into old toms belt confound you nan said old tom grimacing but friendly as if his sympathies had been irresistibly assailed its done tom ive done it won my bet now andrew exclaimed the womenpoor creatures what a state theyre in i pity em old tom pursed his lips and eyed his brother incredulously but with curious eagerness oh lord what a face ive had to wear andrew continued and while he sank into a chair and rubbed his handkerchief over his crisp hair old tom let loose a convinced and exulting ha ha yes you may laugh ive had all the bother said andrew serve ye rightmarrying such cattle old tom snapped at him they believe were bankruptowe fifty thousand clear tom ha ha brewery stock and household furniture to be sold by general auction friday week ha ha not a place for any of us to poke our heads into i talked about pitiless storms to my poor harryno shelter to be had unless we go down to lymport and stop with their brother in shop old tom did enjoy this he took a great gulp of air for a tremendous burst of laughter and when this was expended and reflection came his features screwed as if the acidest of flavours had ravished his palate bravo nan didnt think you were man enough ha ha nani sayeh how did ye get on behind the curtains the tale to guess by andrews face appeared to be too strongly infused with pathos for revelation will they go nan eh d ye think theyll go where else can they go tom they must go there or on the parish you know theyll all troop down to the young tailoreh they cant sleep in the parks tom no they cant get into buckingham palace neithercept as housemaids gad theyre howling like cats id swearnuisance to the neighbourhoodha ha old toms cruel laughter made andrew feel for the unhappy ladies he stuck his forehead and leaned forward saying i dont knowpon my honour i dont knowcant think wevequite done right to punish em so this acted like cold water on old toms delight he pitched it back in the shape of a doubt of what andrew had told him whereupon andrew defied him to face three miserable women on the verge of hysterics and old tom beginning to chuckle again rejoined that it would bring them to their senses and emancipate him you may laugh mr tom said andrew but if poor harry should find me out deuce a bit more home for me old tom looked at him keenly and rapped the table swear you did it nan you promise youll keep the secret said andrew never make promises then theres a pretty life for me i did it for that poor dear boy you were only up to one of your jokesi see that confound you old tom youve been making a fool of me the flattering charge was not rejected by old tom who now had his brother to laugh at as well andrew affected to be indignant and desperate if youd had a heart tom youd have saved the poor fellow without any bother at all what do you think when i told him of our smashha ha it isnt such a bad jokewell i went to him hanging my head and he offered to arrange our affairsthat is damned meddlesome young dog cried old tom quite in a rage thereyoure up in a twinkling said andrew dont you see he believed it you stupid old tom lord to hear him say how sorry he was and to see how glad he looked at the chance of serving us serving us tom sneered ha went andrew yes there youre a deuced deal prouder than fifty peers youre an upside down old despot no sharper retort rising to old toms lips he permitted his brothers abuse of him to pass declaring that bandying words was not his business he not being a parliament man how about the major nan he coming down too major cried andrew lucky if he keeps his commission coming down no hes off to the continent find plenty of scamps there to keep him company added tom so hes brokeeh ha ha tom said andrew seriously ill tell you all about it if youll swear not to split on me because it would really upset poor harry so shed think me such a beastly hypocrite i couldnt face her afterwards lose what pluck you haveeh tom jerked out his hand and bade his brother continue compelled to trust in him without a promise andrew said well then after wed arranged it i went back to harry and begged her to have poor van at the house told her what i hoped youd do for him about getting him into the brewery shes very kind tom pon my honour she is she was willing only onlyeh well she was so afraid itd hurt her sisters to see him there old tom saw he was in for excellent fun and wouldnt spoil it for the world yes nan so i went to caroline she was easy enough and she went to the countess well and she she was willing too till lady jocelyn came and took miss bonner home to beckley and because evan had written to my lady to fetch her the countessshe was angry that was all because of that you know but yet she agreed but when miss bonner had gone it turned out that the major was the obstacle they were all willing enough to have evan there but the major refused i didnt hear him i wasnt going to ask him i maynt be a match for three women but man to man eh tom youd back me there so harry said the majord make caroline miserable if his wishes were disrespected by george i wish id known then dont you think it odd tom now theres a duke of belfield the fellow had hooked into his company andthrough evan i heardthe duke had his name struck off after that the major swore at the duke once or twice and said caroline wasnt to go out with him suddenly he insists that she shall go days the poor thing kept crying one day he makes her go she hasnt the spirit of my harry or the countess by good luck van who was hunting ferns for some friends of his met them on sunday in richmond park and van took her away from the duke but tom think of van seeing a fellow watching her wherever she went and hearing the dukes coachman tell that fellow he had orders to drive his master and a lady hard on to the sea that night i dont believe itit wasnt caroline but what do you think of our finding out that beast of a spy to be in the majors pay we did van put a constable on his track we found him out and he confessed it a fact tom that decided me if it was only to get rid of a brute i determined id do it and i did strike came to me to get my name for a bill that night gad he looked blanker than his bill when he heard of us two bankrupt i showed him one or two documents id got ready says he never mind itll only be a couple of hundred more in the schedule stop tom hes got some of our blood i dont think he meant it he is hard pushed well i gave him a twentier and he was off the next night youll soon see all about the company in the papers at the conclusion of andrews recital old tom thrummed and looked on the floor under a heavy frown his mouth worked dubiously and from moment to moment he plucked at his waistcoat and pulled it down throwing back his head and glaring ive knocked that fellow over once he said wish he hadnt got up again andrew nodded one good thing nan he never boasted of our connection much obliged to him yes said andrew who was gladly watching old toms change of mood with a quiescent aspect ummust keep it quiet from his poor old mother andrew again affirmatived his seniors remarks that his treatment of old tom was sound he presently had proof of the latter stood up and after sniffing in an injured way for about a minute launched out his right leg and vociferated that he would like to have it in his power to kick all the villains out of the world a modest demand andrew at once chimed in with adding that were such a faculty extended to him he would not object to lose the leg that could benefit mankind so infinitely and consented to its following them then old tom who was of a practical turn meditated swung his foot and gave one grim kick at the imaginary bundle of villains discharged them headlong straight into space andrew naturally imitative and seeing that he had now to kick them flying attempted to excel old tom in the vigour of his delivery no wonder that the efforts of both were heating they were engaged in the task of ridding the globe of the larger half of its inhabitants tom perceived andrews useless emulation and with a sound translated by yack sent his leg out a long way not to be outdone andrew immediately with a still louder yack committed himself to an effort so violent that the alternative between his leg coming off or his being taken off his leg was propounded by nature and decided by the laws of gravity in a trice joyful grunts were emitted by old tom at the sight of andrew prostrate rubbing his pate but mrs sockley to whom the noise of andrews fall had suggested awful fears of a fratricidal conflict upstairs hurried forthwith to announce to them that the sovereign remedy for human ills the promoter of concord the healer of feuds the central point of mans destiny in the fleshdinner was awaiting them to the dinner they marched of this great festival be it simply told that the supply was copious and of good qualitymuch too good and copious for a bankrupt host that evan and mr john raikes were formally introduced to old tom before the repast commenced and welcomed some three minutes after he had decided the flavour of his first glass that mr raikes in due time preferred his petition for release from a dreadful engagement and furnished vast amusement to the company under old toms hand until by chance he quoted a scrap of latin at which the brothers cogglesby who would have faced peers and princes without being disconcerted or performing mental genuflexions shut their mouths and looked injured unhappy and in the presence of a superior mr raikes not being the man to spare them moreover a surprise was afforded to evan andrew stated to old tom that the hospitality of main street lymportwas open to him strange to say old tom accepted it on the spot observing youre master of the housecan do what you like if youre man enough and adding that he thanked him and would come in a day or two the case of mr raikes was still left uncertain for as the bottle circulated he exhibited such a faculty for apt but to the brothers totally incomprehensible quotation that they fled from him without leaving him time to remember what special calamity was on his mind or whether this earth was other than an abode conceived in great jollity for his life long entertainment chapter xlii juliana the sick night light burned steadily in julianas chamber on a couch beside her bed caroline lay sleeping tired with a long watch two sentences had been passed on juliana one on her heart one on her body thou art not loved and thou must die the frail passion of her struggle against her destiny was over with her quiet as that quiet which nature was taking her to her body reposed calm as the solitary night light before her open eyes her spirit was wasting away if i am not loved then let me die in such a sense she bowed to her fate at an hour like this watching the round of light on the ceiling with its narrowing inner rings a sufferer from whom pain has fled looks back to the shores she is leaving and would be well with them who walk there it is false to imagine that schemers and workers in the dark are destitute of the saving gift of conscience they have it and it is perhaps made livelier in them than with easy people and therefore they are imperatively spurred to hoodwink it hence their self delusion is deep and endures they march to their object and gaining or losing it the voice that calls to them is the voice of a blind creature whom any answer provided that the answer is ready will silence and at an hour like this when finally they snatch their minute of sight on the threshold of black night their souls may compare with yonder shining circle on the ceiling which as the light below gasps for air contracts and extends but to mingle with the darkness they would be nobler better boundlessly good to allto those who have injured them to those whom they have injured alas for any definite deed the limit of their circle is immoveable and they must act within it the trick they have played themselves imprisons them beyond it they cease to be lying in this utter stillness juliana thought of rose of her beloved by evan the fever that had left her blood had left it stagnant and her thoughts were quite emotionless she looked faintly on a far picture she saw rose blooming with pleasures in elburne house sliding as a boat borne by the rivers tide to sea away from her living joy the breast of rose was lucid to her and in that hour of insight she had clear knowledge of her cousins heart how it scoffed at its base love and unwittingly betrayed the power on her still by clinging to the world and what it would give her to fill the void how externally the lake was untroubled and a mirror to the passing day and how within there pressed a flood against an iron dam evan too she saw the countess was right in her judgement of julianas love juliana looked very little to his qualities she loved him when she thought him guilty which made her conceive that her love was of a diviner cast than rose was capable of guilt did not spoil his beauty to her his gentleness and glowing manhood were unchanged and when she knew him as he was the revelation of his high nature simply confirmed her impression of his physical perfections she had done him a wrong at her death news would come to him and it might be that he would bless her name because she sighed no longer for those dear lips and strong arms to close about her tremulous frame it seemed to her that she had quite surrendered him generous to evan she would be just to rose beneath her pillow she found pencil and paper and with difficulty scarce seeing her letters in the brown light she began to trace lines of farewell to rose her conscience dictated to her thus tell rose that she was too ready to accept his guilt and that in this as in all things she acted with the precipitation of her character tell her that you always trusted and that now you know him innocent give her the proofs you have show that he did it to shield his intriguing sister tell her that you write this only to make her just to him end with a prayer that rose may be happy ere juliana had finished one sentence she resigned the pencil was it not much even at the gates of death to be the instrument to send rose into his arms the picture swayed before her helping her weakness she found herself dreaming that he had kissed her once dorothy she remembered had danced up to her one day to relate what the maids of the house said of the gentlemanat whom it is known they look with the licence of cats toward kings and dorothys fresh careless mouth had told how one observant maid amorously minded proclaimed of evan to a companion of her sex that he was the only gentleman who gave you an idea of how he would look when he was kissing you juliana cherished that vision likewise young ladies are not supposed to do so if menial maids are but juliana did cherish it and it possessed her fancy bear in your recollection that she was not a healthy person diseased little heroines may be made attractive and are now popular but strip off the cleverly woven robe which is fashioned to cover them and you will find them in certain matters bearing a resemblance to menial maids while the thoughts of his kiss lasted she could do nothing but lay with her two hands out on the bed and her eyelids closed then waking she took the pencil again it would not move her bloodless fingers fell from it if they do not meet and he never marries i may claim him in the next world she mused but conscience continued uneasy she turned her wrist and trailed a letter from beneath the pillow it was from mrs shorne juliana knew the contents she raised it unopened as high as her faltering hands permitted and read like one whose shut eyes read syllables of fire on the darkness rose has at last definitely engaged herself to ferdinand you will be glad to hear and we may now treat her as a woman having absorbed these words julianas hand found strength to write with little difficulty what she had to say to rose she conceived it to be neither sublime nor generous not even good merely her peculiar duty when it was done she gave a long low sigh of relief caroline whispered dearest child are you awake yes she answered sorrowful dear very quiet caroline reached her hand over to her and felt the paper what is this my good bye to rose i want it folded now caroline slipped from the couch to fulfil her wish she enclosed the pencilled scrap of paper sealed it and asked is that right now unlock my desk juliana uttered feebly put it beside a letter addressed to a law gentleman post both the morning i am gone caroline promised to obey and coming to juliana to mark her looks observed a faint pleased smile dying away and had her hand gently squeezed julianas conscience had preceded her contentedly to its last sleep and she beneath that round of light on the ceiling drew on her counted breaths in peace till dawn chapter xliii rose have you seen a young audacious spirit smitten to the earth it is a singular study and in the case of young women a trap for inexperienced men rose who had commanded and managed every one surrounding her since infancy how humble had she now becomehow much more womanly in appearance and more child like at heart she was as wax in lady elburnes hands a hint of that veiled episode the beckley campaign made rose pliant as if she had woven for herself a rod of scorpions the high ground she had taken the perfect trust in one the scorn of any judgement save her own these had vanished from her rose the tameless heroine who had once put her mothers philosophy in action was the easiest filly that turbaned matron ever yet drove into the straight road of the world it even surprised lady jocelyn to see how wonderfully she had been broken in by her grandmother her ladyship wrote to drummond to tell him of it and drummond congratulated her saying however changes of this sort dont come of conviction wait till you see her at home i think they have been sticking pins into the sore part drummond knew rose well in reality there was no change in her she was only a suppliant to be spared from ridicule spared from the application of the scourge she had woven for herself and ah to one who deigned to think warmly still of such a disgraced silly creature with what gratitude she turned he might well suppose love alone could pour that profusion of jewels at his feet ferdinand now lord laxley understood the merits of his finger nails better than the nature of young women but he is not to be blamed for presuming that rose had learnt to adore him else why did she like his company so much he was not mistaken in thinking she looked up to him she seemed to beg to be taken into his noble serenity in truth she sighed to feel as he did above everybodyshe that had fallen so low above everybodyborn above them and therefore superior by grace divine to this rose jocelyn had comeshe envied the mind of ferdinand he you may be sure was quite prepared to accept her homage rose he had always known to be just the girl for him spirited fresh and with fine teeth and once tied to you safe to be staunch they walked together rode together danced together her soft humility touched him to eloquence say she was a little hypocrite if you like when the blood came to her cheeks under his eyes say she was a heartless minx for allowing it to be bruited that she and ferdinand were betrothed i can but tell you that her blushes were blushes of gratitude to one who could devote his time to such a disgraced silly creature and that she in her abject state felt a secret pleasure in the protection ferdinands name appeared to extend over her and was hardly willing to lose it so far lady elburnes tact and discipline had been highly successful one morning in may ferdinand strolling with rose down the garden made a positive appeal to her common sense and friendly feeling by which she understood that he wanted her consent to his marriage with her rose answered who would have me ferdinand spoke pretty well and ultimately got possession of her hand she let him keep it thinking him noble for forgetting that another had pressed it before him some minutes later the letters were delivered one of them contained julianas dark winged missive poor poor juley said rose dropping her head after reading all that was on the crumpled leaf with an inflexible face and then talking on long low sighs lifted her bosom at intervals she gazed from time to time with a wistful conciliatory air on ferdinand rushing to her chamber the first cry her soul framed was he did not kiss me the young have a superstitious sense of something incontestably true in the final protestations of the dead evan guiltless she could not quite take the meaning this revelation involved that which had been dead was beginning to move within her but blindly and now it stirred and troubled now sank guiltless all she had thought him oh she knew she could not have been deceived but why why had he hidden his sacrifice from her it is better for us both of course said rose speaking the worlds wisdom parrot like and bursting into tears the next minute guiltless and gloriously guiltless but nothingnothing to her she tried to blame him it would not do she tried to think of that grovelling loathsome position painted to her by lady elburnes graphic hand evan dispersed the gloomy shades like sunshine then in a sort of terror she rejoiced to think she was partially engaged to ferdinand and found herself crying again with exultation that he had not kissed her for a kiss on her mouth was to rose a pledge and a bond the struggle searched her through bared her weakness probed her strength and she seeing herself suffered grievously in her self love am i such a coward inconstant cold she asked confirmatory answers coming flung her back under the shield of ferdinand if for a moment her soul stood up armed and defiant it was evans hand she took to whom do i belong was another terrible question in her ideas if evan was not chargeable with that baseness which had sundered them he might claim her yet if he would if he did what then must she go to him impossible she was in chains besides what a din of laughter there would be to see her led away by him twisting her joined hands weeping for her cousin as she thought rose passed hours of torment over julianas legacy to her why did i doubt him she cried jealous that any soul should have known and trusted him better jealous and i am afraid that the kindling of that one feature of love relighted the fire of her passion thus fervidly to be outstripped in generosity was hateful to her rose naturally could not reflect that a young creature like herself fighting against the world as we call it has all her faculties at the utmost stretch and is often betrayed by failing nature when the will is still valiant and here she satin chains yes i am fit only to be the wife of an idle brainless man with money and a title she said in extreme self contempt she caught a glimpse of her whole life in the horrid tomb of his embrace and questions whether she could yield her hand to himwhether it was right in the eyes of heaven rushed impetuously to console her and defied anything in the shape of satisfactory affirmations nevertheless the end of the struggle was that she felt that she was bound to ferdinand but this i will do said rose standing with heat bright eyes and deep coloured cheeks before the glass i will clear his character at beckley i will help him i will be his friend i will wipe out the injustice i did him and this bride elect of a lord absolutely added that she was unworthy to be the wife of a tailor he how unequalled he is there is nothing he fears except shame oh how sad it will be for him to find no woman in his class to understand him and be his helpmate over this sad subject of which we must presume her to be accurately cognizant rose brooded heavily by mid day she gave her grandmother notice that she was going home to julianas funeral well rose if you think it necessary to join the ceremony said lady elburne beckley is bad quarters for you as you have learnt there was never much love between you cousins no and i dont pretend to it rose answered i am sorry poor juleys gone shes better gone for many reasonsshe appears to have been a little venomous toad said lady elburne and rose thinking of a snakelike death bite working through her blood rejoined yes she isnt to be pitied shes better off than most people so it was arranged that rose should go ferdinand and her aunt mrs shorne accompanied her mrs shorne gave them their opportunities albeit they were all stowed together in a carriage and ferdinand seemed willing to profit by them but roses hand was dead and she sat by her future lord forming the vow on her lips that they should never be touched by him arrived at beckley she to her great delight found caroline there waiting for the funeral in a few minutes she got her alone and after kisses looked penetratingly into her lovely eyes shook her head and said why were you false to me false echoed caroline you knew him you knew why he did that why did you not save me caroline fell upon her neck asking pardon she spared her the recital of facts further than the broad avowal evans present condition she plainly stated and rose when the bitter pangs had ceased made oath to her soul she would rescue him from it in addition to the task of clearing evans character and rescuing him rose now conceived that her engagement to ferdinand must stand ice bound till evan had given her back her troth how could she obtain it from him how could she take anything from one so noble and so poor happily there was no hurry though before any bond was ratified she decided conscientiously that it must be done you see that like a lithe snake she turns on herself and must be tracked in and out not being a girl to solve the problem with tears or outright perfidy she had to ease her heart to the great shock little by littlesincere as far as she knew as far as one who loves may be the day of the funeral came and went the jocelyns were of their mothers opinion that for many reasons juliana was better out of the way mrs bonners bequest had been a severe blow to sir franks however all was now well the estate naturally lapsed to lady jocelyn no one in the house dreamed of a will signed with julianas name attested under due legal forms being in existence none of the members of the family imagined that at beckley court they were then residing on somebody elses ground want of hospitable sentiments was not the cause that led to an intimation from sir franks to his wife that mrs strike must not be pressed to remain and that rose must not be permitted to have her own way in this knowing very well that mrs shorne spoke through her husbands mouth lady jocelyn still acquiesced and rose who had pressed caroline publicly to stay had to be silent when the latter renewed her faint objections so caroline said she would leave on the morrow morning juliana with her fretfulness her hand bounties her petty egoisms and sudden far leaping generosities and all the contradictory impulses of her malady had now departed utterly the joys of a landed proprietor mounted into the head of sir franks he was up early the next morning and he and harry walked over a good bit of the ground before breakfast sir franks meditated making it entail and favoured harry with a lecture on the duty of his shaping the course of his conduct at once after the model of the landed gentry generally and you may think yourself lucky to come into that cataloguethe son of a younger son said sir franks tapping mr harrys shoulder harry also began to enjoy the look and smell of land at the breakfast which though early was well attended harry spoke of the adviseability of felling timber here planting there and so forth after the model his father held up sir franks nodded approval of his interest in the estate but reserved his opinion on matters of detail all i beg of you is said lady jocelyn that you wont let us have turnips within the circuit of a mile which was obligingly promised the morning letters were delivered and opened with the customary calmness letter from old george harry sings out and buzzes over a few lines halloahum he was going to make a communication but catching sight of caroline tossed the letter over to ferdinand who read it and tossed it back with the comment of a careless face read it rosey says harry smiling bluntly rather to his surprise rose took the letter study her eyes if you wish to gauge the potency of one strong dose of ridicule on an ingenuous young heart she read that mr george uplift had met our friend mr snip riding by moonlight on the road to beckley that great orbed night of their deep tender love flashed luminously through her frame storming at the base epithet by which her lover was mentioned flooding grandly over the ignominies cast on him by the world she met the world as it were in a death grapple she matched the living heroic youth she felt him to be with that dead wooden image of him which it thrust before her her heart stood up singing like a craven who sees the tide of victory setting toward him but this passed beneath her eyelids when her eyes were lifted ferdinand could have discovered nothing in them to complain of had his suspicions been light to raise nor could mrs shorne perceive that there was the opening for a shrewd bodkin thrust rose had got a mask at last her colour voice expression were perfectly at command she knew it to be a cowardice to wear any mask but she had been burnt horribly burnt how much so you may guess from the supple dissimulation of such a bold clear visaged girl she conquered the sneers of the world in her soul but her sensitive skin was yet alive to the pangs of the scorching it had been subjected to when weak helpless and betrayed by evan she stood with no philosophic parent to cry fair play for her among the skilful torturers of elburne house sir franks had risen and walked to the window news said lady jocelyn wheeling round in her chair the one eyebrow up of the easy going baronet signified trouble of mind he finished his third perusal of a letter that appeared to be written in a remarkably plain legal hand and looking as men do when their intelligences are just equal to the comprehension or expression of an oath handed the letter to his wife and observed that he should be found in the library nevertheless he waited first to mark its effect on lady jocelyn at one part of the document her forehead wrinkled slightly doesnt sound like a joke he said she answered no sir franks apparently quite satisfied by her ready response turned on his heel and left the room quickly an hour afterward it was rumoured and confirmed that juliana bonner had willed all the worldly property she held in her own right comprising beckley court to mr evan harrington of lymport tailor an abstract of the will was forwarded the lawyer went on to say that he had conformed to the desire of the testatrix in communicating the existence of the aforesaid will six days subsequent to her death being the day after her funeral there had been railing and jeering at the countess de saldar the clever outwitted exposed adventuress at elburne house and beckley court what did the crowing cleverer aristocrats think of her now on rose the blow fell bitterly was evan also a foul schemer was he of a piece with his intriguing sister his close kinship with the countess had led her to think baseness possible to him when it was confessed by his own mouth once she heard black names cast at him and the whole of the great mels brood and incapable of quite disbelieving them merited unable to challenge and rebut them she dropped into her recent state of self contempt into her lately instilled doubt whether it really was in natures power unaided by family portraits coats of arms ball room practice and at least one small phial of essence of society to make a gentleman chapter xliv contains a warning to all conspirators this if you have done me the favour to read it aright has been a chronicle of desperate heroism on the part of almost all the principal personages represented but not the countess de saldar scaling the embattled fortress of society nor rose tossing its keys to her lover from the shining turret tops nor evan keeping bright the lamp of self respect in his bosom against south wind and east none excel friend andrew cogglesby who having fallen into old toms plot to humiliate his wife and her sisters simply for evans sake and without any distinct notion of the terror confusion and universal upset he was bringing on his home could yet after a scared contemplation of the scene when he returned from his expedition to fallowfield continue to wear his rueful mask and persevere in treacherously outraging his lofty wife he did it to vindicate the ties of blood against accidents of position was he justified i am sufficiently wise to ask my own sex alone on the other side be it said since in our modern days every hero must have his weak heel that now he had gone this distance it was difficult to recede it would be no laughing matter to tell his solemn harriet that he had been playing her a little practical joke his temptations to give it up were incessant and most agitating but if to advance seemed terrific there was in stopping short an awfulness so overwhelming that andrew abandoned himself to the current his real dismay adding to his acting powers the worst was that the joke was no longer his it was old toms he discovered that he was in old toms hands completely andrew had thought that he would just frighten the women a bit get them down to lymport for a week or so and then announce that matters were not so bad with the brewery as he had feared concluding the farce with a few domestic fireworks conceive his dismay when he entered the house to find there a man in possession andrew flew into such a rage that he committed an assault on the man so ungovernable was his passion that for some minutes harriets measured voice summoned him from over the banisters above quite in vain the miserable englishman refused to be taught that his house had ceased to be his castle it was something beyond a joke this the intruder perfectly docile seeing that by accurate calculation every shake he got involved a bottle of wine for him and ultimate compensation probably to the amount of a couple of sovereigns allowed himself to be lugged up stairs in default of summary ejection on the point of andrews toe into the street there he was faced to the lady of the house who apologized to him and requested her husband to state what had made him guilty of this indecent behaviour the man showed his papers they were quite in order at the suit of messrs grist my own lawyers cried andrew smacking his forehead and old toms devilry flashed on him at once he sank into a chair why did you bring this person up here said harriet like a speaking statue my dear andrew answered and spread out his hand and waggled his head mypleaseii dont know we all want exercise the man laughed which was kindly of him but offensive to mrs cogglesby who gave andrew a glance which was full payment for his imbecile pleasantry and promised more with a hospitable inquiry as to the condition of his appetite and a request that he would be pleased to satisfy it to the full the man was dismissed whereat as one delivered of noxious presences the countess rustled into sight not noticing andrew she lisped to harriet misfortunes are sometimes no curses i bless the catarrh that has confined silva to his chamber and saved him from a bestial exhibition the two ladies then swept from the room and left andrew to perspire at leisure fresh tribulations awaited him when he sat down to dinner andrew liked his dinner to be comfortable good and in plenty this may not seem strange the fact is stated that i may win for him the warm sympathies of the body of his countrymen he was greeted by a piece of cold boiled neck of mutton and a solitary dish of steaming potatoes the blank expanse of table cloth returned his desolate stare why whats the meaning of this andrew brutally exclaimed as he thumped the table the countess gave a start and rolled a look as of piteous supplication to spare a ladys nerves addressed to a ferocious brigand harriet answered it means that i will have no butchers bills butchers bills butchers bills echoed andrew why you must have butchers bills why confound why youll have a bill for this wont you harry eh of course there will be no more bills dating from yesterday said his wife what this is paid for then yes mr cogglesby and so will all household expenses be while my pocket money lasts resting his eyes full on harriet a minute andrew dropped them on the savourless white rimmed chop which looked as lonely in his plate as its parent dish on the table the poor dear creatures pocket money had paid for it the thought mingling with a rush of emotion made his ideas spin his imagination surged deliriously he fancied himself at the zoological gardens exchanging pathetic glances with a melancholy marmoset wonderfully like one the chop looked there was no use in his trying to eat it he seemed to be fixing his teeth in solid tears he choked twice he took up knife and fork put them down again and plucking forth his handkerchief blew a tremendous trumpet that sent the countesss eyes rolling to the ceiling as if heaven were her sole refuge from such vulgarity damn that old tom he shouted at last and pitched back in his chair mr cogglesby and in the presence of ladies were the admonishing interjections of the sisters at whom the little man frowned in turns do you wish us to quit the room sir inquired his wife god bless your soul you little darling he apostrophized that stately person here come along with me harry a wifes a wife i sayhang it just outside the roomjust a second or up in a corner will do mrs cogglesby was amazed to see him jump up and run round to her she was prepared to defend her neck from his caress and refused to go but the words something particular to tell you awakened her curiosity which urged her to compliance she rose and went with him to the door well sir what is it no doubt he was acting under a momentary weakness he was about to betray the plot and take his chance of forgiveness but her towering port her commanding aspect restored his courage there may be a contrary view of the case he enclosed her briskly in a connubial hug and remarked with mad ecstasy what a duck you are harry what a likeness between you and your mother mrs cogglesby disengaged herself imperiously had he called her aside for this gratuitous insult contrite he saw his dreadful error harry i declare was all he was allowed to say mrs cogglesby marched back to her chair and recommenced the repast in majestic silence andrew sighed he attempted to do the same he stuck his fork in the blanched whiskerage of his marmoset and exclaimed i cant he was unnoticed you do not object to plain diet said harriet to louisa oh no in verity murmured the countess however plain it be absence of appetite dearest you are aware i partook of luncheon at mid day with the honourable and reverend mr duffian you must not look condemnation at your louy for that luncheon is not conversion harriet observed that this might be true but still to her mind it was a mistake to be too intimate with dangerous people and besides she added mr duffian is no longer the reverend we deprive all renegades of their spiritual titles his worldly ones let him keep her superb disdain nettled the countess dear harriet she said with less languor you are utterly and totally and entirely mistaken i tell you so positively renegade the application of such a word to such a man oh and it is false harriet quite renegade means one who has gone over to the turks my dear i am almost certain i saw it in johnsons dictionary or an improvement upon johnson by a more learned author but there is the fact if harriet can only bring hershall i say stiff necked prejudices to envisage it harriet granted her sister permission to apply the phrases she stood in need of without impeaching her intimacy with the most learned among lexicographers and is there no such thing as being too severe the countess resumed what our enemies call unchristian mr duffian has no cause to complain of us said harriet nor does he do so dearest calumny may assail him you may utterly denude him adam interposed andrew distractedly listening he did not disturb the countesss flow you may vilify and victimize mr duffian and strip him of the honours of his birth but like the martyrs he will still continue the perfect nobleman stoned i assure you that mr duffian would preserve his breeding in character he is exquisite a polish to defy misfortune i suppose his table is good said harriet almost ruffled by the countesss lecture plate was remarked in the cold tone of supreme indifference hem good wines andrew asked waking up a little and not wishing to be excluded altogether all is of the very best the countess pursued her eulogy not looking at him dont you think you couldeh harrymanage a pint for me my dear andrew humbly petitioned this cold waterha ha my stomach dont like cold bathing his wretched joke rebounded from the impenetrable armour of the ladies the wine cellar is locked said his wife i have sealed up the key till an inventory can be taken by some agent of the creditors what creditors roared andrew you can have some of the servants beer mrs cogglesby appended andrew studied her face to see whether she really was not hoisting him with his own petard perceiving that she was sincerely acting according to her sense of principle he fumed and departed to his privacy unable to stand it any longer then like a kite the countess pounced upon his character would the honourable and reverend mr duffian decline to participate in the sparest provender would he be guilty of the discourtesy of leaving table without a bow or an apology even if reduced to extremest poverty no indeed which showed that under all circumstances a gentleman was a gentleman and oh how she pitied her poor harrieteternally tied to a most vulgar little man without the gilding of wealth and a fool in his business to boot dear these comparisons do no good said harriet andrew at least is not a renegade and never shall be while i live i will do my duty by him however poor we are and now louisa putting my husband out of the question what are your intentions i dont understand bankruptcy but i imagine they can do nothing to wife and children my little ones must have a roof over their heads and besides there is little maxwell you decline to go down to lymport of course decline cried the countess melodiously and do not you as far as i am concernedyes but i am not to think of myself the countess meditated and said dear mr duffian has offered me his hospitality renegades are not absolutely inhuman they may be generous i have no moral doubt that mr duffian would upon my representationdare i venture sleep in his house break bread with him exclaimed harriet what do you think i am made of i would perishgo to the workhouse rather i see you trooping there said the countess intent on the vision and have you accepted his invitation for yourself louisa the countess was never to be daunted by threatening aspects she gave her affirmative with calmness and a deliberate smile you are going to live with him live with him what expressions my husband accompanies me harriet drew up i know nothing louisa that could give me more pain the countess patted harriets knee it succeeds to bankruptcy assuredly but would you have me drag silva to thethe shop harriet love alternatives mrs andrew got up and rang the bell to have the remains of their dinner removed when this was done she said louisa i dont know whether i am justified you told me to day i might keep my jewels trinkets and lace and such like to me i know they do not belong now but i will dispose of them to procure you an asylum somewherethey will fetch i should think to prevent your going to mr duffian no exhibition of great mindedness which the countess could perceive ever found her below it never love never she said then will you go to evan evan i hate him the olive hued visage was dark it brightened as she added at least as much as my religious sentiments permit me to a boy who has thwarted me at every turndisgraced us indeed i find it difficult to pardon you the supposition of such a possibility as your own consent to look on him ever again harriet you have no children said mrs andrew the countess mournfully admitted it there lies your danger with mr duffian louisa what do you doubt my virtue asked the countess pish i fear something different you understand me mr duffians moral reputation is none of the best perhaps that was before he renegaded said the countess harriet bluntly rejoined you will leave that house a roman catholic now you have spoken said the countess pluming now let me explain myself my dear i have fought worldly battles too long and too earnestly i am rightly punished i do but quote herbert duffians own words he is no flatterer though you say he has such soft fingers i am now engaged in a spiritual contest he is very wealthy i have resolved to rescue back to our church what can benefit the flock of which we form a portion so exceedingly at this revelation of the countesss spiritual contest mrs andrew shook a worldly head you have no chance with men there louisa my harriet complains of female weakness yes we are strong in our own element louisa dont be tempted out of it sublime the countess rose element am i to be confined to one what but spiritual solaces could assist me to live after the degradations i have had heaped on me i renounce the world i turn my sight to realms where caste is unknown i feel no shame there of being a tailors daughter you see i can bring my tongue to name the thing in its actuality once that member would have blistered confess to me that in spite of your children you are tempted to howl at the idea of lymport the countess paused and like a lady about to fire off a gun appeared to tighten her nerves crying out rapidly shop shears geese cabbage snip nine to a man even as the silence after explosions of cannon that which reigned in the room was deep and dreadful see the countess continued you are horrified you shudder i name all our titles and if i wish to be red in my cheeks i must rouge it is in verity as if my senseless clay were pelted as we heard of evan at his first lymport boys school you remember when he told us the story he lisped a trifle then im the thon of a thnip oh it was hell fire to us then but now what do i feel why i avowed it to herbert duffian openly and he said that the misfortune of dear papas birth did not the less enable him to proclaim himself in conduct a noblemans offspring which he never was harriet broke the rhapsody in a monotonous low tone the countess was not compelled to hear and that a large outfitterone of the very largest was in reality a merchant whose daughters have often wedded nobles of the land and become ancestresses now harriet do you see what a truly religious mind can do for us in the way of comfort oh i bow in gratitude to herbert duffian i will not rest till i have led him back to our fold recovered from his error he was our own preacher and pastor he quitted us from conviction he shall return to us from conviction the countess quoted texts which i respect and will not repeat she descanted further on spiritualism and on the balm that it was to tailors and their offspring to all outcasts from society overpowered by her harriet thus summed up her opinions you were always self willed louisa say full of sacrifice if you would be just added the countess and the victim of basest ingratitude well you are in a dangerous path louisa harriet had the last word which usually the countess was not disposed to accord but now she knew herself strengthened to do so and was content to smile pityingly on her sister full upon them in this frame of mind arrived carolines great news from beckley it was then that the countesss conduct proved a memorable refutation of cynical philosophy she rejoiced in the good fortune of him who had offended her though he was not crushed and annihilated as he deserved to be by the wrong he had done the great hearted woman pardoned him her first remark was let him thank me for it or not i will lose no moment in hastening to load him with my congratulations pleasantly she joked andrew and defended him from harriet now so we are not all bankrupts you see dear brother in law andrew had become so demoralized by his own plot that in every turn of events he scented a similar piece of human ingenuity harriet was angry with his disbelief or say the grudging credit he gave to the glorious news notwithstanding her calmness the thoughts of lymport had sickened her soul and it was only for the sake of her children and from a sense of the dishonesty of spending a farthing of the money belonging as she conceived to the creditors that she had consented to go i see your motive mr cogglesby she observed your measures are disconcerted i will remain here till my brother gives me shelter oh thatll do my love thats all i want said andrew sincerely both of you fools the countess interjected know you evan so little he will receive us anywhere his arms are open to his kindred but to his heart the road is through humiliation and it is to his heart we seek admittance what do you mean harriet inquired just this the countess answered in bold english and her eyes were lively her figure elastic we must all of us go down to the old shop and shake his hand thereevery man jack of usim only quoting the sailors harrietand thats the way to win him she snapped her fingers laughing harriet stared at her and so did andrew though for a different reason she seemed to be transformed seeing him inclined to gape she ran up to him caught up his chin between her ten fingers and kissed him on both cheeks saying you neednt come if youre too proud you know little man and to harriets look of disgust the cause for which she divined with her native rapidity she said what does it matter they will talk but they cant look down on us now why this is my doing she came tripping to her tall sister to ask plaintively maynt i be glad and bobbed a curtsey harriet desired andrew to leave them flushed and indignant she then faced the countess so unnecessary she began what can excuse your indiscretion louisa the countess smiled to hear her talking to her younger sister once more she shrugged oh if you will keep up the fiction do andrew knowshe isnt an idiotand to him we can make light of it now what does anybodys birth matter whos well off it was impossible for harriet to take that view the shop if not the thing might still have been concealed from her husband she thought it mattered to me when i was well off she said sternly yes and to me when i was but weve had a fall and a lesson since that my dear half the aristocracy of england spring from shopsshall i measure you harriet never felt such a desire to inflict a slap upon mortal cheek she marched away from her in a tiff on the other hand andrew was half fascinated by the countesss sudden re assumption of girlhood and returnedsilly fellow to have another look at her she had ceased on reflection to be altogether so vivacious her stronger second nature had somewhat resumed its empire still she was fresh and could at times be roguishly affectionate and she patted him and petted him and made much of him slightly railed at him for his uxoriousness and domestic subjection and proffered him her fingers to try the taste of the truth must be told mr duffian not being handy she in her renewed earthly happiness wanted to see her charms in a womans natural mirror namely the face of man if of man on his knees all the better and though a little man is not much of a man and a sisters husband is or should be hardly one at all still some sort of a reflector he must be two or three jests adapted to andrews palate achieved his momentary captivation he said gad i never kissed you in my life louy and she with a flavour of delicate irish brogue why dont ye catch opportunity by the tail then perfect innocence i assure you on both sides but mark how stupidity betrays andrew failed to understand her and act on the hint immediately had he done so the affair would have been over without a witness as it happened delay permitted harriet to assist at the ceremony it wasnt your mouth louy said andrew oh my mouththat i keep for my chosen was answered gad you make a fellow almost wish andrews fingers worked over his poll and then the spectre of righteous wrath flashed on himnaughty little man that he was he knew himself naughty for it was the only time since his marriage that he had ever been sorry to see his wife this is a comedy and i must not preach lessons of life here but i am obliged to remark that the husband must be proof the sister in law perfect where arrangements exist that keep them under one roof she may be so like his wife or from the knowledge she has of his circumstances she may talk to him almost as his wife he may forget that she is not his wife and then again the small beginnings which are in reality the mighty barriers are so easily slid over but what is the use of telling this to a pure generation my constant error is in supposing that i write for the wicked people who begat us note however the difference between the woman and the man shame confessed andrews naughtiness he sniggered pitiably whereas the countess jumped up and pointing at him asked her sister what she thought of that her next sentence coolly delivered related to some millinery matter if this was not innocence what is nevertheless i must here state that the scene related innocent as it was and as one would naturally imagine of puny consequence if any did no less a thing than subsequently to precipitate the protestant countess de saldar into the bosom of the roman catholic church a little bit of play it seems barely just but if as i have heard a lady has trod on a pebble and broken her nose tremendous results like these warn us to be careful how we walk as for play it was never intended that we should play with flesh and blood and oh be charitable matrons of britain see here andrew cogglesby who loved his wife as his very soul and who almost disliked her sister in ten minutes the latter had set his head spinning the whole of the day he went about the house meditating frantically on the possibility of his harriet demanding a divorce she was not the sort of woman to do that but one thing she resolved to do and it was to go to lymport with louisa and having once got her out of her dwelling place never to allow her to enter it wherever it might be in the light of a resident again whether anything but the menace of a participation in her conjugal possessions could have despatched her to that hateful place i doubt she went she would not let andrew be out of her sight growing haughtier toward him at every step she advanced to the strange old shop evan harrington over the door there the countess having meantime returned to her state of womanhood shared her shudders they entered and passed in to mrs mel leaving their footman apparently in the rear evan was not visible a man in the shop with a yard measure negligently adorning his shoulders said that mr harrington was in the habit of quitting the shop at five deuced good habit too said andrew why sir observed another stepping forward as you truly sayyes butah mr andrew cogglesby pleasure of meeting you once in fallowfield remember mr perkinsthe lawyer not the maltster will you do me the favour to step out with me andrew followed him into the street are you aware of our young friends good fortune said lawyer perkins yes ah wellwould you believe that any sane person in his condition nownonsense apartcould bring his mind wilfully to continue a beggar no um well mr cogglesby i may tell you that i hold here in my hands a document by which mr evan harrington transfers the whole of the property bequeathed to him to lady jocelyn and that i have his orders to execute it instantly and deliver it over to her ladyship after the will is settled probate and so forth i presume there will be an arrangement about his fathers debts now what do you think of that think sirthink cried andrew cocking his head at him like an indignant bird i think hes a damned young idiot to do so and youre a confounded old rascal to help him leaving mr perkins to digest his judgement which he had solicited andrew bounced back into the shop chapter xlv in which the shop becomes the centre of attraction under the first lustre of a may night evan was galloping over the moon shadowed downs toward beckley at the ridge commanding the woods the park and the stream his horse stopped as if from habit snorted and puffed its sides while he gazed steadily across the long lighted vale soon he began to wind down the glaring chalk track and reached grass levels here he broke into a round pace till gaining the first straggling cottages of the village he knocked the head of his whip against the garden gate of one and a man came out who saluted him and held the reins animal does work sir said the man evan gave directions for it to be looked to and went on to the doorway where he was met by a young woman she uttered a respectful greeting and begged him to enter the door closed he flung himself into a chair and said well susan how is the child oh hes always well mr harrington he dont know the tricks o trouble yet will polly be here soon at a quarter after nine she said sir evan bade her sit down after examining her features quietly he said im glad to see you here susan you dont regret that you followed my advice no sir now its over i dont mothers kind enough and father doesnt mention anything shes a bed with bilefathers out but what theres something on your mind i shall cry if i begin mr harrington see how far you can get without oh sir then said susan on a sharp rise of her bosom it aint my fault i wouldnt cause trouble to mr harry or any friend of yours but sir father have got hold of his letters to me and he says theres a promise in emleast one of em and its as good as law he sayshe heard it in a public house and hes gone over to fallfield to a law gentleman there susan was compelled to give way to some sobs it aint for mefather does it sir she pleaded i tried to stop him knowing how itd vex you mr harrington but hes heady about points though a quiet man ordinary and he says he dont expectand i know now no gentlemand marry such as mei aint such a stupid gaper at words as i used to be but father says its for the childs sake and he does it to have him provided for please dont ye be angry with me sir susans half controlled spasms here got the better of her while evan was awaiting the return of her calmer senses the latch was lifted and polly appeared at it again was her sneering comment after a short survey of her apron screened sister and then she bobbed to evan its whimper whimper and squeak squeak half their lives with some girls after that they go wondering they cant see to thread a needle the neighbours i suppose i should like to lift the top off some o their houses i hope i havent kept you sir no polly said evan but you must be charitable or i shall think you want a lesson yourself mr raikes tells me you want to see me what is it you seem to be correspondents polly replied oh no mr harrington only accidental oneswhen something particulars to be said and he dances like on the paper so that you cant help laughing isnt he a very eccentric gentleman sir very said evan ive no time to lose polly here you must go the latter called to her sister now pack at once sue do rout out and do leave off thinking youve got a candle at your eyes for goodness sake susan was too well accustomed to pollys usage to complain she murmured a gentle good night sir and retired whereupon polly exclaimed bless her poor dear soft heart its us hard ones that get on best in the world im treated better than her mr harrington and i know i aint worth half of her it goes nigh to make one religious only to see how exactly like scripture is the way beckley treats her whose only sin is her being so soft as to believe in a man oh dear mr harrington i wish i had good news for you in spite of all his self control evan breathed quickly and looked eagerly speak it out polly oh dear i must i suppose polly answered mr laxleys become a lord now mr harrington evan tasted in his soul the sweets of contrast well and my miss roseshe what moved by the keen hunger of his eyes polly hesitated her face betrayed a sudden change of mind wants to see you sir she said resolutely to see me evan stood up so pale that polly was frightened where is she where can i meet her please dont take it so mr harrington evan commanded her to tell him what her mistress had said now up to this point polly had spoken truth she was positive her mistress did want to see him polly also with a maidens tender guile desired to bring them together for once though it were for the last time and for no good on earth she had been about to confide to him her young mistresss position toward lord laxley when his sharp interrogation stopped her shrinking from absolute invention she remarked that of course she could not exactly remember miss roses words which seemed indeed too much to expect of her she will see me to night said evan i dont know about to night polly replied go to her instantly tell her i am ready i will be at the west park gates this is why you wrote polly why did you lose time dont delay my good girl come evan had opened the door he would not allow polly an instant for expostulation but drew her out saying you will attend to the gates yourself or come and tell me the day if she appoints another polly made a final effort to escape from the pit she was being pushed into mr harrington it wasnt to tell you this i wrote miss rose is engaged sir i understand said evan hoarsely scarcely feeling it as is the case with men who are shot through the heart ten minutes later he was on horseback by the fallowfield gates with the tidings shrieking through his frame the night was still and stiller in the pauses of the nightingales he sat there neither thinking of them nor reproached in his manhood for the tears that rolled down his cheeks presently his horses ears pricked and the animal gave a low neigh evans eyes fixed harder on the length of gravel leading to the house there was no sign no figure out from the smooth grass of the lane a couple of horsemen issued and came straight to the gates he heard nothing till one spoke it was a familiar voice by jove ferdy here is the fellow and weve been all the way to lymport evan started from his trance its you harrington yes harry sir exclaimed that youth evidently flushed with wine what the devil do you mean by addressing me by my christian name laxley pushed his horses head in front of harry in a manner apparently somewhat improved by his new dignity he said we have ridden to lymport to speak to you sir favour me by moving a little ahead of the lodge evan bowed and moved beside him a short way down the lane harry following the purport of my visit sir laxley began was to make known to you that miss jocelyn has done me the honour to accept me as her husband i learn from her that during the term of your residence in the house you contrived to extract from her a promise to which she attaches certain scruples she pleases to consider herself bound to you till you release her my object is to demand that you will do so immediately there was no reply should you refuse to make this reparation for the harm you have done to her and her family laxley pursued i must let you know that there are means of compelling you to it and that those means will be employed harry fuming at these postured sentences burst out what do you talk to the fellow in that way for a fellow who makes a fool of my cousin and then wants to get us to buy off my sister whats he spying after here the place is ours till we troop i tell you theres only one way of dealing with him and if you dont do it i will laxley pulled his reins with a jerk that brought him to the rear miss jocelyn has commissioned you to make this demand on me in her name said evan i make it in my own right returnedlaxley i demand a prompt reply my lord you shall have it miss jocelyn is not bound to me by any engagement should she entertain scruples which i may have it in my power to obliterate i shall not hesitate to do sobut only to her what has passed between us i hold sacred hark at that shouted harry the damned tradesman means money you ass ferdinand what did we go to lymport for not to bandy words here ive got my own quarrel with you harrington youve been setting that girls father on me can you deny that it was enough for harry that evan did not deny it the calm disdain which he read on evans face acted on his fury and digging his heels into his horses flanks he rushed full at him and dealt him a sharp flick with his whip evans beast reared accept my conditions sir or afford me satisfaction cried laxley you do me great honour my lord but i have told you i cannot said evan curbing his horse at that moment rose came among them evan raised his hat as did laxley harry a little behind the others performed a laborious mock salute and then ordered her back to the house a quick altercation ensued the end being that harry managed to give his sister the context of the previous conversation now go back rose said laxley i have particular business with mr harrington i came to see him said rose in a clear voice laxley reddened angrily then tell him at once you want to be rid of him her brother called to her rose looked at evan could he not see that she had no word in her soul for him of that kind yes but love is not always to be touched to tenderness even at the sight of love rose he said i hear from lord laxley that you fancy yourself not at liberty and that you require me to disengage you he paused did he expect her to say there that she wished nothing of the sort her stedfast eyes spoke as much but misery is wanton and will pull all down to it even harry was checked by his tone and laxley sat silent the fact that something more than a tailor was speaking seemed to impress them since i have to say it rose i hold you in no way bound to me the presumption is forced upon me may you have all the happiness i pray god to give you gentlemen good night he bowed and was gone how keenly she could have retorted on that false prayer for her happiness her limbs were nerveless her tongue speechless he had thrown her offthere was no barrier now between herself and ferdinand why did ferdinand speak to her with that air of gentle authority bidding her return to the house she was incapable of seeing what the young lord acutely felt that he had stooped very much in helping to bring about such a scene she had no idea of having trifled with him and her own heart when she talked feebly of her bondage to another as one who would be warmer to him were she free swiftly she compared the two that loved her and shivered as if she had been tossed to the embrace of a block of ice you are cold rose said laxley bending to lay his hand on her shoulder pray never touch me she answered and walked on hastily to the house entering it she remembered that evan had dwelt there a sense of desolation came over her she turned to ferdinand remorsefully saying dear ferdinand and allowed herself to be touched and taken close to him when she reached her bed room she had time to reflect that he had kissed her on the lips and then she fell down and shed such tears as had never been drawn from her before next day she rose with an undivided mind belonging henceforth to ferdinand it was necessary that she should invest him immediately with transcendent qualities the absence of character in him rendered this easy what she had done for evan she did for him but now as if the fates had been lying in watch to entrap her and chain her that they might have her at their mercy her dreams of evans high naturehitherto dreams onlywere to be realized with the purposeless waywardness of her sex pony wheedle while dressing her young mistress and though quite aware that the parting had been spoken must needs relate her sisters story and evans share in it rose praised him like one forever aloof from him nay she could secretly congratulate herself on not being deceived upon that came a letter from caroline do not misjudge my brother he knew julianas love for him and rejected it you will soon have proofs of his disinterestedness then do not forget that he works to support us all i write this with no hope save to make you just to him that is the utmost he will ever anticipate it gave no beating of the heart to rose to hear good of evan now but an increased serenity of confidence in the accuracy of her judgement of persons the arrival of lawyer perkins supplied the key to carolines communication no one was less astonished than rose at the news that evan renounced the estate she smiled at harrys contrite stupefaction and her fathers incapacity of belief in conduct so singular caused her to lift her head and look down on her parent shows he knows nothing of the world poor young fellow said sir franks nothing more clearly observed lady jocelyn i presume i shall cease to be blamed for having had him here upon my honour he must have the soul of a gentleman said the baronet theres nothing he can expect in return you know one would think papa you had always been dealing with tradesmen remarked rose to whom her father now accorded the treatment due to a sensible girl laxley was present at the family consultation what was his opinion rose manifested a slight anxiety to hear it what those sort of fellows do never surprises me he said with a semi yawn rose felt fire on her cheeks its only what the young man is bound to do said mrs shorne his duty aunt i hope we may all do it rose interjected championing him again rose quietly turned her face too sure of her cold appreciation of him to retort but yesterday night a word from him might have made her his and here she sat advocating the nobility of his nature with the zeal of a barrister in full swing of practice remember however that a kiss separates them and how many millions of leagues that counts for in love in a pure girls thought i leave you to guess now in what way was evan to be thanked how was he to be treated sir franks proposed to go down to him in person accompanied by harry lady jocelyn acquiesced but rose said to her mother will not you wound his sensitiveness by going to him there possibly said her ladyship shall we write and ask him to come to us no mama could we ask him to make a journey to receive our thanks not till we have solid ones to offer perhaps he will not let us help him mama unless we have all given him our hands probably not theres always a fund of nonsense in those who are capable of great things i observe it shall be a family expedition if you like what exclaimed mrs shorne do you mean that you intend to allow rose to make one of the party franks is that your idea sir franks looked at his wife what harm lady jocelyn asked for roses absence of conscious guile in appealing to her reason had subjugated that great faculty simply a sense of propriety emily said mrs shorne with a glance at ferdinand you have no objection i suppose lady jocelyn addressed him ferdinand will join us said rose thank you rose id rather not he replied i thought we had done with the fellow for good last night last night quoth lady jocelyn no one spoke the interrogation was renewed was it roses swift instinct which directed her the shortest way to gain her point or that she was glad to announce that her degrading engagement was at an end she said ferdinand and mr harrington came to an understanding last night in my presence that strange as it struck on their ears appeared to be quite sufficient to all albeit the necessity for it was not so very clear the carriage was ordered forthwith lady jocelyn went to dress rose drew ferdinand away into the garden then with all her powers she entreated him to join her thank you rose he said i have no taste for the genus for my sake i beg it ferdinand its really too much to ask of me rose if you care for me you will pon my honour quite impossible you refuse ferdinand my london tailord find me out and never forgive me this pleasantry stopped her soft looks why she wished him to be with her she could not have said for a thousand reasons which implies no distinct one something prophetically pressing in her blood chapter xlvi a lovers parting now to suppose oneself the fashioner of such a chain of events as this which brought the whole of the harrington family in tender unity together once more would have elated an ordinary mind but to the countess de saldar it was simply an occasion for reflecting that she had misunderstoodand could most sincerely forgiveprovidence she admitted to herself that it was not entirely her work for she never would have had their place of meeting to be the shop seeing however that her end was gained she was entitled to the credit of it and could pardon the means adopted her brother lord of beckley court and all of them assembled in the old main street lymport what matter for proud humility providence had answered her numerous petitions but in its own way stipulating that she must swallow this pill providence consented to serve her she swallowed it with her wonted courage in half an hour subsequent to her arrival at lymport she laid siege to the heart of old tom cogglesby whom she found installed in the parlour comfortably sipping at a tumbler of rum and water old tom was astonished to meet such an agreeable unpretentious woman who talked of tailors and lords with equal ease appeared to comprehend a mans habits instinctively and could amuse him while she ministered to them can you cook maam asked old tom all but that said the countess with a smile of sweet meaning ha then you wont suit me as well as your mother take care you do not excite my emulation she returned graciously albeit disgusted at his tone to harriet old tom had merely nodded there he sat in the arm chair sucking the liquor with the glimpse of a sour chuckle on his cheeks now and then during the evening he rubbed his hands sharply but spoke little the unbending harriet did not conceal her disdain of him when he ventured to allude to the bankruptcy she cut him short pray excuse mei am unacquainted with affairs of businessi cannot even understand my husband lord bless my soul old tom exclaimed rolling his eyes caroline had informed her sisters up stairs that their mother was ignorant of evans change of fortune and that evan desired her to continue so for the present caroline appeared to be pained by the subject and was glad when louisa sounded his mysterious behaviour by saying evan has a native love of concealmenthe must be humoured at the supper mr raikes made his bow he was modest and reserved it was known that this young gentleman acted as shopman there with a tenderness for his position worthy of all respect the countess spared his feelings by totally ignoring his presence whereat he unaccustomed to such great minded treatment retired to bed a hater of his kind harriet and caroline went next the countess said she would wait up for evan but hearing that his hours of return were about the chimes of matins she cried exultingly darling papa all over and departed likewise mrs mel when she had mixed old toms third glass wished the brothers good night and they were left to exchange what sentiments they thought proper for the occasion the countess had certainly disappointed old toms farce in a measure and he expressed himself puzzled by her you aint the only one said his brother andrew with some effort held his tongue concerning the news of evanhis fortune and his folly till he could talk to the youth in person all took their seats at the early breakfast next morning has evan not comehome yet was the countesss first question mrs mel replied no do you know where he has gone dear mama he chooses his own way and you fear that it leads somewhere added the countess i fear that it leads to knocking up the horse he rides the horse mama he is out on a horse all night but dont you see dear old pet his morals at least are safe on horseback the horse has to be paid for louisa said her mother sternly and then for she had a lesson to read to the guests of her son ready money doesnt come by joking what will the creditors think if he intends to be honest in earnest he must give up four feet mouths fourteen feet maam you mean said old tom counting the heads at table bravo mama cried the countess and as she was sitting near her mother she must show how prettily she kissed by pouting out her playful lips to her parent do be economical always and mind for the sake of the wretched animals i will intercede for you to be his inspector of stables this with a glance of intelligence at her sisters well mr raikes said andrew you keep good hours at all eventseh up with the lark said old tom ha fraid he wont be so early when he gets rid of his present habitseh nec dierum numerum ut nos sed noctium computant said mr raikes and both the brothers sniffed like dogs that have put their noses to a hot coal and the countess who was less insensible to the aristocracy of the dead languages than are women generally gave him the recognition that is occasionally afforded the family tutor about the hour of ten evan arrived he was subjected to the hottest embrace he had ever yet received from his sister louisa darling she called him before them all oh how i suffer for this ignominy i see you compelled for a moment to endure but it is but for a moment they must vacate and you will soon be out of this horrid hole where he just said he was glad to give us a welcome muttered old tom evan heard him and laughed the countess laughed too no we will not be impatient we are poor insignificant people she said and turning to her mother added and yet i doubt not you think the smallest of our landed gentry equal to great continental seigneurs i do not say the contrary you will fill evans head with nonsense till you make him knock up a horse a week and never go to his natural bed said mrs mel angrily look at him is a face like that fit for business certainly certainly not said the countess well mother the horse is dismissedyou wont have to complain any more said evan touching her hand another history commences from to day the countess watched him admiringly such powers of acting she could not have ascribed to him another history indeed she said by the way van love was it out of glamorganshirewere we tudors according to papa or only powys chieftains its of no moment but it helps one in conversation not half so much as good ale though was old toms comment the countess did not perceive its fitness till evan burst into a laugh and then she said oh we shall never be ashamed of the brewery do not fear that mr cogglesby old tom saw his farce reviving and encouraged the countess to patronize him she did so to an extent that called on her mrs mels reprobation which was so cutting and pertinent that harriet was compelled to defend her sister remarking that perhaps her mother would soon learn that louisa was justified in not permitting herself and family to be classed too low at this andrew coming from a private interview with evan threw up his hands and eyes as one who foretold astonishment but counselled humility what with the effort of those who knew a little to imply a great deal of those who knew all to betray nothing and of those who were kept in ignorance to strain a fact out of the conflicting innuendos the general mystification waxed apace and was at its height when a name struck on evans ear that went through his blood like a touch of the torpedo he had been called into the parlour to assist at a consultation over the brewery affairs raikes opened the door and announced sir franks and lady jocelyn them he could meet though it was hard for his pride to pardon their visit to him there but when his eyes discerned rose behind them the passions of his lower nature stood up armed what could she have come for but to humiliate or play with him a very few words enabled the countess to guess the cause for this visit of course it was to beg time but they thanked evan for something generous no doubt sir franks took him aside and returning remarked to his wife that she perhaps would have greater influence with him all this while rose sat talking to mrs andrew cogglesby mrs strike and evans mother she saw by his face the offence she had committed and acted on by one of her impulses said mama i think if i were to speak to mr harrington ere her mother could make light of the suggestion old tom had jumped up and bowed out his arm allow me to conduct ye to the drawing room upstairs young lady hell follow safe enough rose had not stipulated for that nevertheless seeing no cloud on her mothers face or her fathers she gave old tom her hand and awaited a movement from evan it was too late to object to it on either side old tom had caught the tide at the right instant much as if a grim old genie had planted them together the lovers found themselves alone evan you forgive me she began looking up at him timidly with all my heart rose he answered with great cheerfulness no i know your heart better oh evan you must be sure that we respect you too much to wound you we came to thank you for your generosity do you refuse to accept anything from us how can we take this that you thrust on us unless in some way say no more he interposed you see me here you know me as i am now yes yes the tears stood in her eyes why did i come you would ask that is what you cannot forgive i see now how useless it was evan why did you betray me betray you rose you said that you loved me once she was weeping and all his spirit melted and his love cried out i said till death and till death it will be rose then why why did you betray me evan i know it all but if you blackened yourself to me was it not because you loved something better than me and now you think me false which of us two has been false its silly to talk of these things now too late but be just i wish that we may be friends can we unless you bend a little the tears streamed down her cheeks and in her lovely humility he saw the baseness of that pride of his which had hitherto held him up now that you are in this house where i was born and am to live can you regret what has come between us rose her lips quivered in pain can i do anything else but regret it all my life evan how was it possible for him to keep his strength rose he spoke with a passion that made her shrink are you bound to this man and to the drooping of her eyes no impossible for you do not love him break it break the engagement you cannot fulfil break it and belong to me it sounds ill for me to say that in such a place but rose i will leave it i will accept any assistance that your fatherthat any man will give me belovednoble girl i see my falseness to you though i little thought it at the timefool that i was be my help my guideas the soul of my body be mine oh evan she clasped her hands in terror at the change in him that was hurrying her she knew not whither and trembling held them supplicatingly yes rose you have taught me what love can be you cannot marry that man but my honour evan no i do not love him for i can love but one he has my pledge can i break it the stress on the question choked him just as his heart sprang to her can you face the world with me rose oh evan is there an escape for me think decidenono there is not my mother i know looks on it so why did she trust me to be with you here but that she thinks me engaged to him and has such faith in me oh help mebe my guide think whether you would trust me hereafter i should despise myself not if you marry him said evan bitterly and then thinking as men will think when they look on the figure of a fair girl marching serenely to a sacrifice the horrors of which they insist that she ought to know half hating her for her calmnessadoring her for her innocence he said it rests with you rose the world will approve you and if your conscience does whyfarewell and may heaven be your help she murmured farewell did she expect more to be said by him what did she want or hope for now and yet a light of hunger grew in her eyes brighter and brighter as it were on a wave of yearning take my hand once she faltered her hand and her whole shape he took and she with closed eyes let him strain her to his breast their swoon was broken by the opening of the door where old tom cogglesby and lady jocelyn appeared gad he seems to have got his recompenseeh my lady cried old tom however satisfactorily they might have explained the case it certainly did seem so lady jocelyn looked not absolutely displeased old tom was chuckling at her elbow the two principal actors remained dumb i suppose if we leave young people to settle a thing this is how they do it her ladyship remarked gad and they do it well cried old tom rose with a deep blush on her cheeks stepped from evan to her mother not in effrontery but earnestly and as the only way of escaping from the position she said i have succeeded mama he will take what i offer and whats that now old tom inquired rose turned to evan he bent and kissed her hand call it recompense for the nonce said lady jocelyn do you still hold to your original proposition tom every penny my lady i like the young fellow and shes a jolly little lassif she means itshes a woman true said lady jocelyn considering that fact you will oblige me by keeping the matter quiet does she want to try whether the tailors a gentleman still my ladyeh no i fancy she will have to see whether a certain nobleman may be one the countess now joined them sir franks had informed her of her brothers last fine performance after a short uneasy pause she said glancing at evan you know his romantic nature i can assure you he was sincere and even if you could not accept at least but we have accepted countess said rose the estate the estate countess and what is more to increase the effect of his generosity he has consented to take a recompense indeed exclaimed the countess directing a stony look at her brother may i presume to ask what recompense rose shook her head such a very poor one countess he has no idea of relative value the countesss great mind was just then running hot on estates and thousands or she would not have played goose to them you may be sure she believed that evan had been wheedled by rose into the acceptance of a small sum of money in return for his egregious gift with an internal groan the outward aspect of which she had vast difficulty in masking she said you are righthe has no head easily cajoled old tom sat down in a chair and laughed outright lady jocelyn in pity for the poor lady who always amused her thought it time to put an end to the scene i hope your brother will come to us in about a week she said may i expect the favour of your company as well the countess felt her dignity to be far superior as she responded lady jocelyn when next i enjoy the gratification of a visit to your hospitable mansion i must know that i am not at a disadvantage i cannot consent to be twice pulled down to my brothers level evans heart was too full of its dim young happiness to speak or care for words the cold elegance of the countesss curtsey to lady jocelyn her ladyships kindly pressure of his hand roses stedfast look into his eyes old toms smothered exclamation that he was not such a fool as he seemed all passed dream like and when he was left to the fury of the countess he did not ask her to spare him nor did he defend himself she bade adieu to him and their mutual relationship that very day but her star had not forsaken her yet chancing to peep into the shop to intrust a commission to mr john raikes who was there doing penance for his career as a gentleman she heard old tom and andrew laughing utterly unlike bankrupts whod have thought the women such fools and the countess too this was andrews voice he chuckled as one emancipated the countess had a short interview with him before she took her departure to join her husband under the roof of the honourable herbert duffian and andrew chuckled no more chapter xlvii a year later the countess de saldar de sancorvo to her sister caroline rome let the post mark be my reply to your letter received through the consulate and most courteously delivered with the consuls compliments we shall yet have an ambassador at romemark your louisas words yes dearest i am here body and spirit i have at last found a haven a refuge and let those who condemn me compare the peace of their spirits with mine you think that you have quite conquered the dreadfulness of our origin my love i smile at you i know it to be impossible for the protestant heresy to offer a shade of consolation earthly born it rather encourages earthly distinctions it is the sweet sovereign pontiff alone who gathers all in his arms not excepting tailors here if they could know it is their blessed comfort thank harriet for her message she need say nothing by refusing me her hospitality when she must have known that the house was as free of creditors as any foreigner under the rank of count is of soap she drove me to mr duffian oh how i rejoice at her exceeding unkindness how warmly i forgive her the unsisterlyto say the leastvindictiveness of her unaccountable conduct her sufferings will one day be terrible good little andrew supplies her place to me why do you refuse his easily afforded bounty no one need know of it i tell you candidly i take double and the small good punch of a body is only too delighted but then i can be discreet oh the gentlemanliness of these infinitely maligned jesuits they remind me immensely of sir charles grandison and those frontispiece pictures to the novels we read when girlsi mean in manners and the ideas they imposenot in dress or length of leg of course the same winning softness the same irresistible ascendancy over the female mind they require virtue for two i assure you and so i told silva who laughed but the charms of confession my dear i will talk of evan first i have totally forgiven him attach to the naples embassy sounds tol lol in such a position i can rejoice to see him for it permits me to acknowledge him i am not sure that spiritually rose will be his most fitting helpmate however it is done and i did it and there is no more to be said the behaviour of lord laxley in refusing to surrender a young lady who declared that her heart was with another exceeds all i could have supposed one of the noble peers among his ancestors must have been a pig oh the roman nobility grace refinement intrigue perfect comprehension of your ideas wishesthe meanest trifles here you have every worldly charm and all crowned by religion this is my true delight i feel at last that whatsoever i do i cannot go far wrong while i am within hail of my gentle priest i never could feel so before the idea of mr parsley proposing for the beautiful widow strike it was indecent to do so so soonwidowed under such circumstances but i dare say he was as disinterested as a protestant curate ever can be beauty is a good dowry to bring a poor lean worldly curate of your church and he knows that your bishops and arches are quite susceptible to beautiful petitioners and we know here how your livings and benefices are dispensed what do you intend to do come to me come to the bosom of the old and the only true church and i engage to marry you to a roman prince the very next morning or two that is if you have no ideas about prosecuting a certain enterprise which i should not abandon in that case stay as duchess of b mr duffian says you would be cordially welcome to his holiness who may see women that absurd report is all nonsense we do not kiss his toe certainly but we have privileges equally enviable herbert is all charm i confess he is a little wearisome with his old ruins and his dante the poet he is quite of my opinion that evan will never wash out the trade stain on him until he comes over to the church of rome i adjure you caroline to lay this clearly before our dear brother in fact while he continues a protestant to me he is a tailor but here rose is the impediment i know her to be just one of those little dogged minds that are incapable of receiving new impressions was it not evident in the way she stuck to evan after i had once brought them together i am not at all astonished that mr raikes should have married her maid it is a case of natural selection but it is amusing to think of him carrying on the old business in and with credit i suppose his parents are to be pitied but what better is the creature fit for mama displeases me in consenting to act as housekeeper to old grumpus i do not object to the fact for it is prospective but she should have insisted on another place of resort than fallowfield i do not agree with you in thinking her right in refusing a second marriage her age does not shelter her from scandal in your protestant communities i am every day expecting harry jocelyn to turn up he was rightly sent away for to think of the folly evan put into his empty head no he shall have another wife and protestantism shall be his forsaken mistress see how your louy has given up the world and its vanities you expected me to creep up to you contrite and whimpering on the contrary i never felt prouder and i am not going to live a lazy life i can assure you the church hath need of me if only for the peace it hath given me on one point i am eternally bound to serve it postscript i am persuaded of this that it is utterly impossible for a man to be a true gentleman who is not of the true church what it is i cannot say but it is as a convert that i appreciate my husband love is made to me dear for catholics are human the other day it was a question whether a lady or a gentleman should be compromised it required the grossest fib the gentleman did not hesitate and why his priest was handy fancy lord laxley in such a case i shudder this shows that your religion precludes any possibility of the being the real gentleman and whatever evan may think of himself or rose think of him i know the thing

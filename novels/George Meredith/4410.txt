and david widger widgercecometnet the ordeal of richard feverel by george meredith book xxxiv conquest of an epicure xxxv clares marriage xxxvi a dinnerparty at richmond xxxvii mrs berry on matrimony xxxviii an enchantress chapter xxxiv it was the month of july the solent ran up green waves before a full blowing southwester gay little yachts bounded out like foam and flashed their sails light as seanymphs a crown of deep summer blue topped the flying mountains of cloud by an open window that looked on the brine through nodding roses our young bridal pair were at breakfast regaling worthily both of them had the scientific humanist observed them he could not have contested the fact that as a couple who had set up to be father and mother of britons they were doing their duty files of eggcups with disintegrated shells bore witness to it and they were still at work hardly talking from rapidity of exercise both were dressed for an expedition she had her bonnet on and he his yachtinghat his sleeves were turned over at the wrists and her gown showed its lining on her lap at times a chance word might spring a laugh but eating was the business of the hour as i would have you to know it always will be where cupid is in earnest tribute flowed in to them from the subject land neglected lies loves pennywhistle on which they played so prettily and charmed the spheres to hear them what do they care for the spheres who have one another come eggs come bread and butter come tea with sugar in it and milk and welcome the jolly hours that is a fair interpretation of the music in them just now yonder instrument was good only for the overture after all what finer aspiration can lovers have than to be free man and woman in the heart of plenty and is it not a glorious level to have attained ah wretched scientific humanist not to be by and mark the admirable sight of these young creatures feeding it would have been a spell to exorcise the manichee methinks the mighty performance came to an end and then with a flourish of his tablenapkin husband stood over wife who met him on the confident budding of her mouth the poetry of mortals is their daily prose is it not a glorious level to have attained a short quickblooded kiss radiant fresh and honest as aurora and then richard says without lack of cheer no letter today my lucy whereat her sweet eyes dwell on him a little seriously but he cries never mind hell be coming down himself some morning he has only to know her and alls well eh and so saying he puts a hand beneath her chin and seems to frame her fair face in fancy she smiling up to be looked at but one thing i do want to ask my darling says lucy and dropped into his bosom with hands of petition take me on board his yacht with him todaynot leave me with those people will he im a good sailor he knows the best afloat laughs richard hugging her but you know you darling bit of a sailor they dont allow more than a certain number on board for the race and if they hear youve been with me therell be cries of foul play besides theres lady judith to talk to you about austin and lord mountfalcons compliments for you to listen to and mr morton to take care of you lucys eyes fixed sideways an instant i hope i dont frown and blush as i did she said screwing her pliable brows up to him winningly and he bent his cheek against hers and murmured something delicious and we shall be separated forhow many hours one two three hours she pouted to his flatteries and then i shall come on board to receive my brides congratulations and then my husband will talk all the time to lady judith and then i shall see my wife frowning and blushing at lord mountfalcon am i so foolish richard she forgot her trifling to ask in an earnest way and had another aurorean kiss just brushing the dew on her lips for answer after hiding a month in shyest shade the pair of happy sinners had wandered forth one day to look on men and marvel at them and had chanced to meet mr morton of poer hall austin wentworths friend and ralphs uncle mr morton had once been intimate with the baronet but had given him up for many years as impracticable and hopeless for which reason he was the more inclined to regard richards misdemeanour charitably and to lay the faults of the son on the father and thinking society to be the one thing requisite to the young man he had introduced him to the people he knew in the island among others to the lady judith felle a fair young dame who introduced him to lord mountfalcon a puissant nobleman who introduced him to the yachtsmen beginning to congregate so that in a few weeks he found himself in the centre of a brilliant company and for the first time in his life tasted what it was to have free intercourse with his fellowcreatures of both sews the son of a system was therefore launched not only through the surf but in deep waters now the baronet had so far compromised between the recurrence of his softer feelings and the suggestions of his new familiar that he had determined to act toward richard with justness the world called it magnanimity and even lady blandish had some thoughts of the same kind when she heard that he had decreed to richard a handsome allowance and had scouted mrs dorias proposal for him to contest the legality of the marriage but sir austin knew well he was simply just in not withholding money from a youth so situated and here again the world deceived him by embellishing his conduct for what is it to be just to whom we love he knew it was not magnanimous but the cry of the world somehow fortified him in the conceit that in dealing perfect justice to his son he was doing all that was possible because so much more than common fathers would have done he had shut his heart consequently richard did not want money what he wanted more and did not get was a word from his father and though he said nothing to sadden his young bride she felt how much it preyed upon him to be at variance with the man whom now that he had offended him and gone against him he would have fallen on his knees to the man who was as no other man to him she heard him of nights when she lay by his side and the darkness and the broken mutterings of those nights clothed the figure of the strange stern man in her mind not that it affected the appetites of the pretty pair we must not expect that of cupid enthroned and in condition under the influence of seaair too the files of eggcups laugh at such an idea still the worm did gnaw them judge then of their delight when on this pleasant morning as they were issuing from the garden of their cottage to go down to the sea they caught sight of tom bakewell rushing up the road with a portmanteau on his shoulders and some distance behind him discerned adrian its all right shouted richard and ran off to meet him and never left his hand till he had hauled him up firing questions at him all the way to where lucy stood lucy this is adrian my cousinisnt he an angel his eyes seemed to add while lucys clearly answered that he is the fullbodied angel ceremoniously bowed to her and acted with reserved unction the benefactor he saw in their greetings i think we are not strangers he was good enough to remark and very quickly let them know he had not breakfasted on hearing which they hurried him into the house and lucy put herself in motion to have him served dear old rady said richard tugging at his hand again how glad i am youve come i dont mind telling you weve been horridly wretched six seven eight nine eggs was adrians comment on a survey of the breakfasttable why wouldnt he write why didnt he answer one of my letters but here you are so i dont mind now he wants to see us does he well go up tonight ive a match on at eleven my little yachtive called her the blandishagainst fred cuiries begum i shall beat but whether i do or not well go up tonight whats the news what are they all doing my dear boy adrian returned sitting comfortably down let me put myself a little more on an equal footing with you before i undertake to reply half that number of eggs will be sufficient for an unmarried man and then well talk theyre all very well as well as i can recollect after the shaking my total vacuity has had this morning i came over by the first boat and the sea the sea has made me love mother earth and desire of her fruits richard fretted restlessly opposite his cool relative adrian what did he say when he heard of it i want to know exactly what words he said well says the sage my son speech is the small change of silence he said less than i do thats how he took it cried richard and plunged in meditation soon the table was cleared and laid out afresh and lucy preceded the maid bearing eggs on the tray and sat down unbonneted and like a thoroughbred housewife to pour out the tea for him now well commence said adrian tapping his egg with meditative cheerfulness but his expression soon changed to one of pain all the more alarming for his benevolent efforts to conceal it could it be possible the egg was bad oh horror lucy watched him and waited in trepidation this egg has boiled three minutes and threequarters he observed ceasing to contemplate it dear dear said lucy i boiled them myself exactly that time richard likes them so and you like them hard mr harley on the contrary i like them soft two minutes and a half or three quarters at the outside an egg should never rashly verge upon hardness never three minutes is the excess of temerity if richard had told me if i had only known the lovely little hostess interjected ruefully biting her lip we mustnt expect him to pay attention to such matters said adrian trying to smile hang it there are more eggs in the house cried richard and pulled savagely at the bell lucy jumped up saying oh yes i will go and boil some exactly the time you like pray let me go mr harley adrian restrained her departure with a motion of his hand no he said i will be ruled by richards tastes and heaven grant me his digestion lucy threw a sad look at richard who stretched on a sofa and left the burden of the entertainment entirely to her the eggs were a melancholy beginning but her ardour to please adrian would not be damped and she deeply admired his resignation if she failed in pleasing this glorious herald of peace no matter by what small misadventure she apprehended calamity so there sat this fair dove with brows at work above her serious smiling blue eyes covertly studying every aspect of the plump faced epicure that she might learn to propitiate him he shall not think me timid and stupid thought this brave girl and indeed adrian was astonished to find that she could both chat and be useful as well as look ornamental when he had finished one egg behold two fresh ones came in boiled according to his prescription she had quietly given her orders to the maid and he had them without fuss possibly his look of dismay at the offending eggs had not been altogether involuntary and her womans instinct inexperienced as she was may have told her that he had come prepared to be not very well satisfied with anything in loves cottage there was mental faculty in those pliable brows to see through and combat an unwitting wise youth how much she had achieved already she partly divined when adrian said i think now im in case to answer your questions my dear boythanks to mrs richard and he bowed to her his first direct acknowledgment of her position lucy thrilled with pleasure ah cried richard and settled easily on his back to begin the pilgrim has lost his notebook and has been persuaded to offer a reward which shall maintain the happy finder thereof in an asylum for life bensonsuperlative bensonhas turned his shoulders upon raynham none know whither he has departed it is believed that the sole surviving member of the sect of the shaddockdogmatists is under a total eclipse of woman benson gone richard exclaimed what a tremendous time it seems since i left raynham so it is my dear boy the honeymoon is mahomets minute or say the persian kings waterpail that you read of in the story you dip your head in it and when you draw it out you discover that you have lived a life to resume your uncle algernon still roams in pursuit of the lost onei should say hops your uncle hippias has a new and most perplexing symptom a determination of bridecake to the nose ever since your generous present to him though he declares he never consumed a morsel of it he has been under the distressing illusion that his nose is enormous and i assure you he exhibits quite a maidenly timidity in following itthrough a doorway for instance he complains of its terrible weight i have conceived that benson invisible might be sitting on it his hand and the doctors are in hourly consultation with it but i fear it will not grow smaller the pilgrim has begotten upon it a new aphorism that size is a matter of opinion poor uncle hippy said richard i wonder he doesnt believe in magic theres nothing supernatural to rival the wonderful sensations he does believe in good god fancy coming to that im sure im very sorry lucy protested but i cant help laughing charming to the wise youth her pretty laughter sounded the pilgrim has your notion richard whom does he not forestall confirmed dyspepsia is the apparatus of illusions and he accuses the ages that put faith in sorcery of universal indigestion which may have been the case owing to their infamous cookery he says again if you remember that our own age is travelling back to darkness and ignorance through dyspepsia he lays the seat of wisdom in the centre of our system mrs richard for which reason you will understand how sensible i am of the vast obligation i am under to you at the present moment for your especial care of mine richard looked on at lucys little triumph attributing adrians subjugation to her beauty and sweetness she had latterly received a great many compliments on that score which she did not care to hear and adrians homage to a practical quality was far pleasanter to the young wife who shrewdly guessed that her beauty would not help her much in the struggle she had now to maintain adrian continuing to lecture on the excelling virtues of wise cookery a thought struck her where where had she tossed mrs berrys book so thats all about the homepeople said richard all replied adrian or stay you know clares going to be married not your aunt helen oh bother my aunt helen what do you think she had the impertinence to writebut never mind is it to ralph your aunt helen i was going to say my dear boy is an extraordinary woman it was from her originally that the pilgrim first learnt to call the female the practical animal he studies us all you know the pilgrims scrip is the abstract portraiture of his surrounding relatives well your aunt helen mrs doria battledoria laughed richard being foiled in a little pet scheme of her owncall it a system if you likeof some ten or fifteen years standing with regard to miss clare the fair shuttlecockiana instead of fretting like a man and questioning providence and turning herself and everybody else inside out and seeing the world upside down what does the practical animal do she wanted to marry her to somebody she couldnt marry her to so she resolved instantly to marry her to somebody she could marry her to and as old gentlemen enter into these transactions with the practical animal the most readily she fixed upon an old gentleman an unmarried old gentleman a rich old gentleman and now a captive old gentleman the ceremony takes place in about a week from the present time no doubt you will receive your invitation in a day or two and that cold icy wretched clare has consented to marry an old man groaned richard ill put a stop to that when i go to town richard got up and strode about the room then he bethought him it was time to go on board and make preparations im off he said adrian youll take her she goes in the empress mountfalcons vessel he starts us a little schooneryachtsuch a beauty ill have one like her some day goodbye darling he whispered to lucy and his hand and eyes lingered on her and hers on him seeking to make up for the priceless kiss they were debarred from but she quickly looked away from him as he held heradrian stood silent his brows were up and his mouth dubiously contracted he spoke at last go on the water yes its only to st helens short and sharp do you grudge me the nourishment my poor system has just received my son oh bother your system put on your hat and come along ill put you on board in my boat richard i have already paid the penalty of them who are condemned to come to an island i will go with you to the edge of the sea and i will meet you there when you return and take up the tale of the tritons but though i forfeit the pleasure of mrs richards company i refuse to quit the land yes oh mr harley lucy broke from her husband and i will stay with you if you please i dont want to go among those people and we can see it all from the shore dearest i dont want to go you dont mind of course i will go if you wish but i would so much rather stay and she lengthened her plea in her attitude and look to melt the discontent she saw gathering adrian protested that she had much better go that he could amuse himself very well till their return and so forth but she had schemes in her pretty head and held to it to be allowed to stay in spite of lord mountfalcons disappointment cited by richard and at the great risk of vexing her darling as she saw richard pished and glanced contemptuously at adrian he gave way ungraciously there do as you like get your things ready to leave this evening no im not angrywho could be he seemed as he looked up from her modest fondling to ask adrian and seized the indemnity of a kiss on her forehead which however did not immediately disperse the shade of annoyance he felt good heavens he exclaimed such a day as this and a fellow refuses to come on the water well come along to the edge of the sea adrians angelic quality had quite worn off to him he never thought of devoting himself to make the most of the material there was but somebody else did and that fair somebody succeeded wonderfully in a few short hours she induced adrian to reflect that the baronet had only to see her and the family muddle would be smoothed at once he came to it by degrees still the gradations were rapid her manner he liked she was certainly a nice picture best of all she was sensible he forgot the farmers niece in her she was so very sensible she appeared really to understand that it was a womans duty to know how to cook but the difficulty was by what means the baronet could be brought to consent to see her he had not yet consented to see his son and adrian spurred by lady blandish had ventured something in coming down he was not inclined to venture more the small debate in his mind ended by his throwing the burden on time time would bring the matter about christians as well as pagans are in the habit of phrasing this excuse for folding their arms forgetful says the pilgrims scrip that the devils imps enter into no such armistice as she loitered along the shore with her amusing companion lucy had many things to think of there was her darlings match the yachts were started by pistolshot by lord mountfalcon on board the empress and her little heart beat after richards straining sails then there was the strangeness of walking with a relative of richards one who had lived by his side so long and the thought that perhaps this night she would have to appear before the dreaded father of her husband o mr harley she said is it trueare we to go tonight and me she faltered will he see me ah that is what i wanted to talk to you about said adrian i made some reply to our dear boy which he has slightly misinterpreted our second person plural is liable to misconstruction by an ardent mind i said see you and he supposednow mrs richard i am sure you will understand me just at present perhaps it would be advisablewhen the father and son have settled their accounts the daughterinlaw cant be a debtor lucy threw up her blue eyes a halfcowardly delight at the chance of a respite from the awful interview made her quickly apprehensive o mr harley you think he should go alone first well that is my notion but the fact is he is such an excellent husband that i fancy it will require more than a mans power of persuasion to get him to go but i will persuade him mr harley perhaps if you would there is nothing i would not do for his happiness murmured lucy the wise youth pressed her hand with lymphatic approbation they walked on till the yachts had rounded the point is it tonight mr harley she asked with some trouble in her voice now that her darling was out of sight i dont imagine your eloquence even will get him to leave you tonight adrian replied gallantly besides i must speak for myself to achieve the passage to an island is enough for one day no necessity exists for any hurry except in the brain of that impetuous boy you must correct it mrs richard men are made to be managed and women are born managers now if you were to let him know that you dont want to go to night and let him guess after a day or two that you would very much rather you might affect a peculiar repugnance by taking it on yourself you see this wild young man will not require such frightful efforts of persuasion both his father and he are exceedingly delicate subjects and his father unfortunately is not in a position to be managed directly its a strange office to propose to you but it appears to devolve upon you to manage the father through the son prodigal having made his peace you who have done all the work from a distance naturally come into the circle of the paternal smile knowing it due to you i see no other way if richard suspects that his father objects for the present to welcome his daughterinlaw hostilities will be continued the breach will be widened bad will grow to worse and i see no end to it adrian looked in her face as much as to say now are you capable of this piece of heroism and it did seem hard to her that she should have to tell richard she shrank from any trial but the proposition chimed in with her fears and her wishes she thought the wise youth very wise the poor child was not insensible to his flattery and the subtler flattery of making herself in some measure a sacrifice to the home she had disturbed she agreed to simulate as adrian had suggested victory is the commonest heritage of the hero and when richard came on shore proclaiming that the blandish had beaten the begum by seven minutes and threequarters he was hastily kissed and congratulated by his bride with her fingers among the leaves of dr kitchener and anxiously questioned about wine dearest mr harley wants to stay with us a little and he thinks we ought not to go immediatelythat is before he has had some letters and i feel i would so much rather ah thats it you coward said richard well then tomorrow we had a splendid race did you see us oh yes i saw you and was sure my darling would win and again she threw on him the cold water of that solicitude about wine mr harley must have the best you know and we never drink it and im so silly i dont know good wine and if you would send tom where he can get good wine i have seen to the dinner so thats why you didnt come to meet me pardon me darling well i do but mountfalcon doesnt and lady judith thinks you ought to have been there ah but my heart was with you richard put his hand to feel for the little heart her eyelids softened and she ran away it is to say much of the dinner that adrian found no fault with it and was in perfect goodhumour at the conclusion of the service he did not abuse the wine they were able to procure for him which was also much the coffee too had the honour of passing without comment these were sound first steps toward the conquest of an epicure and as yet cupid did not grumble after coffee they strolled out to see the sun set from lady judiths grounds the wind had dropped the clouds had rolled from the zenith and ranged in amphitheatre with distant flushed bodies over sea and land titanic crimson head and chest rising from the wave faced hyperion falling there hung briareus with deepindented trunk and ravined brows stretching all his hands up to unattainable blue summits northwest the range had a rich white glow as if shining to the moon and westward streams of amber melting into upper rose shot out from the dipping disk what sandoe calls the passionflower of heaven said richard under his breath to adrian who was serenely chanting greek hexameters and answered in the swing of the caesura he might as well have said cauliflower lady judith with a black lace veil tied over her head met them in the walk she was tall and dark darkhaired darkeyed sweet and persuasive in her accent and manner a second edition of the blandish thinks adrian she welcomed him as one who had claims on her affability she kissed lucy protectingly and remarking on the wonders of the evening appropriated her husband adrian and lucy found themselves walking behind them the sun was under all the spaces of the sky were alight and richards fancy flamed so youre not intoxicated with your immense triumph this morning said lady judith dont laugh at me when its over i feel ashamed of the trouble ive taken look at that gloryim sure you despise me for it was i not there to applaud you i only think such energies should be turned into some definitely useful channel but you must not go into the army what else can i do you are fit for so much that is better i never can be anything like austin but i think you can do more well i thank you for thinking it lady judith something i will do a man must deserve to live as you say sauces adrian was heard to articulate distinctly in the rear sauces are the top tree of this science a woman who has mastered sauces sits on the apex of civilization briareus reddened duskily seaward the west was all a burning rose how can men see such sights as those and live idle richard resumed i feel ashamed of asking my men to work for meor i feel so now not when youre racing the begum i think theres no necessity for you to turn democrat like austin do you write now no what is writing like mine it doesnt deceive me i know its only the excuse im making to myself for remaining idle i havent written a line sincelately because you are so happy no not because of that of course im very happy he did not finish vague shapeless ambition had replaced love in yonder skies no scientific humanist was by to study the natural development and guide him this lady would hardly be deemed a very proper guide to the undirected energies of the youth yet they had established relations of that nature she was five years older than he and a woman which may explain her serene presumption the cloudgiants had broken up a brawny shoulder smouldered over the sea well work together in town at all events said richard why cant we go about together at night and find out people who want help lady judith smiled and only corrected his nonsense by saying i think we mustnt be too romantic you will become a knighterrant i suppose you have the characteristics of one especially at breakfast adrians unnecessarily emphatic gastronomical lessons to the young wife here came in you must be our champion continued lady judith the rescuer and succourer of distressed dames and damsels we want one badly you do said richard earnestly from what i hear from what i know his thoughts flew off with him as knighterrant hailed shrilly at exceeding critical moment by distressed dames and damsels images of airy towers hung around his fancy performed miraculous feats the towers crumbled the stars grew larger seemed to throb with lustre his fancy crumbled with the towers of the air his heart gave a leap he turned to lucy my darling what have you been doing and as if to compensate her for his little knighterrant infidelity he pressed very tenderly to her we have been engaged in a charming conversation on domestic cookery interposed adrian cookery such an evening as this his face was a handsome likeness of hippias at the presentation of bridecake dearest you know its very useful lucy mirthfully pleaded indeed i quite agree with you child said lady judith and i think you have the laugh of us i certainly will learn to cook some day womans mission in so many words ejaculated adrian and pray what is mans to taste thereof and pronounce thereupon let us give it up to them said lady judith to richard you and i never will make so delightful and beautifully balanced a world of it richard appeared to have grown perfectly willing to give everything up to the fair face his bridal hesper neat day lucy had to act the coward anew and as she did so her heart sank to see how painfully it affected him that she should hesitate to go with him to his father he was patient gentle he sat down by her side to appeal to her reason and used all the arguments he could think of to persuade her if we go together and make him see us both if he sees he has nothing to be ashamed of in yourather everything to be proud of if you are only near him you will not have to speak a word and im certainas certain as that i livethat in a week we shall be settled happily at raynham i know my father so well lucy nobody knows him but i lucy asked whether mr harley did not adrian not a bit adrian only knows a part of people lucy and not the best part lucy was disposed to think more highly of the object of her conquest is it he that has been frightening you lucy no no richard oh dear no she cried and looked at him more tenderly because she was not quite truthful he doesnt know my father at all said richard but lucy had another opinion of the wise youth and secretly maintained it she could not be won to imagine the baronet a man of human mould generous forgiving full of passionate love at heart as richard tried to picture him and thought him now that he beheld him again through adrians embassy to her he was that awful figure shrouded by the midnight why are you so harsh she had heard richard cry more than once she was sure that adrian must be right well i tell you i wont go without you said richard and lucy begged for a little more time cupid now began to grumble and with cause adrian positively refused to go on the water unless that element were smooth as a plate the south west still joked boisterously at any comparison of the sort the days were magnificent richard had yachting engagements and lucy always petitioned to stay to keep adrian company concerning it her duty as hostess arguing with adrian was an absurd idea if richard hinted at his retaining lucy the wise youth would remark its a wholesome interlude to your extremely cupidinous behaviour my dear boy richard asked his wife what they could possibly find to talk about all manner of things said lucy not only cookery he is so amusing though he does make fun of the pilgrims scrip and i think he ought not and then do you know darlingyou wont think me vaini think he is beginning to like me a little richard laughed at the humble mind of his beauty doesnt everybody like you admire you doesnt lord mountfalcon and mr morton and lady judith but he is one of your family richard and they all will if she isnt a coward ah no she sighs and is chidden the conquest of an epicure or any young wifes conquest beyond her husband however loyally devised for their mutual happiness may be costly to her richard in his hours of excitement was thrown very much with lady judith he consulted her regarding what he termed lucys cowardice lady judith said i think shes wrong but you must learn to humour little women then would you advise me to go up alone he asked with a cloudy forehead what else can you do be reconciled yourself as quickly as you can you cant drag her like a captive you know it is not pleasant for a young husband fancying his bride the peerless flower of creation to learn that he must humour a little woman in her it was revolting to richard what i fear he said is that my father will make it smooth with me and not acknowledge her so that whenever i go to him i shall have to leave her and tit for tatan abominable existence like a ball on a billiardtable i wont bear that ignominy and this i know i know she might prevent it at once if she would only be brave and face it you you lady judith you wouldnt be a coward where my old lord tells me to go i go the lady coldly replied theres not much merit in that pray dont cite me women are born cowards you know but i love the women who are not cowards the little thingyour wife has not refused to go nobut tears who can stand tears lucy had come to drop them unaccustomed to have his will thwarted and urgent where he saw the thing to do so clearly the young husband had spoken strong words and she who knew that she would have given her life by inches for him who knew that she was playing a part for his happiness and hiding for his sake the nature that was worthy his esteem the poor little martyr had been weak a moment she had adrians support the wise youth was very comfortable he liked the air of the island and he liked being petted a nice little woman a very nice little woman tom bakewell heard him murmur to himself according to a habit he had and his air of rather succulent patronage as he walked or sat beside the innocent beauty with his head thrown back and a smile that seemed always to be in secret communion with his marked abdominal prominence showed that she was gaining part of what she played for wise youths who buy their loves are not unwilling when opportunity offers to try and obtain the commodity for nothing examinations of her hand as for some occult purpose and unctuous pattings of the same were not infrequent adrian waxed now and then anacreontic in his compliments lucy would say thats worse than lord mountfalcon better english than the noble lord deigns to employallow that quoth adrian he is very kind said lucy to all save to our noble vernacular added adrian he seems to scent a rival to his dignity there it may be that adrian scented a rival to his lymphatic emotions we are at our ease here in excellent society he wrote to lady blandish i am bound to confess that the huron has a happy fortune or a superlative instinct blindfold he has seized upon a suitable mate she can look at a lord and cook for an epicure besides dr kitchener she reads and comments on the pilgrims scrip the love chapter of course takes her fancy that picture of woman drawn by reverence and coloured by love she thinks beautiful and repeats it tossing up pretty eyes also the lovers petition give me purity to be worthy the good in her and grant her patience to reach the good in me tis quite taking to hear her lisp it be sure that i am repeating the petition i make her read me her choice passages she has not a bad voice the lady judith i spoke of is austins miss menteith married to the incapable old lord felle or fellow as the wits here call him lord mountfalcon is his cousin and herwhat she has been trying to find out but they have both got over their perplexity and act respectively the bad man reproved and the chaste counsellor a position in which our young couple found them and haply diverted its perils they had quite taken them in hand lady judith undertakes to cure the fair papist of a pretty modest trick of frowning and blushing when addressed and his lordship directs the exuberant energies of the original man tis thus we fulfil our destinies and are content sometimes they change pupils my lord educates the little dame and my lady the hope of raynham joy and blessings unto all as the german poet sings lady judith accepted the hand of her decrepit lord that she might be of potent service to her fellowcreatures austin you know had great hopes of her i have for the first time in my career a field of lords to study i think it is not without meaning that i am introduced to it by a yeomans niece the language of the two social extremes is similar i find it to consist in an instinctively lavish use of vowels and adjectives my lord and farmer blaize speak the same tongue only my lords has lost its backbone and is limp though fluent their pursuits are identical but that one has money or as the pilgrim terms it vantage and the other has not their ideas seem to have a special relationship in the peculiarity of stopping where they have begun young tom blaize with vantage would be lord mountfalcon even in the character of their parasites i see a resemblance though i am bound to confess that the hon peter brayder who is my lords parasite is by no means noxious this sounds dreadfully democrat pray dont be alarmed the discovery of the affinity between the two extremes of the royal british oak has made me thrice conservative i see now that the national love of a lord is less subservience than a form of selflove putting a goldlace hat on ones image as it were to bow to it i see too the admirable wisdom of our systemcould there be a finer balance of power than in a community where men intellectually nil have lawful vantage and a gold lace hat on how soothing it is to intellectthat noble rebel as the pilgrim has itto stand and bow and know itself superior this exquisite compensation maintains the balance whereas that period anticipated by the pilgrim when science shall have produced an intellectual aristocracy is indeed horrible to contemplate for what despotism is so black as one the mind cannot challenge twill be an iron age wherefore madam i cry and shall continue to cry vive lord mountfalcon long may he sip his burgundy long may the baconfed carry him on their shoulders mr morton who does me the honour to call me young mephisto and socrates missed leaves tomorrow to get master ralph out of a scrape our richard has just been elected member of a club for the promotion of nausea is he happy you ask as much so as one who has had the misfortune to obtain what he wanted can be speed is his passion he races from point to point in emulation of leander and don juan he swam i hear to the opposite shores the other day or some worldshaking feat of the sort himself the hero whom he went to meet or as they who pun say his hero was a bet a pretty little domestic episode occurred this morning he finds her abstracted in the fire of his caresses she turns shy and seeks solitude green jealousy takes hold of him he lies in wait and discovers her with his new rivala veteran edition of the culinary doctor blind to the doctors great national services deaf to her wild music he grasps the intruder dismembers him and performs upon him the treatment he has recommended for dressed cucumber tears and shrieks accompany the descent of the gastronome down she rushes to secure the cherished fragments he follows they find him true to his character alighted and straggling over a bed of blooming flowers yet ere a fairer flower can gather him a heel black as pluto stamps him into earth flowers and allhappy burial pathetic tribute to his merit is watering his grave when by saunters my lord mountfalcon whats the mattah says his lordship soothing his moustache they break apart and tis left to me to explain from the window my lord looks shocked richard is angry with her for having to be ashamed of himself beauty dries her eyes and after a pause of general foolishness the business of life is resumed i may add that the doctor has just been dug up and we are busy in the enemys absence renewing old aeson with enchanted threads by the way a papist priest has blest them a month had passed when adrian wrote this letter he was very comfortable so of course he thought time was doing his duty not a word did he say of richards return and for some reason or other neither richard nor lucy spoke of it now lady blandish wrote back his father thinks he has refused to come to him by your utter silence on the subject i fear that it must be so make him come bring him by force insist on his coming is he mad he must come at once to this adrian replied after a contemplative comfortable lapse of a day or two which might be laid to his efforts to adopt the ladys advice the point is that the half man declines to come without the whole man the terrible question of sex is our obstruction lady blandish was in despair she had no positive assurance that the baronet would see his son the mask put them all in the dark but she thought she saw in sir austin irritation that the offender at least when the opening to come and make his peace seemed to be before him should let days and weeks go by she saw through the mask sufficiently not to have any hope of his consenting to receive the couple at present she was sure that his equanimity was fictitious but she pierced no farther or she might have started and asked herself is this the heart of a woman the lady at last wrote to richard she said come instantly and come alone then richard against his judgment gave way my father is not the man i thought him he exclaimed sadly and lucy felt his eyes saying to her and you too are not the woman i thought you nothing could the poor little heart reply but strain to his bosom and sleeplessly pray in his arms all the night chapter xxxv three weeks after richard arrived in town his cousin clare was married under the blessings of her energetic mother and with the approbation of her kinsfolk to the husband that had been expeditiously chosen for her the gentleman though something more than twice the age of his bride had no idea of approaching senility for many long connubial years to come backed by his tailor and his hairdresser he presented no such bad figure at the altar and none would have thought that he was an ancient admirer of his brides mama as certainly none knew he had lately proposed for mrs doria before there was any question of her daughter these things were secrets and the elastic and happy appearance of mr john todhunter did not betray them at the altar perhaps he would rather have married the mother he was a man of property well born tolerably well educated and had when mrs doria rejected him for the first time the reputation of being a foolwhich a wealthy man may have in his youth but as he lived on and did not squander his moneyamassed it on the contrary and did not seek to go into parliament and did other negative wise things the worlds opinion as usual veered completely round and john todhunter was esteemed a shrewd sensible manonly not brilliant that he was brilliant could not be said of him in fact the man could hardly talk and it was a fortunate provision that no impromptu deliveries were required of him in the marriageservice mrs doria had her own reasons for being in a hurry she had discovered something of the strange impassive nature of her child not from any confession of clares but from signs a mother can read when her eyes are not resolutely shut she saw with alarm and anguish that clare had fallen into the pit she had been digging for her so laboriously in vain she entreated the baronet to break the disgraceful and as she said illegal alliance his son had contracted sir austin would not even stop the little pension to poor berry at least you will do that austin she begged pathetically you will show your sense of that horrid womans conduct he refused to offer up any victim to console her then mrs doria told him her thoughtsand when an outraged energetic lady is finally brought to exhibit these painfully hoarded treasures she does not use half words as a medium his system and his conduct generally were denounced to him without analysis she let him understand that the world laughed at him and he heard this from her at a time when his mask was still soft and liable to be acted on by his nerves you are weak austin weak i tell you she said and like all angry and selfinterested people prophecy came easy to her in her heart she accused him of her own fault in imputing to him the wreck of her project the baronet allowed her to revel in the proclamation of a dire future and quietly counselled her to keep apart from him which his sister assured him she would do but to be passive in calamity is the province of no woman mark the race at any hour what revolution and hubbub does not that little instrument the needle avert from us says the pilgrims scrip alas that in calamity women cannot stitch now that she saw clare wanted other than iron it struck her she must have a husband and be made secure as a woman and a wife this seemed the thing to do and as she had forced the iron down clares throat so she forced the husband and clare gulped at the latter as she had at the former on the very day that mrs doria had this new track shaped out before her john todhunter called at the foreys old john sang out mrs doria show him up to me i want to see him particularly he sat with her alone he was a man multitudes of women would have marriedwhom will they notand who would have married any presentable woman but women do want asking and john never had the word the rape of such men is left to the practical animal so john sat alone with his old flame he had become resigned to her perpetual lamentation and living suttee for his defunct rival but ha what meant those soft glances nowaddressed to him his tailor and his hairdresser gave youth to john but they had not the art to bestow upon him distinction and an undistinguished man what woman looks at john was an indistinguishable man for that reason he was dry wood to a soft glance and now she said it is time you should marry and you are the man to be the guide and helper of a young woman john you are well preserved younger than most of the young men of our day you are eminently domestic a good son and will be a good husband and good father some one you must marrywhat do you think of clare for a wife for you at first john todhunter thought it would be very much like his marrying a baby however he listened to it and that was enough for mrs doria she went down to johns mother and consulted with her on the propriety of the scheme of wedding her daughter to john in accordance with his proposition mrs todhunters jealousy of any disturbing force in the influence she held over her son mrs doria knew to be one of the causes of johns remaining constant to the impression she had aforetime produced on him she spoke so kindly of john and laid so much stress on the ingrained obedience and passive disposition of her daughter that mrs todhunter was led to admit she did think it almost time john should be seeking a mate and that heall things consideredwould hardly find a fitter one and this john todhunterold john no moreheard to his amazement when a day or two subsequently he instanced the probable disapproval of his mother the match was arranged mrs doria did the wooing it consisted in telling clare that she had come to years when marriage was desirable and that she had fallen into habits of moping which might have the worse effect on her future life as it had on her present health and appearance and which a husband would cure richard was told by mrs doria that clare had instantaneously consented to accept mr john todhunter as lord of her days and with more than obediencewith alacrity at all events when richard spoke to clare the strange passive creature did not admit constraint on her inclinations mrs doria allowed richard to speak to her she laughed at his futile endeavours to undo her work and the boyish sentiments he uttered on the subject let us see child she said let us see which turns out the best a marriage of passion or a marriage of common sense heroic efforts were not wanting to arrest the union richard made repeated journeys to hounslow where ralph was quartered and if ralph could have been persuaded to carry off a young lady who did not love him from the bridegroom her mother averred she did love mrs doria might have been defeated but ralph in his cavalry quarters was cooler than ralph in the bursley meadows women are oddities dick he remarked running a finger right and left along his upper lip best leave them to their own freaks shes a dear girl though she doesnt talk i like her for that if she cared for me id go the race she never did its no use asking a girl twice she knows whether she cares a fig for a fellow the hero quitted him with some contempt as ralph morton was a young man and he had determined that john todhunter was an old man he sought another private interview with clare and getting her alone said clare ive come to you for the last time will you marry ralph morton to which clare replied i cannot marry two husbands richard will you refuse to marry this old man i must do as mama wishes then youre going to marry an old mana man you dont love and cant love oh good god do you know what youre doing he flung about in a fury do you know what it is clare he caught her two hands violently have you any idea of the horror youre going to commit she shrank a little at his vehemence but neither blushed nor stammered answering i see nothing wrong in doing what mama thinks right richard your mother i tell you its an infamy clare its a miserable sin i tell you if i had done such a thing i would not live an hour after it and coldly to prepare for it to be busy about your dresses they told me when i came in that you were with the milliner to be smiling over the horrible outrage decorating yourself dear richard said clare you will make me very unhappy that one of my blood should be so debased he cried brushing angrily at his face unhappy i beg you to feel for yourself clare but i suppose and he said it scornfully girls dont feel this sort of shame she grew a trifle paler next to mama i would wish to please you dear richard have you no will of your own he exclaimed she looked at him softly a look he interpreted for the meekness he detested in her no i believe you have none he added and what can i do i cant step forward and stop this accursed marriage if you would but say a word i would save you but you tie my hands and they expect me to stand by and see it done will you not be there richard said clare following the question with her soft eyes it was the same voice that had so thrilled him on his marriage morn oh my darling clare he cried in the kindest way he had ever used to her if you knew how i feel this and now as he wept she wept and came insensibly into his arms my darling clare he repeated she said nothing but seemed to shudder weeping you will do it clare you will be sacrificed so lovely as you are too clare you cannot be quite blind if i dared speak to you and tell you all look up can you still consent i must not disobey mama clare murmured without looking up from the nest her cheek had made on his bosom then kiss me for the last time said richard ill never kiss you after it clare he bent his head to meet her mouth and she threw her arms wildly round him and kissed him convulsively and clung to his lips shutting her eyes her face suffused with a burning red then he left her unaware of the meaning of those passionate kisses argument with mrs doria was like firing paperpellets against a stone wall to her indeed the young married hero spoke almost indecorously and that which his delicacy withheld him from speaking to clare he could provoke nothing more responsive from the practical animal than poohpooh tush tush and fiddlededee really mrs doria said to her intimates that boys education acts like a disease on him he cannot regard anything sensibly he is for ever in some mad excess of his fancy and what he will come to at last heaven only knows i sincerely pray that austin will be able to bear it threats of prayer however that harp upon their sincerity are not very well worth having mrs doria had embarked in a practical controversy as it were with her brother doubtless she did trust he would be able to bear his sorrows to come but one who has uttered prophecy can barely help hoping to see it fulfilled she had prophecied much grief to the baronet poor john todhunter who would rather have married the mother and had none of your heroic notions about the sacred necessity for love in marriage moved as one guiltless of offence and deserving his happiness mrs doria shielded him from the hero to see him smile at clares obedient figure and try not to look paternal was touching meantime clares marriage served one purpose it completely occupied richards mind and prevented him from chafing at the vexation of not finding his father ready to meet him when he came to town a letter had awaited adrian at the hotel which said detain him till you hear further from me take him about with you into every form of society no more than that adrian had to extemporize that the baronet had gone down to wales on pressing business and would be back in a week or so for ulterior inventions and devices wherewith to keep the young gentleman in town he applied to mrs doria leave him to me said mrs doria ill manage him and she did who can say asks the pilgrims scrip when he is not walking a puppet to some woman mrs doria would hear no good of lucy i believe she observed as adrian ventured a shrugging protest in her behalfit is my firm opinion that a scullerymaid would turn any of you men round her little fingeronly give her time and opportunity by dwelling on the arts of women she reconciled it to her conscience to do her best to divide the young husband from his wife till it pleased his father they should live their unhallowed union again without compunction or a sense of incongruity she abused her brother and assisted the fulfilment of his behests so the puppets were marshalled by mrs doria happy or sad or indifferent quite against his set resolve and the tide of his feelings richard found himself standing behind clare in the churchthe very edifice that had witnessed his own marriage and heard i clare doria take thee john pemberton clearly pronounced he stood with black brows dissecting the arts of the tailor and hairdresser on unconscious john the back and much of the middle of mr todhunters head was bald the back shone like an eggshell but across the middle the artist had drawn two long dabs of hair from the sides and plastered them cunningly so that all save wilful eyes would have acknowledged the head to be covered the mans only pretension was to a respectable juvenility he had a good chest stout limbs a face inclined to be jolly mrs doria had no cause to be put out of countenance at all by the exterior of her soninlaw nor was she her splendid hair and gratified smile made a light in the church playing puppets must be an immense pleasure to the practical animal the forey bridesmaids five in number and one miss doria their cousin stood as girls do stand at these sacrifices whether happy sad or indifferent a smile on their lips and tears in attendance old mrs todhunter an exceedingly small ancient woman was also there i cant have my boy john married without seeing it done she said and throughout the ceremony she was muttering audible encomiums on her johns manly behaviour the ring was affixed to clares finger there was no ring lost in this commonsense marriage the instant the clergyman bade him employ it john drew the ring out and dropped it on the finger of the cold passive hand in a businesslike way as one who had studied the matter mrs doria glanced aside at richard richard observed clare spread out her fingers that the operation might be the more easily effected he did duty in the vestry a few minutes and then said to his aunt now ill go youll come to the breakfast child the foreys he cut her short ive stood for the family and ill do no more i wont pretend to eat and make merry over it richard goodbye she had attained her object and she wisely gave way well go and kiss clare and shake his hand pray pray be civil she turned to adrian and said he is going you must go with him and find some means of keeping him or hell be running off to that woman now no wordsgo richard bade clare farewell she put up her mouth to him humbly but he kissed her on the forehead do not cease to love me she said in a quavering whisper in his ear mr todhunter stood beaming and endangering the art of the hairdresser with his pockethandkerchief now he positively was married he thought he would rather have the daughter than the mother which is a reverse of the order of human thankfulness at a gift of the gods richard my boy he said heartily congratulate me i should be happy to if i could sedately replied the hero to the consternation of those around nodding to the bridesmaids and bowing to the old lady he passed out adrian who had been behind him deputed to watch for a possible unpleasantness just hinted to john you know poor fellow he has got into a mess with his marriage oh ah yes kindly said john poor fellow all the puppets then rolled off to the breakfast adrian hurried after richard in an extremely discontented state of mind not to be at the breakfast and see the best of the fun disgusted him however he remembered that he was a philosopher and the strong disgust he felt was only expressed in concentrated cynicism on every earthly matter engendered by the conversation they walked side by side into kensington gardens the hero was mouthing away to himself talking by fits presently he faced adrian crying and i might have stopped it i see it now i might have stopped it by going straight to him and asking him if he dared marry a girl who did not love him and i never thought of it good heaven i feel this miserable affair on my conscience ah groaned adrian an unpleasant cargo for the conscience that i would rather carry anything on mine than a married couple do you purpose going to him now the hero soliloquized hes not a bad sort of man well hes not a cavalier said adrian and thats why you wonder your aunt selected him no doubt hes decidedly of the roundhead type with the puritan extracted or inoffensive if latent theres the double infamy cried richard that a man you cant call bad should do this damned thing well its hard we cant find a villain he would have listened to me im sure go to him now richard my son go to him now its not yet too late who knows if he really has a noble elevated superior mindthough not a cavalier in person he may be one at hearthe might to please you and since you put such stress upon it abstainperhaps with some loss of dignity but never mind and the request might be singular or seem so but everything has happened before in this world you know my dear boy and what an infinite consolation it is for the eccentric that reflection the hero was impervious to the wise youth he stared at him as if he were but a speck in the universe he visioned it was provoking that richard should be adrians best subject for cynical pastime in the extraordinary heterodoxies he started and his worst in the way he took it and the wise youth against his will had to feel as conscious of the young mans imaginative mental armour as he was of his muscular physical the same sort of day mused richard looking up i suppose my fathers right we make our own fates and nature has nothing to do with it adrian yawned some difference in the trees though richard continued abstractedly growing bald at the top said adrian will you believe that my aunt helen compared the conduct of that wretched slave clare to lucys who she had the cruel insolence to say entangled me into marriage the hero broke out loudly and rapidly you knowi told you adrianhow i had to threaten and insist and how she pleaded and implored me to wait ah hum mumbled adrian you remember my telling you richard was earnest to hear her exonerated pleaded and implored my dear boy oh no doubt she did wheres the lass that doesnt call my wife by another name if you please the generic title cant be cancelled because of your having married one of the body my son she did all she could to persuade me to wait emphasized richard adrian shook his head with a deplorable smile come come my good ricky not all not all richard bellowed what more could she have done she could have shaved her head for instance this happy shaft did stick with a furious exclamation richard shot in front adrian following him and asking him merely to have his assumption verified whether he did not think she might have shaved her head and presuming her to have done so whether in candour he did not think he would have waitedat least till she looked less of a rank lunatic after a minute or so the wise youth was but a fly buzzing about richards head three weeks of separation from lucy and an excitement deceased caused him to have soft yearnings for the dear lovely home face he told adrian it was his intention to go down that night adrian immediately became serious he was at a loss what to invent to detain him beyond the stale fiction that his father was coming tomorrow he rendered homage to the genius of woman in these straits my aunt he thought would have the lie ready and not only that but she would take care it did its work at this juncture the voice of a cavalier in the row hailed them proving to be the honourable peter brayder lord mountfalcons parasite he greeted them very cordially and richard remembering some fun they had in the island asked him to dine with them postponing his return till the next day lucy was his it was even sweet to dally with the delight of seeing her the hon peter was one who did honour to the body he belonged to though not so tall as a west of london footman he was as shapely and he had a power of making his voice insinuating or arrogant as it suited the exigencies of his profession he had not a rap of money in the world yet he rode a horse lived high expended largely the world said that the hon peter was salaried by his lordship and that in common with that of parasite he exercised the ancient companion profession this the world said and still smiled at the hon peter for he was an engaging fellow and where he went not lord mountfalcon would not go they had a quiet little hotel dinner ordered by adrian and made a square at the table ripton thompson being the fourth richard sent down to his office to fetch him and the two friends shook hands for the first time since the great deed had been executed deep was the old dogs delight to hear the praises of his beauty sounded by such aristocratic lips as the hon peter brayders all through the dinner he was throwing out hints and small queries to get a fuller account of her and when the claret had circulated he spoke a word or two himself and heard the hon peter eulogize his taste and wish him a bride as beautiful at which ripton blushed and said he had no hope of that and the hon peter assured him marriage did not break the mould after the wine this gentleman took his cigar on the balcony and found occasion to get some conversation with adrian alone our young friend heremade it all right with the governor he asked carelessly oh yes said adrian but it struck him that brayder might be of assistance in showing richard a little of the society in every form required by his chiefs prescript that is he continued we are not yet permitted an interview with the august author of our being and i have rather a difficult post tis mine both to keep him here and also to find him the opportunity to measure himself with his fellowman in other words his father wants him to see something of life before he enters upon housekeeping now i am proud to confess that im hardly equal to the task the demi or damnedmondeif its that lie wants him to observeis one that i leave not got the walk to ha ha laughed brayder you do the keeping i offer to parade the demi i must say though its a queer notion of the old gentleman its the continuation of a philosophic plan said adrian brayder followed the curvings of the whiff of his cigar with his eyes and ejaculated infernally philosophic has lord mountfalcon left the island adrian inquired mount to tell the truth i dont know where he is chasing some light craft i suppose thats poor mounts weakness its his ruin poor fellow hes so confoundedly in earnest at the game he ought to know it by this time if fame speaks true remarked adrian hes a baby about women and always will be said brayder hes been once or twice wanting to marry them now theres a womanyouve heard of mrs mount all the world knows herif that woman hadnt scandalizedthe young man joined them and checked the communication brayder winked to adrian and pitifully indicated the presence of an innocent a married man you know said adrian yes yeswe wont shock him brayder observed he appeared to study the young man while they talked next morning richard was surprised by a visit from his aunt mrs doria took a seat by his side and spoke as follows my dear nephew now you know i have always loved you and thought of your welfare as if you had been my own child more than that i fear well now you are thinking of returning toto that placeare you not yes it is as i thought very well now let me speak to you you are in a much more dangerous position than you imagine i dont deny your fathers affection for you it would be absurd to deny it but you are of an age now to appreciate his character whatever you may do he will always give you money that you are sure of that you know very well but you are one to want more than money you want his love richard i am convinced you will never be happy whatever base pleasures you may be led into if he should withhold his love from you now child you know you have grievously offended him i wish not to animadvert on your conductyou fancied yourself in love and so on and you were rash the less said of it the better now but you must nowit is your duty now to do somethingto do everything that lies in your power to show him you repent no interruptions listen to me you must consider him austin is not like other men austin requires the most delicate management you mustwhether you feel it or nopresent an appearance of contrition i counsel it for the good of all he is just like a woman and where his feelings are offended he wants utter subservience he has you in town and he does not see younow you know that he and i are not in communication we have likewise our differenceswell he has you in town and he holds aloofhe is trying you my dear richard no he is not at raynham i do not know where he is he is trying you child and you must be patient you must convince him that you do not care utterly for your own gratification if this personi wish to speak of her with respect for your sakewell if she loves you at allif i say she loves you one atom she will repeat my solicitations for you to stay and patiently wait here till he consents to see you i tell you candidly its your only chance of ever getting him to receive her that you should know and now richard i may add that there is something else you should know you should know that it depends entirely upon your conduct now whether you are to see your fathers heart for ever divided from you and a new family at raynham you do not understand i will explain brothers and sisters are excellent things for young people but a new brood of them can hardly be acceptable to a young man in fact they are and must be aliens i only tell you what i have heard on good authority dont you understand now foolish boy if you do not humour him he will marry her oh i am sure of it i know it and this you will drive him to i do not warn you on the score of your prospects but of your feelings i should regard such a contingency richard as a final division between you think of the scandal but alas that is the least of the evils it was mrs dorias object to produce an impression and avoid an argument she therefore left him as soon as she had as she supposed made her mark on the young man richard was very silent during the speech and save for an exclamation or so had listened attentively he pondered on what his aunt said he loved lady blandish and yet he did not wish to see her lady feverel mrs doria laid painful stress on the scandal and though he did not give his mind to this he thought of it he thought of his mother where was she but most his thoughts recurred to his father and something akin to jealousy slowly awakened his heart to him he had given him up and had not latterly felt extremely filial but he could not bear the idea of a division in the love of which he had ever been the idol and sole object and such a man too so good so generous if it was jealousy that roused the young mans heart to his father the better part of love was also revived in it he thought of old days of his fathers forbearance his own wilfulness he looked on himself and what he had done with the eyes of such a man he determined to do all he could to regain his favour mrs doria learnt from adrian in the evening that her nephew intended waiting in town another week that will do smiled mrs doria he will be more patient at the end of a week oh does patience beget patience said adrian i was not aware it was a propagating virtue i surrender him to you i shant be able to hold him in after one week more i assure you my dear aunt hes already thank you no explanation mrs doria begged when richard saw her nest he was informed that she had received a most satisfactory letter from mrs john todhunter quite a glowing account of johns behaviour but on richards desiring to know the words clare had written mrs doria objected to be explicit and shot into worldly gossip clare seldom glows said richard no i mean for her his aunt remarked dont look like your father child i should like to have seen the letter said richard mrs doria did not propose to show it chapter xxxvi a lady driving a pair of greys was noticed by richard in his rides and walks she passed him rather obviously and often she was very handsome a bold beauty with shining black hair red lips and eyes not afraid of men the hair was brushed from her temples leaving one of those fine reckless outlines which the action of driving and the pace admirably set off she took his fancy he liked the air of petulant gallantry about her and mused upon the picture rare to him of a glorious dashing woman he thought too she looked at him he was not at the time inclined to be vain or he might have been sure she did once it struck him she nodded slightly he asked adrian one day in the parkwho she was i dont know her said adrian probably a superior priestess of paphos now thats my idea of bellona richard exclaimed not the fury they paint but a spirited dauntless eagerlooking creature like that bellona returned the wise youth i dont think her hair was black red wasnt it i shouldnt compare her to bellona though no doubt shes as ready to spill blood look at her she does seem to scent carnage i see your idea no i should liken her to diana emerged from the tutorship of master endymion and at nice play among the gods depend upon itthey tell us nothing of the matterolympus shrouds the storybut you may be certain that when she left the pretty shepherd she had greater vogue than venus up aloft brayder joined them see mrs mount go by he said oh thats mrs mount cried adrian whos mrs mount richard inquired a sister to miss random my dear boy like to know her drawled the hon peter richard replied indifferently no and mrs mount passed out of sight and out of the conversation the young man wrote submissive letters to his father i have remained here waiting to see you now five weeks he wrote i have written to you three letters and you do not reply to them let me tell you again how sincerely i desire and pray that you will come or permit me to come to you and throw myself at your feet and beg my forgiveness and hers she as earnestly implores it indeed i am very wretched sir believe me there is nothing i would not do to regain your esteem and the love i fear i have unhappily forfeited i will remain another week in the hope of hearing from you or seeing you i beg of you sir not to drive me mad whatever you ask of me i will consent to nothing he would not do the baronet commented as he read there is nothing he would not do he will remain another week and give me that final chance and it is i who drive him mad already he is beginning to cast his retribution on my shoulders sir austin had really gone down to wales to be out of the way a shaddockdogmatist does not meet misfortune without hearing of it and the author of the pilgrims scrip in trouble found london too hot for him he quitted london to take refuge among the mountains living there in solitary commune with a virgin notebook some indefinite scheme was in his head in this treatment of his son had he construed it it would have looked ugly and it settled to a vague principle that the young man should be tried and tested let him learn to deny himself something let him live with his equals for a term if he loves me he will read my wishes thus he explained his principle to lady blandish the lady wrote you speak of a term till when may i name one to him it is the dreadful uncertainty that reduces him to despair that and nothing else pray be explicit in return he distantly indicated richards majority how could lady blandish go and ask the young man to wait a year away from his wife her instinct began to open a wide eye on the idol she worshipped when people do not themselves know what they mean they succeed in deceiving and imposing upon others not only was lady blandish mystified mrs doria who pierced into the recesses of everybodys mind and had always been in the habit of reading off her brother from infancy and had never known herself to be once wrong about him she confessed she was quite at a loss to comprehend austins principle for principle he has said mrs doria he never acts without one but what it is i cannot at present perceive if he would write and command the boy to await his return all would be clear he allows us to go and fetch him and then leaves us all in a quandary it must be some womans influence that is the only way to account for it singular interjected adrian what pride women have in their sex well i have to tell you my dear aunt that the day after tomorrow i hand my charge over to your keeping i cant hold him in an hour longer ive had to leash him with lies till my inventions exhausted i petition to have them put down to the chiefs account but when the stream runs dry i can do no more the last was that i had heard from him desiring me to have the southwest bedroom ready for him on tuesday proximate so says my son ill wait till then and from the gigantic effort he exhibited in coming to it i doubt any human powers getting him to wait longer we must we must detain him said mrs doria if we do not i am convinced austin will do something rash that he will for ever repent he will marry that woman adrian mark my words now with any other young man but richards education that ridiculous system has he no distraction nothing to amuse him poor boy i suppose he wants his own particular playfellow the wise youth had to bow to a reproof i tell you adrian he will marry that woman my dear aunt can a chaste man do aught more commendable has the boy no object we can induce him to followif he had but a profession what say you to the regeneration of the streets of london and the profession of moralscavenger aunt i assure you i have served a months apprenticeship with him we sally forth on the tenth hour of the night a female passes i hear him groan is she one of them adrian i am compelled to admit she is not the saint he deems it the portion of every creature wearing petticoats to be another groan an evident internal it cannot beand yetthat we hear on the stage rollings of eyes impious questionings of the creator of the universe savage mutterings against brutal males and then we meet a second young person and repeat the performanceof which i am rather tired it would be all very well but he turns upon me and lectures me because i dont hire a house and furnish it for all the women one meets to live in in purity now thats too much to ask of a quiet man master thompson has latterly relieved me im happy to say mrs doria thought her thoughts has austin written to you since you were in town not an aphorism returned adrian i must see richard tomorrow morning mrs doria ended the colloquy by saying the result of her interview with her nephew was that richard made no allusion to a departure on the tuesday and for many days afterward he appeared to have an absorbing business on his hands but what it was adrian did not then learn and his admiration of mrs dorias genius for management rose to a very high pitch on a morning in october they had an early visitor in the person of the hon peter whom they had not seen for a week or more gentlemen he said flourishing his cane in his most affable manner ive come to propose to you to join us in a little dinnerparty at richmond nobodys in town you know londons as dead as a stockfish nothing but the scrapings to offer you but the weathers fine i flatter myself youll find the company agreeable what says my friend feverel richard begged to be excused no no positively you must come said the hon peter ive had some trouble to get them together to relieve the dulness of your incarceration richmonds within the rules of your prison you can be back by night moonlight on the waterlovely woman weve engaged a citybarge to pull us back eight oarsim not sure it isnt sixteen comethe word adrian was for going richard said he had an appointment with ripton youre in for another rick you two said adrian arrange that we go you havent seen the cockneys paradise abjure blazes and taste of peace my son after some persuasion richard yawned wearily and got up and threw aside the care that was on him saying very well just as you like well take old rip with us adrian consulted brayders eye at this the hon peter briskly declared he should be delighted to have feverels friend and offered to take them all down in his drag if you dont get a match on to swim there with the tideeh feverel my boy richard replied that he had given up that sort of thing at which brayder communicated a queer glance to adrian and applauded the youth richmond was under a still october sun the pleasant landscape bathed in autumn stretched from the foot of the hill to a red horizon haze the day was like none that richard vividly remembered it touched no link in the chain of his recollection it was quiet and belonged to the spirit of the season adrian had divined the character of the scrapings they were to meet brayder introduced them to one or two of the men hastily and in rather an undervoice as a thing to get over they made their bow to the first knot of ladies they encountered propriety was observed strictly even to severity the general talk was of the weather here and there a lady would seize a buttonhole or any little bit of the habiliments of the man she was addressing and if it came to her to chide him she did it with more than a forefinger this however was only here and there and a privilege of intimacy where ladies are gathered together the queen of the assemblage may be known by her court of males the queen of the present gathering leaned against a corner of the open window surrounded by a stalwart court in whom a practised eye would have discerned guardsmen and ripton with a sinking of the heart apprehended lords they were fine men offering inanimate homage the trim of their whiskerage the cut of their coats the highbred indolence in their aspect eclipsed riptons sense of self esteem but they kindly looked over him occasionally one committed a momentary outrage on him with an eyeglass seeming to cry out in a voice of scathing scorn whos this and ripton got closer to his hero to justify his humble pretensions to existence and an identity in the shadow of him richard gazed about heroes do not always know what to say or do and the cold bath before dinner in strange company is one of the instances he had recognized his superb bellona in the lady by the garden window for brayder the men had nods and yokes the ladies a pretty playfulness he was very busy passing between the groups chatting laughing taking the feminine taps he received and sometimes returning them in sly whispers adrian sat down and crossed his legs looking amused and benignant whose dinner is it ripton heard a mignonne beauty ask of a cavalier mounts i suppose was the answer where is he why dont he come an affaire i fancy there he is again how shamefully he treats mrs mount she dont seem to cry over it mrs mount was flashing her teeth and eyes with laughter at one of her court who appeared to be fool dinner was announced the ladies proclaimed extravagant appetites brayder posted his three friends ripton found himself under the lee of a dame with a bosom on the other aide of him was the mignonne adrian was at the lower end of the table ladies were in profusion and he had his share brayder drew richard from seat to seat a happy man had established himself next to mrs mount him brayder hailed to take the head of the table the happy man objected brayder continued urgent the lady tenderly insisted the happy man grimaced dropped into the post of honour strove to look placable richard usurped his chair and was not badly welcomed by his neighbour then the dinner commenced and had all the attention of the company till the flying of the first champagnecork gave the signal and a hum began to spread sparkling wine that looseneth the tongue and displayeth the verity hath also the quality of colouring it the ladies laughed high richard only thought them gay and natural they flung back in their chairs and laughed to tears ripton thought only of the pleasure he had in their society the champagnecorks continued a regular filefiring where have you been lately i havent seen you in the park said mrs mount to richard no he replied ive not been there the question seemed odd she spoke so simply that it did not impress him he emptied his glass and had it filled again the hon peter did most of the open talking which related to horses yachting opera and sport generally who was ruined by what horse or by what woman he told one or two of richards feats fair smiles rewarded the hero do you bet said mrs mount only on myself returned richard bravo cried his bellona and her eye sent a lingering delirious sparkle across her brimming glass at him im sure youre a safe one to back she added and seemed to scan his points approvingly richards cheeks mounted bloom dont you adore champagne quoth the dame with a bosom to ripton oh yes answered ripton with more candour than accuracy i always drink it do you indeed said the enraptured bosom ogling him you would be a friend now i hope you dont object to a lady joining you now and then champagnes my folly a laugh was circling among the ladies of whom adrian was the centre first low and as he continued some narration peals resounded till those excluded from the fun demanded the cue and ladies leaned behind gentlemen to take it up and formed an electric chain of laughter each one as her ear received it caught up her handkerchief and laughed and looked shocked afterwards or looked shocked and then spouted laughter the anecdote might have been communicated to the bewildered cavaliers but coming to a lady of a demurer cast she looked shocked without laughing and reproved the female table in whose breasts it was consigned to burial but here and there a mans head was seen bent and a ladys mouth moved though her face was not turned toward him and a mans broad laugh was presently heard while the lady gazed unconsciously before her and preserved her gravity if she could escape any other ladys eyes failing in which handkerchiefs were simultaneously seized and a second chime arose till the tickling force subsided to a few chance bursts what nonsense it is that my father writes about women thought richard he says they cant laugh and dont understand humour it comes he reflected of his shutting himself from the world and the idea that he was seeing the world and feeling wiser flattered him he talked fluently to his dangerous bellona he gave her some reminiscences of adrians whimsies oh said she thats your tutor is it she eyed the young man as if she thought he must go far and fast ripton felt a push look at that said the bosom fuming utter disgust he was directed to see a manly arm round the waist of the mignonne now thats what i dont like in company the bosom inflated to observe with sufficient emphasis she always will allow it with everybody give her a nudge ripton protested that he dared not upon which she said then i will and inclined her sumptuous bust across his lap breathing wine in his face and gave the nudge the mignonne turned an inquiring eye on ripton a mischievous spark shot from it she laughed and said arent you satisfied with the old girl impudence muttered the bosom growing grander and redder do do fill her glass and keep her quietshe drinks port when theres no more champagne said the mignonne the bosom revenged herself by whispering to ripton scandal of the mignonne and between them he was enabled to form a correcter estimate of the company and quite recovered from his original awe so much so as to feel a touch of jealousy at seeing his lively little neighbour still held in absolute possession mrs mount did not come out much but there was a deferential manner in the bearing of the men toward her which those haughty creatures accord not save to clever women and she contrived to hold the talk with three or four at the head of the table while she still had passages aside with richard the port and claret went very well after the champagne the ladies here did not ignominiously surrender the field to the gentlemen they maintained their position with honour silver was seen far out on thames the wine ebbed and the laughter sentiment and cigars took up the wondrous tale oh what a lovely night said the ladies looking above charming said the gentlemen looking below the faintsmelling cool autumn air was pleasant after the feast fragrant weeds burned bright about the garden we are split into couples said adrian to richard who was standing alone eying the landscape tis the influence of the moon apparently we are in cyprus how has my son enjoyed himself how likes he the society of aspasia i feel like a wise greek tonight adrian was jolly and rolled comfortably as he talked ripton had been carried off by the sentimental bosom he came up to them and whispered by jove ricky do you know what sort of women these are richard said he thought them a nice sort puritan exclaimed adrian slapping ripton on the back why didnt you get tipsy sir dont you ever intoxicate yourself except at lawful marriages reveal to us what you have done with the portly dame ripton endured his bantering that he might hang about richard and watch over him he was jealous of his innocent beautys husband being in proximity with such women murmuring couples passed them to and fro by jove ricky ripton favoured his friend with another hard whisper theres a woman smoking and why not o riptonus said adrian art unaware that woman cosmopolitan is woman consummate and dost grumble to pay the small price for the splendid gem well i dont like women to smoke said plain ripton why maynt they do what men do the hero cried impetuously i hate that contemptible narrowmindedness its that makes the ruin and horrors i see why maynt they do what men do i like the women who are brave enough not to be hypocrites by heaven if these women are bad i like them better than a set of hypocritical creatures who are all show and deceive you in the end bravo shouted adrian there speaks the regenerator ripton as usual was crushed by his leader he had no argument he still thought women ought not to smoke and he thought of one far away lonely by the sea who was perfect without being cosmopolitan the pilgrims scrip remarks that young men take joy in nothing so much as the thinking women angels and nothing sours men of experience more than knowing that all are not quite so the aphorist would have pardoned ripton thompson his first random extravagance had he perceived the simple warmhearted worship of feminine goodness richards young bride had inspired in the breast of the youth it might possibly have taught him to put deeper trust in our nature ripton thought of her and had a feeling of sadness he wandered about the grounds by himself went through an open postern and threw himself down among some bushes on the slope of the hill lying there and meditating he became aware of voices conversing what does he want said a womans voice its another of his villanies i know upon my honour brayder when i think of what i have to reproach him for i think i must go mad or kill him tragic said the hon peter havent you revenged yourself bella pretty often best deal openly this is a commercial transaction you ask for money and you are to have iton the conditions double the sum and debts paid he applies to me you know my dear bella it has long been all up between you i think mount has behaved very well considering all he knows hes not easily hoodwinked you know he resigns himself to his fate and follows other game then the condition is that i am to seduce this young man my dear bella you strike your bird like a hawk i didnt say seduce hold him inplay with him amuse him i dont understand halfmeasures women seldom do how i hate you brayder i thank your ladyship the two walked farther ripton had heard some little of the colloquy he left the spot in a serious mood apprehensive of something dark to the people he loved though he had no idea of what the hon peters stipulation involved on the voyage back to town richard was again selected to sit by mrs mount brayder and adrian started the jokes the pair of parasites got on extremely well together soft fell the plash of the oars softly the moonlight curled around them softly the banks glided by the ladies were in a state of high sentiment they sang without request all deemed the british balladmonger an appropriate interpreter of their emotions after good wine and plenty thereof fair throats will make men of taste swallow that remarkable composer eyes lips hearts darts and smarts and sighs beauty duty bosom blossom false one farewell to this pathetic strain they melted mrs mount though strongly requested declined to sing she preserved her state under the tall aspens of brentfordait and on they swept the white moon in their wake richards hand lay open by his side mrs mounts little white hand by misadventure fell into it it was not pressed or soothed for its fall or made intimate with eloquent fingers it lay there like a bit of snow on the cold ground a yellow leaf wavering down from the aspens struck richards cheek and he drew away the very hand to throw back his hair and smooth his face and then folded his arms unconscious of offence he was thinking ambitiously of his life his blood was untroubled his brain calmly working which is the more perilous is a problem put by the pilgrim to meet the temptings of eve or to pique her mrs mount stared at the young man as at a curiosity and turned to flirt with one of her court the guardsmen were mostly sentimental one or two rattled and one was such a goodhumoured fellow that adrian could not make him ridiculous the others seemed to give themselves up to a silent waxing in length of limb however far they sat removed everybody was entangled in their legs pursuing his studies adrian came to the conclusion that the same close intellectual and moral affinity which he had discovered to exist between our nobility and our yeomanry is to be observed between the guardsman class and that of the corps de ballet they both live by the strength of their legs where also their wits if they do not altogether reside there are principally developed both are volage wine tobacco and the moon influence both alike and admitting the one marked difference that does exist it is after all pretty nearly the same thing to be coquetting and sinning on two legs as on the point of a toe a long guardsman with a deep bass voice sang a doleful song about the twining tendrils of the heart ruthlessly torn but required urgent persuasions and heavy trumpeting of his lungs to get to the end before he had accomplished it adrian had contrived to raise a laugh in his neighbourhood so that the company was divided and the camp split jollity returned to onehalf while sentiment held the other ripton blotted behind the bosom was only lucky in securing a higher degree of heat than was possible for the rest are you cold she would ask smiling charitably i am said the mignonne as if to excuse her conduct you always appear to be the fat one sniffed and snapped wont you warm two mrs mortimer said the naughty little woman disdain prevented any further notice of her those familiar with the ladies enjoyed their sparring which was frequent the mignonne was heard to whisper that poor fellow will certainly be stewed very prettily the ladies took and gave warmth for the air on the water was chill and misty adrian had beside him the demure one who had stopped the circulation of his anecdote she in nowise objected to the fair exchange but said hush betweenwhiles past kew and hammersmith on the cool smooth water across putney reach through battersea bridge and the city grew around them and the shadows of great millfactories slept athwart the moonlight all the ladies prattled sweetly of a charming day when they alighted on land several cavaliers crushed for the honour of conducting mrs mount to her home my broughams here i shall go alone said mrs mount some one arrange my shawl she turned her back to richard who had a view of a delicate neck as he manipulated with the bearing of a mailed knight which way are you going she asked carelessly and to his reply as to the direction said then i can give you a lift and she took his arm with a matterofcourse air and walked up the stairs with him ripton saw what had happened he was going to follow the portly dame retained him and desired him to get her a cab oh you happy fellow said the brighteyed mignonne passing by ripton procured the cab and stuffed it full without having to get into it himself try and let him come in too said the persecuting creature again passing take liberties with pour menyou shant with me retorted the angry bosom and drove off so shes been and gone and run away and left him after all his trouble cried the pert little thing peering into riptons eyes now youll never be so foolish as to pin your faith to fat women again there he shall be made happy another time she gave his nose a comical tap and tripped away with her possessor ripton rather forgot his friend for some minutes random thoughts laid hold of him cabs and carriages rattled past he was sure he had been among members of the nobility that day though when they went by him now they only recognized him with an effort of the eyelids he began to think of the day with exultation as an event recollections of the mignonne were captivating blue eyesjust what i like and such a little impudent nose and red lips poutingthe very thing i like and her hair darkish i thinksay brown and so saucy and light on her feet and kind she is or she wouldnt have talked to me like that thus with a groaning soul he pictured her his reason voluntarily consigned her to the aristocracy as a natural appanage but he did amorously wish that fortune had made a lord of him then his mind reverted to mrs mount and the strange bits of the conversation he had heard on the hill he was not one to suspect anybody positively he was timid of fixing a suspicion it hovered indefinitely and clouded people without stirring him to any resolve still the attentions of the lady toward richard were queer he endeavoured to imagine they were in the nature of things because richard was so handsome that any woman must take to him but hes married said ripton and he mustnt go near these people if hes married not a high morality perhaps better than none at all better for the world were it practised more he thought of richard along with that sparkling dame alone with her the adorable beauty of his dear bride her pure heavenly face swam before him thinking of her he lost sight of the mignonne who had made him giddy he walked to richards hotel and up and down the street there hoping every minute to hear his step sometimes fancying he might have returned and gone to bed two oclock struck ripton could not go away he was sure he should not sleep if he did at last the cold sent him homeward and leaving the street on the moonlight side of piccadilly he met his friend patrolling with his head up and that swing of the feet proper to men who are chanting verses old rip cried richard cheerily what on earth are you doing here at this hour of the morning ripton muttered of his pleasure at meeting him i wanted to shake your hand before i went home richard smiled on him in an amused kindly way that all you may shake my hand any day like a true man as you are old rip ive been speaking about you do you know thatmrs mountnever saw you all the time at richmond or in the boat oh ripton said well assured that he was a dwarf you saw her safe home yes ive been there for the last couple of hourstalking she talks capitally shes wonderfully clever shes very like a man only much nicer i like her but richard excuse meim sure i dont mean to offend youbut now youre marriedperhaps you couldnt help seeing her home but i think you really indeed oughtnt to have gone upstairs ripton delivered this opinion with a modest impressiveness what do you mean said richard you dont suppose i care for any woman but my little darling down there he laughed no of course not thats absurd what i mean is that people perhaps willyou know they dothey say all manner of things and that makes unhappiness and i do wish you were going home tomorrow ricky i mean to your dear wife ripton blushed and looked away as he spoke the hero gave one of his scornful glances so youre anxious about my reputation i hate that way of looking on women because they have been once misledlook how much weaker they arebecause the world has given them an ill fame you would treat them as contagious and keep away from them for the sake of your character it would be different with me quoth ripton how asked the hero because im worse than you was all the logical explanation ripton was capable of i do hope you will go home soon he added yes said richard and i so do i hope so but ive work to do now i dare not i cannot leave it lucy would be the last to ask meyou saw her letter yesterday now listen to me rip i want to make you be just to women then he read ripton a lecture on erring women speaking of them as if he had known them and studied them for years clever beautiful but betrayed by love it was the first duty of all true men to cherish and redeem them we turn them into curses rip these divine creatures and the world suffered for it thatthat was the root of all the evil in the world i dont feel anger or horror at these poor women rip its strange i knew what they were when we came home in the boat but i doit tears my heart to see a young girl given over to an old mana man she doesnt love thats shamedont speak of it forgetting to contest the premiss that all betrayed women are betrayed by love ripton was quite silenced he like most young men had pondered somewhat on this matter and was inclined to be sentimental when be was not hungry they walked in the moonlight by the railings of the park richard harangued at leisure while riptons teeth chattered chivalry might be dead but still there was something to do went the strain the lady of the day had not been thrown in the heros path without an object he said and he was sadly right there he did not express the thing clearly nevertheless ripton understood him to mean he intended to rescue that lady from further transgressions and show a certain scorn of the world that lady and then other ladies unknown were to be rescued ripton was to help he and ripton were to be the knights of this enterprise when appealed to ripton acquiesced and shivered not only were they to be knights they would have to be titans for the powers of the world the spurious ruling social gods would have to be defied and overthrown and titan number one flung up his handsome bold face as if to challenge base jove on the spot and titan number two strained the upper button of his coat to meet across his pockethandkerchief on his chest and warmed his fingers under his coat tails the moon had fallen from her high seat and was in the mists of the west when he was allowed to seek his blankets and the cold acting on his friends eloquence made riptons flesh very contrite the poor fellow had thinner blood than the hero but his heart was good by the time he had got a little warmth about him his heart gratefully strove to encourage him in the conception of becoming a knight and a titan and so striving ripton fell asleep and dreamed chapter xxxvii behold the hero embarked in the redemption of an erring beautiful woman alas writes the pilgrim at this very time to lady blandish i cannot get that legend of the serpent from me the more i think has he not caught you and ranked you foremost in his legions for see till you were fashioned the fruits hung immobile on the boughs they swayed before us glistening and cold the hand must be eager that plucked them they did not come down to us and smile and speak our language and read our thoughts and know when to fly when to follow how surely to have us do but mark one of you standing openly in the track of the serpent what shall be done with her i fear the world is wiser than its judges turn from her says the world by day the sons of the world do it darkens and they dance together downward then comes there one of the worlds elect who deems old counsel devilish indifference to the end of evil worse than its pursuit he comes to reclaim her from deepest bane will he bring her back to highest blessing is not that a bait already poor fish tis wondrous flattering the serpent has slimed her so to secure him with slow weary steps he draws her into light she clings to him she is human part of his work and he loves it as they mount upward he looks on her more while she it may be looks above what has touched him what has passed out of her and into him the serpent laughs below at the gateways of the sun they fall together this alliterative production was written without any sense of the peril that makes prophecy it suited sir austin to write thus it was a channel to his acrimony moderated through his philosophy the letter was a reply to a vehement entreaty from lady blandish for him to come up to richard and forgive him thoroughly richards name was not mentioned in it he tries to be more than he is thought the lady and she began insensibly to conceive him less than he was the baronet was conscious of a certain false gratification in his sons apparent obedience to his wishes and complete submission a gratification he chose to accept as his due without dissecting or accounting for it the intelligence reiterating that richard waited and still waited richards letters and more his dumb abiding and practical penitence vindicated humanity sufficiently to stop the course of virulent aphorisms he could speak we have seen in sorrow for this frail nature of ours that he had once stood forth to champion but how long will this last he demanded with the air of hippias he did not reflect how long it had lasted indeed his indigestion of wrath had made of him a moral dyspepsy it was not mere obedience that held richard from the aims of his young wife nor was it this new knightly enterprise he had presumed to undertake hero as he was a youth open to the insane promptings of hot blood he was not a fool there had been talk between him and mrs doria of his mother now that he had broken from his father his heart spoke for her she lived he knew he knew no more words painfully hovering along the borders of plain speech had been communicated to him filling him with moody imaginings if he thought of her the red was on his face though he could not have said why but now after canvassing the conduct of his father and throwing him aside as a terrible riddle he asked mrs doria to tell him of his other parent as softly as she could she told the story to her the shame was past she could weep for the poor lady richard dropped no tears disgrace of this kind is always present to a son and educated as he had been these tidings were a vivid fire in his brain he resolved to hunt her out and take her from the man here was work set to his hand all her dear husband did was right to lucy she encouraged him to stay for that purpose thinking it also served another there was tom bakewell to watch over lucy there was work for him to do whether it would please his father he did not stop to consider as to the justice of the act let us say nothing on ripton devolved the humbler task of grubbing for sandoes place of residence and as he was unacquainted with the name by which the poet now went in private his endeavours were not immediately successful the friends met in the evening at lady blandishs townhouse or at the foreys where mrs doria procured the reverer of the royal martyr and staunch conservative a favourable reception pity deep pity for richards conduct ripton saw breathing out of mrs doria algernon feverel treated his nephew with a sort of rough commiseration as a young fellow who had run off the road pity was in lady blandishs eyes though for a different cause she doubted if she did well in seconding his fathers unwise scheme supposing him to have a scheme she saw the young husband encompassed by dangers at a critical time not a word of mrs mount had been breathed to her but the lady had some knowledge of life she touched on delicate verges to the baronet in her letters and he understood her well enough if he loves this person to whom he has bound himself what fear for him or are you coming to think it something that bears the name of love because we have to veil the rightful appellation so he responded remote among the mountains she tried very hard to speak plainly finally he came to say that he denied himself the pleasure of seeing his son specially that he for a time might be put to the test the lady seemed to dread this was almost too much for lady blandish loves charity boy so loftily serene now that she saw him half denudeda thing of shanks and wristswas a trial for her true heart going home at night richard would laugh at the faces made about his marriage well carry the day rip my lucy and i or ill do it alone what there is to do he slightly adverted to a natural want of courage in women which ripton took to indicate that his beauty was deficient in that quality up leapt the old dog im sure there never was a braver creature upon earth richard shes as brave as shes lovely ill swear she is look how she behaved that day how her voice sounded she was trembling brave shed follow you into battle richard and richard rejoined talk on dear old rip shes my darling love whatever she is and she is gloriously lovely no eyes are like hers ill go down tomorrow morning the first thing ripton only wondered the husband of such a treasure could remain apart from it so thought richard for a space but if i go rip he said despondently if i go for a day even i shall have undone all my work with my father she says it herselfyou saw it in her last letter yes ripton assented and the words please remember me to dear mr thompson fluttered about the old dogs heart it came to pass that mrs berry having certain business that led her through kensington gardens spied a figure that she had once dandled in long clothes and helped make a man of if ever woman did he was walking under the trees beside a lady talking to her not indifferently the gentleman was her bridegroom and her babe i know his back said mrs berry as if she had branded a mark on it in infancy but the lady was not her bride mrs berry diverged from the path and got before them on the left flank she stared retreated and came round upon the right there was that in the ladys face which mrs berry did not like her innermost question was why he was not walking with his own wife she stopped in front of them they broke and passed about her the lady made a laughing remark to him whereat he turned to look and mrs berry bobbed she had to bob a second time and then he remembered the worthy creature and hailed her penelope shaking her hand so that he put her in countenance again mrs berry was extremely agitated he dismissed her promising to call upon her in the evening she heard the lady slip out something from a side of her lip and they both laughed as she toddled off to a sheltering tree to wipe a corner of each eye i dont like the looks of that woman she said and repeated it resolutely why doesnt he walk arminarm with her was her neat inquiry wheres his wife succeeded it after many interrogations of the sort she arrived at naming the lady a boldfaced thing adding subsequently brazen the lady had apparently shown mrs berry that she wished to get rid of her and had checked the outpouring of her emotions on the breast of her babe i know a lady when i see one said mrs berry i havent lived with em for nothing and if shes a lady bred and born i wasnt married in the church alive then if not a lady what was she mrs berry desired to know shes imitation lady im sure she is berry vowed i say she dont look proper establishing the lady to be a spurious article however what was one to think of a married man in company with such oh no it aint that mrs berry returned immediately on the charitable tack belike its some one of his acquaintance ve married her for her looks and heve just met her why itd be as bad as my berry the relinquished spouse of berry ejaculated in horror at the idea of a second man being so monstrous in wickedness just coupled too mrs berry groaned on the suspicious side of the debate and such a sweet young thing for his wife but no ill never believe it not if he tell me so himself and men dont do that she whimpered women are swift at coming to conclusions in these matters soft women exceedingly swift and soft women who have been betrayed are rapid beyond measure mrs berry had not cogitated long ere she pronounced distinctly and without a shadow of dubiosity my opinion ismarried or not married and wheresomever he pick her upshes nothin more nor less than a bella donna as which poisonous plant she forthwith registered the lady in the botanical notebook of her brain it would have astonished mrs mount to have heard her person so accurately hit off at a glance in the evening richard made good his promise accompanied by ripton mrs berry opened the door to them she could not wait to get him into the parlour youre my own blessed babe and im as good as your mother though i didnt suck ye bein a maid she cried falling into his arms while richard did his best to support the unexpected burden then reproaching him tenderly for his guileat mention of which ripton chuckled deeming it his own most honourable portion of the plotmrs berry led them into the parlour and revealed to richard who she was and how she had tossed him and hugged him and kissed him all over when he was only that bigshowing him her stumpy fat arm i kissed ye from head to tail i did said mrs berry and you neednt be ashamed of it its be hoped youll never have nothin worse come tye my dear richard assured her he was not a bit ashamed but warned her that she must not do it now mrs berry admitting it was out of the question now and now that he had a wife moreover the young men laughed and ripton laughing overloudly drew on himself mrs berrys attention but that mr thompson therehowever he can look me in the face after his inncence helping blindfold an old woman though i aint sorry for what i didthat im free for to say and its over and blessed be all amen so now where is she and how is she mr richard my dearits only cuttin off the s and you are as you waswhy didnt ye bring her with ye to see her old berry richard hurriedly explained that lucy was still in the isle of wight oh and youve left her for a day or two said mrs berry good god i wish it had been a day or two cried richard ah and how long have it been asked mrs berry her heart beginning to beat at his manner of speaking dont talk about it said richard oh you never been dudgeonin already oh you havent been peckin at one another yet mrs berry exclaimed ripton interposed to tell her such fears were unfounded then how long ha you been divided in a guilty voice ripton stammered since september september breathed mrs berry counting on her fingers september october novtwo months and more nigh three a young married husband away from the wife of his bosom nigh three months oh my oh my what do that mean my father sent for meim waiting to see him said richard a few more words helped mrs berry to comprehend the condition of affairs then mrs berry spread her lap flattened out her hands fixed her eyes and spoke my dear young gentlemanid like to call ye my darlin babe im going to speak as a mother to ye whether ye likes it or no and what old berry says you wont mind for shes had ye when there was no conventionals about ye and she has the feelins of a mother to you though humble her state if theres one that know matrimony its me my dear though berry did give me no more but nine months of it and ive known the worst of matrimony which if you wants to be woeful wise there it is for ye for what have been my gain that man gave me nothin but his name and bessy andrews was as good as bessy berry though both is bs and says he you was a and now yous b so youre my a b he says write yourself down that he says the bad man with his jokesberry went to service mrs berrys softness came upon her so i tell ye berry went to service he left the wife of his bosom forlorn and he went to service because he were allays an ambitious man and wasnt so to speak happy out of his uniformwhich was his liverynot even in my arms and he let me know it he got among them kitchen sluts which was my mournin ready made and worse than a widows cap to me which is no shame to wear and some say becoming theres no man as ever lived known better than my berry how to show his legs to advantage and gals look at em i dont wonder now that berry was prostrated his temptations was strong and his flesh was weak then what i say is that for a young married

dear young gentleman some mens hearts is vagabonds bornthey must go astray its their natur to but all men are men and i know the foundation of em by reason of my woe mrs berry paused richard was humorously respectful to the sermon the truth in the good creatures address was not to be disputed or despised notwithstanding the inclination to laugh provoked by her quaint way of putting it ripton nodded encouragingly at every sentence for he saw her drift and wished to second it seeking for an illustration of her meaning mrs berry solemnly continued we all know what checked prespiration is but neither of the young gentlemen could resist this out they burst in a roar of laughter laugh away said mrs berry i dont mind ye i say again we all do know what checked prespiration is it fly to the lungs it gives ye mortal inflammation and it carries ye off then i say checked matrimony is as bad it fly to the heart and it carries off the virtue thats in ye and you might as well be dead them that

ripton struck in mrs richard would do anything in the world her husband asked her im quite sure bless you for your good opinion mr thompson why see her she aint frail on her feet she looks ye straight

from that darlin richard paced up and down a fathers will urged mrs berry thats a sons law but he mustnt go again the laws of his nature to do it just be quiet at presenttalk of other things theres a good woman said richard mrs berry meekly folded her arms how strange now our meetin like this meetin at all too she remarked contemplatively its them advertisements they brings people together from the ends of the earth for good or for bad i often say theres more lucky accidents or unlucky ones since advertisements was the rule than ever there was before they make a number of romances depend upon it do you walk much in the gardens my dear now and then said richard very pleasant it is there with the fine folks and flowers and titled people continued mrs berry that was a handsome woman you was a walkin beside this mornin very said richard she was a handsome woman or i should say is for her day aint past and she know it i thought at firstby her backit might ha been your aunt mrs forey for she do step out well and hold up her shoulders straight as a dart she be but when i come to see her faceoh dear me says i this aint one of the family they none of em got such bold facesnor no lady as i know have but shes a fine womanthat nobody can gainsay mrs berry talked further of the fine woman it was a liberty she took to speak in this disrespectful tone of her and mrs berry was quite aware that she was laying herself open to rebuke she had her end in view no rebuke was uttered and during her talk she observed intercourse passing between the eyes of the young men look here penelope richard stopped her at last will it make you comfortable if i tell you ill obey the laws of my nature and go down at the end of the week ill thank the lord of heaven if you do she exclaimed very well thenbe happyi will now listen i want you to keep your rooms for methose she had i expect in a day or two to bring a lady here a lady faltered mrs berry yes a lady may i make so bold as to ask what lady you may not not now of course you will know mrs berrys short neck made the best imitation it could of an offended swans action she was very angry she said she did not like so many ladies which natural objection richard met by saying that there was only one lady and mrs berry he added dropping his voice you will treat her as you did my dear girl for she will require not only shelter but kindness i would rather leave her with you than with any one she has been very unfortunate his serious air and habitual tone of command fascinated the softness of berry and it was not until he had gone that she spoke out unfortnate hes going to bring me an unfortnate female oh not from my babe can i bear that never will i have her here i see it its that boldfaced woman hes got mixed up in and sheve been and made the young man think hell go for to reform her its one o their arts that is and hes too innocent a young man to mean anythin else but i aint a house of magdalens no and sooner than have her here id have the roof fall over me i would she sat down to eat her supper on the sublime resolve in love mrs berrys charity was all on the side of the law and this is the case with many of her sisters the pilgrim sneers at them for it and would have us credit that it is their admirable instinct which at the expense of every virtue save one preserves the artificial barrier simply to impose upon us men i presume are hardly fair judges and should stand aside and mark early next day mrs berry bundled off to richards hotel to let him know her determination she did not find him there returning homeward through the park she beheld him on horseback riding by the side of the identical lady the sight of this public exposure shocked her more than the secret walk under the trees you dont look near your reform yet mrs berry apostrophized her you dont look to me one thatd come the fair penitent till youve left off bein fairif then you do which some of ye dont laugh away and show yet airs spite o your hat and feather and your ridin habit youre a belle donna setting her down again absolutely for such whatever it might signify mrs berry had a virtuous glow in the evening she heard the noise of wheels stopping at the door never she rose from her chair to exclaim he aint rided her out in the mornin and been and made a magdalen of her afore dark a lady veiled was brought into the house by richard mrs berry feebly tried to bar his progress in the passage he pushed past her and conducted the lady into the parlour without speaking mrs berry did not follow she heard him murmur a few sentences within then he came out all her crest stood up as she whispered vigorously mr richard if that woman stay here i go forth my house aint a penitentiary for unfortnate females sir he frowned at her curiously but as she was on the point of renewing her indignant protest he clapped his hand across her mouth and spoke words in her ear that had awful import to her she trembled breathing low my god forgive me richard and her virtue was humbled lady feverel is it your mother mr richard and her virtue was humbled chapter xxxviii one may suppose that a prematurely aged oily little man a poet in bad circumstances a decrepit butterfly chained to a disappointed inkstand will not put out strenuous energies to retain his ancient paramour when a robust young man comes imperatively to demand his mother of him in her person the colloquy was short between diaper sandoe and richard the question was referred to the poor spiritless lady who seeing that her son made no question of it cast herself on his hands small loss to her was diaper but he was the loss of habit and that is something to a woman who has lived the blood of her son had been running so long alien from her that the sense of her motherhood smote he now with strangeness and richards stern gentleness seemed like dreadful justice come upon her her heart had almost forgotten its maternal functions she called him sir till he bade her remember he was her son her voice sounded to him like that of a brokenthroated lamb so painful and weak it was with the plaintive stop in the utterance when he kissed her her skin was cold her thin hand fell out of his when his grasp related can sin hunt one like this he asked bitterly reproaching himself for the shame she had caused him to endure and a deep compassion filled his breast poetic justice had been dealt to diaper the poet he thought of all he had sacrificed for this womanthe comfortable quarters the friend the happy flights he could not but accuse her of unfaithfulness in leaving him in his old age habit had legalized his union with her he wrote as pathetically of the break of habit as men feel at the death of love and when we are old and have no fair hope tossing golden locks before us a wound to this our second nature is quite as sad i know not even if it be not actually sadder day by day richard visited his mother lady blandish and ripton alone were in the secret adrian let him do as he pleased he thought proper to tell him that the public recognition he accorded to a particular lady was in the present state of the world scarcely prudent tis a proof to me of your moral rectitude my son but the world will not think so no one character is sufficient to cover twoin a protestant country especially the divinity that doth hedge a bishop would have no chance in contact with your madam danae drop the woman my son or permit me to speak what you would have her hear richard listened to him with disgust well youve had my doctorial warning said adrian and plunged back into his book when lady feverel had revived to take part in the consultations mrs berry perpetually opened on the subject of richards matrimonial duty another chain was cast about him do not oh do not offend your father was her one repeated supplication sir austin had grown to be a vindictive phantom in her mind she never wept but when she said this so mrs berry to whom richard had once made mention of lady blandish as the only friend he had among women bundled off in her blacksatin dress to obtain an interview with her and an ally after coming to an understanding on the matter of the visit and reiterating many of her views concerning young married people mrs berry said my lady if i may speak so bold id say the sin thats bein done is the sin o the lookerson and when everybody appear frightened by that young gentlemans father ill sayhopin your pardonthey no cause be frighted at all for though its nigh twenty year since i knew him and i knew him then just sixteen monthsno moreill say his hearts as soft as a womans which ive cause for to know and thats it thats where everybodys deceived by him and i was its because he keeps his face and makes ye think youre dealin with a man of iron and all the while theres a woman underneath and a man thats like a woman hes the puzzle o life we can see through ourselves my lady and we can see through men but one o that sorthes like somethin out of nature then i sayhopin be excusedwhats to do is for to treat him like a woman and not for to let him have his own waywhich he dont know himself and is why nobody else do let that sweet young couple come together and be wholesome in spite of him i say and then give him time to come round just like a woman and round hell come and give em his blessin and we shall know weve made him comfortable hes angry because matrimony have come between him and his son and he womanlike hes wantin to treat what is as if it isnt but matrimonys a holier than him it began long long before him and its be hoped will endoor longs the time after if the worlds not coming to rackwishin him no harm now mrs berry only put lady blandishs thoughts in bad english the lady took upon herself seriously to advise richard to send for his wife he wrote bidding her come lucy however had wits and inexperienced wits are as a little knowledge in pursuance of her sage plan to make the family feel her worth and to conquer the members of it one by one she had got up a correspondence with adrian whom it tickled adrian constantly assured her all was going well time would heal the wound if both the offenders had the fortitude to be patient he fancied he saw signs of the baronets relenting they must do nothing to arrest those favourable symptoms indeed the wise youth was languidly seeking to produce them he wrote and felt as lucys benefactor so lucy replied to her husband a cheerful rigmarole he could make nothing of save that she was happy in hope and still had fears then mrs berry trained her fist to indite a letter to her bride her bride answered it by saying she trusted to time you poor marter mrs berry wrote back i know what your sufferins be they is the only kind a wife should never hide from her husband he thinks all sorts of things if she can abide being away and you trusting to time why its like trusting not to catch cold out of your natural clothes there was no shaking lucys firmness richard gave it up he began to think that the life lying behind him was the life of a fool what had he done in it he had burnt a rick and got married he associated the two acts of his existence where was the hero he was to have carved out of tom bakewella wretch he had taught to lie and chicane and for what great heavens how ignoble did a flash from the light of his aspirations make his marriage appear the young man sought amusement he allowed his aunt to drag him into society and sick of that he made late evening calls on mrs mount oblivious of the purpose he had in visiting her at all her manlike conversation which he took for honesty was a refreshing change on fair lips call me bella ill call you dick said she and it came to be bella and dick between them no mention of bella occurred in richards letters to lucy mrs mount spoke quite openly of herself i pretend to be no better than i am she said and i know im no worse than many a woman who holds her head high to back this she told him stories of blooming dames of good repute and poured a little social sewerage into his ears also she understood him what you want my dear dick is something to do you went and got married like ahumfriends must be respectful go into the army try the turf i can put you up to a trick or two friends should make themselves useful she told him what she liked in him youre the only man i was ever alone with who dont talk to me of love and make me feel sick i hate men who cant speak to a woman sensiblyjust wait a minute she left him and presently returned with ah dick old fellow how are you arrayed like a cavalier one arm stuck in her side her hat jauntily cocked and a pretty oath on her lips to give reality to the costume what do you think of me wasnt it a shame to make a woman of me when i was born to be a man i dont know that said richard for the contrast in her attire to those shooting eyes and lips aired her sex bewitchingly what you think i dont do it well charming but i cant forget now that is too bad she pouted then she proposed that they should go out into the midnight streets arm inarm and out they went and had great fits of laughter at her impertinent manner of using her eyeglass and outrageous affectation of the supreme dandy they take up men dick for going about in womens clothes and vice versaw i suppose youll bail me old fellaa if i have to make my bow to the beak wont you say its becas im an honest woman and dont care to hide theaunmentionables when i wear themas the tothers do sprinkled with the dandys famous invocations he began to conceive romance in that sort of fun youre a wopper my brave dick wont let any peeler take me by jove and he with many assurances guaranteed to stand by her while she bent her thin fingers trying the muscle of his arm and reposed upon it more there was delicacy in her dandyism she was a graceful cavalier sir julius as they named the dandys attire was frequently called for on his evening visits to mrs mount when he beheld sir julius he thought of the lady and vice versaw as sir julius was fond of exclaiming was ever hero in this fashion wooed the woman now and then would peep through sir julius or she would sit and talk and altogether forget she was impersonating that worthy fop she never uttered an idea or a reflection but richard thought her the cleverest woman he had ever met all kinds of problematic notions beset him she was cold as ice she hated talk about love and she was branded by the world a rumour spread that reached mrs dorias ears she rushed to adrian first the wise youth believed there was nothing in it she sailed down upon richard is this true that you have been seen going publicly about with an infamous woman richard tell me pray relieve me richard knew of no person answering to his aunts description in whose company he could have been seen tell me i say dont quibble do you know any woman of bad character the acquaintance of a lady very much misjudged and illused by the world richard admitted to urgent grave advice mrs doria tendered her nephew both from the moral and the worldly point of view mentally ejaculating all the while that ridiculous system that disgraceful marriage sir austin in his mountain solitude was furnished with serious stuff to brood over the rumour came to lady blandish she likewise lectured richard and with her he condescended to argue but he found himself obliged to instance something he had quite neglected instead of her doing me harm its i that will do her good lady blandish shook her head and held up her finger this person must be very clever to have given you that delusion dear she is clever and the world treats her shamefully she complains of her position to you not a word but i will stand by her she has no friend but me my poor boy has she made you think that how unjust you all are cried richard how mad and wicked is the man who can let him be tempted so thought lady blandish he would pronounce no promise not to visit her not to address her publicly the world that condemned her and cast her out was no better worse for its miserable hypocrisy he knew the world now the young man said my child the world may be very bad i am not going to defend it but you have some one else to think of have you forgotten you have a wife richard ay you all speak of her now theres my aunt remember you have a wife do you think i love any one but lucy poor little thing because i am married am i to give up the society of women of women isnt she a woman too much so sighed the defender of her sex adrian became more emphatic in his warnings richard laughed at him the wise youth sneered at mrs mount the hero then favoured him with a warning equal to his own in emphasis and surpassing it in sincerity we wont quarrel my dear boy said adrian im a man of peace besides we are not fairly proportioned for a combat ride your steed to virtues goal all i say is that i think hell upset you and its better to go at a slow pace and in companionship with the children of the sun you have a very nice little woman for a wifewell goodbye to have his wife and the world thrown at his face was unendurable to richard he associated them somewhat after the manner of the rick and the marriage charming sir julius always gay always honest dispersed his black moods why youre taller richard made the discovery of course i am dont you remember you said i was such a little thing when i came out of my womans shell and how have you done it grown to please you now if you can do that you can do anything and so i would do anything you would honour thenhis project recurred to him but the incongruity of speaking seriously to sir julius struck him dumb then what asked she then youre a gallant fellow that all isnt it enough not quite you were going to say something i saw it in your eyes you saw that i admired you yes but a man mustnt admire a man i suppose i had an idea you were a woman what when i had the heels of my boots raised half an inch sir julius turned one heel and volleyed out silver laughter i dont come much above your shoulder even now she said and proceeded to measure her height beside him with arch upglances you must grow more fraid i cant dick bootmakers cant do it ill show you how and he lifted sir julius lightly and bore the fair gentleman to the lookingglass holding him there exactly on a level with his head will that do yes oh but i cant stay here why cant you why cant i he should have known thenit was thundered at a closed door in him that he played with fire but the door being closed he thought himself internally secure their eyes met he put her down instantly sir julius charming as he was lost his vogue seeing that the wily woman resumed her shell the memory of sir julius breathing about her still doubled the feminine attraction i ought to have been an actress she said richard told her he found all natural women had a similar wish yes ah then if i had been sighed mrs mount gazing on the pattern of the carpet he took her hand and pressed it you are not happy as you are no may i speak to you yes her nearest eye setting a dimple of her cheek in motion slid to the corner toward her ear as she sat with her head sideways to him listening when he had gone she said to herself old hypocrites talk in that way but i never heard of a young man doing it and not making love at the same time their next meeting displayed her quieter subdued as one who had been set thinking he lauded her fair looks dont make me thrice ashamed she petitioned but it was not only that mood with her dauntless defiance that splendidly befitted her gallant outline and gave a wildness to her bright bold eyes when she would call out happy who dares say im not happy dyou think if the world whips me ill wince dyou think i care for what they say or do let them kill me they shall never get one cry out of me and flashing on the young man as if he were the congregated enemy add there now you know methat was a mood that well became her and helped the work she ought to have been an actress this must not go on said lady blandish and mrs doria in unison a common object brought them together they confined their talk to it and did not disagree mrs doria engaged to go down to the baronet both ladies knew it was a dangerous likely to turn out a disastrous expedition they agreed to it because it was something to do and doing anything is better than doing nothing do it said the wise youth when they made him a third do it if you want him to be a hermit for life you will bring back nothing but his dead body ladiesa hellenic rather than a roman triumph he will listen to youhe will accompany you to the stationhe will hand you into the carriageand when you point to his seat he will bow profoundly and retire into his congenial mists adrian spoke their thoughts they fretted they relapsed speak to him you adrian said mrs doria speak to the boy solemnly it would be almost better he should go back to that little thing he has married almost lady blandish opened her eyes i have been advising it for the last month and more a choice of evils said mrs dorias soursweet face and shake of the head each lady saw a point of dissension and mutually agreed with heroic effort to avoid it by shutting their mouths what was more they preserved the peace in spite of adrians artifices well ill talk to him again he said ill try to get the engine on the conventional line command him exclaimed mrs doria gentle means are i think the only means with richard said lady blandish throwing banter aside as much as he could adrian spoke to richard you want to reform this woman her manner is openfair and freethe traditional characteristic we wont stop to canvass how that particular honesty of deportment that wins your approbation has been gained in her college it is not uncommon girls you know are not like boys at a certain age they cant be quite natural its a bad sign if they dont blush and fib and affect this and that it wears off when theyre women but a woman who speaks like a man and has all those excellent virtues you admirewhere has she learned the trick she tells you you dont surely approve of the school well what is there in it then reform her of course the task is worthy of your energies but if you are appointed to do it dont do it publicly and dont attempt it just now may i ask you whether your wife participates in this undertaking richard walked away from the interrogation the wise youth who hated long unrelieved speeches and had healed his conscience said no more dear tender lucy poor darling richards eyes moistened her letters seemed sadder latterly yet she never called to him to come or he would have gone his heart leapt up to her he announced to adrian that he should wait no longer for his father adrian placidly nodded the enchantress observed that her knight had a clouded brow and an absent voice richardi cant call you dick now i really dont know whyshe said i want to beg a favour of you name it i can still call you bella i suppose if you care to what i want to say is this when you meet me outto cut it shortplease not to recognize me and why do you ask to be told that certainly i do then look i wont compromise you i see no harm bella no she caressed his hand and there is none i know that but modest eyelids were drooped other people do struggling eyes were raised what do we care for other people nothing i dont not that snapping her finger i care for you though a prolonged look followed the declaration youre foolish bella not quite so giddythats all he did not combat it with his usual impetuosity adrians abrupt inquiry had sunk in his mind as the wise youth intended it should he had instinctively refrained from speaking to lucy of this lady but what a noble creature the woman was so they met in the park mrs mount whipped past him and secresy added a new sense to their intimacy adrian was gratified at the result produced by his eloquence though this lady never expressed an idea richard was not mistaken in her cleverness she could make evenings pass gaily and one was not the fellow to the other she could make you forget she was a woman and then bring the fact startlingly home to you she could read men with one quiver of her halfclosed eyelashes she could catch the coming mood in a man and fit herself to it what does a woman want with ideas who can do thus much keenness of perception conformity delicacy of handling these be all the qualities necessary to parasites love would have scared the youth she banished it from her tongue it may also have been true that it sickened her she played on his higher nature she understood spontaneously what would be most strange and taking to him in a woman various as the serpent of old nile she acted fallen beauty humorous indifference reckless daring arrogance in ruin and acting thus what think youshe did it so well because she was growing half in earnest richard i am not what i was since i knew you you will not give me up quite never bella i am not so bad as im painted you are only unfortunate now that i know you i think so and yet i am happier she told him her history when this soft horizon of repentance seemed to throw heavens twilight across it a womans history you know certain chapters expunged it was dark enough to richard did you love the man he asked you say you love no one now did i love him he was a nobleman and i a tradesmans daughter no i did not love him i have lived to learn it and now i should hate him if i did not despise him can you be deceived in love said richard more to himself than to her yes when were young we can be very easily deceived if there is such a thing as love we discover it after we have tossed about and roughed it then we find the man or the woman that suits usand then its too late we cant have him singular murmured richard she says just what my father said he spoke aloud i could forgive you if you had loved him dont be harsh grave judge how is a girl to distinguish you had some affection for him he was the first she chose to admit that yes and the first who talks of love to a girl must be a fool if he doesnt blind her that makes what is called first love nonsense isnt it he repelled the insinuation because i know it is not bella nevertheless she had opened a wider view of the world to him and a colder he thought poorly of girls a woman a sensible brave beautiful woman seemed on comparison infinitely nobler than those weak creatures she was best in her character of lovely rebel accusing foul injustice what am i to do you tell me to be different how can i what am i to do will virtuous people let me earn my bread i could not get a housemaids place they wouldnt have mei see their noses smelling yes i can go to the hospital and sing behind a screen do you expect me to bury myself alive why man i have blood i cant become a stone you say i am honest and i will be then let me till you that i have been used to luxuries and i cant do without them i might have married menlots would have had me but who marries one like me but a fool and i could not marry a fool the man i marry i must respect he could not respect mei should know him to be a fools and i should be worse off than i am now as i am now they may look as pious as they likei laugh at them and so forth direr things imputations upon wives horrible exultation at the universal peccancy of husbands this lovely outcast almost made him think she had the right on her side so keenly her parthian arrows pierced the holy centres of society and exposed its rottenness mrs mounts house was discreetly conducted nothing ever occurred to shock him there the young man would ask himself where the difference was between her and the women of society how base too was the army of banded hypocrites he was ready to declare war against them on her behalf his casus beli accurately worded would have read curiously because the world refused to lure the lady to virtue with the offer of a housemaids place our knight threw down his challenge but the lady had scornfully rebutted this prospect of a return to chastity then the form of the challenge must be because the world declined to support the lady in luxury for nothing but what did that mean in other words she was to receive the devils wages without rendering him her services such an arrangement appears hardly fair on the world or on the devil heroes will have to conquer both before they will get them to subscribe to it heroes however are not in the habit of wording their declarations of war at all lance in rest they challenge and they charge like women they trust to instinct and graft on it the muscle of men wide fly the leisurelyremonstrating hosts institutions are scattered they know not wherefore heads are broken that have not the balm of a reason why tis instinct strikes surely there is something divine in instinct still war declared where were these hosts the hero could not charge down on the ladies and gentlemen in a ballroom and spoil the quadrille he had sufficient reticence to avoid sounding his challenge in the law courts nor could he well go into the houses of parliament with a trumpet though to come to a tussle with the nations direct representatives did seem the likelier method it was likewise out of the question that he should enter every house and shop and battle with its master in the cause of mrs mount where then was his enemy everybody was his enemy and everybody was nowhere shall he convoke multitudes on wimbledon common blue policemen and a distant dread of ridicule bar all his projects alas for the hero in our day nothing teaches a strong arm its impotence so much as knocking at empty air what can i do for this poor woman cried richard after fighting his phantom enemy till he was worn out o rip old rip he addressed his friend im distracted i wish i was dead what good am i for miserable selfish what have i done but make every soul i know wretched about me i follow my own inclinations i make people help me by lying as hard as they canand im a liar and when ive got it im ashamed of myself and now when i do see something unselfish for me to do i come upon grinsi dont know where to turn how to actand i laugh at myself like a devil it was only friend riptons ear that was required so his words went for little but ripton did say he thought there was small matter to be ashamed of in winning and wearing the beauty of earth richard added his customary comment of poor little thing he fought his duello with empty air till he was exhausted a last letter written to his father procured him no reply then said he i have tried my utmost i have tried to be dutifulmy father wont listen to me one thing i can doi can go down to my dear girl and make her happy and save her at least from some of the consequences of my rashness theres nothing better for me he groaned his great ambition must be covered by a housetop he and the cat must warm themselves on the domestic hearth the hero was not aware that his heart moved him to this his heart was not now in open communion with his mind mrs mount heard that her friend was goingwould go she knew he was going to his wife far from discouraging him she said nobly goi believe i have kept you let us have an evening together and then go for good if you like if not then to meet again another time forget me i shant forget you youre the best fellow i ever knew richard you are on my honour i swear i would not step in between you and your wife to cause either of you a moments unhappiness when i can be another woman i will and i shall think of you then lady blandish heard from adrian that richard was positively going to his wife the wise youth modestly veiled his own merit in bringing it about by saying i couldnt see that poor little woman left alone down there any longer well yes said mrs doria to whom the modest speech was repeated i suppose poor boy its the best he can do now richard bade them adieu and went to spend his last evening with mrs mount the enchantress received him in state do you know this dress no its the dress i wore when i first met younot when i first saw you i think i remarked you sir before you deigned to cast an eye upon humble me when we first met we drank champagne together and i intend to celebrate our parting in the same liquor will you liquor with me old boy she was gay she revived sir julius occasionally he dispirited left the talking all to her mrs mount kept a footman at a late hour the man of calves dressed the table for supper it was a point of honour for richard to sit down to it and try to eat drinking thanks to the kindly mother nature who loves to see her children made fools of is always an easier matter the footman was diligent the champagne corks feebly recalled the filefiring at richmond well drink to what we might have been

didnt appreciate the sacrifice and he soon forgot to if he ever did its the way of the world richard seized some dead champagne emptied the bottle into a tumbler and drank it off john footman entered to clear the table and they were left without further interruption bella bella richard uttered in a deep sad voice as he walked the room she leaned on her arm her hair crushed against a reddened cheek her eyes halfshut and dreamy bella he dropped beside her you are unhappy she blinked and yawned as one who is awakened suddenly i think you spoke said she you are unhappy bella you cant conceal it your laugh sounds like madness you must be unhappy so young too only twentyone what does it matter who cares for me the mighty pity falling from his eyes took in her whole shape she did not mistake it for tenderness as another would have done who cares for you bella i do what makes my misery now but to see you there and know of no way of helping you father of mercy it seems too much to have to stand by powerless while such ruin is going on her hand was shaken in his by the passion of torment with which his frame quaked involuntarily a tear started between her eyelids she glanced up at him quickly then looked down drew her hand from his and smoothed it eying it bella you have a father alive a linendraper dear he wears a white neckcloth this article of apparel instantaneously changed the tone of the conversation for he rising abruptly nearly squashed the ladys lap dog whose squeaks and howls were piteous and demanded the most fervent caresses of its mistress it was oh my poor pet mumpsy and he didnt like a nasty great big ugly heavy foot an his poor soft silkymummum back he didnt and he soodnt that hemummumsoodnt and he cried out and knew the place to come to and was oh so

happiness of your dog a course se does mumpsy was simperingly assured in the thick of his silky flanks richard looked for his hat mumpsy was deposited on the sofa in a twinkling now said the lady you must come and beg mumpsys pardon whether you meant to do it or no because little doggies cant tell thathow should they and theres poor mumpsy thinking youre a great terrible rival that tries to squash

humour and went through the form of begging mumpsys pardon the dear dog i do believe he saw we were getting dull said she and immolated himself intentionally noble animal well well act as if we thought so let us be gay richard and not part like ancient fogies wheres your fun you can rattle why dont you you havent seen me in one of my charactersnot sir julius wait a couple of minutes she ran out a white visage reappeared behind a spring of flame her black hair was scattered over her shoulders and fell half across her brows she moved slowly and came up to him fastening weird eyes on him pointing a finger at the region of witches sepulchral cadences accompanied the representation he did not listen for he was thinking what a deadly charming and exquisitely horrid witch she was something in the way her underlids worked seemed to remind him of a forgotten picture but a veil hung on the picture there could be no analogy for this was beautiful and devilish and that if he remembered rightly had the beauty of seraphs his reflections and her performance were stayed by a shriek the spirits of wine had run over the plate she held to the floor she had the coolness to put the plate down on the table while he stamped out the flame on the carpet again she shrieked she thought she was on fire he fell on his knees and clasped her skirts all round drawing his arms down them several times still kneeling he looked up and asked do you feel safe now she bent her face glaring down till the ends of her hair touched his cheek said she do you was she a witch verily there was sorcery in her breath sorcery in her hair the ends of it stung him like little snakes how do i do it dick she flung back laughing like you do everything bella he said and took breath there i wont be a witch i wont be a witch they may burn me to a cinder but i wont be a witch she sang throwing her hair about and stamping her feet i suppose i look a figure i must go and tidy myself no dont change i like to see you so he gazed at her with a mixture of wonder and admiration i cant think you the same person not even when you laugh richard her tone was serious you were going to speak to me of my parents how wild and awful you looked bella my father richard was a very respectable man bella youll haunt me like a ghost my mother died in my infancy richard dont put up your hair bella i was an only child her head shook sorrowfully at the glistening fireirons he followed the abstracted intentness of her look and came upon her words ah yes speak of your father bella speak of him shall i haunt you and come to your bedside and cry tis time dear bella if you will tell me where he lives i will go to him he shall receive you he shall not refusehe shall forgive you if i haunt you you cant forget

on the fact that her eyes were brown they had a haughty sparkle when she pleased and when she pleased a soft languor circled them excitement had dyed her cheeks deep red he was a youth and she an enchantress he a hero she a female willothewisp the eyes were languid now set in rosy colour you will not leave me yet richard not yet he had no thought of departing its our last nighti suppose its our last hour together in this worldand i dont want to meet you in the next for poor dick will have to come to such a very very disagreeable place to make the visit he grasped her hand at this yes he will too true cant be helped they say im handsome youre lovely bella she drank in his homage well well admit it his highness below likes lovely women i hear say a gentleman of taste you dont know all my accomplishments yet richard i shant be astonished at anything new bella then hear and wonder her voice trolled out some lively roulades dont you think hell make me his prima donna below its nonsense to tell me theres no singing there and the atmosphere will be favourable to the voice no damp you know you saw the pianowhy didnt you ask me to sing before i can sing italian i had a masterwho made love to me i forgave him because of the musicstoolmen cant help it on a musicstool poor dears she went to the piano struck the notes and sang my heart my hearti think twill break

company were oh so propereven we if i had a husband what think you id do id make it my business to keep him a lover for when a young gentleman ceases to woo some other amusement hell quickly discover for such are young gentlemen made ofmade of such are young gentlemen made of after this trifling she sang a spanish ballad sweetly he was in the mood when imagination intensely vivifies everything mere suggestions of music sufficed the lady in the ballad had been wronged lo it was the lady before him and soft horns blew he smelt the languid nightflowers he saw the stars crowd large and close above the arid plain this lady leaning at her window desolate pouring out her abandoned heart heroes know little what they owe to champagne the lady wandered to venice thither he followed her at a leap in venice she was not happy he was prepared for the misery of any woman anywhere but oh to be with her to glide with phantommotion through throbbing street past houses muffled in shadow and gloomy legends under storied bridges past palaces charged with full life in dead quietness past grand old towers colossal squares gleaming quays and out and on with her on into the silver infinity shaking over seas was it the champagne the music or the poetry something of the two former perhaps but most the enchantress playing upon him how many instruments cannot clever women play upon at the same moment and this enchantress was not too clever or he might have felt her touch she was no longer absolutely bent on winning him or he might have seen a manoeuvre she liked himliked none better she wished him well her pique was satisfied still he was handsome and he was going what she liked him for she rathervery slightlywished to do away with or see if it could be done away with just as one wishes to catch a pretty butterfly without hurting its patterned wings no harm intended to the innocent insect only one wants to inspect it thoroughly and enjoy the marvel of it in ones tender possession and have the felicity of thinking one could crush it if one would he knew her what she was this lady in seville or in venice the spot was on her sailing the pathways of the moon it was not celestial light that illumined her beauty her sin was there but in dreaming to save he was soft to her sindrowned it in deep mournfulness silence and the rustle of her dress awoke him from his musing she swam wavelike to the sofa she was at his feet i have been light and careless tonight richard of course i meant it i must be happy with my best friend going to leave me those witch underlids were working brightly you will not forget me and i shall trytry her lips twitched she thought him such a very handsome fellow if i changeif i can change oh if you could know what a net im in richard now at those words as he looked down on her haggard loveliness not divine sorrow but a devouring jealousy sprang like fire in his breast and set him rocking with horrid pain he bent closer to her pale beseeching face her eyes still drew him down bella no no promise me swear it lost richard lost for ever give me up he cried i never will and strained her in his arms and kissed her passionately on the lips she was not acting now as she sidled and slunk her halfaverted head with a kind of maiden shame under his arm sighing heavily weeping clinging to him it was wicked truth not a word of love between them was ever hero in this fashion won etext editors bookmarks a woman who has mastered sauces sits on the apex of civilization behold the hero embarked in the redemption of an erring beauty come prepared to be not very well satisfied with anything habit had legalized his union with her hero embarked in the redemption of an erring beautiful woman his equanimity was fictitious his fancy performed miraculous feats how many instruments cannot clever women play upon i aint a speeder of matrimony opened a wider view of the world to him and a colder serene presumption the pilgrims scrip remarks that young men take joy in nothing threats of prayer however that harp upon their sincerity to be passive in calamity is the province of no woman unaccustomed to have his will thwarted women

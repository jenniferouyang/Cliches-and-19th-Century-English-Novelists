xix the girl madge chapter x small causes a clock sounded one of the later morning hours of the night as gower woodseer stood at his hotel door having left fleetwood with a band of revellers the night was now clear stars were low over the ridge of pines dropped to a league of our strange world to record the doings beneath this roof lay the starry she he was elected to lie beneath it also and he beheld his heavenly lady floating on the lull of soft white cloud among her sister spheres after the way of imaginative young men he had her features more accurately now she was hidden and he idealized her more he could escape for a time from his coil of similes and paint for himself the irids of her large long grey eyes darkly rimmed purest watergrey lucid within the ring beneath an arch of lashes he had them fast but then he fell to contemplating their exceeding rareness and the mystery of the divinely grey swung a kindled fancy to the flight with some queenwitch of woods of whom a youth may dream under the spell of twilights east or west among forest branches she had these marvellous eyes and the glamour for men she had not yet met a man with the poetical twist in the brain to prize her elementally all admitted the glamour none of her courtiers were able to name it even the poetical head giving it a name did not think of the witch in her looks as a witch in her deeds a modern daughter of the mediaeval to her giant squire the eyes of the lady were queer they were unlit glass lamps to her french suppliant and to the others they were attractively uncommon the charm for them being in her fine outlines her stature carriage of her person and unalterable composure particularly her latent daring she had the effect on the general mind of a lofty crag castle with a history there was a whiff of gunpowder exciting the atmosphere in the anecdotal part of the history known woodseer sat for a certain time over his notebook he closed it with a thrilling conceit of the right thing written down such as entomologists feel when they have pinned the rare insect but what is butterfly or beetle compared with the chiselled sentences carved out of air to constitute us part owner of the breathing image and spirit of an adored fair woman we repeat them and the act of repeating them makes her come close on ours by virtue of the eagle thought in the stamped gold of the lines then though she is not ever to be absolutely ours and it is an impoverishing desire that she should be we have beaten out the golden sentencethe essential she and we in one but is it so precious after all a suspicious ring of an adjective drops us on a sickening descent the author dashed at his book examined approved keenly enjoyed and he murderously scratched the adjective she stood better without it as a bright planet star issuing from clouds which are perhaps an adornment to our hackneyed moon this done he restored the book to his coats breastpocket smiling or sneering at the rolls of banknotes there disdaining to count them they stuffed an inner waistcoat pocket and his trousers also they at any rate warranted that we can form a calculation of the chances let lord fleetwood rave as he may please woodseer had caught a glimpse of the elbowpoint of his coat when flinging it back to the chair there was distinctly abrasion philosophers laugh at such things but they must be the very ancient pallium philosophers ensconced in tubs if they pretend to merriment over the spectacle of nether garments gapped at the spot where man is most vulnerable he got loose from them and held them up to the candle and the rays were admitted neither winking nor peeping serviceable old clothes no doubt time had not dealt them the final kick before they scored a good record they dragged him nevertheless to a sort of confession of some weakness that he could not analyze for the swirl of emotional thoughts in the way and they had him to the ground an eagle of the poetic becomes a mere squat toad through one of these pretty material strokes where then is philosophy but who can be philosopher and the fervent admirer of a glorious lady ask again who in that frowzy garb can presume to think of her or stand within fifty miles of her orbit a dreary two hours brought round daylight woodseer quitted his restless bed and entered the abjured habiliments chivalrous enough to keep from denouncing them until he could cast the bad skin they now were to his uneasy sensations he remembered having stumbled and fallen on the slope of the hill into this vale and probably then the mischief had occurred though a brush would have been sufficient the slightest collision only it was odd that the accident should have come to pass just previous to his introduction how long antecedent was it he belaboured his memory to reckon how long it was from the moment of the fall to the first sight of that lady his window looked down on the hotel stableyard a coachhouse door was open odd or notand it certainly looked like fatethat he should be bowing to his lady so shortly after the mishap expelling him he had to leave the place a groom in the yard was hailed and cheerily informed him he could be driven to carlsruhe as soon as the coachman had finished his breakfast at carlsruhe a decent refitting might be obtained and he could return from exile that very day thanks to the praiseworthy early hours of brave old germany he had swallowed a cup of coffee with a roll of stale bread in the best of moods and entered his carriage he was calling the order to start when a shout surprised his ear the fiddler bolts captain abranes was the voice about twenty paces behind abrane fleetwood and one whom they called chummy potts were wildly waving arms woodseer could hear the captains lowered roar race you chummy couple of louis catch him first the two came pelting up to the carriage abreast they were belated revellers and had been carelessly strolling under the pinky cloudlets bedward after a prolonged carousal with the sons and daughters of hilarious nations until the apparition of virgin luck on the wing shocked all prospect of a dead fight with the tables that day here come no by jove you mr woodsir wont do not a bit cant let you go cried abrane as he puffed what cut and run and leave us post winningsbankersknock your luck on the head what a fellow cant let you countess never forgive us you promisedswore itplay for her struck all aheap to hear of your play youve got the trick her purse for you in my pocket never a fellow played like you cool as a cook over agridiron comme un phare st ombre saysthat frenchman you astonished the frenchman and now cut and run cant allow it honour of the country at stake hands off woodseer bellowed feeling himself a leaky vessel in dock his infirmities in danger of exposure if you pullwhat the deuce do you want stop out you come said the giant and laughed at the fun to his friends who were entirely harmonious when not violently dissenting as is the way with nights rollickers before their beds have reconciled them to the daybeams woodseer would have had to come and was coming he happened to say dont knock my pipe out of my mouth and touched a chord in the giant allright smoke your pipe was answered to his remonstrance during the amnesty fleetwood inquired where are you going far a driveto be sure dont you see youll return i intend to return hes beastly excited quoth abrane fleetwood silenced him though indeed woodseer appeared suspiciously restive step down and have a talk with me before you start youre not to go yet i must im in a hurry what s the hurry i want to smoke and think takes a carriage on the top of the morning to smoke and think hark at that abrane sang out oh come along quietly you fellow theres a good fellow it concerns us all every man jack were all bound up in your fortunes fellow with luck like yours cant pretend to behave independently out of reason do you give me your word you return said fleetwood woodseer replied very well i do there i give my word hang it now i know what they mean by anything for a quiet life just a shake brings us down on that canebottomed chair you return today today yes yes fleetwood signified the captives release and abrane immediately suggested pop old chummy in beside the fellow to mount guard potts was hustled and precipitated into the carriage by the pair with whom he partook this last glimmer of their nights humorous extravagances for he was an easy creature the carriage drove off keep him company they shouted escort him back said he nodding he remarked to woodseer with your permission concerning the seat he took and that a draught of morning air would do him good then he laughed politely exchanged wavy distant farewells with his comrades touched a breastpocket for his case of cigars pulled forth one obtained the loan of a light blew clouds and fell into the anticipated composure quite understanding the case and his office both agreed as to the fine morning it was woodseer briefly assented to his keepers reiterated encomium on the morning justified on oath a fine morning indeed damned if i think i ever saw so fine a morning potts cried he had no other subject of conversation with this hybrid and being equally disposed for hot discourse or for sleep the deprivation of the one and the other forced him to seek amusement in his famous reading of character which was profound among the biped equine jockeys turfmen sharpers pugilists demireps he fronted woodseer with square shoulders and wide knees an elbow on one a fist on the other engaged in what he termed the prodding of his eel or nicking of his man a method of getting straight at the riddle of the fellow by the test of how long he could endure a flat mute stare and return look for look unblinking the act of smoking fortifies and partly covers the insolence but if by chance an equable not too narrowly focussed counterstare is met our impertinent inquisitor may resemble the fisherman pulled into deep waters by his fish woodseer perused his man he was not attempting to fathom him he had besides other stuff in his head potts had naught and the poor particle he was wriggled under detection tobacco before breakfast he said disgustedly tossing his cigar to the road your pipe holds on bad thing i can tell you that smoking on an empty stomach no trainerd allow it not for a whole fee or double kills your wind let me ask you my good sir are you going to turn weve sat a fairish stretch i begin to want my bath and a shave linen and coffee thirsty as a dog he heard with stupefaction that he could alight on the spot if he pleased otherwise he would be driven into carlsruhe and now they had a lingual encounter hot against cool but the eyes of chummy potts having been beaten his arguments and reproaches were not backed by the powerful looks which are an essential part of such eloquence as he commanded they fled from his enemys currishly even while he was launching epithets his pathetic position subjected him to beg that woodseer would direct the driver to turn for he had no knowledge of their german lingo and said he youve nothing to laugh at that i can see im at your mercy you brute caught in a trap i never walkand the sun fit to fry a mackerel along that road i apologize for abusing you i cant do more youre an infernally clever playerthere and upon my soul i could drink ditchwater but if youre going in for transactions at carlsruhe mark my words your lucks gone laugh as much as you like woodseer happened to be smiling over the excellent reason for not turning back which inflicted the wofulness he was not without sympathy for a thirsty wretch and guessing at the sight of an avenue of limes to the left of the road that a wayside inn was below he said you can have coffee or beer in two minutes and told the driver where to pull up the sight of a greyjacketed greencollared sportsman dog at heel crossing the flat land to the hills of the forest pricked him enviously and caused him to ask what change had come upon him that he should be hurrying to a town for a change of clothes just as potts was about to jump out a carriage with a second behind it left the inn door he rubbed a hand on his unshaven chin tried a glance at his shirtfront and remarking it wont be any one who knows me stood to let the carriages pass in the first were a young lady and a gentleman the lady brilliantly fair an effect of auburn hair and complexion despite the signs of a storm that had swept them and had not cleared from her eyelids apparently her maid a damsel sitting straight up occupied the carriage following and this freshfaced young person twice quickly and bluntly bent her head as she was driven by potts was unacquainted with the maid but he knew the lady well or well enough for her inattention to be the bigger puzzle she gazed at the black forest hills in the steadiest manner with eyes betraying more than they saw which solved part of the puzzle of course her reasons for declining to see him were exposed by the presence of the gentleman beside her at the same time in so highly bred a girl a defenceless exposure was unaccountable half a nod and the shade of a smile would have been the proper course and her going along on the road to the valley seemed to say it might easily have been taken except that there had evidently been a bit of a scene potts ranked henriettas beauty far above her cousin livias he was therefore personally offended by her disregard of him and her bit of a scene with the fellow carrying her off did him injury on behalf of his friend fleetwood he dismissed woodseer curtly thirsting more to gossip than to drink he took a moody draught of beer at the inn and by the aid of a conveyance hastily built of rotten planks to serve his needs and drawn by a horse of the old wars as he reported on his arrival at badenreached that home of the maltreated innocents twenty minutes before the countess and her party were to start for lunch up the lichtenthal naturally he was abused for letting his bird fly but as he was shaven refreshed and in clean linen he could pull his shirt cuffs and take seat at his breakfasttable with equanimity while abrane denounced him ill bet you the fellows luck has gone said potts he s no new hand and you dont think him so either fleet ive looked into the fellows eye and seen a leery old badger at the bottom of it talks vile stuff however perhaps i didnt drive out on that sweltering carlsruhe road for nothing he screwed a look at the earl who sent abrane to carry a message and heard the story potts had to tell henrietta fakenham no mistake about her driving out from a pothouse man beside her military man might be a german and if you please quite unacquainted with your humble servant though we were as close as you to me something went wrong in that pothouse red eyes there had been a scene one could swear behind the lady another carriage and her maid never saw the girl before and sets to bowing and smirking at me as if i was thefellow of all others comical i made sure they were bound for this place they were on the strasburg road no sign of them you speak to me said fleetwood potts muttered he had put his foot into it you have a bad habit of speaking to yourself fleetwood remarked and left him he suffered from the rustics he had to deal with among his class and it was not needed that he should thunder at them to make his wrath felt livia swam in asking what has come to russett he passed me in one of his black fits the tale of the carlsruhe road was repeated by potts she reproved him how could you choose russett for such a report as that the admiral was on the road behind henriettayoure sure it was she german girls have much the same colouring the gentleman with her must have been one of the court equerries they were driving to some chateau or battlefield the admiral wanted to inspect goodlooking man military man oh the man pretty fair i dare say potts rejoined if it wasnt henrietta fakenham i see with the back of my head german girl the maid was a german girl that may well be said livia she conceived the news to be of sufficient importance for her to countermand the drive up the lichtenthal and take the carlsruhe road instead for henrietta was weak and chillon kirby an archplotter and pleader too one of the desperate lovers he was outstaying his leave of absence already she believed he had to be in england if he feared to lose henrietta he would not hesitate to carry her off livia knew him and knew the power of his pleading with a firmer woman than henrietta chapter xi the prisoner of his word nothing to rouse alarm was discovered at carlsruhe livias fair cousin was there with the redhaired gaunt girl of the mountains and it was frankly stated by henrietta that she had accompanied the girl a certain distance along the strasburg road for her to see the last of her brother chillon on his way to england livia was not the woman to push inquiries on that subject she merely said as soon as they were alone together you seem to have had the lions share of the parting yes we passed mr chumley potts was henriettas immediate answer and her reference to him disarmed livia they smiled at his name transiently but in agreement the tattlerspout of their set was a fatal person to encounter and each deemed the sudden apparition of him in the very early morning along the carlsruhe road rather magical you place particular confidence in russetts fidelity to his word rietteas you have been hearing yourself called you should be serious by this time russett wont bear much more i counted on the night of the ball for the grand effect you will extinguish every woman there and if he is absent i shall excuse him you are not in a position to be so charitable you ought to know your position and yourself too a little better than you do how could you endure poverty chillon kirby stands in his uniform and alls told he can manoeuvre we know he got the admiral away to take him to those reviews cleverly but is he thinking of your interests when he does it he requires twenty years of active service to give you a roof to your head i hate such allusions but look for a moment at your character you must have ordinary luxuries and pleasures and if you were to find yourself grinding against common necessitiesimagine it russett is quite manageable he is trust me he is a gentleman he has more ability than most young men he can do anything he sets his mind to do he has his great estates and fortune all in his own hands we call him eccentric he is only young with a lot of power add hes in love and some one distracts him not love do you sayyou look it he worships he has no chance given him to show himself at his best perhaps he is off again now will you bet me he is not i should incline to make the bet if i betted said henrietta his pride is in his word and supposing hes in love its with his pride which never quits him theres firmness in a man who has pride of that kind you must let me take you back to baden i hold to having you with me today you must make an appearance there the admiral will bring us his miss kirby to morrow if he is bound to remain here tonight theres no harm in his bachelor dinners i suspect his twinges of gout come of the prospect of affairs when he lands in england remember our bill with madame clemence there wont be the ghost of a banknote for me if russett quits the field we shall all be stranded henrietta inquired does it depend on my going with you today consider that he is now fancying a thousand things we wont talk of the road to paris a shot of colour swept over henrietta i will speak to papaif he can let me go he has taken to miss kirby does she taste well henrietta debated its impossible to dislike her oh she is wild she knows absolutely nothing of the world she can do everything we cantor dont dare to trymen would like her papas beginning to doat he says she would have made a firstrate soldier she fears blood as little as her morning cup of milk one of the orderlies fell rather badly from a frightened horse close by our carriage she was out in a moment and had his head on her lap calling to papa to keep the carriage fast and block the way of the squadron for the mans leg was hurt i really thought we were lost at these manoeuvres anything may happen at any instant papa will follow the horseartillery you know his vanity to be a military quite as much as a naval commander like the greeks and romans he says we took the bruised man into our carriage and drove him to camp carinthia nursing him on the way carinthia shes well fitted with her name what with her name and her hair and her build and her singular style of attire one wonders at her coming into civilized parts she s utterly unlike chillon henrietta reddened at the mention of one of her own thoughts in the contrasting of the pair they had their points of likeness she said it did not concern livia to hear what these were back to baden with means to procure the pleasant shocks of the galvanic battery there was her thought for she had a fear of the earls having again departed in a huff at henriettas behaviour the admiral consented that his daughter should go as soon as he heard that miss kirby was to stay he had when a young man met her famous father he vowed she was the old buccaneer young again in petticoats and had made prize of an english manofwar by storm all the profit however being his this he proved with a courteous clasp of the girl and a show of the salute on her cheek which he presumed to take at the nights farewell shes my tonic he proclaimed heartily she seemed to livia somewhat unstrung and toneless the separation from her brother in the morning might account for it and a man of the admirals age could be excused if he exalted the girl senility like infancy is fond of plain outlines for the laying on of its paints the girl had rugged brows a short nose red hair no young man would look at her twice she was utterly unlike chillon kissing her hand to henrietta from the steps of the hotel the girls face improved livias little squire sir meeson corby ejaculated as they were driving down the main street fleetwoods tramp there he goes now see miss fakenham the kind of object lord fleetwood picks up and calls friend calls that object friend but what he has been to a tailor and a barber stop the coachman run tell mr woodseer i wish him to join us livia said and sir meeson had to thank his tramp for a second indignity he protested he simulated remonstrancehe had to go really feeling a sickness the singularlooking person whose necessities or sense of the decencies had unknown to himself and to the others put them all in motion that day swung round listening to the challenge to arms as the puffy little mans delivery of the countesss message sounded he was respectably clad he thought in the relief of his escape from the suit of clothes discarded and he silently followed sir meesons trot to the carriage should have mistaken you for a german today sir the latter said and trotted on a stout one woodseer replied with his happy indifference to his exterior his dark ladys eyes were kindly overlooking like the heavens her fair cousin to whom he bowed awakened him to a perception of the spectacle causing the slight quick arrest of her look in an astonishment not unlike the hiccup in speech while her act of courtesy proceeded at once he was conscious of the price he paid for respectability and saw the teuton skin on the slim cambrian baggy at shoulders baggy at seat pinched at the knees short at the heels showing outrageously every spot where he ought to have been bigger or smaller how accept or how reject the invitation to drive in such company to baden youre decided enough sir in your play they tell me the vindictive little baronet commented on his hesitation and woodseer sprang to the proffered vacant place but he had to speak of his fly waiting for him at the steps of a certain hotel best hotel in the town sir beeson exclaimed pointedly to henrietta reading her constraint with this comical object before her it was the admirals hotel they stopped at be so good as to step down and tell the admiral he is to bring madame clemence in his carriage tomorrow and on your way you will dismiss mr woodseers fly livia mildly addressed her squire he stared again he had to go muttering that nondescripts footman and his mischance in being checked and crossed and humiliated perpetually by a dirtyfisted vagabond impostor astounded him he sent the flyman to the carriage for orders admiral fakenham and carinthia descended sir meeson heard her cry out is it you and up stood the pretentious lout in the german sack affecting the graces of a born gentleman fresh from parisbowing smirking excusing himself for something and he jumped down to the young lady he talked intimately with her with a jokers air he roused the admiral to an exchange of jokes and the countess and miss fakenham more than smiled evidently at his remarks unobservant of the preposterous figure he cut sir meeson corby had intimations of the disintegration of his country if a patent tramp burlesquing in those clothes could be permitted to amuse english ladies of high station quite at home with them among the signs of englands downfall this was decidedly one what to think of the admirals favourite when having his arm paternally on her shoulder she gave the tramp her hand at parting and then blushed all that the ladies had to say about it was that a spread of colour rather went to change the character of her face carinthia had given woodseer her hand and reddened under the recollection of chillons words to her as they mounted the rise of the narrow vale after leaving the lame gentleman to his tobacco on the grass below the rocks her brother might have counselled her wisely and was to be obeyed only the great pleasure in seeing the gentleman again inspired gratitude he brought the scene to her and it was alive it chatted and it beckoned it neighboured her home she had passed it on her walk away from her home the gentleman was her link to the mountain paths he was just outside an association with her father and mother at least her thinking of them led to him he to them now that she had lost chillon no one was near to do so much besides chillon loved henrietta he was her own his heart was hers and his mind his countrys this gentleman loved the mountains the sight of him breathed mountain air to see him next day was her anticipation for it would be at the skirts of hilly forest land where pinetrees are a noble family different from the dusty firs of the weariful plains which had tired her eyes of late baden was her first peep at the edges of the world since she had grown to be a young woman she had but a faint idea of the significance of gambling the brilliant lights the band music the sitting groups and company of promenaders were novelties the ball of the ensuing night at the schloss would be a wonder she acknowledged in response to henrietta who was trying to understand her and she admired her balldress she said looking unintelligently when she heard that she would be guilty of slaying numbers of gentlemen before the night was over madame clemence thought her chances in that respect as good as any other young ladys if only she could be got to feel interested but at a word of the pine forest and saying she intended to climb the hills early with the light in the morning a pointed eagerness flushed carinthia the cold engraving became a picture of colour she was out with the earliest light yesterdays parting between chillon and henrietta had taught her to know some little about love and if her voice had been heeded by chillons beloved it would not have been a parting her only success was to bring a flood of tears from henrietta the tears at least assured her that her brothers beautiful girl had no love for the other onethe young nobleman of the great wealth who was to be at the ball and had gone flying admiral fakenham shrugged to say for lord fleetwood was nowhere seen the much talk of him on the promenade overnight fetched his name to her thoughts he scarcely touched a mind that her father filled when she was once again breathing early morning air among the stems of climbing pines broken alleys of the lowsweeping spruce branches and the bare straight shafts carrying their heads high in the march upward her old father was archpriest of such forest land always recoverable to her there the suggestion of mountains was enough to make her mind play and her old father and she were aware of one another without conversing in speech he pointed at things to observe he shared her satisfied hunger for the solitudes of the dumb and growing and wild sweetsmelling he would not let a sorrowful thought backward or an apprehensive idea forward disturb the scene a halfuprooted pinetree stem propped midfall by standing comrades and the downy drop to ground and muted scurry up the bark of longbrush squirrels cocktail on the wary watch were noticed by him as well as by her even the rotting timber drift bark and cones on the yellow pine needles and the tortuous dwarf chestnut pushing level out with a strain of the head up from a crevice of mossed rock among ivy and ferns he saw what his girl saw power of heart was her conjuring magician she climbed to the rockslabs above this was too easily done the poor bit of effort excited her frame to desire a spice of danger her walk was towering in the physical contempt of a mountain girl for petty lowland obstructions and it was just then by the chance of thingsby the direction of events as dame gossip believes it to bewhile colour expression and her proud stature marked her from her sex that a gentleman who was no other than lord fleetwood passed carinthia coming out of the deeper pine forest some distance on round a bend of the path she was tempted to adventure by a projected forked head of a sturdy blunted and twisted little rock fostered forest tree pushing horizontally for growth about thirty feet above the lower ground she looked on it and took a step down to the stem soon after fleetwood had turned and followed merely for the final curious peep at an unexpected vision he had noticed the singular shoot of thick timber from the rock and the form of the gooseneck it rose to the sprout of branches off the bill in the shape of a crest and now a shameful spasm of terror seized him at sight of a girl doing what he would have dreaded to attempt she footed coolly wellbalanced upright she seated herself and there let her be she was a german girl apparently she had an air of breeding something more than breeding german families of the nobles give out here and there as the great war showed examples of intrepid young women who have the sharp lines of character to render them independent of the graces but if a young woman out alone in the woods was hardly to be counted among the wellborn she held rank above them her face and bearing might really be taken to symbolize the forest life she was as individual a representative as the tragic and comic masks and should be got to stand between them for sign of the naturally straight growing untrained a noble daughter of the woods not comparable to henrietta in feminine beauty she was on an upper plateau where questions as to beauty are answered by other than the shallow aspect of a girl but would henrietta eclipse her if they were side by side fleetwood recalled the strange girls face there was in it a savage poignancy in serenity unexampled among womenor modern women one might imagine an apotheosis of a militant young princess of goths or vandals the glow of blessedness awakening her martial ardours through the languor of the gravewoodseer would comprehend and hit on the exact image to portray her in a moment fleetwood thought and longed for that fellow he walked hurriedly back to the stunted rock tree the damsel had vanished he glanced below she had not fallen he longed to tell woodseer he had seen a sort of carinthia sister cousin one of the family a single glimpse of her had raised him out of his grovelling perturbations cooled and strengthened him more than diverting the course of the poison henrietta infused and to which it disgraced him to be so subject he took love unmanfully the passion struck at his weakness in wrath at the humiliation if only to revenge himself for that he could be fiendish he knew it and loathed the desired fair creature who caused and exposed to him these cracks in his nature whence there came a brimstone stench of the infernal pits and he was made for better of this he was right well assured superior to station and to wealth to all mundane advantages he was the puppet of a florid puppet girl and he had slept at the small inn of a village hard by because it was intolerable to him to see the face that had been tearful over her lovers departure and hear her praises of the man she trusted to keep his word however grievously she wounded him he was the prisoner of his wordrather like the donkeys known as married men rather more honourable than most of them he had to be present at the ball at the schloss and behold his loathed henrietta suffer torture of chains to the rack by reason of his having promised the bitter coquette he would be there so hellish did the misery seem to him that he was relieved by the prospect of lying a whole day long in loneliness with the sunshine of the woods occasionally conjuring up the antidote face of the woodsprite before he was to undergo it but as he was not by nature a dreamer only dreamed of the luxury of being one he soon looked back with loathing on a notion of relief to come from the state of ruminating animal and jumped up and shook off another of mens delusionsthat they can if they have the heart to suffer pain deaden it with any semipoetical devices similar to those which rufus abranes fiddler fellow practised and was able to carry out because he had no blood the spite of a present entire opposition to woodseers professed views made him exult in the thought that the mouther of sentences was likely to be at work stultifying them and himself in the halls there below during the day an imp of mischief offered consolatory sport in those halls of the black goddess already he regarded his recent subservience to the conceited and tripped peripatetic philosopher as among the ignominies he had cast away on his road to a general contempt which is the position of a supreme elevation for particularly sensitive young men pleasure in the scenery had gone and the woodsprite was a flitted vapour he longed to be below there observing abrane and potts and the philosopher confounded and the legible placidity of countess livia nevertheless he hung aloft feeding where he could impatient of the solitudes till night when according to his guess the ladies were at their robing half the fun was over but the tale of it narrated in turn by abrane and his chummy potts on the promenade was a very good half the fiddler had played for the countess and handed her back her empty purse with a bow and a pretty speech nothing had been seen of him since he had lost all his own money besides as of course he would said potts a fellow calculating the chances catches at a knife in the air every francpiece he had cried abrane and how could the jackass expect to keep his luck flings off his old suit and comes back here with a rig of german bagsyou never saw such a figureshoreditch jews holidaywhy of course the luck wouldnt stand that they confessed ruefully to having backed him a certain distance notwithstanding he took it so coolly just as if paying for goods across a counter and he had something to bear braney when you fell on him said potts and murmured aside he can be smartish hears me call braney rufus and says he like a fellowchin on his fiddlecaptain mountain rufus mus not bad for a counter fleetwood glanced round he could have wrung woodseers hand he saw young cressett instead and hailed him here you are my gallant you shall flash your maiden sword tonight when i was under your age by a long count i dealt sanctimoniousness a flick o the cheek and you shall and let em know youre a man come and have your first boarhunt along with me petticoats be hanged the boy showed some recollection of the lectures of his queen but he had not the vocables for resistance to an imperative senior at work upon sneaking inclinations promised lady fdo you hear him fleetwood called to the couple behind and as gamblers must needs be parasites manly were the things they spoke to invigorate the youthful plunger and second the whim of their paymaster at halfpast eleven the prisoner of his word entered under the schloss partico having vowed to himself on the way that he would satisfy the formulas to gain release by a deferential bow to the great personages and straightway slip out into the heavenly starlight thence down among the jolly parisian and viennese bacchanals chapter xii henriettas letter treating of the great event by the first light of an autumn morning henrietta sat at her travelling desk to shoot a spark into the breast of her lover with the story of the great event of the night for there had been one one of our biggest beyond all tongues and trumpets and possible anticipations wonder at it hammered on incredulity as she wrote it for fact and in writing had vision of her lovers eyes over the page monsieur du lac grey dawn you are greeted this if you have been tardy on the journey home will follow close on the heels of the prowest i believe truest of knights and bear perhaps to his quick mind some help to the solution he dropped a hint of seeking the ball in every way a success grand duke and duchess perfect in courtesy not a sign of the german morgue livia splendid compared to day and night but the night eclipses the day a summer sea of dancing who think you eclipsed those two i tell you the very truth when i say your carinthia did if you had seen herthe poor dear girl you sigh to speak ofwith the doleful outlook on her fortunes portionless unattractive chillon she was magical you cannot ever have seen her irradiated with happiness her pleasure in the happiness of all around her was part of the charm one should be a poet to describe her it would task an artist to paint the rosecrystal she became when threading her way through the groups to be presented this is not meant to say that she looked beautiful it was the something above beautymore unique and impressivelike the alpine snowcloak towering up from the flowery slopes you know so well and i a little you choose to think is it riette who noticed my simple sister so closely before for i suppose you to be reading this letter a second time and reflecting as you read in the first place acquaintance with her has revealed that she is not the simple persononly in her manner under the beams of subsequent events it is true i see her more picturesquely but i noticed also just a suspicion of the grenadier stride when she was on the march to make her curtsey but livia had no cause for chills and quivers she was not the very strange bird requiring explanatory excuses she dances excellently and after the first dance i noticed she minced her steps in the walk with her partner she catches the tone readily if not the image of her mother she has inherited her mothers bent for the graces she needs but a small amount of practice take my assurance of that and you know who has critical eyes your anxiety may rest she is equal to any station as expected by me my lord tyrant appeared though late near midnight i saw him bowing to the ducal party papa had led your simple sister there next i saw the tyrant and carinthia conversing soon they were dancing together talking interestedly like cheerful comrades whatever his faults he has the merit of being a man of his word he said he would come he did not wish to come and he came his word binds himi hope not fatally irrevocably it certainly does there is charm of character in that his autocrat airs can be forgiven to a man who so profoundly respects his word it occurred during their third dance your riette was not in the quadrille o but she was a snubbed young woman last night i refrain the examples are too minute for quotation a little later and he had vanished carinthia kirby may already be written countess of fleetwood his hand was offered and hers demanded in plain terms her brother would not be so astounded if he had seen the brilliant creature she wasis i could say for when she left me here to go to her bed she still wore the afterglow she tripped over to me in the ballroom to tell me i might doubt she had no doubt whatever i fancied he had subjected her to some degree of trifling he was in a mood his moods are known to me but no he was precise her report of him strikes the ear as credible in spite of the marvel it insists on our swallowing lord fleetwood had asked me to marry him neither assurance nor bashfulness newspaper print aid an undoubting air of contentment imagine me hearing it to be his wife he said wife and you replied isaid i would tell me all he said we were plighted now wife is one of the words he abhors and he loathes the hearing of a girl as engaged however plighted carried a likeness i pressed her my dear carinthia you thought him in earnest he was how do you judge by his look when he spoke not by his words i repeat them to you she has repeated them to me here in my bedroom there is no variation she remembers every syllable he went so far as to urge her to say whether she would as willingly utter consent if they were in a church and a clergyman at the altarrails that was like him she made answer wherever it may be i am bound if i say yes she then adds he told me he joined hands with me did he repeat the word wife he said it twice i transcribe verbatim scrupulously there cannot be an error chillon it seems to show that he has embraced the serious meaning of the word or seriously embraced the meaning reads better i have seen his lips form wife but why wonder so staringly they both love the mountains both are wildish she was looking superb and he had seen her do a daring thing on the rocks on the heights in the early morning when she was out by herself unaware of a spectator he not knowing who she wasthe fates had arranged it so that was why he took to her so rapidly so he told her she likes being admired the preparation for the meeting does really seem under direction she likes him too i do think between her repetitions of his compliments she praised his tone of voice his features she is ready to have the fullest faith in the sincerity of his offer speaks without any impatience for the fulfilment if it should happen what a change in the fortunes of a girlof more than one possibly now i must rest eyelids fall it will be with a heart galloping no rest for me till this letter flies good morning is my good night to you in a world that has turned over henrietta resumes livia will not hear of it calls up all her pretty languor to put it aside it is the same today as last night why mention russetts nonsense to me carinthia is as quietly circumstantial as at first she and the tyrant talked of her native home very desirous to see it means to build a mansion there he said it must be the most romantic place on earth i suppose i slept i woke with my last line to you on my lips and the great news thundering he named esslemont and his favouritealways uninhabitedcader argau she speaks them correctly she has an unfailing memory the point is that it is a memory do not forget alsolivia is affected by her distastethat he is a gentleman he plays with his nobility with his reputation of gentleman he has never been known to play you will understand the slightly hypocritical airit is not of sufficient importance for it to be alluded to in papas presencei put on with her yes i danced nearly all the dances one a princeling in scarlet uniform appearing fresh from under earth prussian a weighty young graf in green between sage and bottle who seemed to have run off a tree in the forest and was trimmed with silver like dewdrops one in your austrian white dragon de boheme if i caught his french rightly others as well a list they have the accomplishment they are drilled in it young as girls are and so few englishmeneven english officers how it may be for campaigning you can pronounce but for dancing the pantalon collant is the perfect uniform your critical henrietta had not to complain of her partners in the absence of the one i shall be haunted by visions of chillons amazement until i hear or we meet i serve for carinthias mouthpiece she cannot write it she says it would be related in two copybook lines if at all the amazement over london the jewel hand of the kingdom gone in a flash to a raw mountain girl as will be said i can hear lady endor lady eldritch lady cowry the reasonable woman should be lady arpington i have heard her speak of your mother seen by her when she was in frocks enter the plighted poor livia to be made a dowager of by any but a damsel of the family she may well ridicule that nonsense of russetts last night carinthia kisses embraces her brother i am to say what henrietta tells you is true chillon she is contented though she has not seen him again and has not the look of expecting to see him she still wears the kind of afterglow chillons viennese waltz was played by the band played a second time special request conveyed to the leader by prince ferdinand true most true she longs to be home across the water but be it admitted that to any one loving colour music chivalry the island of drab is an exile imagine then the strange magnetism drawing her there could warmer proof be given adieu livias archplotter will weigh the letter he reads to the smallest fraction of a fraction before he moves a step i could leave it and come to it again and add and add i foresee in livias mind a dread of the aforesaid arch and an interdict so the letter must be closed sealed and into the box with the hand i still call mine though i should doubt my right if it were contested fervently i am singing the waltz adieu ever and beyond it your obedient queen henrietta psmy lord tyrant has departedas on other occasions the prisoner of his word is sure to take his airing before he presents himself to redeem it his valet is left to pay bills fortunately for livia she entrusted her purse yesterday to a man picked up on the road by my lord that he might play for her captain abrane assured her he had a star and mr potts thought him a rush compere an adept of those dreadful gambling tables why will she continue to play the purse was returned to her without so much as a piece of silver in it the man has flown sir m corby says he is a man whose hands betray himor did to sir m expects to see him one day on the wrong side of the criminal bar he struck me as not being worse than absurd he was in any case an unfit companion and our c would help to rescue the eccentric from such complicating associates i see worlds of good she may do happily he is no slave of the vice of gambling so she would not suffer that anxiety i wish it could be subjoined that he has no malicious pleasure in misleading others livia is inconsolable over her pet young lord cressett whom he yesterday induced to try his luckwith the result we leave if bills are paid in two days captain abrane and mr potts left this afternoon just enough to carry them home papa and your blissful sister out driving riette within her four walls and signing herself the prisoner of chillon chapter xiii an irruption of mistress gossip in breach of the convention it is a dark land carinthia said on seeing our islands lowered clouds in swift motion without a break of their folds above the sheer white cliffs she said it we know that poor child carinthia jane when first she beheld old englands shores tossing in the packetboat on a wild channel sea did say it and think it for it is in the family that she did and no wonder that she should the day being showery from the bed of the sun after a frosty three days at the close of autumn we used to have an eye of our own for english weather before printed meteorological observations and forecasts undertook to supplant the shepherd and the poacher and the pilot with his worn brown leather telescope tucked beneath his arm all three would have told you that the end of a three days frost in the late season of the year and the early is likely to draw the warm winds from the atlantic over cornish lands end and lizard quite by chance of things carinthia jane looked on the land of her father and mother for the first time under those conditions there can be no harm in quoting her remark onlyi have to say itexperience causes apprehension that we are again to be delayed by descriptions and an exposition of feelings taken for grantedof course in a serious narrative which it really seems these moderns think designed for a frequent arrest of the actors in the story and a searching of the internal state of this one or that one of them who is laid out stark naked and probed and expounded like as in the celebrated picture by a great painterand we thirsting for events as we are are to stop to enjoy a lecture on anatomy and all the while the windows of the lectureroom are rattling if not the whole fabric shaking with exterior occurrences or impatience for them to come to pass every explanation is sure to be offered by the course events may take so do in mercy i say let us bide for them she thought our island all the darker because henrietta had induced her to talk on the boat of her mountain home and her last morning there for the walk away with chillon john soon it was to appear supernaturally bright a very magicians cave for brilliancy now this had happenedand comment on it to yourselves remembering always that chillon john was a lover and a lover has his excuses though they will not obviate the penalties he may incur and dreadful they were after reading henriettas letter to him he rode out of his canterbury quarters across the country to the borders of sussex where his uncle lord levellier lived on the ridge of ironstone near the wild land of a forest croridge the name of the place now chillon john knew his uncle was miserly and dreaded the prospect of having to support a niece in the wretched establishment at lekkatts or as it was popularly called leancats you can understand why but he managed to assure himself he must in duty consult with the senior and chief member of his family on a subject of such importance as the proposal of marriage to his lordships niece the consultation was short you will leave it to me his uncle said and we hear of business affairs between them involving payment of moneys due to the young man and how whenever he touched on them his uncle immediately fell back on the honour of the family and carinthia janes reputation her good name to be vindicated and especially that there must be no delays together with as close a reckoning as he could make of the value of lord fleetwoods estates in kent and in staffordshire and south wales and his house property in london he will have means to support her said the old lord shrugging as if at his own incapacity for that burden the two then went to the workshops beside a large pond where there was an island bordered with birch trees and workmens cottages near the main building and that was an arsenal containing every kind of sword and lance and musket rifle and fowlingpiece and pistol and more gunpowder than was i believe allowed by law for they were engaged in inventing a new powder for howitzer shells of tremendous explosive power nothing further did either of them say concerning the marriage nor did carinthia jane hear any mention of lord fleetwood from her brother on the landingplace at dover she was taken to admiral baldwin fakenhams house in hampshire and there she remained the delight of his life during two months patiently expecting and rebuking the unmaidenliness of her expectations as honest young women in her position used to do so did they sometimes wait for years they have waited until they withered into their graves like the vapours of a brief winters day a moving picture of a sex restrained by modesty in those purer times from the taking of one step forward unless inquired for two months she waited in our dark land january arrived and her brother henrietta communicated the news my janey you are asked by lord fleetwood whether it is your wish that he should marry you now usually a wellborn young womans answer if a willing one is an example of weak translation here it was the hearts native tongue without any roundabout simple but direct oh i will i am ready tell him remember she was not speaking publicly henrietta knew the man enough to be glad he did not hear she herself would have felt a little shock on his behalf only that answer suited the scheme of the pair of lovers how far those two were innocent in not delivering the whole of lord fleetwoods message to carinthia jane through lord levellier we are unable to learn we may suspect the miserly nobleman of curtailing it for his purposes and such is my idea but the answer would have been the same i am sure in consequence and straight away chillon john betakes him to admiral baldwin and informs him of lord fleetwoods proposal on the night at baden and renewal of it through the mouth of lord levellier not communicating however he may really not have known the story of how it had been wrung from the earl by a surprise movement on the part of the onearmed old lord who burst out on him in the street from the ambush of a clubwindow where he had been stationed every day for a fortnight indefatigably to watch for the passing of the earl as there seemed no other way to find him they say indeed there was a scene judging by the result and it would have been an excellent scene for the stage though the two noblemen were to all appearance politely exchanging their remarks but the audience hearing what passes appreciates the courteous restraint of an attitude so contrasting with their tempers behind the ostentation of civility their words were daggers for it chanced that the young earl after a period of refuge at his welsh castle supposing as he well might that his latest mad freak of the proposal of his hand and title to the strange girl in a quadrille at a foreign castle had been forgotten by her and the risks of annoyance on the subject had quite blown over returned to town happy in having done the penance for his impulsiveness and got clean againthat is to say struck off his fetters and escaped from importunitiesthe very morning of the day when lord levellier sprang upon him it shows the old campaigners shrewdness in guessing where his prey would come and not putting him on his guard by a call at his house out of the window he looked for all the hours of light during an entire fortnight in the service of my sisters child he said to save him from the cost of maintaining her say his enemies at any rate he did it he was likely to have done the worse which i suspect now the imparting of the wonderful news to admiral baldwin fakenham was we read the whiff of a tropical squall to lay him on his beam ends he could not but doubt and his talk was like the sails of a big ship rattling to the first puff of wind he had to believe and then we read he was for hours like a vessel rolling in the trough of the sea of course he was a disappointed father naturally his glance at the loss to henrietta of the greatest prize of the matrimonial market of all europe and america was vexing and saddening then he woke up to think of the fortunes of his other girl as he named her and cried crinny catches him he cried it in glee and rubbed his hands so thereupon standing before him chillon john from whom he had the news bent to him slightly as his elegant manner was and lengthened the admirals chaps with another proposal easy deliberate precise quite the respectful bandit if you please determined on having his daughter by all means only much preferring the legal formal and friendly upon that in the moment of indecision henrietta enters followed by admiral baldwins heroine his crinny whom he embraced and kissed congratulated and kissed again one sees the contrivance to soften him so it was done down in that hampshire household on the heights near the downs whence you might behold off a terra firma resembling a roll of billows englands big battleships in line fronting the island when they were a spectacle of beauty as well as power which now they are no more but will have to be if they are both to float and to fight for i have had quoted to me by a great admirer of the old buccaneer one of the dark sayings in his maxims for men where captain john peter kirby commends his fellowmen to dissatisfaction with themselves if they have not put an end to their enemy handsomely and he advises the copying of nature in this whose elements have always he says a pretty besides a thorough style of doing it when they get the better of us and the one by reason of the other he instances the horse the yacht and chiefly the sword for proof that the handsomest is the most effective and he prints large ugly is only half way to a thing to an invention i suppose he intends to say but looking on our huge foundering sea monsters and the disappearance of the unwieldy in nature and the countenances of criminals who are he bids us observe always in the long run beaten i seem to see a meaning our country might meditate on so as i said it was done for admiral baldwin could refuse his crinny nothing as little as he would deny anything to himself the heartiest of kindly hosts fathers friends carinthia janes grand good fortune covered that pit the question of money somehow and was we may conceive a champagne wine in their reasoning faculties the admiral was in debt henrietta had no heritage chillon john was the heir of a miserly uncle owing him sums and evading every application for them yet they behaved as people who had the cup of golden wishes perhaps it was because henrietta and her lover were so handsome a match as to make it seem to them and others they must marry and as to character her father could trust her to the man of her choice more readily than to the wealthy young nobleman of whose discreetness he had not the highest opinion he reconciled this view with his warm feeling for the countess of fleetwood to be by saying crinny will tame him his faith was in her dauntless bold spirit not thinking of the animal she was to tame countess livia after receiving henriettas letter of information descended on them and thought them each and all a crazed set love as a motive of action for a woman she considered the females lunacy and suicide men are born subject to it happily and thus the balance between the lordly half of creation and the frail is rectified we women dress and smile sigh if you like to excite the malady but if we are the fools to share it we lose our chance instead of the queens we are the slaves and instead of a life of pleasure we pass from fever to fever at a tyrants caprice he does rightly in despising us ay and many a worthy woman thinks the same educated in dependency as they are they come to the idea of love to snatch at it for their weapon of the mans weakness for which my lord calls them heartless and poets are angry with them rightly or wrongly it must i fear be admitted for a truth that sorrow is the portion of young women who give the full measure of love to the engagement marrying for love at least countess livia could declare subsequently she had foretold it and warned her cousin not another reflection do you hear from me if i must pay forfeit of my privilege to hurry you on past descriptions of places and anatomy of character and impertinent talk about philosophy in a story when we are startled and offended by the insinuated tracing of principal incidents to a threadbare spot in the nether garments of a man of no significance i lose patience henriettas case was a secondary affair what with her passionit was nothing lessand her lovers cunning arts and her fathers consent given and in truth the look of the two together the dissuasion of them from union was as likely to keep them apart as an exhortation addressed to magnet and needle countess livia attacked carinthia jane and the admiral backing her but the admiral having given his consent to his daughters marriage in consequence of the earls pledged word to his other girl had become a zealot for this marriage and there was only not a grand altercation on the subject because livia shunned annoyances alone with carinthia jane as she reported to henrietta she spoke to a block that shook a head and wore a thin smile and nursed its own idea of the better knowledge of edward russett earl of fleetwood gained in the run of a silly quadrille at a ball what is a young mans word to his partner in a quadrille livia put the question she put it twice rather sternly and the girl came out with oh he meant it the nature the pride the shifty and furious moods of lord fleetwood were painted frightful to her she had conceived her own image of him whether to set her down as an enamoured idiot or a creature not a whit less artful than her brother was countess livias debate her inclination was to misdoubt the daughter of the old buccaneer she might be simple at her age and she certainly was ignorant but she clung to her prize still the promise was extracted from her that she would not worry the earl to fulfil the word she supposed him to mean in its full meaning the promise was unreluctantly yielded no she would not write admiral fakenham too engaged to leave the matter to a man of honour meanwhile chillon john had taken a journey to lekkatts following which his uncle went to london lord fleetwood heard that miss kirby kept him bound he was again the fated prisoner of his word and following that not so very long there was the announcement of the marriage of chillon john kirby levellier lieutenant in the kings own hussars and henrietta daughter of admiral baldwin fakenham a county newspaper paragraph was quoted for its eulogy of the beauty of hampshire not too strong those acquainted with her thought interest at court obtained an advancement for the bridegroom he was gazetted captain during his honeymoon and his prospects under his uncles name were considerd fair though certain people said at the time it was likely to be all he would get while old lord levellier of leancats remained in the flesh now as it is good for those to tell who intend preserving their taste for romance and hate anatomical lectures we never can come to the exact motives of any extraordinary piece of conduct on the part of man or woman girls are to read and the study of a boy starts from the monkey but no literary surgeon or chemist shall explain positively the cause of the behaviour of men and women in their relations together and speaking to rescue my story i say we must with due submission accept the facts we are not a bit the worse for wondering at them so it happened that lord fleetwoods reply to lord levelliers hammerhammer by post and messenger at his door one may call it on the subject of the celebration of the marriage of the young croesus and carinthia jane in which there was demand for the fixing of a date forthwith was despatched on the day when london had tidings of henrietta pakenhams wedding the letter lost for many years turned up in the hands of a kentish auctioneer selling it on behalf of a farmserving man who had it from lord levelliers cook and housemaid among the things she brought him as her wifely portion after her masters death and this she had not found saleable in her husbands village at her price but she had got the habit of sticking to the scraps being proud of hearing it said that she had skinned leancats to some profit and her expectation proved correct after her own demise for her husband putting it up at the auction our relative on the mothers side dr glossop interested in the documents and particulars of the story as he was had it knocked down to him in contest with an agent of a london gentleman going as high as two pounds ten shillings for the sum of two pounds and fifteen shillings count the amount that makes for each word of a letter a marvel of brevity considering the purport but dr glossop was right in saying he had it cheap the value of that letter may now be multiplied by ten nor for that sum would he part with it thus it ran i need not refer to it in bundle no my lord i drive to your churchdoor on the fourteenth of the month at ten am to keep my appointment with miss c j kirby if i do not blunder the initials your lordships obedient servant fleetwood that letter will ever be a treasured family possession with us that letter was dated from lord fleetwoods kentish mansion esslemont the tenth of the month he must have quitted london for esslemont for change of scene for air the moment after the news of henriettas marriage carinthia jane received the summons without transmission of the letter from her uncle on the morning of the twelfth it was a peremptory summons unfortunately admiral fakenham a real knight and chevalier of those past times would not let her mount the downs to have her farewell view of the big ships unaccompanied by him and partly and largely in pure chivalry no doubt but her young idea of englands grandeur as shown in her great vessels of war thrilled him too and restored his youthful enthusiasm for his noble profession or made it effervesce however it was he rode beside her and rejoiced to hear the young girls talk of her father as a captain of one of englands thunderers and of the cruelty of that admiralty to him at which admiral baldwin laughed but had not the heart to disagree with her for he could belabour the admiralty in season cause or no cause altogether he much enjoyed the ride notwithstanding intimations of the approach of his visitor as he called his attacks of gout riding home however the couple passed through a heavy rainfall and the next day when he was to drive with the bride to lekkatts gout the fiercest he had ever known chained him fast to his bed such are the petty accidents affecting circumstances they are the instruments of destiny there he lay protesting that the ceremony could not possibly be for the fourteenth because countess livia had he now remembered written of her engagement to meet russett on the night of that day at a ball at mrs cowper quilletts place canleys lying south of the surrey hills a house famed for its gatherings of beautiful women whither lord fleetwood would be sure to engage to go the admiral now said and it racked him like gout in his mind and perhaps troubled his conscience about handing the girl to such a young man but he was lying on his back the posture for memory to play the fiend with us as we read in the book of maxims of the old buccaneer admiral baldwin wished heartily to be present at his crinnys wedding to see her launched if wedding it was to be and he vowed the date of the fourteenth in lord levelliers announcement of it must be an error and might be a month in advance and ought to be but it was sheer talking and raving for a solace to his disappointment or his anxiety he had to let carinthia jane depart under the charge of his housekeeper mrs carthew a staid excellent lady poorly gifted with observation her report of the performance of the ceremony at croridge village church a half mile from lekkatts was highly reassuring to the anxious old admiral still lying on his back with memory and gout at their fiends play and livid forecasts hovering he had recollected that there had been no allusion in lord levelliers message to settlements or any lawyers preliminaries and he raged at himself for having to own it would have been the first of questions on behalf of his daughter all passed off correctly mrs carthew said the responses of the bride and bridegroom were particularly articulate she was reserved upon the question of the hospitality of lekkatts the place had entertained her during her necessitated residence there and honour forbade her to smile concordantly at the rosy admirals mention of leancats she took occasion however to praise the earl of fleetwoods eminently provident considerateness for his bride inasmuch as he had packed a hamper in his vehicle which was a fourinhand driven by himself admiral baldwin inquired bride inside he was informed the countess of fleetwood sat on the box on the left of my lord she had made no moan about the absence of bridesmaids she appeared too profoundly happy to meditate an instant upon deficiencies how did the bridegroom behave lord fleetwood was very methodical he is not or was not voluntarily a talker blue coat brass buttons hothouse flower old style or new his lordship wore a rather low beaver and a buttoned white overcoat not out of harmony with the brides plain travellingdress ah hes a good whip men say keeps firstrate stables hacks and bloods esslemont hard by will be the place for their honeymoon i guess and hes a lucky dog if he knows his luck so said admiral baldwin he was proceeding to say more for he had a prodigious opinion of the young countess and the benefit of her marriage to the british race as it concerned a healthy constitution and motherhood mrs carthew coughed and retired nor do i reprove either of them the speculation and the decorum are equally commendable masculine ideas are one thing but let feminine ever be feminine or our civilization perishes at croridge village church then one of the smallest churches in the kingdom the ceremony was performed and duly witnessed names written in the vestry book the clergymans fee the clerk and the pewwoman paid by the bridegroom and thus we see how a pair of lovers blind with the one object of lovers in view and a miserly uncle all on edge to save himself the expense of supporting his niece and an idolatrous old admiral on his back with gout conduced in turn and together to the marriage gradually exciting the worlds wonder till it eclipsed the story of the old buccaneer and countess fanny which it caused to be discussed afresh mrs carthew remembered carinthia janes last maiden remark and her first bridal utterance on the way walking to the church of croridge from lekkatts the girl said going on my feet i feel i continue the mountain walk with my brother when we left our home and after leaving the church about to mount the coach she turned to mrs carthew saying as she embraced her a happy brides kiss should bring some good fortune and looking down from her place on the top of the coach adieu dear mrs carthew a day of glory it is today she must actually have had it in her sight as a day of glory and it was a day of the clouds off our rainy quarter similar in every way to the day of her stepping on english soil and saying it is a dark land for the heart is truly declared to be our colourist a day having the gale in its breast sweeping the whole country and bending the trees for the twigs to hiss like spray of the billows around our island was a day of golden splendour to the young bride of the earl of fleetwood though he scarcely addressed one syllable to her and they sat side by side all but dumb he like a coachman driving an unknown lady fare on a morning after a night when his wifes tongue may have soured him for the sex chapter xiv a pendant of the foregoing mention has been omitted or forgotten by the worthy dame in her vagrant fowls treatment of a story she cannot incubate will not relinquish and may ultimately addle that the bridegroom after walking with a disengaged arm from the little village church at croridge to his coach and four at the cross of the roads to lekkatts and the lowland abruptly and as one pursuing a deferential line of conduct he had prescribed to himself asked his bride what seat she would prefer he shouted ives a person inside the coach appeared to be effectually roused the glass of the window dropped the head of a man emerged it was the head of one of the bargefaced men of the british isles broad and battered flattish with sentinel eyes in an instant the heavyheaded but not illlooking fellow was nimble and jumped from the coach napping my lord he said heavy though the look of him might be his feet were light they flipped a bar of a hornpipe at a touch of the ground perhaps they were allowed to go with their instinct for the dance that his master should have a sample of his wakefulness he quenched a smirk and stood to take orders clad in a flat blue cap a brown overcoat and kneebreeches as the temporary bustle of his legs had revealed fleetwood heard the young lady say i would choose if you please to sit beside you he gave a nod of enforced assent glancing at the vacated box the man inquired a knee and a back for the lady to mount up my lord in was the smart command to him and he popped in with the agility of his popping out then carinthia made reverence to the grey lean figure of her uncle and kissed mrs carthew she needed no help to mount the coach fleetwoods arm was rigidly extended and he did not visibly wince when this foreign girl sprang to the first handgrip on the coach and said no my husband i can do it unaided was implied her stride from the axle of the wheel to the step higher would have been a graceful spectacle on alpine crags fleetwood swallowed that too though it conjured up a mocking recollection of the baden woods and an astonished wild donkey preparing himself for his harness a sour relish of the irony in his present position sharpened him to devilish enjoyment of it as the finest form of loathing on the principle that if we find ourselves consigned to the nether halls we do well to dance drunkenly he had cried for romance here it was he raised his hat to mrs carthew and to lord levellier previous to the ceremony the two noblemen had interchanged the short speech of mannered duellists punctiliously courteous in the opening act their civility was maintained at the termination of the deadly work the old lords bosom thanked the young one for not requiring entertainment and a repast the young lords thanked the old one for a strict military demeanour at an execution and the abstaining from any nonsensical talk over the affair a couple of liveried grooms at the horses heads ran and sprang to the hinder seats as soon as their master had taken the reins he sounded the whip caressingly off those pretty trotters went mrs carthew watched them waving to the bride she was on the present occasion less than usually an acute or a reflective observer owing to her admiration of lordly state and masculine commandership and her thought was she has indeed made a brilliant marriage the lady thought it notwithstanding an eccentricity in the wedding ceremony such as could not but be noticeable but very wealthy noblemen were commonly perhaps necessarily eccentric for thus they proved themselves egregious which the world expected them to be lord levellier sounded loud eulogies of the illustrious drivers team his meditation as he subsequently stated to chillon was upon his vanquished antagonists dexterity in so conducting matters that he had to be taken at once with naught of the customary preface and apology for taking to himself the young lady of which a handsome settlement is the memorial we have to suppose that the curious occupant of the coach inside aroused no curiosity in the pair of absorbed observers speculations regarding the chances of a fall of rain followed the coach until it sank and the backs of the two liveried grooms closed the chapter of the wedding introductory to the honeymoon at esslemont seven miles distant by road to the right of lekkatts it was out of sight that the coach turned to the left northwestward chapter xv opening stage of the honeymoon a famous maxim in the book of the old buccaneer treating of precaution as the brave mans clean conscience with sound counsel to the adventurous has it then you sail away into the tornado happy as a sealed bottle of ripe wine it should mean that brave men entering the jaws of hurricanes are found to have cheerful hearts in them when they know they have done their best but touching the picture of happiness conceive the bounteous bacchic spirit in the devoutness of a sophocles and you find comparison neighbour closely between the sealed wineflask and the bride who is being driven by her husband to the nest of the unknown on her marriage morn seated beside him with bosom at heave and shut mouth in a strange land travelling cloudlike rushing like the showercloud to the vale this carinthia suddenly wedded passionately grateful for humbleness exalted virginly sensible of treasures of love to give resembled the inanimate and most inspiring was mindless and inexpressive past memory beyond the hopes a thing of the thrilled blood and skylark air since she laid her hand in this young mans his not speaking to her was accepted her blood rather than recollection revived their exchanges during the dance at baden for assurance that their likings were one their aims rapturously one that he was she she he the two hearts making one soul could she give as much as he it was hardly asked if we feel we can give our breath of life the strength of the feeling fully answers it bubbles perpetually from the depth like a wellspring in tumult two hearts that make one soul do not separately count their gifts for the rest her hunger to admire disposed her to an absorbing sentience of his acts the trifles gestures manner of this and that which were seized as they flew and swiftly assimilated to stamp his personality driving was the piece of skill she could not do her husbands mastery of the reins endowed him with the beauty of those harmonious trotters he guided and kept to their pace and the humming rush of the pace the smooth torrent of the brown heathknolls and reddish pits and hedgelines and grassflats and copses pouring the counterway of her advance belonged to his wizardry the bearing of her onward was her abandonment to him delicious as mountain air the wind sang it had a song of many voices quite as much as on the mountains there was the keen the blissful nerveknotting catch of the presence of danger in the steep descents taken as if swallowed without swerve or check she was in her husbands hands at times at the pitch of a rapid shelving that was like a fall her heart went down and at the next throb exalted before it rose not reasoning whyher confidence was in him she was his comrade whatever chanced up over the mountainpeaks she had known edged moments little heeded in their passage when life is poised as a crystal pitcher on the head in peril of a step then she had been dependent on herself now she had the joy of trusting to her husband his hard leftward eye had view of her askant if he cared to see how she bore the trial and so relentlessly did he take the slopes that the man inside pushed out an inquiring pate the two grooms tightened arms across their chests her face was calmly set wakeful but unwrinkled the creature did not count among timid girlsor among civilized she had got what she wanted from her madmanmad in his impulses mad in his reading of honour she was the sister of henriettas husband henrietta bore the name she had quitted could madness go beyond the marrying of the creature he chafed at her containment at her courage her silence her withholding the brazen or the fawnish lookup either of which he would have hated he however was dragged to look down neither gorgon nor venus nor a mingling of them she had the chasm of the face recalling the face of his bondage seen first that night at baden it recalled and it was not the face it was the skull of the face or the flesh of the spirit occasionally she looked for a twinkle or two the creature or vision she had been as if to mock by reminding him she was the abhorred delusion who captured him by his nerves ensnared his wordthe doing of a foul witch how had it leapt from his mouth she must have worked for it the word spokenshe must have known ithe was bound or the detested henrietta would have said not even true to his word to see her now this girl insisting to share his name for a slip of his tongue despite the warning sent her through her uncle had that face much as a leaden winter landscape pretends to be the country radiant in colour she belonged to the order of the variable animalsa woman indeedwomanish enough in that there are men who love womenthe idea of woman woman is their shepherdess of sheep he loved freedom loathed the subjection of a partnership could undergo it only in adoration of an ineffable splendour he had stepped to the altar fancying she might keep to her part of the contract by appearing the miracle that subdued him seen by light of day this bitter object beside him was a witch without her spells that is the skeleton of the seductive ghastliest among horrors and ironies let her have the credit of doing her work thoroughly before the exposure she had done it she might have helpedsuch was the stipulation of his mad freak in consenting to the bondageyes she might have helped to soften the sting of his wound she was beside him bearing his name for the perpetual pouring of an acid on the wound that vile henriettapoisoned honey of a girlhad dealt he glanced down at his possessionheaven and the yawning pit were the contrast poisoned honey is after all honey while you eat it here there was nothing but a rocky bowl of emptiness and who was she she was the sister of henriettas husband he was expected to embrace the sister of henriettas husband those two were on their bridal tour this creature was also the daughter of an ancient impostor and desperado called the old buccaneer a distinguished member of the family of the lincolnshire kirbys boasting a present representative grimly acquitted men said on a trial for murder an eminent alliance society considered the earl of fleetwood wildish though he could manage his affairs he and his lawyers had them under strict control how of himself the prize of the english marriage market had taken to his bosom for his winsome bride the daughter of the old buccaneer he was to mix his blood with the blood of the lincolnshire kirbys lying pallid under the hesitating acquittal of a divided jury how had he come to this pass which swung him round to think almost regretfully of the scorned multitude of fair besiegers in the market some of whom had their unpoetic charms he was renowned and unrivalled as the man of stainless honour the one living man of his word he had never broken itnever would there was his distinction among the herd in that a man is princely above princes the nobility of edward russett earl of fleetwood surpassed the nobility of common nobles but by all that is holy he pays for his distinction the creature beside him is a franked issue of her old pirate of a father in one respectnothing frightens her there she sits not a screw of her brows or her lips and the coach rocked they were sharp on a spill midway of the last descent it rocks again she thinks it scarce worth while to look up to reassure him she is looking over the country have you been used to driving he said she replied no it is new to me on a coach carinthia felt at once how wild the wish or half expectation that he would resume the glowing communion of the night which had plighted them she did not this time say my husband still it flicked a whip at his ears she had made it more offensive by so richly toning the official title just won from him as to ring it on the nerves one had to block it or be invaded an anticipation that it would certainly recur haunted every opening of her mouth now that it did not he felt the gap relieved and yet pricked to imagine a mimicry of her tones for the odd foreignness of the word and the sound she had a voice of her own besides her courage at the altar her responses had their music no wonder the day was hers my husband was a manner of saying my fish he spoke very civilly oblige me by telling me what name you are accustomed to answer to she seemed unaware of an arctic husband and replied my father called me carinshort for carinthia my mother called me janey my second name is jane my brother chillon says both henrietta calls me janey the creature appeared dead flesh to goads but the name of her sister inlaw on her lips returned the stroke neatly she spared him one whip to cut him with another you have not informed me which of these names you prefer oh my husband it is as you shall please fleetwood smartened the trot of his team and there was a todo with the rakish leaders fairies of a malignant humour in former days used to punish the unhappiest of the naughty men who were not favourites by suddenly planting a hump on their backs off the bedevilled wretches pranced and they kicked they snorted whinnied rolled galloped outflying the wind but not the dismal rider marriage is our incubus now no explanation is offered of why we are afflicted we have simply offended or some one absent has offended and we are handy the spiteful hag of power ties a wife to us perhaps for the reason that we behaved in the spirit of a better time by being chivalrously honourable wives are just as inexplicable curses just as ineradicable and astonishing as humps imposed on shapely backs fleetwood lashed his horses until carinthias low cry of entreaty rose to surprise that stung him leave the coachman to his devices we have an appointment and must keep it he said they go so willingly good beasts in their way i do not like the whip i have the same objection they were on the level of the vale going along a road between farms and mansions meadows and gardenplots and parkpalings a strong warm wind drove the pack of clouds over the treetops and charged at the branches english scenery animating air a rouse to the blood and the mind carinthia did not ask for hues she had come to love of the dark land with the warm lifting wind the big trees and the hedges and the stately houses and people requiring to be studied who mean well and are warm somewhere below as chimneypots are though they are so stiff english people dislike endearments she had found it might be that her husband disliked any show of fondness he would have to be studied very much he was not like others as henrietta had warned her from thinking of him fervidly she was already past the marvel of the thought that she called him husband at the same time a curious intimation gathered she knew not whence of the word husband on a young wifes lips as being a foreign sound in england advised her to withhold it his behaviour was instructing her are you weatherwiseable to tell when the clouds will hold off or pelt he said to be very civil to a neighbour she collected her understanding apparently treating a conversational run of the tongue as a question to be pondered and the horses paid for it ordinarily he was gentle with his beasts he lashed at her in his heart for perverting the humanest of men father was she replied oh i have heard of him her face lightened father had a great name in england the old buccaneer i think i do not know he was a seaman of the navy like admiral fakenham is weather at sea weather on the mountains he could foretell it always he wrote a book i have a copy you will read it is a book of maxims he often speaks of the weather english weather and women he says but not my mother my mother he stood aside by herselfpas capricieuse du tout because she would be out in the weather and brave the weather she rode she swam best of any woman if she could have known you what pleasure for me mother learnt to read mountain weather from father i did it too but sometimes on the high fields upper snows it is very surprising father has been caught here the cloud is down near the earth and the strong wind keeps the rain from falling how long the wind will blow i cannot guess but you love the mountains we spoke and mountains adventures we both love i will talk french if you like for i think german you do not speak i may speak english better than french but i am afraid of my english with you dear me quoth fleetwood and he murmured politely and cursorily attentive to his coachman business she had a voice that clove the noise of the wheels and she had a desire to talkthat was evident talk of her father set her prattling it became clear also to his not dishonest his impressionable mind that her baby english might be natural or she was mildly playing on it to give herself an air he had no remembrance of such baby english at baden there however she was in a state of enthusiasmthe sort of illuminated transparency they show at the end of fireworks mention of her old scapegrace of a father lit her up again the girl there and the girl here were no doubt the same it could not be said that she had duped him he had done it for himselfacted on by a particular agency this creature had not the capacity to dupe he had armed a bluntwitted young woman with his idiocy and she had dealt the stroke different in scarce a degree by nature from other young women of prey but her look at times and now and then her voice gave sign that she counted on befooling him as well to reconcile him to his bondage the calculation was excessive no woman had done it yet idiocy plunged him the step which reawakened understanding and to keep his whole mind alert on guard against any sort of satisfaction with his bargain he frankly referred to the cause not female arts but natures impulses it was his passion for the wondrous in the look of a womans face the new morning of the idea of women in the look and the peep into imaginary novel character did the trick of enslaving him call it idiocy such it was once acknowledged it is not likely to recur an implacable reason sits in its place with a keen blade for efforts to carry the imposture further afield or make it agreeable yet after giving his word to lord levellier he had prodded himself to think the burden of this wild young woman might be absurdly tolerable and a laugh at the world a solicitude for the animal was marked by his inquiry you are not hungry yet oh no not yet said she oddly enlivened they had a hamper and were independent of stoppages for provision he informed her what more delightful cried her look seeing the first middays rest and meal with chillon on the walk over the mountain from their empty home she could get up enthusiasm for a stocked hamper and when told of some business that drew him to a meadow they were nearing she said she would be glad to help if she could i learn quickly i know his head acquiesced the daughter of the old buccaneer might learn the business quickly perhaps a singularly cutting smile was on his tight lips in memory of a desire he had as a boy to join hands with an amazonian damsel and be out over the world for adventures comrade and bride as one here the creature sat life is the burlesque of young dreams or they precipitate us on the roar and grin of a recognized beast world the devil possessing him gnawed so furiously that a partial mitigation of the pain was afforded by sight of waving hats on a hillrise of the road he flourished his whip the hats continued at windmill work it signified brisk news to him and prospect of glee to propitiate any number of devils you will want a maid to attend on you he said she replied i am not used to attendance on me henriettas maid would help i did not want her i had no maid at home i can do for myself father and mother liked me to be very independent he supposed he would have to hear her spelling her words out next the hilltop was gained twenty paces of pretty trotting brought up the coach beside an inn porch in the style of the finish dear to whips and even imperative upon them if they love their art two gentlemen stood in the road and a young woman at the inn door a darkhaired girl of an anxious countenance her puckers vanished at some signal from inside the coach all right madge nothing to fear fleetwood called to her and she curtseyed he alighted saying to her before he spoke to his friends ive brought him safe had him under my eye the last four and twenty hours hell do the trick today you dont bet oh my lord no help the lady down out with you ines the lightlegged bargefaced man touched ground capering he was greeted kit by the pair of gentlemen who shook hands with him after he had faintly simulated the challenge to a jig with madge she flounced from him holding her arms up to the lady landlord landlady and hostler besought the lady to stay for the fixing of a ladder carinthia stepped leaped and entered the inn fleetwood remarking we are very independent chummy potts cordy bally by jove potts cried but the moment after this disengaged ejaculation he was taken with a bewilderment at the opera he questioned of his perplexity no sir not at the opera fleetwood rejoined the ladys last public appearance was at the altar sort of a suspicion of having seen her somewhere left her husband behind has she you see she has gone in the scoring of a proposition of euclid on the forehead of potts amused him and the other gentleman who was hailed mallard and cared nothing for problems involving the female of man when such work was to the fore as the pugilistic encounter of the earl of fleetwoods chosen kit ines with lord brailstones unbeaten and wellbacked ben todds ines had done pretty things from the age of seventeen to his twentythird year remarkably clever things they were to be called great in the annals of the ring the point however was that the pockets of his backers had seriously felt his latest fight he received a dogs licking at the hands of lummy phelps his inferior in skill fighting two to one of the odds and all because of his fatal addiction to the breaking of his trainers imposed fast in liquids on the night before the battle right through his training up to that hour the rascal was devout the majoritys money rattled all on the snug safe side and how did he get at the bottle his trainers never could say but what made him turn himself into a headlong ass when he had only to wait a night to sit among friends and worshippers drinking off his tumbler upon tumbler with the honours it was past his wits to explain endurance of his privation had snapped in him or else which is more likely this genius of the ring was tempted by his genius on the summit of his perfected powers to believe the battle his own and celebrate it as became a victor despising the drubbed antagonist in any case he drank and a minor man gave him the dogs licking went into it puffy came out of it bunged the chronicle resounding over england ran old england read of an eyeless carcase heroically stepping up to time for three rounds of mashing punishment if he had won the day after all the country would have been electrified it sympathized on the side of his backers too much to do more than nod a short approval of his fortitude to sink with flag flying is next to sinking the enemy there was talk of a girl present at the fight and of how she received the eyeless almost faceless carcase of her sweetheart kit and carried him away in a little donkeycart comfortably cushioned to meet disaster this petty incident drew the attention of the earl of fleetwood then beginning to be known as the diamond of uncounted facets patron of the pick of all departments of manly activity in england the devotion of the girl madge to her sweetheart was really a fine story fleetwood touched on it to mr mallard speaking of it like the gentleman he could be while chumley potts wagged impatient acquiescence in a romantic episode of the ring that kept the talk from the hotter theme moneys bank of england today you think he interposed and had his answer after mallard had said the girl s rather goodlooking too you may double your bets chummy i had the fellow to his tea at my dinnertable yesterday evening locked him in his bedroom and had him up and out for a morning spin at six his trainer flippers on the field drove from esslemont at nine confident as trumps deuce of a goodlooking girl potts could now afford to say and he sang out feel fit lucky dog concert pitch was the declaration of kit ives how about lord brailstones man female partner in a quadrille sir ah potts doated on his limbs with a butchers eye for prize joints cocksure has crowed low by sunset mallard observed fleetwood offered him to take his bets youre heavy on it with brailstone said mallard three thousand id back you for your luck blindfold a ruffle of sourness shot over the features of the earl and was noticed by both eager betters who exchanged a glance potts inspected his watch and said half aloud liver ten to one that never meant bad luckexcept bad to act on we slept here last night you know it s a mile and a quarter from the royal sovereign to the field of glory pretty well time to start brailstone has a drive of a couple of miles coaches from london down by this time abranes dead on ben todds any odds poor old braney steady man todds backs him because hes a respectable citizendont drink a prizefighter total abstainer has no spurts old braneys branded for the losing side you might bet against braney blindfold mallard how long shall you take to polish him off kit ines the opponent of ben todds calculated well sir steady benny ought to be satisfied with his dose in say about forty minutes maybe he wont own to it before an hour and ten hes got a proud english stomach shall we be late potts asked jump in fleetwood said to his man we may be five minutes after time chummy i had a longer drive and had to get married on the way andah here they are lady coming i fancy she sticks to the coach i dont know her tastes madge must see her through it thats positive potts deferred his astonishment at the things he was hearing and seeing which were only fleetwoods riddles the fight and the bets rang every other matter out of his head he beheld the lady who had come down from the coach like a columbine mount it like beanstalk jack madge was not half so clever and required a hand at her elbow after giving hurried directions to rundles the landlord of the royal sovereign fleetwood took the reins and all three gentlemen touched hats to the curtseying figure of mrs rundles you have heard i dare sayits an english scene he spoke partly turning his face to carinthia particularly select today their majesties might look on as the caesars did in rome pity we cant persuade them they ought to set the fashion here we have the english people at their grandest in prime condition if they were not drunk overnight and dogged perfectly awake magnanimous all for fair play fine fellows upon my word a little blood of course but the daughter of the old buccaneer would have inherited a tenderness for the sight of blood she should make a natural lady patroness of englands national sports we might turn her to that purpose wander over england with a tail of shouting riffraft have exhibitions join in them display our accomplishments issue challenges to fence shoot walk run box in time the creature has muscle its one way of crowning a freak we follow the direction since the deed done cant be undone and a precious poetical life too you may get as royally intoxicated on swipes as on choice wine win a name for yourself as the husband of such a wife a name in sporting journals and shilling biographies quite a revival of the peerage they have begun to rail at i would not wish to leave you said carinthia you have chosen said fleetwood chapter xvi in which the bride from foreign parts is given a taste of old england cheers at an open gate of a field saluted the familiar scarlet of the earl of fleetwoods coach in kentish land they were chorister cheers the spontaneous ringing out of english country hearts in homage to the nobleman who brightened the heaviness of life on english land with a spectacle of the noble art distinguishing their fathers he drove along over muffling turf ploughboys and blue butcherboys and smocked old men with an approach to a hundredweight on their heels at the trot to right and left all hoping for an occasional sight of the jewel called kitty that he carried inside kitty was there kittys eyes are shut think of that cradled innocence and angels dreams and the whole of the hymn just before dingdongbang on noses and jaws that means confidence looks like it but kittys not asleep you try him hes only quiet because he has got to undergo great exertion last fight he was knocked out of time because he went into it honest drunk they tell and the earl took him up to give him a chance of recovering his good name and thats christian but the earl he knows a man as well as a horse hes one to follow go to a fayte down at esslemont you wont forget your day see there hes brought a lady on the top o the coach that seems for to signify he dont expect its going to be much of a bloody business but theres no accounting anyhow broadfield ll have a name in the papers for sunday reading in comes t other lords coach theyve timed it together closes they have they were pronounced to be both the right sort of noblemen for the country lord brailstones blue coach rattled through an eastern gate to the corner of the thirtyacre meadow where lord fleetwood had drawn up a toss from the ring the meeting of the blue and scarlet coaches drew forth old englands thunders and when the costly treasures contained in them popped out heads the moment was delirious kit ines came after his head on a bound ben todds was ostentatiously deliberate his party said he was no dancingmaster he stepped out grave as a barge emerging from a lock though alive to the hurrahs of supporters and punctilious in returning the formal portion of his rivals too roguish nod their look was sharp into the eyes just an instant brailstone and fleetwood jumped to the grass and met talking and laughing precise upon points of business otherwise cordial plenipotentiaries of great powers whom they have set in motion and bind to the ceremonial opening steps according to the rules of civilized warfare they had a short colloquy with newspaper reporters an absolutely fair square upright fight of britons was to be chronicled captain abrane a tower in the crowd registered bets whenever he could curricles gigs carts ponytraps boys on ponies a swarm on legs flowed to the central point and huddled there was either champion born in kent an audacious boy proclaimed kit ines a man of kent why of course he was and that was why the earl of fleetwood backed our cocky kitty and means to land him on the top of his profession ben todds was shuffled aside as one of their londoners destitute of county savour all very well but have a spy at benny todds who looks the square man and hear what that big gentleman of the other lords party says a gentleman of his height and weight has a right to his opinion he s dead against kit ines its fists not feet he says ll do it today stamina he says benny has got the stamina todds possession of the stamina and the grand voice of captain abrane and the father christmas roastbeefofold england face of the umpire declared to be on the side of lord brailstones colour blue darkened the star of kit ines till a characteristic piece of behaviour was espied he dashed his cap into the ring and followed it with the lightest of vaults across the ropes there he was the first in the ring and that stands for promise of first blow first blood first flat knockdown and last to cry for quarter his pair of seconds were soon after him fleetwood mounted his box is it to fight said carinthia to see which is the master they fight to see generally until one or the other cant see you are not obliged to see it you can be driven away if you wish i will be here if you are here you choose it fleetwood leaned over to chumley potts on the turf abranes ruining himself potts frankly hoped that his friend might be doing so todds is jolly well backed hes in prime condition hes the favourite of the knowing ones you wouldnt have the odds if he werent no but the odds are like ten per cent they conjure the gale and be hanged said potts he swore at his betting mania which destroyed the pleasure of the show he loved all in the ring were shaking hands shots of a desire to question and comment sped through carinthias veins and hurt her she had gathered that she spoke foolishly to her husbands ear so she kept her mouth shut though the unanswered of her inquisitive ignorance in the strange land pricked painfully at her bosom she heard the girl behind her say our colours when the colour scarlet unwound with lord brailstones blue was tied to the stake and her husband nodded he smiled he liked to hear the girl potts climbed up crying toilets complete now for paws out and then at it my hearties choice of corners under the leaden low cloud counted for little a signal was given a man outside the ring eyed a watch raised a hand the two umpires were on foot in their places the pair of opposing seconds hurried out cheery or boltbusiness words to their men and the champions advanced to the scratch todds first by the courtesy of ines whose decorous control of his legs at a weighty moment was rightly read by his party their hands grasped firmly thereupon becoming fists of a hostile couple in position and simply to learn which of us two is the better man or in other words with four simple fists to compass a patent fact and stand it on the historic pedestal with a little red writing underneath you never can patent a fact without it but mark the differences of this kind of contention from all otherespecially the parliamentary this is positive it has a beginning and an end and it is goodhumoured from beginning to end trial of skill trial of stamina nature and art old english which made us what we are and no rancours no vows of vengeance the beaten man of the two bowing to the bit of history he has helped to make kittites had need to be confident in the skill of their lither lad his facer looked granite fronting that mass kit you mightnot to lash about for comparisonscall a bundle of bamboo ay but well knitted springy alive every inch of him crafty too as you will soon bear witness he knows he has got his task and hes the man to do it there was wary sparring and mirrors watched them bigger fellow but have no fear the earl said over his shoulder to madge she said in return oh i dont know im praying kit was now on his toes all himself like one who has found the key he feinted quick as lightning he landed a bolt on bens jib just at the tollbar of the bridge between the eyes and was off out of reach elastic bens counter fell short by a couple of inches cheers for first blow the earl clucked to madge her gaze at the ring was a sullen intensity will you believe itben received a second spanking cracker on the spectaclesseat neat indeed and poor payment for the compliment he managed to dig a drive at the ribs as much of that game as may suit you sturdy ben but hear the shout and behold first blood to kit ines that telltale nose of old bens has mounted the earl of fleetwoods colours and all his party are looking brailstoneblue so far said fleetwood his grooms took an indication the hamper was unfastened sandwiches were handed carinthia held one she tried to nibble in obedience to her husbands example madge refused a bite of food hearing carinthia say to her i hope he will not be beaten i hope i hope she made answer you are very good miss and the young lady flushed gentlemen below were talking up to the earl a kentish squire of an estate neighbouring esslemont introduced a welsh squire he had driven to see the fun by the name of mr owain wythan a neighbour of the earls down in wales refreshments were offered carinthia submissively sipped the sparkling wine which stings the lips when they are indisposed to it the voice of the girl madge rang on the tightened chords of her breast madge had said she was praying and to pray was all that could be done by two women her husband could laugh loudly with mr potts and the other gentlemen and the strangers he was quite sure the man he supported would win he might have means of knowing carinthia clung to his bare words for the sake of the girl a roaring peal went up from the circle of combat kit had it this time attacking bens peepers he was bent on defending his own and he caught a bodyblow that sent him hopping back to his pair of seconds five clear hops to the rear like a smashed surgewave off the rock he was respectful for the remainder of the round but hammering at the system he had formed in the very next round he dropped from a tremendous repetition of the blow and lay flat as a turbot the bets against him had simultaneously a seesaw rise bellows he appears to have none was the comment of chumley potts now for training chummy said lord fleetwood chummy signifying a crow over potts rang out of the hollows of captain abrane on lord brailstones coach carinthia put a hand behind her to madge it was grasped in gratitude for sympathy or in feminine politeness the girl murmured ive seen worse she was not speaking to ears lord fleetwood sat watch in hand up he said and as if hearing him kit rose from the ministering seconds knee he walked stiffly squared after the fashion of a man taught caution ben made play they rounded the ring giving and taking ben rushed and had an emollient spouted again and was corked again and received a neat redwaxen stopper he would not be denied at kits door found him at home and hugged him kit got himself to grass after a spell of heavy fibbing bens game it did him no great harm it might be taken for an enlivener he was dead on his favourite spot the ensuing round played postman on it so cleverly easily dancingly did he perform the double knock and the retreat that chumley potts was moved to forget his wagers and exclaim racketball by jove if he doesnt let the fellow fib the wind out of him mallard addressed his own crab eyeballs lord fleetwood heard and said coolly tightstrung i kept him fasting since he earned his breakfast you dont wind an empty rascal fit for action a sword through the lungs wont kill when theres no air in them that was printed in the few words before the encounter in the book of maxims for men carinthia hearing everything her husband uttered burned to remind him of the similarity between his opinions and her fathers she was learning that for some reason allusions to her father were not acceptable she squeezed the hand of madge and felt a pressure like a scream telling her the girls heart was with the fight beneath them she thought it natural for her she wished she could continue looking as intently she looked because her husband looked the dark hills and clouds curtaining the run of the stretch of fields relieved her sight the clouds went their way the hills were solid but like a blue smoke the scene here made them very distant and strange those two men were still hitting not hating one another only to gratify a number of unintelligible people and win a success but the earth and sky seemed to say what is the glory they were insensible to it as they are not they are never insensible to noble grounds of strife they bless the spot they light lamps on it they put it into books of history make it holy if the cause was a noble one or a good one or supposing both those men loved the girl who loved one of them then would carinthia be less reluctantly interested in their blows her infant logic stumbled on for a reason while she repressed the torture the scene was becoming as though a reason could be found by her submissive observation of it and she was right in believing that a reason for the scene must or should exist only like other bewildered instinctive believers she could not summon the great universe or a lifes experience to unfold it her one consolation was in squeezing the hand of the girl from time to time not stealthily done it was not objected to by the husband whose eye was on all but the persistence in doing it sank her from the benignity of her station to the girls level it was conduct much too raw and grated on the deed of the man who had given her his name madge pleased him better she had the right to be excited and she was very little demonstrative she hadwell in justice the couple of them had only she had it morethe tone of the women who can be screwed to witness a spill of blood peculiarly catching to heara tone of every string in them snapped except the silver string catching to hear it is worth a stretching of them on the rack to hear that low buzzhum of their inner breast by heaven we have them at their best when they sing that note his watch was near an hour of the contest and brailstones man had scored first knockdown blow a particularly clean floorer thinking of that he was cheered by hearing chummy potts whose opinions he despised cry out to abrane yeast to him for the face of todds was visibly swelling to the ripest of plums from kits deliveries down he went he had the sturdy legs which are no legs to a clean blow odds were offered against him oh pretty play with your right kit exclaimed mallard as kit fetched his man an ugly stroke on the round of the waist behind and the crowd sent up the name of the great organs affected a sickener of a stroke if dealt soundly it meant more than showed kit was now for taking liberties light as ever on his pins he now and then varied his attentions to the yeasty part delivering a wakener in unexpected quarters masterly as the skilled cooks carving of a joint with hungry guests for admirers eh madge the earl said she kept her sight fixed replying yes i think carinthia joined with her i must believe it that he will but will the other man poor man submit i entreat him to put away his pride it is hisoh poor man ben was having it hot and fast on a torso physiognomy the voices of these alien women thrilled the fray and were a bardic harp to lord fleetwood he dropped a pleasant word on the heads in the curricle mr owain wythan looked up worthy of theocritus its the boxing twin and the bembrycian giant the style of each to the letter kit is assiduously fastening bens blinkers potts remarked he explained to the incomprehensible lady he fancied he had somewhere seen that the battle might be known as near the finish by the behaviour on board lord brailstones coach its like foreign affaits and the stock exchange he said to the more intelligent males if i want to know exactly how the country stands i turn to the money article in the papers thats a barometrical certainty no use inquiring abroad look at old rufus abrane i see the state of the fight on the old fellows mug he hasnt a bet left in him captain mountainrufus mus cried lord fleetwood and laughed at the penetrative portrait woodseers epigram sketched he had a desire for the presence of the singular vagabond the rufus mus in the captain mountain exposed his view of the encounter by growing stiller apparently growing smaller without a squeak like the entrapped and profoundly contemplative after the style of the absolutely detached who foresee the fatal crash and are calculating far ahead of events the means for meeting their personal losses the close of the battle was on the visage of rufus abrane fifteen minutes before that elgin marble under red paint in the ring sat on the knee of a succouring seconder mopped rubbed dramprimed puppypeeping inconsolably comforted preparatory to the resumption of the greatcoat he had so hopefully cast from his shoulders not downcast by any means like an old roman the man of the sheer hulk with purple eyemounds found his legs to do the manful thing show that there was no bad blood stand equal to all forms ben todds if ever man in old england looked the picture you might label bellyful it was remarked kit ines had an appearance of springy readiness to lead off again so they faced on the opening step of their march into english history vanquisher and vanquished shook hands engaged in a parting rally of goodhumoured banter the beaten man said his handsome word the best man capped it with a compliment to him they drink of different cups today both will drink of one cup in the day to come but the day went too clearly to crown the light and the tight and the right man of the two for moralizing to wag its tail at the end oldsters and youngsters agreed to that science had done it happy the backers of science not one of them alluded to the philosophical hundred years hence for when england thanks to a spirited pair of our young noblemen has exhibited one of her characteristic performances consummately philosophy is bidden fly she is a foreign bird chapter xvii records a shadow contest close on the foregoing kit ines cocked an eye at madge in the midst of the congratulations and the paeans pumping his arms as he had been little mauled he could present a face to her expecting a wreath of smiles for the victor what are we to think of the contrarious young woman who when he lay beaten drove him off the field and was all tenderness and devotion she bobbed her head hardly more than a trifle pleased one might say just like females theyre riddles not worth spelling then drunk ill get tonight my pretty dear the man muttered soured by her inopportune staidness as an opponents bruisings could never have rendered him she smiled a lively beam in answer to the earl oh yes i m glad its your doing my lord him it was that she thanked and for the moment prized most the female riddle is hard to read because it is compounded of sensations and they rouse and appeal to the similar cockatrices in us which either hiss back or coil upon themselves she admired kit ines for his valour she hated that ruinous and besotting drink it flung skeletons of a married couple on the wall of the future nevertheless her love had been all maternal to him when he lay chastised and disgraced on account of his vice pity had done it pity not being stirred her admiration of the hero declared victorious whose fortunes in uncertainty had stopped the beating of her heart was eclipsed by gratitude toward his preserver and a sentiment eclipsed becomes temporarily coldish against our wish and our efforts in a way to astonish making her think that she cannot hold two sentiments at a time when it is but the fact that she is unable to keep the two equally warm carinthia said to her he is brave oh yes hes brave madge assented lord brailstone flourishing his whip cried out at canleys tonight the earl nodded i shall be there you too chummy came from abrane to see you dance potts rejoined and mumbled but will he dance old braneys down on his luck hes a specimen of a fellow emptier and not lighter and wont be till suppertime but i say fleet how the deucefunny sort of proceedingyou havent introduced me the lady bears my name mr chumley potts with a bow to the ladys profile and a mention of a glimpse at baden potts ejaculated it happened this morning you allude to the marriage it happened this morning how do i get to canleys i drive you another team from the esslemont stables is waiting at the royal you stay at canleys no no oh funny upon my word though i dont know why notexcept that people count your winnings chummy fleetwood remarked to his bride our friend has the habit of soliloquizing in company i forgot to tell you of an appointment of mine at a place called canleys about twenty miles or more from here i gave my word so i keep it the landlady at the inn mrs rundles motherly kind of woman she will be attentive they dont cook badly for an english inn i have heard madge here will act as your ladysmaid for the time you will find her serviceable shes a bruisers lass and something above it ines informed me madge you were going to friends of yours at the wells you will stay at the royal and wait on this lady who bears my name you understanda girl i can trust for courage if the article is in request he resumed to his bride and talked generally of the inn and the management of it and its favoured position outside the village and contiguous to the river upon which it subsisted carinthia had heard she was more than ever the stunned young woman she had been since her mounting of the coach between the village church and lekkatts she said not a word why should she her object was won give her that and a womans tongue will consent to rest the dreaded weapon rest also when she is kept spinning by the whip she gives out a pleasant hum too her complexion must be pronounced dull in repose a bride on her travels with an aspect of wet chalk rather helps to scare mankind from marriage which may be good or bad but she reflects a sicklier hue on the captured chessman calling her his own let her shine in privacy fleetwood drew up at the royal sovereign whereof the reigning monarch in blue uniform on the signboard curtseyed to his equally windy subjects and a small congregation of the aged and some cripples and infants greeted the patron of old englands manfullest display cheering at news of the fight brought them by many little runners your box has been conveyed to your room he said to his bride she bowed this time she descended the coach by the aid of the ladder ines victorious in battle had scant notice from his love yes i m glad and she passed him to follow her newly constituted mistress his pride was dashed all the foam of the first draw on the top of him blown off as he figuratively explained the cause of his gloom to the earl i drink and i gets a lickingthat girl nurses and cossets me i dont drink and i whops my manshe shows me her back aint it encouragement my lord you ought to know them by this time you dolt returned his patron and complimented him on his bearing in the fight you shall have your two hundred and something will be added hold handy here till i mount i start in ten minutes whether to speak a polite adieu to the bride whose absurd position she had brought on her own head was debated for half a minute he considered that the wet chalkquarry of a beauty had at all events the merit of not being a creature to make scenes he went up to the sitting room if she was not there he would leave his excuses she was there and seated neither crying nor smiling nor pointedly serious in any way not conventionally at her ease either and so clearly was he impressed by her transparency in simplicity of expression that he took without a spurn at it the picture of a woman half drained of her blood veiling the wound and a young woman a stranger to suffering perhapsas the creatures do looking for the usual flummery tenderness what they call happiness wondering at the absence of it and the shifty ghost of a husband she has got by floundering into the bog known as marriage she would have it and here she was he entered the situation and was possessed by the shivering delicacy of it surface emotions were not seen on her she might be a creature with a soul here and there the thing has been found in women it is priceless when found and she could not be acting one might swear the creature had no power to act she spoke without offence the simplest of words affected no solicitudes put on no gilt smiles wore no reproaches spoke to him as if so it happenedhe had necessarily a journey to perform one could see all the while big drops falling from the wound within one could hear it in her voice imagine a crack of the string at the bows deep stress or imagine the bow paralyzed at the moment of the deepest sounding and yet the voice did not waver she had now the richness of tone carrying on a music through silence well then at least he had not been the utterly duped fool he thought himself since the consent was pledged to wed her more she had beautyof its kind or splendour or grandeur was the term for it but it bore no name none of her qualitiesif they were qualitieshad a name she stood with a dignity that the word did not express she endured meekly when there was no meekness pain breathed out of her and not a sign of pain was visible she had under his present observation of her beauty with the lines of her face breaking in revolt from beautyor requiring a superterrestrial illumination to show the harmony he as he now saw had erred grossly in supposing her insensitive and therefore slow of a womans understanding she drew the breath of pain through the lips red lips and well cut her brown eyes were tearless not alluring or beseeching or repelling they did but look much like the skies opening high aloof on a wreck of storm her reddish hairchestnut if you willlet fall a skein over one of the rugged brows and softened the ruggedness by making it wilder as if a great bird were winging across a shoulder of the mountain ridges conceived of the mountains built in their image the face partook alternately of mountain terror or splendour wholly he remembered of the splendour when her blood ran warm no longer the chalkquarry faceits paleness now was that of night alps beneath a moon chasing the shadows she might be casting her spells again you remember i told you he said i have given my wordi dont break itto be at a ball your uncle was urgent to have the ceremony over these clashes occur the people herei have spoken of that people of good repute for attention to guests i am uncertain of the time we have all to learn to wait so then goodbye till we meet he was experiencing a novel nip of torment of just the degree which takes a partial appeasement from the inflicting of it and calls up a loathed compassion she might have been in his arms for a step though she would not have been the better loved he was allowed his escape bearing with him enough of husband to execrate another enslaving pledge of his word that begat a frenzy to wreak some caresses on the creatures intolerably haunting image of course he could not return to her how would she receive him there was no salt in the thought of it she was too submissive however there would be fun with chummy potts on the drive to canleys fun with rufus abrane at mrs cowper quilletts and with the countess livia smothered struggling fighting for life with the title of dowager a desire for unbridled fun had hold of any amount of it to excess in any direction and though this cloud as a dry tongue after much wine craves water glimpses of his tramps walk with a fellow tramp on a different road enjoying strangely healthy vagabond sensations and vast ideas brought the vagrant philosopher refreshfully to his mind chiefly for the reason that while in woodseers company he had hardly suffered a stroke of pain from the thought of henrietta she was now a married woman he was a married man by the register stronger proof of the maddest of worlds could not be furnished sane in so mad a world a man is your flabby citizen among outlaws good for plucking fun at any cost is the one object worth a shot in such a world and the fun is not to stop if it does we are likely to be got hold of and lugged away to the altarthe terminus that foul disaster has happened through our having temporarily yielded to a fit of the dumps and treated a mad worlds lunatic issue with some seriousness but fun shall be had with the aid of his highness below the madder the world the madder the fun and the mixing in it of another element which it has to beguile usromanceis not at all bad cookery poetic romance is delusiona tale of a corsair a poets brain a bottle of gin and a theatrical wardrobe comic romance is about us everywhere alive for the tapping a daughter of the old buccaneer should participate in it by right of birth she would expect it in order to feel herself perfectly at home then be sure she finds an english tongue and prattles away as merrily as she does when her old scapegrace of a father is the theme soninlaw to him but the path of wisdom runs in the line of facts and to have wild fun and romance on this pantomime path instead of kicking to break away from it we follow things conceived by the genius of the situation for the delectation of the fair countess of fleetwood and the earl her delighted husband quite in the spirit of the old buccaneer father of the bride carinthia sat beside the fire seeing nothing in the room or on the road up in her bedchamber the girl madge was at her window she saw lord fleetwood standing alone laughing it seemed at some thought he threw up his head was it a newly married man leaving his bride and laughing the bride was a dear lady fit for better than to be driven to look on at a prizefighta terrible scene to a lady she was left solitary and this her wedding day the earl had said it he had said she bore his name spoke of coming from the altar and the lady had blushed to hear herself called miss the pressure of her hand was warm with madge her situation roused the fervid latent sisterhood in the breast of women before he mounted the coach lord fleetwood talked to kit ives he pointed at an upper window seemed to be issuing directions kit nodded he understood it whatever it was you might have said a pair of burglars the girl ran downstairs to bid her lover goodbye and show him she really rejoiced in his victory kit came to her saying given my word of honour i wont make a beast of myself tonight got to watch over you and your lady lord fleetwood started his fresh team casting no glance at the windows of the room where his bride was he and the gentlemen on the coach were laughing his leaving of his young bride to herself this day was classed among the murky flashes which distinguished the deeds of noblemen but his laughter on leaving her stamped it a cruelty of the kind that plain mortals who can be monsters commit madge conceived a pretext for going into the presence of her mistress whose attitude was the same as when she first sat in the chair the lady smiled and said he is not hurt much she thought for them about her the girls heart of sympathy thumped and her hero became a very minute object he had spoken previously of the making or not making a beast of himself without inflicting a picture of the beast his words took shape now and in consequence a little selfpity began to move it stirred to swell the great wave of pity for the lady that was in her bosom oh he she said and extinguished the thought of him and at once her underlip was shivering her eyes filled and poured carinthia rose anxiously the girl dropped at her feet you have been so good to me today my lady so good to me today i cant help it i dont often just for this moment ive been excited oh hes well he will do hes nothing you say poor child but im not its only excitement i do long to serve you the best i can she stood up in obedience and had the arms of her young mistress pressing her tears also were streaming from carinthias eyes heartily she thanked the girl for the excuse to cry they were two women on the road to canleys the coach conveying men spouted with the lusty anecdote relieved of the interdict of a tyrannical sex chapter xviii down whitechapel way contention begets contention in a land of the pirate races gigs were at high rival speed along the road from the battlefield to london they were the electrical wires of the time for an expectant population bursting to have report of so thundering an event as the encounter of two champion light weights nursed and backed by a pair of gallant young noblemen pick of the whole row of coronets above london panted gaping and the gigs flew with the meat to fill it chumley potts offered ambrose mallard fair odds that the neat little trap of the chief sporting journal which had a reputation to maintain would be over one or other of the bridges crossing the thames first mallard had been struck by the neat little trap of an impudent new and lower priced journal which had a reputation to gain he took the proffered odds on the cry as of a cracker splitting enormous difficulties in regard to the testimony and the verifications were discussed they were overcome potts was ready for any amount of trouble mallard the same there was clearly a race there would consequently be a record visits to the offices of those papers perhaps half a day at the south end of london or on westminster bridge examining witnesses corner shopmen watermen and the like would or should satisfactorily establish the disputed point fleetwood had his fun insomuch that he laughed himself into a sentiment of humaneness toward the couple of donkeys and forgot his contempt of them their gamblings and their bets increased his number of dependents and imbeciles were preferable to dolts or the dry gilt figures of the circle he had to move in matter for some astonishment had been furnished to the latter this day and would cause an icy signor stare and rather an angry signora flutter a characteristic of that upper circle as he knew it is that the good are dull the vicious very bad they had nothing to please him but manners elsewhere this land is a land of no manners take it and make the most of it then for its quality of brute honesty which is found to flourish best in the british prizering his irony landed him there it struck the country a ringing blow but it struck an almost effacing one at the life of the young nobleman of boundless wealth whose highest renown was the being a patron of prizefighters husband of the daughter of the old buccaneer as well perchance as a result that philosopher tramp named her beautiful gorgon she has no beauty and as for gorgon the creature has a look of timid softness in waiting behind her rocky eyes a barbaric damsel beginning to nibble at civilization is nearer the mark and ought she to be discouraged fleetwoods wrath with his position warned him against the dupery of any such alcove thoughts for his wrath revenged him and he feared the being stripped of it lest a certain fund of his own softness that he knew of though few did should pull him to the creatures feet she belonged to him indeed so he might put her to the trial of whether she had a heart and personal charm without the ceremony of wooingwhich in his case tempted to the feeling desperately earnest and becoming enslaved he speculated upon her eyelids and lips and her voice when melting as women do in their different ways here and there with an execrableperhaps pardonableart one or two divinely the vision drew him to a headlong plunge and swim of the amorous mind occupying a minute filling an era he corrected the feebleness and at the same time threw a practical coachmans glance on peculiarities of the road requiring some knowledge of it if traversed backward at a whipping pace on a moonless night the drive from canleys to the royal sovereign could be done by good pacers in an hour and a half little morewith ives and the stables ready and some astonishment in a certain unseen chamber fleetwood chuckled at a vision of romantic devilryperfectly legitimate too something more to inflict than enjoy was due to him he did not phrase it that a talk with the fellow woodseer of his mountains and his forests and nature philosophy poetry would have been particularly healthy for him almost as good as the good counsel be needed and solicited none to give him it swept among his ruminations while he pricked potts and mallard to supply his craving for satanical fare gower woodseer the mention of whom is a dejection to the venerable source of our story was then in the act of emerging from the eastward into the southward of the line of canterburys pilgrims when they set forth to worship on his homeward course after a walk of two days out of dover he descended londons borough having exactly twopence halfpenny for refreshment following a term of prudent starvation at the end of the walk it is not a district seductive to the wayfarers appetite as for example one may find the jews fry of fish in oil inspiriting the shoreditch region to be nourishment is afforded according to the laws of englands genius in the arts of refection at uninviting shops to the necessitated stomach a pennorth of crumb of bread assisted on its laborious passage by a pennorth of the rinsings of beer left the natural philosopher a hapenny for dessert at the stall of an applewoman where he withstood an inclination toward the juicy fruit and chose nuts they extend a meal as a grimace broadens the countenance illusorily but they help to cheat an emptiness in time where it is nearly as offensive to our sensations as within us and that prolonged occupation of the jaws goes a length to persuade us we are filling all the better when the substance is indigestible tramps of the philosophical order who are the practically sagacious prefer tough grain for the teeth woodseers munching of his nuts awakened to fond imagination the picture of his fathers dinner seen one day and little envied a small slice of cold boiled muttonflesh in a crescent of white fat with a lump of dry bread beside the plate thus he returned to the only home he had not disheartened and bearing scenes that outvied londons printshops for polychrome splendour an exultation to recall his condition moreover threw his fathers life and work into colour the lean whitechapel house of the minister among the poor the joy in the saving of souls if he could persuade himself that such good labour advanced and at the fall of light the pastime task of bootmakinga desireable occupation for a thinker thought flies best when the hands are easily busy cobblers have excursive minds their occasional rap at the pegs diversifies the stitchings and is often happily timed to settle an internal argument seek in a village for information concerning the village or the state of mankind you will be less disappointed at the cobblers than elsewhere it has been said as gower had anticipated with lively feelings of pleasure mr woodseer was at the wonted corner of his back room on the stool between two tallow candleflames leather scented strongly when the wanderer stood before him in the image of a ball that has done with circling about a stable point back the minister sang out at once and his wrinkles gleamed their hands grasped hungry sir rather to be sure you are one can read it on your boots mrs jones will spread you a table how many miles today show the soles they tell a tale of wear they had worn to resemble the thinedged layers of still upper cloud round the peep of coming sky about forty odd today sir theyve done their hundreds of miles and have now come to dock i ll ask mrs jones to bring me a plate here gower went to the housekeeper in the kitchen his fathers front door was unfastened by day she had not set eyes on him yet and mr woodseer murmured now shes got the boy there s clasping and kissing hes all wild wales to her the plate of meat was brought by mary jones with gower beside her and a sniffle of her happiness audible she would not although invited to stay and burning to hear gower wait in the room where father and son had to talk together after a separation long to loves counting she was a welshwoman of the pure blood therefore delicately mannered by nature yes dear lad tobacco helps you on to the marrow of your story and i too will blow the cloud said mr woodseer when the plate was pushed aside and the pipe appeared so gowers recital of his wanderings began more puffs than speech at the commencement he was alternately picturesque and sententious until he reached baden there he became involved from thinking of a revelation of beauty in woman mr woodseer rapped the leather on his block a place where they have started public gambling i am told we must look into all the corners of the world to know it sir and the world has to be riddled or it riddles us ah did you ever tell a lie gower woodseer i played you played the lord be thanked you have kept your straight tongue the lord can always enter a heart of truth sin cannot dwell with it but you played for gain and that was a licenced thieving and that was a backsliding and there will have to be a climbing up and what that means your hold on truth will learn touch sin and you accommodate yourself to its vileness ay you love nature nature is not anchorage for vessels like men if you loved the book you would float in harbour you played i do trust you lost you have your wish sir to have won their money gower rather starve i did your reason for playing poor lad the reason eludes reason not in you sight of the tables an itch to try themones self as well a notion that the losers were playing wrong in fine a bit of a whirl of a medley of atoms i cant explain it further ah the tipplers fumes in his head spotty business gower woodseer lead us not into temptation is worldly wisdom in addition to heavenly after listening to an extended homily with a general assent and tobaccos phlegm gower replied to his fathers you starved manfully nodding from baden to nancy an alsatian cottager at times helped me along milk and bread wholesome for body and for soul entering nancy i subscribed to the dictum of our first fathers which dogs would deliver if they could speak that there is no driver like stomach and i went head on to the college saw the principal plea of urgency no engagement possible to teach either french or english but he was inquisitive touching the urgency that was my chance the french are humane when they are not suspicious of you they are generous if you put a light to their minds as i was dealing with a scholarly one i made use of such ornamental literary skill as i possessed to prove urgency he supplied me with bread fruit and wine in the end he procured me pupils i lodged over a bakers shop i had food walks and learnt something of forestry therea taking study when i had saved enough to tramp it home i said my adieux to that good friend and tramped away entering london with about the same amount in small coin as when i entered nancy a manner of exactly hitting the mark that some would not find so satisfactory as it is to me the minister sighed there comes in the philosophy i suppose when will you understand that this philosophy is only the passive of a religious faith it seems to suit you gentlemen of the road while you are young work among the whitechapel poor it would be a way for discovering the shallows of your philosophy earlier gower asked him going badly here sir murders robberies misusage of women and misconduct of womendrink in short about the same amount drink is their deaths river rolling them on helpless as corpses on tomay they find mercy i and a few standits in the tide we stand here to stop them pluck them out make life a bit sweet to them before the poor bodies go beneath but come alls not dark we have our gleams i speak distressed by one of our girls a good girl i believe and the wilfullest that ever had command of her legs a wellfavoured girl youll laugh she has given her heart to a prizefighter well you can say she might have chosen worse he drinks she hates it she loves the man and hates his vice he swears amendment is hiccupping at night fights a match on the morrow and gets beaten out of formation no matter whenever wherever that man goes to his fight that girl follows to nurse him after it hes her hero women will have one and its their lottery you read of such things here we have it alive and walking i am led to think they re an honest couple they come of established families her mother was out of caermarthen died under my ministration saintly forgiving the drunkard you may remember the greengrocer tobias winch he passed away in shrieks for one drop i had to pitch my voice to the top notes to get hearing for the hymn he was a reverent man with the craving by fits that should have been a lesson to madge a little girl at the greengrocers hard by she sold me apples rather pretty said gower a fine grown girl nowmadge winch a comely wench she is it breaks her sister sarahs heart they both manage the little shop they make it prosper in a small way enough and what need they more then christopher ines has on one of his matches madge drives her cart out if it s near town shes off down into kent today by coach sarah tells me a great nobleman patronizes christopher a lord fleetwood a lord of wealth and he must be thoughtful for these people he sent sarah word that christopher should not touch drink you may remember a butcher ines in the street next to us christopher was a wild lad always at best man with every boy he met went to searan away he returned a pugilist the girl will be nursing him now i have spoken to her of him and i trust to her but i mourn her attachment to the man who drinks the lords name said gower lord fleetwood sarah named him and so it pleases him to spend his money he has other tastes i know something of him sir he promises to be a patron of literature as well his mother was a south wales woman could he be persuaded to publish a grand edition of the triads mr woodseer said at once no man more likely if you see him suggest it very little chance of my meeting him again but those triads theyre in our blood they spring to tie knots in the head they push me to condense my thoughts to a tight ball they were good for primitive times but theyor the trick of the mind engendered by themtrip my steps along the lines of composition i produce pellets instead of flowing sheets itll come right at present i m so bent to pick and perfect polish my phrase that i lose my survey as a consequence my vocabulary falters ah mr woodseer breathed and smote this literature is to be your profession for the means of living nothing else and im so low down in the market way of it that i could not count on twenty pounds per annum fifty would give me standing an independent fifty to whom are you crying gower not to gamble you may be sure you have a home good work of the head wants an easy conscience ive too much of you in me for a comfortable pensioner or is it not that you have been living the gentleman out there with just a holiday title to it gower was hit by his fathers thrust i shall feel myself a piemans chuckpenny as long as im unproductive now i ve come back and have to own to a home he said tea brought in by mrs mary jones rather brightened him until he considered that the enlivenment was due to a purchase by money of which he was incapable and he rejected it like an honourable man simultaneously the state of depression threw critic shades on a prized sentence or two among his recent confections it was rejected for the best of reasons and the most discomforting because it racked our english signifying that he had not yet learnt the right use of his weapons he was in this wrestle under a placid demeanour for several days hearing the shouts of whitechapel kits victory and hearing of sarah winchs anxiety on account of her sister madge unaffected by sounds of joy or grief in his effort to produce a supple english with badens madonna for sole illumination of his darkness to her to the illimitable goldmist of perspective and the innumerable images the thought of her painted for him he owed the lift which withdrew him from contemplation of himself in a very disturbing stagnant pool of the wastes wherein often will strenuous youth grown faint behold a face beneath a scroll inscribed impostor all whose aim was high have spied into that pool and have seen the face his glorious lady would not let it haunt him the spell she cast had likewise power to raise him clean out of a neighbourhood hinting erebus to the young man with thirst for air solitudes and colour scarce imaginable as she was she reigned here in the idea of her more fixedly than where she had been visible as it were by right of her being celestially removed from the dismal place he was at the same time not insensible to his fathers contented ministrations among these homes of squalor they pricked the curiosity which was in the youthful philosopher a form of admiration for his father like all welshmen loved the mountains yet here he lived exhorting ministering aiding supported up to high good cheer by some it seemed superhuman backbone of uprightnesshis religious faith well if so the thing might be studied but things of the frozen senses lean and hueless things were as repellent to gowers imagination as his fathers dishes to an epicure what he envied was the worthy old mans heart of feeling for others his feeling at present for the girl sarah winch and her sister madge who had not been heard of since she started for the fight mr woodseer had written to her relatives at the wells receiving no consolatory answer he was relieved at last and still a little perplexed madge had returned he informed gower she was well she was well in health he had her assurances that she was not excited about herself she has brought a lady with her a great lady to lodge with her she has brought the countess of fleetwood to lodge with her gower heard those words from his father and his father repeated them to the prostrate worshipper of the countess of fleetwood they were a blow on the head madness had set in here was his first recovering thought or else a miracle had come to pass or was it a sham countess of fleetwood imposing upon the girl his father was to go and see the great lady at the greengrocers shop at her request according to madge conjectures shot their perishing tracks across a darkness that deepened and made shipwreck of philosophy was it the very countess of fleetwood penitent for her dalliance with the gambling passion in feminine need of pastors aid having had report from madge of this good shepherd his father expressed a certain surprise his countenance was mild he considered it a merely strange occurrence perhaps in a crisis a minister of religion is better armed than a philosopher gower would not own that but he acknowledged the evidences and owned to envy especially when he accompanied his father to the greengrocers shop and mr woodseer undisturbedly said here is the place the small stuffed shop appeared to grow portentously cavernous and waveringly illumined chapter xix the girl madge customers were at the counter of the shop and these rational figures together with the piles of cabbages the sacks of potatoes the pale small oranges here and there the dominant smell of red herrings denied the lurking of an angelical presence behind them sarah winch and a boy served at the counter sarah led the mr woodseers into a corner knocked off the shop and called a room below the top bars of a wizened grate was a chilly fire londons light came piecemeal through a smutstreaked window if the wonderful was to occur this was the place to heighten it my son may be an intruder mr woodseer said he is acquainted with a lord fleetwood madge will know sir replied sarah and she sent up a shrill cry for madge from the foot of the stairs the girl ran down swiftly she entered listening to sarah looking at gower to whom after a bob and pained smile where reverence was owing she said can you tell me sir please where we can find lord fleetwood now gower was unable to tell madge turned to mr woodseer saying soon after oh she wont mind shell be glad if he knows lord fleetwood ill fetch her the moments were of the palpitating order for gower although his common sense lectured the wildest of hearts for expecting such a possibility as the presence of his lofty lady here and of course common sense proved to be right the lady was quite another but she struck on a sleeping day of his travels her face was not one to be forgotten and to judge by her tremble of a smile she remembered him instantly they were soon conversing each helping to paint the scene of the place where they had met lord fleetwood has married me she said gower bent his head all stood silent may i said madge to her it is lord fleetwoods wedded wife sir he drove her from her uncles on her wedding day the day of a prize fight where i was he told me to wait on his lady at an inn there as i ve done and will he drove away that evening and he hasntthe girls black eyebrows worked ive not seen him since hes a great nobleman yes he left his lady at the inn expenses paid he left her with no money she stayed on till her heart was breaking she has come to london to find him she had to walk part of the way she has only a change of linen we brought in a parcel shes a stranger to england she knows nobody in london she had no place to come to but this poor hole of ours she s so good as let welcome her we cant do better and it s no use to be ashamed she s not a lady to scorn poor people the girls voice hummed through gower he said lord fleetwood may not be in london and chafed at himself for such a quaver its his house we want sir he has not been at his house in kent we want his london house my dear lady said mr woodseer it might be as well to communicate the state of things to your family without delay my son will call at any address you name or if it is a country address i can write the items with my assurances of your safety under my charge in my house which i beg you to make your home my housekeeper is known to sarah and madge for an excellent christian woman carinthia replied you are kind to me sir i am grateful i have an uncle i would not disturb my uncle he is inventing guns and he wishes peace it is my husband i have come to find he did not leave me in anger she coloured with a dimple of tenderness at one cheek looking from sarah to madge she said i would not leave my friends they are sisters to me sarah at these words caught up her apron madge did no more than breathe deep and fast an unoccupied cold parlour in mr woodseers house that would be heated for a guest urged him to repeat his invitation but he took the check from gower who suggested the doubt of mary jones being so good an attendant upon lady fleetwood as madge and madge has to help in the shop at times madge nodded looked into the eyes of her mistress which sanctioned her saying she will like it best here she is my lady and i understand her best my lady gives no trouble she is hardy shes not like other ladies i and sarah sleep together in the room next i can hear anything she wants she takes us as if she was used to it sarah had to go to serve a customer madge made pretence of pricking her ears and followed into the shop your first visit to london is in ugly weather lady fleetwood said gower it is my first she answered how the marriage came about how the separation could not be asked and was not related our district is not all london my dear lady said mr woodseer good hearts are here as elsewhere and as many if one looks behind the dirt i have found it since i laboured amongst them now twenty years unwashed human nature though it is natural to us to wash is the most human we find gower questioned the naturalness of human natures desire to wash and they wrangled goodhumouredly carinthias eyes dwelling on them each in turn until mr woodseer pursuing the theme started by him to interest her spoke of consolations derived from his labours here in exchange for the loss of his mountains her face lightened you love the mountains i am a son of the mountains ah i love them father called me a daughter of the mountains i was born in the mountains i was leaving my mountains on the day i think it yesterday when i met this gentleman who is your son a glorious day it was gower exclaimed it was a day of great glory for me said carinthia your foot did not pain you for long the length of two pipes you were with your brother with my brother my brother has married a most beautiful lady he is now travelling his happy timemy chillon there came a radiance on her undereyelids there was no weeping struck by the contrast between the two simultaneous honeymoons and a vision of the highspirited mountain girl seen in this place a young bride seeking her husband gower woodseer could have performed that unphilosophical part he had to shake himself she seemed really a soaring bird brought down by the fowler lord fleetwoods manner of abandoning her was the mystery gower stood waiting for her initiative when the minister interposed there are books books of our titled peoplethe peers books of the peerage they would supply the address my son will discover where to examine them he will find the address most of the great noblemen have a london house my husband has a house in london carinthia said i know him to some degree said gower she remarked i have heard that you do her lips were shut as to any hint at his treatment of her gower went into the shop to speak with madge the girl was talking in the business tone to customers she finished her commission hurriedly and joined him on the pavement by the doorstep her voice was like the change for the swing of a door from street to temple youve seen how brave she is sir she has things to bear never cries never frets her marriage dayleastways i cant no girl can tell a great nobleman yes she waited believing in him she does she hasnt spoken to me of what shes had to bear i dont know i guess im sure im rightand him a man girls learn to know men call them gentlemen or sweeps she thinks she has only to meet him to persuade him she s fit to be loved by him she thinks of love would heour tongues are tied except among ourselves to a sister leaves her by herself with only me afterit knocks me dumb many a man commits a murder wouldnt do that she could force him tono it isnt a house she wants she wants him hes her husband mr woodseer you will do what you can to help i judge by your father i and sarah ll slave for her to be as comfortableas wecan make her we cant give her what she s used to i shall count the hours you sold me apples when your head was just above the counter said gower did iyou wont lose time sir she rejoined her box is down at the beastly inn in kent kind people i dare say their bill was paid any extent they said and he might do as he liked in itenter it like a thief if it pleased him and off like one and they no wiser she walked to his big house esslemont for news of him and im not a snivelling wench either but she speaks of him a way to make a girl drink her tears if they aint to be let fall but you had a victory down there gower hinted congratulations ah said she christopher ines is all right now ive as good as lost my good name for kit ines mr woodseer not with my dad madge the minister reads us at the heart shall we hear the street of his house in london before night i may be late ill be up any hour for a rap at the shutters i want to take her to the house early next morning she wont mind the distance she lies in bed her eyes shut or open never sleeping hears any mouse it shouldnt go on if we can do a thing to help im off said gower unwontedly vexed at his empty pocket that could not offer the means for conveyance to a couple of young women the darkbrowed girl sent her straight eyes at him they pushed him to hasten on second thoughts he stopped and hailed her he was moved to confirm an impression of this girls features his mind was directed to the business burning behind them honestly enough as soon as he had them in sight again i ought to have the address of some of her people in case he said she wont go to her uncle i m sure of that said madge he s a lord and cant be worried it s her husband to find first if hes to be foundhes a lord too has she no other relatives or friends she loves her brother hes an officer hes away on honeymoon there s an admiral down hampshire way a place ive been near and seen id not have you go to any of them sir without trying all we can do to find lord fleetwood its admiral fakenham she speaks of shes fond of him shes not minded to bother any of her friends about herself i shall see you tonight said gower and set his face westward remembering that his father had named caermarthen as her mothers birthplace just in that tone of hers do welshwomen talk of their country of its history when at home of its mountains when exiled and in a language like hers bare of superlatives to signify an ardour conveyed by the fire of the breath her quick devotion to a lady exciting enthusiasm through admiring pity for the grace of a muchtried quiet sweetness was explained apart from other reasons feminine or hidden which might exist only a welsh girl would be so quick and all in it with a voice intimating a heated cauldron under her mouth none but a welshblooded girl risking her good name to follow and nurse the man she considered a hero would carry her head to look virgin eyes as she did one could swear to them gower thought contact with her spirited him out of his mooniness he had the cymric and celtic respect of character which puts aside the persons environments to face the soul he was also an impressionable fellow among his fellows a philosopher only at his leisure in his courted solitudes getting away some strides from this girl of the drilling voicethe shuddervoice he phrased itthe lady for whom she pleaded came clearer into his view and gradually absorbed him though it was an emulation with the girl madge of which he was a trifle conscious that drove him to do his work of service in the directest manner he then fancied the girl had caught something of the tone of her lady the savage intensity or sincerity and he brooded on carinthias position the mixture of the astounding and the woful in her misadventure one could almost laugh at our human fate to think of a drop off the radiant mountain heights upon a whitechapel greengrocers shop gathering the title of countess midway but nothing of the ludicrous touched her no and if we bring reason to scan our laugh at pure humanity it is we who are in the place of the ridiculous for doing what reason disavows had he not named her carinthia saint and martyr from a first perusal of her face and lord fleetwood had read and repeated it lord fleetwood had become the instrument to martyrize her that might be there was a hoard of bad stuff in his composition besides the precious and this was a nobleman owning enormous wealth who could vitiate himself by disposing of a multitude of men and women to serve his will a shifty will wealth creates the magician and may breed the fiend within him in the hands of a young man wealth is an invitation to devilry gowers idea of the story of carinthia inclined to charge lord fleetwood with every possible false dealing he then quashed the charge and decided to wait for information at the second of the aristocratic clubs of londons west into which he stepped like an easy member the hallporter did not examine his clothing from german hat to boots and gave him lord fleetwoods town address he could tell madge at night by the door of the shuttered shop that lord fleetwood had gone down to wales it means her having to wait she said the minister has been to the coachoffice to order up her box from that inn he did it in his name they cant refuse no moneys owing she must have a change sally has fifteen pounds locked up in case of need sallys capacity and economy fetched the penniless philosopher a slap youve taken to this lady he said she held my hand while kit ines was at his work and i was new to her and a prizefighters lass they call meupon the top of that noblemans coach where he made me sit behind her to see the fight and she his wedded lady that morning a queer groom he may keep kit ines from drink hes one of you men and rides over anything in his way i cant speak about it i could swear it before a judge from what i know those rundles at that inn dont hear anything it suits him to do all the people down in those parts are slaves to him and i thought he was a real st george beforeyes ready i was to kiss the ground his feet crossed if you could its chinningfold near where admiral fakenham lives down hampshire way her friends ought to hear whats happened to her theyll find her in a queer place she might go to the ministers i believe shes happier with us girls gower pledged his word to start for chinningfold early as the light next day he liked the girl the better in an amicable fashion now that his nerves had got free of the transient spell of her kettle tonethe hardly varied one note of a heart boiling with sisterly devotion to a misused stranger of her sexand after the way of his race imagination sprang up in him at the heels of the quieted senses releasing him from the personal and physical to grasp the general situation and place the protagonist foremost he thought of carinthia with full vision of her some wrong had been done or some violation of the right to guess from the girl madges molten words in avoidance of the very words it impliedthough it might be but one of loves shrewder discordssuch suspected traitorous dealing of a man with their sister woman as makes the world of women all woman toward her they can be that and their being so illuminates their hidden sentiments in relation to the mastering male whom they uphold but our uninformed philosopher was merely picking up scraps of sheddings outside the dark wood of the mystery they were to him and playing imagination upon them this primary element of his nature soon enthroned his chosen lady above their tangled obscurities beneath her tranquil beams with the rapture of the knowledge that her name on earth was livia he threaded east londons thoroughfareson a morning when day and night were made one by fog to journey down to chinningfold by coach in the service of the younger countess of fleetwood whose right to the title he did not doubt though it directed surprise movements at his understanding from time to time etext editors bookmarks cocksure has crowed low by sunset drink is their deaths river rolling them on helpless father and she were aware of one another without conversing fun at any cost is the one object worth a shot he was the prisoner of his word heartily she thanked the girl for the excuse to cry hearts that make one soul do not separately count their gifts life is the burlesque of young dreams make a girl drink her tears if they aint to be let fall on a morning when day and night were made one by fog poetic romance is delusion push me to condense my thoughts to a tight ball she endured meekly when there was no meekness she seemed really a soaring bird brought down by the fowler she stood with a dignity that the word did not express there is no driver like stomach touch sin and you accommodate yourself to its vileness you played for gain and that was a licenced thieving the end

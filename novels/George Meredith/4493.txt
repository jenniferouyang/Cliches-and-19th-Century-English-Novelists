note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw the case of general ople and lady camper by george meredith chapter i an excursion beyond the immediate suburbs of london projected long before his ponycarriage was hired to conduct him in fact ever since his retirement from active service led general ople across a famous common with which he fell in love at once to a lofty highway along the borders of a park for which he promptly exchanged his heart and so gradually within a stonesthrow or so of the riverside where he determined not solely to bestow his affections but to settle for life it may be seen that he was of an adventurous temperament though he had thought fit to loosen his swordbelt the ponycarriage however had been hired for the very special purpose of helping him to pass in review the lines of what he called country houses cottages or even sites for building not too remote from sweet london and as when coelebs goes forth intending to pursue and obtain there is no doubt of his bringing home a wife the circumstance that there stood a house to let in an airy situation at a certain distance in hail of the metropolis he worshipped was enough to kindle the generals enthusiasm he would have taken the first he saw had it not been for his daughter who accompanied him and at the age of eighteen was about to undertake the management of his house fortune under elizabeth oples guiding restraint directed him to an epitome of the comforts the place he fell upon is only to be described in the tongue of auctioneers and for the first week after taking it he modestly followed them by terming it bijou in time when his own imagination instigated by a state of something more than mere contentment had been at work on it he chose the happy phrase a gentlemanly residence for it was he declared a small estate there was a lodge to it resembling two sentryboxes forced into union where in one half an old couple sat bent in the other half lay compressed there was a backdrive to discoverable stables there was a bit of grass that would have appeared a meadow if magnified and there was a wall round the kitchengarden and a strip of wood round the flowergarden the prying of the outside world was impossible comfort fortification and gentlemanliness made the place as the general said an ideal english home the compass of the estate was half an acre and perhaps a perch or two just the size for the hugging love general ople was happiest in giving he wisely decided to retain the old couple at the lodge whose members were used to restriction and also not to purchase a cow that would have wanted pasture with the old man while the old woman attended to the bell at the handsome front entrance with its giltspiked gates he undertook to do the gardening a business he delighted in so long as he could perform it in a gentlemanly manner that is to say so long as he was not overlooked he was perfectly concealed from the road only one house and curiously indeed only one window of the house and further to show the protection extended to douro lodge that window an attic overlooked him and the house was empty the house for who can hope and who should desire a commodious house with conservatories aviaries pond and boatshed and other joys of wealth to remain unoccupied was taken two seasons later by a lady of whom fame rolling like a dustcloud from the place she had left reported that she was eccentric the word is uninstructive it does not frighten in a lady of a certain age it is rather a characteristic of aristocracy in retirement and at least it implies wealth general ople was very anxious to see her he had the sentiment of humble respectfulness toward aristocracy and there was that in riches which aroused his admiration london for instance he was not afraid to say he thought the wonder of the world he remarked in addition that the sacking of london would suffice to make every common soldier of the foreign army of occupation an independent gentleman for the term of his natural days but this is a nightmare said he startling himself with an abhorrent dream of envy of those enriched invading officers for booty is the one lovely thing which the military mind can contemplate in the abstract his habit was to go off in an explosion of heavy sighs when he had delivered himself so far like a man at war with himself the lady arrived in time she received the cards of the neighbourhood and signalized her eccentricity by paying no attention to them excepting the card of a mrs baerens who had audience of her at once by express arrangement the card of general wilson ople as her nearest neighbour followed the card of the rector the social head of the district and the rector was granted an interview but lady camper was not at home to general ople she is of superior station to me and may not wish to associate with me the general modestly said nevertheless he was wounded for in spite of himself and without the slightest wish to obtrude his own person as he explained the meaning that he had in him his rank in the british army forced him to be the representative of it in the absence of any one of a superior rank so that he was professionally hurt and his heart being in his profession it may be honestly stated that he was wounded in his feelings though he said no and insisted on the distinction once a day his walk for constitutional exercise compelled him to pass before lady campers windows which were not bashfully withdrawn as he said humorously of douro lodge in the seclusion of halfpay but bowed out imperiously militarily like a generalissimo on horseback and had full command of the road and levels up to the swelling parkfoliage he went by at a smart stride with a delicate depression of his upright bearing as though hastening to greet a friend in view whose hand was getting ready for the shake this much would have been observed by a housemaid and considering his fine figure and the peculiar shining silveriness of his hair the acceleration of his gait was noticeable when he drove by the ponys right ear was flicked to the extreme indignation of a mettlesome little animal it ensued in consequence that the general was borne flying under the eyes of lady camper and such pace displeasing him he reduced it invariably at a step or two beyond the corner of her grounds but neither he nor his daughter elizabeth attached importance to so trivial a circumstance the general punctiliously avoided glancing at the windows during the passage past them whether in his wild career or on foot elizabeth took a sideshot as one looks at a wayside tree their speech concerning lady camper was an exchange of commonplaces over her loneliness and this condition of hers was the more perplexing to general ople on his hearing from his daughter that the lady was very finelooking and not so very old as he had fancied eccentric ladies must be the rectors account of her too excited the mind she had informed him bluntly that she now and then went to church to save appearances but was not a churchgoer finding it impossible to support the length of the service might however be reckoned in subscriptions for all the charities and left her pew open to poor people and none but the poor she had travelled over europe and knew the east sketches in watercolours of the scenes she had visited adorned her walls and a pair of pistols that she had found useful she affirmed lay on the writing desk in her drawingroom general ople gathered from the rector that she had a great contempt for men yet it was curiously varied with lamentations over the weakness of women really she cannot possibly be an example of that said the general thinking of the pistols now we learn from those who have studied women on the chessboard and know what ebony or ivory will do along particular lines or hopping that men much talked about will take possession of their thoughts and certainly the fact may be accepted for one of their moves but the whole fabric of our knowledge of them which we are taught to build on this originally acute perception is shattered when we hear that it is exactly the same in the same degree in proportion to the amount of work they have to do exactly the same with men and their thoughts in the case of women much talked about so it was with general ople and nothing is left for me to say except that there is broader ground than the chessboard i am earnest in protesting the similarity of the singular couples on common earth because otherwise the general is in peril of the accusation that he is a feminine character and not simply was he a gallant officer and a veteran in gunpowder strife he was also and it is an extraordinary thing that a genuine humility did not prevent it and did survive it a lord and conqueror of the sex he had done his pretty bit of mischief all in the way of honour of course but hearts had knocked and now with his bright white hair his closebrushed white whiskers on a face burnt brown his clearcut features and a winning droop of his eyelids there was powder in him still if not shot there was a lamentable susceptibility to ladies charms on the other hand for the protection of the sex a remainder of shyness kept him from active enterprise and in the state of suffering so long as indications of encouragement were wanting he had killed the soft ones who came to him attracted by the softness in him to be killed but clever women alarmed and paralyzed him their aptness to question and require immediate sparkling answers their demand for fresh wit of a kind that is not furnished by publications which strike it into heads with a hammer and supply it wholesale their various reading their power of ridicule too made them awful in his contemplation supposing for the inflammable officer was now thinking and deeply thinking of a clever woman supposing that lady campers pistols were needed in her defence one night at the first report proclaiming her extremity valour might gain an introduction to her upon easy terms and would not be expected to be witty she would perhaps after the excitement admit his masculine superiority in the beautiful old fashion by fainting in his arms such was the reverie he passingly indulged and only so could he venture to hope for an acquaintance with the formidable lady who was his next neighbour but the proud society of the burglarious denied him opportunity meanwhile he learnt that lady camper had a nephew and the young gentleman was in a cavalry regiment general ople met him outside his gates received and returned a polite salute liked his appearance and manners and talked of him to elizabeth asking her if by chance she had seen him she replied that she believed she had and praised his horsemanship the general discovered that he was an excellent sculler his daughter was rowing him up the river when the young gentleman shot by with a splendid stroke in an outrigger backed and floating alongside presumed to enter into conversation during which he managed to express regrets at his aunts turn for solitariness as they belonged to sister branches of the same service the general and mr reginald roller had a theme in common and a passion elizabeth told her father that nothing afforded her so much pleasure as to hear him talk with mr roller on military matters general ople assured her that it pleased him likewise he began to spy about for mr roller and it sometimes occurred that they conversed across the wall it could hardly be avoided a hint or two an undefinable flying allusion gave the general to understand that lady camper had not been happy in her marriage he was pained to think of her misfortune but as she was not over forty the disaster was perhaps not irremediable that is to say if she could be taught to extend her forgiveness to men and abandon her solitude if he said to his daughter lady camper should by any chance be induced to contract a second alliance she would one might expect be humanized and we should have highly agreeable neighbours elizabeth artlessly hoped for such an event to take place she rarely differed with her father up to whom taking example from the world around him she looked as the pattern of a man of wise conduct and he was one and though modest he was in good humour with himself approved himself and could say that without boasting of success he was a satisfied man until he met his touchstone in lady camper chapter ii this is the pathetic matter of my story and it requires pointing out because he never could explain what it was that seemed to him so cruel in it for he was no brilliant son of fortune he was no great pretender none of those who are logically displaced from the heights they have been raised to manifestly created to show the moral in providence he was modest retiring humbly contented a gentlemanly residence appeased his ambition popular he could own that he was but not meteorically rather by reason of his willingness to receive light than his desire to shed it why then was the terrible test brought to bear upon him of all men he was one of us no worse and not strikingly or perilously better and he could not but feel in the bitterness of his reflections upon an inexplicable destiny that the punishment befalling him unmerited as it was looked like absence of design in the scheme of things above it looked as if the blow had been dealt him by reckless chance and to believe that was for the mind of general ople the having to return to his alphabet and recommence the ascent of the laborious mountain of understanding to proceed the generals introduction to lady camper was owing to a message she sent him by her gardener with a request that he would cut down a branch of a wychelm obscuring her view across his grounds toward the river the general consulted with his daughter and came to the conclusion that as he could hardly despatch a written reply to a verbal message yet greatly wished to subscribe to the wishes of lady camper the best thing for him to do was to apply for an interview he sent word that he would wait on lady camper immediately and betook himself forthwith to his toilette she was the niece of an earl elizabeth commended his appearance passed him as he would have said and well she might for his hat surtout trousers and boots were worthy of an introduction to royalty a touch of scarlet silk round the neck gave him bloom and better than that the blooming consciousness of it you are not to be nervous papa elizabeth said not at all replied the general i say not at all my dear he repeated and so betrayed that he had fallen into the nervous mood i was saying i have known worse mornings than this he turned to her and smiled brightly nodded and set his face to meet the future he was absent an hour and a half he came back with his radiance a little subdued by no means eclipsed as when experience has afforded us matter for thought we cease to shine dazzlingly yet are not clouded the rays have merely grown serener the sum of his impressions was conveyed in the reflective utteranceit only shows my dear how different the reality is from our anticipation of it lady camper had been charming full of condescension neighbourly friendly willing to be satisfied with the sacrifice of the smallest branch of the wychelm and only requiring that much for complimentary reasons elizabeth wished to hear what they were and she thought the request rather singular but the general begged her to bear in mind that they were dealing with a very extraordinary woman highly accomplished really exceedingly handsome he said to himself aloud the reasons were her liking for air and view and desire to see into her neighbours grounds without having to mount to the attic elizabeth gave a slight exclamation and blushed so my dear we are objects of interest to her ladyship said the general he assured her that lady campers manners were delightful strange to tell she knew a great deal of his antecedent history things he had not supposed were known little matters he remarked by which his daughter faintly conceived a reference to the conquests of his dashing days lady camper had deigned to impart some of her own incidentally that she was of welsh blood and born among the mountains she has a romantic look was the generals comment and that her husband had been an insatiable traveller before he became an invalid and had never cared for art quite an extraordinary circumstance with such a wife the general said he fell upon the wychelm with his own hands under cover of the leafage and the next day he paid his respects to lady camper to inquire if her ladyship saw any further obstruction to the view none she replied and now we shall see what the two birds will do apparently then she entertained an animosity to a pair of birds in the tree yes yes i say they chirp early in the morning said general ople at all hours the song of birds he pleaded softly for nature if the nest is provided for them but i dont like vagabond chirping the general perfectly acquiesced this in an engagement with a clever woman is what you should do or else you are likely to find yourself planted unawares in a high wind your hat blown off and your coattails anywhere in other words you will stand ridiculous in your bewilderment and general ople ever footed with the utmost caution to avoid that quagmire of the ridiculous the extremer quags he had hitherto escaped the smaller into which he fell in his agile evasions of the big he had hitherto been blest in finding none to notice he requested her ladyships permission to present his daughter lady camper sent in her card elizabeth ople beheld a tall handsomelymannered lady with good features and penetrating dark eyes an easy carriage of her person and an agreeable voice but the vision of her age flashed out under the compelling eyes of youth fifty if a day the rich colouring confessed to it but she was very pleasing and elizabeths perception dwelt on it only because her fathers manly chivalry had defended the lady against one year more than forty the richness of the colouring elizabeth feared was artificial and it caused her ingenuous young blood a shudder for we are so devoted to nature when the dame is flattering us with her gifts that we loathe the substitute omitting to think how much less it is an imposition than a form of practical adoration of the genuine our young detective however concealed her emotion of childish horror lady camper remarked of her she seems honest and that is the most we can hope of girls she is a jewel for an honest man the general sighed some day let us hope it will be a distant day yet said the general girls expect to marry lady camper fixed her black eyes on him but did not speak he told elizabeth that her ladyships eyes were exceedingly searching only said he as i have nothing to hide i am able to submit to inspection and he laughed slightly up to an arresting cough and made the mantelpiece ornaments pass muster general ople was the hero to champion a lady whose airs of haughtiness caused her to be somewhat backbitten he assured everybody that lady camper was much misunderstood she was a most remarkable woman she was a most affable and highly intelligent lady building up her attributes on a splendid climax he declared she was pious charitable witty and really an extraordinary artist he laid particular stress on her artistic qualities describing her power with the brush her watercolour sketches and also some immensely clever caricatures as he talked of no one else his friends heard enough of lady camper who was anything but a favourite the pollingtons the wilders the wardens the baerens the goslings and others of his acquaintance talked of lady camper and general ople rather maliciously they were all city people and they admired the general but mourned that he should so abjectly have fallen at the feet of a lady as red with rouge as a railway bill his not seeing it showed the state he was in the sister of mrs pollington an amiable widow relict of a large city warehouse named barcop was chilled by a falling off in his attentions his apology for not appearing at garden parties was that he was engaged to wait on lady camper and at one time her not condescending to exchange visits with the obsequious general was a topic fertile in irony but she did condescend lady camper came to his gate unexpectedly rang the bell and was let in like an ordinary visitor it happened that the general was gardening not the pretty occupation of pruninghe was diggingand of necessity his coat was off and he was hot dusty unpresentable from adoring earth as the mother of roses you may pass into a ladys presence without purification you cannot or so the general thought when you are caught in the act of adoring the mother of cabbages and though he himself loved the cabbage equally with the rose in his heart respected the vegetable yet more than he esteemed the flower for he gloried in his kitchen garden this was not a secret for the world to know and he almost heeled over on his beam ends when word was brought of the extreme honour lady camper had done him he worked his arms hurriedly into his fatigue jacket trusting to get away to the house and spend a couple of minutes on his adornment and with any other visitor it might have been accomplished but lady camper disliked sitting alone in a room she was on the square of lawn as the general stole along the walk had she kept her back to him he might have rounded her like the shadow of a dial undetected she was frightfully acute of hearing she turned while he was in the agony of hesitation in a queer attitude one leg on the march projected by a frenzied tiptoe of the hinder leg the very fatallest moment she could possibly have selected for unveiling him of course there was no choice but to surrender on the spot he began to squander his dizzy wits in profuse apologies lady camper simply spoke of the nice little nest of a garden smelt the flowers accepted a niel rose and a rohan a cline a falcot and la france a beautiful rose indeed she said of the latter only it smells of macassar oil really it never struck me i say it never struck me before rejoined the general smelling it as at a pinch of snuff i was saying i always and he tacitly with the absurdest of smiles begged permission to leave unterminated a sentence not in itself particularly difficult i have a nose observed lady camper like the noblybred person she was according to general oples version of the interview on his estate when he stood before her in his gardening costume she put him at his ease or she exerted herself to do so and if he underwent considerable anguish it was the fault of his excessive scrupulousness regarding dress propriety appearance he conducted her at her request to the kitchen garden and the handful of paddock the stables and coachhouse then back to the lawn it is the home for a young couple she said i am no longer young the general bowed with the sigh peculiar to this confession i say i am no longer young but i call the place a gentlemanly residence i was saying i yes yes lady camper tossed her head half closing her eyes with a contraction of the brows as if in pain he perceived a similar expression whenever he spoke of his residence perhaps it recalled happier days to enter such a nest perhaps it had been such a home for a young couple that she had entered on her marriage with sir scrope camper before he inherited his title and estates the general was at a loss to conceive what it was it recurred at another mention of his idea of the nature of the residence it was almost a paroxysm he determined not to vex her reminiscences again and as this resolution directed his mind to his residence thinking it preeminently gentlemanly his tongue committed the error of repeating it with gentlemanlike for a variation elizabeth was outhe knew not where the housemaid informed him that miss elizabeth was out rowing on the water is she alone lady camper inquired of him i fancy so the general replied the poor child has no mother it has been a sad loss to us both lady camper no doubt she is too pretty to go out alone i can trust her girls she has the spirit of a man that is well she has a spirit it will be tried the general modestly furnished an instance or two of her spiritedness lady camper seemed to like this theme she looked graciously interested still you should not suffer her to go out alone she said i place implicit confidence in her said the general and lady camper gave it up she proposed to walk down the lanes to the riverside to meet elizabeth returning the general manifested alacrity checked by reluctance lady camper had told him she objected to sit in a strange room by herself after that he could hardly leave her to dash upstairs to change his clothes yet how attired as he was in a fatigue jacket that warned him not to imagine his back view and held him constantly a little to the rear of lady camper lest she should be troubled by itand he knew the habit of the second rank to criticise the fronthow consent to face the outer world in such style side by side with the lady he admired come said she and he shot forward a step looking as if he had missed fire are you not coming general he advanced mechanically not a soul met them down the lanes except a little one to whom lady camper gave a small silverpiece because she was a picture the act of charity sank into the generals heart as any pretty performance will do upon a warm waxen bed lady camper surprised him by answering his thoughts no its for my own pleasure presently she said here they are general ople beheld his daughter by the riverside at the end of the lane under escort of mr reginald rolles it was another picture and a pleasing one the young lady and the young gentleman wore boating hats and were both dressed in white and standing by or just turning from the outrigger and light skiff they were about to leave in charge of a waterman elizabeth stretched a finger at arms length issuing directions which mr rolles took up and worded further to the man for the sake of emphasis and he rather than elizabeth was guilty of the halfstart at sight of the persons who were approaching my nephew you should know is intended for a working soldier said lady camper i like that sort of soldier best general ople drooped his shoulders at the personal compliment she resumed his pay is a matter of importance to him you are aware of the smallness of a subalterns pay i said the general i say i feel my poor halfpay having always been a working soldier myself very important i was saying very important to me why did you retire her interest in him seemed promising he replied conscientiously beyond the duties of general of brigade i could not i say i could not dare to aspire i can accept and execute orders i shrink from responsibility it is a pity said she that you were not like my nephew reginald entirely dependent on your profession she laid such stress on her remark that the general who had just expressed a very modest estimate of his abilities was unable to reject the flattery of her assuming him to be a man of some fortune he coughed and said very little the thought came to him that he might have to make a statement to her in time and he emphasized very little indeed sufficient he assured her for a gentlemanly appearance i have given you your warning was her inscrutable rejoinder uttered within earshot of the young people to whom especially to elizabeth she was gracious the damsels boating uniform was praised and her sunny flush of exercise and exposure lady camper regretted that she could not abandon her parasol i freckle so easily the general puzzling over her strange words about a warning gazed at the red rose of art on her cheek with an air of profound abstraction i freckle so easily she repeated dropping her parasol to defend her face from the calculating scrutiny i burn brown said elizabeth lady camper laid the bud of a falcot rose against the young girls cheek but fetched streams of colour that overwhelmed the momentary comparison of the sunswarthed skin with the rich dusky yellow of the rose in its deepening inward to soft brown reginald stretched his hand for the privileged flower and she let him take it then she looked at the general but the general was looking with his usual air of satisfaction nowhere chapter iii lady camper is no common enigma general ople observed to his daughter elizabeth inclined to be pleased with her for at her suggestion the general had bought a couple of horses that she might ride in the park accompanied by her father or the little groom still the great lady was hard to read she tested the resources of his income by all sorts of instigation to expenditure which his gallantry could not withstand she encouraged him to talk of his deeds in arms she was friendly almost affectionate and most bountiful in the presents of fruit peaches nectarines grapes and hothouse wonders that she showered on his table but she was an enigma in her evident dissatisfaction with him for something he seemed to have left unsaid and what could that be at their last interview she had asked him are you sure general you have nothing more to tell me and as he remarked when relating it to elizabeth one might really be tempted to misapprehend her ladyships i say one might commit oneself beyond recovery now my dear what do you think she intended elizabeth was burning brown or darkly blushing as her manner was she answered i am certain you know of nothing that would interest her nothing unless well the general urged her how can i speak it papa you really cant mean papa what could i mean if i were fool enough he murmured no no i am an old man i was saying i am past the age of folly one day elizabeth came home from her ride in a thoughtful mood she had not further than has been mentioned incited her father to think of the age of folly but voluntarily or not lady camper had by an excess of graciousness amounting to downright invitation as thus will you persist in withholding your confidence from me general she added i am not so difficult a person these prompting speeches occurred on the morning of the day when elizabeth sat at his table after a long ride into the country profoundly meditative a note was handed to general ople with the request that he would step in to speak with lady camper in the course of the evening or next morning elizabeth waited till his hat was on then said papa on my ride to day i met mr rolles i am glad you had an agreeable escort my dear i could not refuse his company certainly not and where did you ride to a beautiful valley and there we met her ladyship yes she always admires you on horseback so you know it papa if she should speak of it and i am bound to tell you my child said the general that this morning lady campers manner to me was if i were a fool i say this morning i beat a retreat but apparently she i see no way out of it supposing she i am sure she esteems you dear papa said elizabeth you take to her my dear the general inquired anxiously a littlea little afraid of her a little elizabeth replied only a little dont be agitated about me no papa you are sure to do right but you are trembling oh no i wish you success general ople was overjoyed to be reinforced by his daughters good wishes he kissed her to thank her he turned back to her to kiss her again she had greatly lightened the difficulty at least of a delicate position it was just like the imperious nature of lady camper to summon him in the evening to terminate the conversation of the morning from the visible pitfall of which he had beaten a rather precipitate retreat but if his daughter cordially wished him success and lady camper offered him the crown of it why then he had only to pluck up spirit like a good commander who has to pass a fordable river in the enemys presence a dash a splash a rattling volley or two and you are over established on the opposite bank but you must be positive of victory otherwise with the river behind you your new position is likely to be ticklish so the general entered lady campers drawingroom warily watching the fair enemy he knew he was captivating his old conquests whispered in his ears and her reception of him all but pointed to a footstool at her feet he might have fallen there at once had he not remembered a hint that mr reginald rolles had dropped concerning lady campers amazing variability lady camper began general you ran away from me this morning let me speak and by the way i must reproach you you should not have left it to me things have now gone so far that i cannot pretend to be blind i know your feelings as a father your daughters happiness my lady the general interposed i have her distinct assurance that it is i say it is wrapt up in mine let me speak young people will say anything well they have a certain excuse for selfishness we have not i am in some degree bound to my nephew he is my sisters son assuredly my lady i would not stand in his light be quite assured if i am i was saying if i am not mistaken i and he is or has the making of an excellent soldier in him and is likely to be a distinguished cavalry officer he has to carve his own way in the world general all good soldiers have my lady and if my position is not after a considerable term of service i say if to continue said lady camper i never have liked early marriages i was married in my teens before i knew men now i do know them and now the general plunged forward the honour you do us nowa mature experience is worthmy dear lady camper i have admired youand your objection to early marriages cannot apply to indeed madam vigour they say though youth of course yet young people as you observe and i have though perhaps my reputation is against it i was saying i have a natural timidity with your sex and i am greyheaded whiteheaded but happily without a single malady lady campers brows showed a trifling bewilderment i am speaking of these young people general ople i consent to everything beforehand my dear lady he should be i say mr rolles should be provided for so should she general so should elizabeth she shall be she will dear madam what i have with your permission ifgood heaven lady camper i scarcely know where i am she would i shall not like to lose her you would not wish it in time she will she has every quality of a good wife there stay there and be intelligible said lady camper she has every quality money should be one of them has she money oh my lady the general exclaimed we shall not come upon your purse when her time comes has she ten thousand pounds elizabeth she will have at her fathers death but as for my income it is moderate and only sufficient to maintain a gentlemanly appearance in proper selfrespect i make no show i say i make no show a wealthy marriage is the last thing on earth i should have aimed at i prefer quiet and retirement personally i mean that is my personal taste but if the lady i say if it should happen that the lady and indeed i am not one to press a suit but if she who distinguishes and honours me should chance to be wealthy all i can do is to leave her wealth at her disposal and that i do i do that unreservedly i feel i am very confused alarmingly confused your ladyship merits a superior i trust i have not i am entirely at your ladyships mercy are you prepared if your daughter is asked in marriage to settle ten thousand pounds on her general ople the general collected himself in his heart he thoroughly appreciated the moral beauty of lady campers extreme solicitude on behalf of his daughters provision but he would have desired a postponement of that and other material questions belonging to a distant future until his own fate was decided so he said your ladyships generosity is very marked i say it is very marked how my good general ople how is it marked in any degree cried lady camper i am not generous i dont pretend to be and certainly i dont want the young people to think me so i want to be just i have assumed that you intend to be the same then will you do me the favour to reply to me the general smiled winningly and intently to show her that he prized her and would not let her escape his eulogies marked in this way dear madam that you think of my daughters future more than i i say more than her father himself does i know i ought to speak more warmly i feel warmly i was never an eloquent man and if you take me as a soldier i am as i have ever been in the service i was saying i am wilson ople of the grade of general to be relied on for executing orders and madam you are lady camper and you command me i cannot be more precise in fact it is the feeling of the necessity for keeping close to the business that destroys what i would say i am in fact lamentably incompetent to conduct my own case lady camper left her chair dear me this is very strange unless i am singularly in error she said the general now faintly guessed that he might be in error for his part but he had burned his ships blown up his bridges retreat could not be thought of he stood his head bent and appealing to her sideface like one pleadingly in pursuit and very deferentially with a courteous vehemence he entreated first her ladyships pardon for his presumption and then the gift of her ladyships hand as for his language it was the tongue of general ople but his bearing was fine if his clipped white silken hair spoke of age his figure breathed manliness he was a picture and she loved pictures for his own sake she begged him to cease she dreaded to hear of something gentlemanly this is a new idea to me my dear general she said you must give me time people at our age have to think of fitness of course in a sense we are both free to do as we like perhaps i may be of some aid to you my preference is for absolute independence and i wished to talk of a different affair come to me tomorrow do not be hurt if i decide that we had better remain as we are the general bowed his efforts and the wavering of the fair enemys flag had inspired him with a positive reawakening of masculine passion to gain this fortress he said well i have then the happiness madam of being allowed to hope until tomorrrow she replied i would not deprive you of a moment of happiness bring good sense with you when you do come the general asked eagerly i have your ladyships permission to come early consult your happiness she answered and if to his mind she seemed returning to the state of enigma it was on the whole deliciously she restored him his youth he told elizabeth that night he really must begin to think of marrying her to some worthy young fellow though said he with an air of frank intoxication my opinion is the young ones are not so lively as the old in these days or i should have been besieged before now the exact substance of the interview he forbore to relate to his inquisitive daughter with a very honourable discretion chapter iv elizabeth came riding home to breakfast from a gallop round the park and passing lady campers gates received the salutation of her parasol lady camper talked with her through the bars there was not a sign to tell of a change or twist in her neighbourly affability she remarked simply enough that it was her nephews habit to take early gallops and possibly elizabeth might have seen him for his quarters were proximate but she did not demand an answer she had passed a rather restless night she said how is the general papa must have slept soundly for he usually calls to me through his door when he hears i am up said elizabeth lady camper nodded kindly and walked on early in the morning general ople was ready for battle his forces were the anticipation of victory a carefully arranged toilet and an unaccustomed spirit of enterprise in the realms of speech for he was no longer in such awe of lady camper you have slept well she inquired excellently my lady yes your daughter tells me she heard you as she went by your door in the morning for a ride to meet my nephew you are i shall assume prepared for business elizabeth to meet general oples impression of anything extraneous to his emotion was feeble and passed instantly prepared oh certainly and he struck in a compliment on her ladyships fresh morning bloom it can hardly be visible she responded i have not painted yet does your ladyship proceed to your painting in the very early morning rouge i rouge dear me i should not have supposed it you have speculated on it very openly general i remember your trying to see a freckle through the rouge but the truth is i am of a supernatural paleness if i do not rouge so i do you understand therefore i have a false complexion now to business if your ladyship insists on calling it business i have little to offermyself you have a gentlemanly residence it is my lady it is it is a bijou ah lady camper sighed dejectedly it is a perfect bijou oblige me general by not pronouncing the french word as if you were swearing by something in english like a trooper general ople started admitted that the word was french and apologized for his pronunciation her variability was now visible over a corner of the battlefield like a thundercloud the business we have to discuss concerns the young people general yes brightened by this he assented yes dear lady camper it is a part of the business it is a secondary part it has to be discussed i say i subscribe beforehand i may say that honouring esteeming you as i do and hoping ardently for your consent they must have a home and an income general i presume dearest lady that elizabeth will be welcome in your home i certainly shall never chase reginald out of mine lady camper threw back her head then you are not yet awake or you practice the art of sleeping with open eyes now listen to me i rouge i have told you i like colour and i do not like to see wrinkles or have them seen therefore i rouge i do not expect to deceive the world so flagrantly as to my age and you i would not deceive for a moment i am seventy the effect of this noble frankness on the general was to raise him from his chair in a sitting posture as if he had been blown up her countenance was inexorably imperturbable under his alternate blinking and gazing that drew her close and shot her distant like a mysterious toy but said she i am an artist i dislike the look of extreme age so i conceal it as well as i can you are very kind to fall in with the deception an innocent and i think a proper one before the world though not to the gentleman who does me the honour to propose to me for my hand you desire to settle our business first you esteem me i suppose you mean as much as young people mean when they say they love do you let us come to an understanding i can the melancholy general gasped i say i cani cannoti cannot credit your ladyships you are at liberty to call me angela ange he tried it and in shame relapsed madam yes thanks ah cried lady camper do not use these vulgar contractions of decent speech in my presence i abhor the word thanks it is fit for fribbles dear me i have used it all my life groaned the general then for the remainder be it understood that you renounce it to continue my age is oh impossible impossible the general almost wailed there was really a crack in his voice advancing to seventy but like you i am happy to say i have not a malady i bring no invalid frame to a union that necessitates the leaving of the front door open day and night to the doctor my belief is i could follow my husband still on a campaign if he were a warrior instead of a pensioner general ople winced he was about to say humbly as general of brigade yes yes you want a commanding officer and that i have seen and that has caused me to meditate on your proposal she interrupted him while he studying her countenance hard with the painful aspect of a youth who lashes a donkey memory in an examination by word of mouth attempted to marshal her signs of younger years against her awful confession of the extremely ancient the witheringly ancient but for the manifest rouge manifest in spite of her declaration that she had not yet that morning proceeded to her paintbrush he would have thrown down his glove to challenge her on the subject of her age she had actually charms her mouth had a charm her eyes were lively her figure mature if you like was at least full and good she stood upright she had a queenly seat his mental ejaculation was what a wonderful constitution by a lapse of politeness he repeated it to himself half aloud he was shockingly nervous yes i have finer health than many a younger woman she said an ordinary calculation would give me twenty good years to come i am a widow as you know and by the way you have a leaning for widows have you not i thought i had heard of a widow barcop in this parish do not protest i assure you i am a stranger to jealousy my income the general raised his hands well then said the cool and selfcontained lady before i go farther i may ask you knowing what you have forced me to confess are you still of the same mind as to marriage and one moment general i promise you most sincerely that your withdrawing a step shall not as far as it touches me affect my neighbourly and friendly sentiments not in any degree shall we be as we were lady camper extended her delicate hand to him he took it respectfully inspected the aristocratic and unshrunken fingers and kissing them said i never withdraw from a position unless i am beaten back lady camper i my name is angela the general tried again he could not utter the name to call a lady of seventy angela is difficult in itself it is it seems thrice difficult in the way of courtship angela said she yes i say there is not a more beautiful female name dear lady camper spare me that word female as long as you live address me by that name if you please the general smiled the smile was meant for propitiation and sweetness it became a brazen smile unless you wish to step back said she indeed no i am happy lady camper my life is yours i say my life is devoted to you dear madam angela general ople was blushingly delivered of the name that will do said she and as i think it possible one may be admired too much as an artist i must request you to keep my number of years a secret to the death madam said the general and now we will take a turn in the garden wilson ople and beware of one thing for a commencement for you are full of weeds and i mean to pluck out a few never call any place a gentlemanly residence in my hearing nor let it come to my ears that you have been using the phrase elsewhere dont express astonishment at present it is enough that i dislike it but this only lady camper added this only if it is not your intention to withdraw from your position madam my lady i was sayinghemangela i could not wish to withdraw lady camper leaned with some pressure on his arm observing you have a curious attachment to antiquities my dear lady it is your mind i say it is your mind i was saying i am in love with your mind the general endeavoured to assure her and himself too or is it my powers as an artist your mind your extraordinary powers of mind well said lady camper a veteran general of brigade is as good a crutch as a childless old grannam can have and as a crutch general ople parading her grounds with the aged woman found himself used and treated the accuracy of his perceptions might be questioned he was like a man stunned by some great tropical fruit which responds to the longing of his eyes by falling on his head but it appeared to him that she increased in bitterness at every step they took as if determined to make him realize her wrinkles he was even so inconsequent or so little recognized his position as to object in his heart to hear himself called wilson it is true that she uttered wilsonople as if the names formed one word and on a second occasion when he inclined to feel hurt she remarked i fear me wilsonople if we are to speak plainly thou art but a fool he perhaps naturally objected to that he was however giddy and barely knew yet once more the magical woman changed all semblance of harshness and harridanlike spiketonguedness vanished when she said adieu the astronomer looking at the crusty jag and scoria of the magnified moon through his telescope and again with naked eyes at the softbeaming moon when the craterridges are faint as eyebrowpencillings has a similar sharp alternation of prospect to that which mystified general ople but between watching an orb that is only variable at our caprice and contemplating a woman who shifts and quivers ever with her own how vast the difference and consider that this woman is about to be ones wife he could have believed if he had not known full surely that such things are not he was in the hands of a witch lady campers adieu was perfectly beautifula kind cordial intimate above all to satisfy his present craving it was a ladylike adieuthe adieu of a delicate and elegant woman who had hardly left her anchorage by forty to sail into the fifties alas he had her word for it that she was not less than seventy and worse she had betrayed most melancholy signs of sourness and agedness as soon as he had sworn himself to her fast and fixed the road is open to you to retreat were her last words my road he answered gallantly is forward he was drawing backward as he said it and something provoked her to smile chapter v it is a noble thing to say that your road is forward and it befits a man of battles general ople was too loyal a gentleman to think of any other road still albeit not gifted with imagination he could not avoid the feeling that he had set his face to winter he found himself suddenly walking straight into the heart of winter and a nipping winter for her ladyship had proved acutely nipping his little customary phrases to which lady camper objected he could see no harm in whatever conversing with her in the privacy of domestic life would never be the flowing business that it is for other men it would demand perpetual vigilance hop skip jump flounderings and apologies this was not a pleasing prospect on the other hand she was the niece of an earl she was wealthy she might be an excellent friend to elizabeth and she could be when she liked both commandingly and bewitchingly ladylike good but he was a general officer of not more than fiftyfive in his full vigour and she a woman of seventy the prospect was bleak it resembled an outlook on the steppes in point of the discipline he was to expect he might be compared to a raw recruit and in his own home however she was a woman of mind one would be proud of her but did he know the worst of her a dreadful presentiment that he did not know the worst of her rolled an ocean of gloom upon general ople striking out one solitary thought in the obscurity namely that he was about to receive punishment for retiring from active service to a life of ease at a comparatively early age when still in marching trim and the shadow of the thought was that he deserved the punishment he was in his garden with the dawn hard exercise is the best of opiates for dismal reflections the general discomposed his daughter by offering to accompany her on her morning ride before breakfast she considered that it would fatigue him i am not a man of eighty he cried he could have wished he had been he led the way to the park where they soon had sight of young rolles who checked his horse and spied them like a vedette but perceiving that he had been seen came cantering and hailing the general with hearty wonderment and whats this the world says general said he but we all applaud your taste my aunt angela was the handsomest woman of her time the general murmured in confusion dear me and looked at the young man thinking that he could not have known the time is all arranged my dear general nothing is arranged and i begi say i beg i came out for fresh air and pace the general rode frantically in spite of the fresh air he was unable to eat at breakfast he was bound of course to present himself to lady camper in common civility immediately after it and first what were the phrases he had to avoid uttering in her presence he could remember only the gentlemanly residence and it was a gentlemanly residence he thought as he took leave of it it was one neatly named to fit the place lady camper is indeed a most eccentric person he decided from his experience of her he was rather astonished that young rolles should have spoken so coolly of his aunts leaning to matrimony but perhaps her exact age was unknown to the younger members of her family this idea refreshed him by suggesting the extremely honourable nature of lady campers uncomfortable confession he himself had an uncomfortable confession to make he would have to speak of his income he was living up to the edges of it she is an upright woman and i must be the same he said fortunately not in her hearing the subject was disagreeable to a man sensitive on the topic of money and feeling that his prudence had recently been misled to keep up appearances lady camper was in her garden reclining under her parasol a chair was beside her to which acknowledging the salutation of her suitor she waved him you have met my nephew reginald this morning general curiously in the park this morning before breakfast i did yes hem i i say i did meet him has your ladyship seen him no the park is very pretty in the early morning sweetly pretty lady camper raised her head and with the mildness of assured dictatorship pronounced never say that before me i submit my lady said the poor scourged man why naturally you do vulgar phrases have to be endured except when our intimates are guilty and then we are not merely offended we are compromised by them you are still of the mind in which you left me yesterday you are one day older but i warn you so am i yes my lady we cannot i say we cannot check time decidedly of the same mind quite so oblige me by never saying quite so my lawyer says it it reeks of the city of london and do not look so miserable i madam my dear lady the general flashed out in a radiance that dulled instantly well said she cheerfully and youre for the old woman for lady camper you are seductive in your flatteries general well then we have to speak of business my affairs general ople was beginning with perturbed forehead but lady camper held up her finger we will touch on your affairs incidentally now listen to me and do not exclaim until i have finished you know that these two young ones have been whispering over the wall for some months they have been meeting on the river and in the park habitually apparently with your consent my lady i did not say with your connivance you mean my daughter elizabeth and my nephew reginald we have named them if that advances us now the end of such meetings is marriage and the sooner the better if they are to continue i would rather they should not i do not hold it good for young soldiers to marry but if they do it is very certain that their pay will not support a family and in a marriage of two healthy young people we have to assume the existence of the family you have allowed matters to go so far that the boy is hot in love i suppose the girl is too she is a nice girl i do not object to her personally but i insist that a settlement be made on her before i give my nephew one penny hear me out for i am not fond of business and shall be glad to have done with these explanations reginald has nothing of his own he is my sisters son and i loved her and rather like the boy he has at present four hundred a year from me i will double it on the condition that you at once make over ten thousandnot less and let it be yes or noto be settled on your daughter and go to her children independent of the husbandcela va sans dire now you may speak general the general spoke with breath fetched from the deeps ten thousand pounds hem ten hem franklyten my lady ones incomei am quite taken by surprise i say elizabeths conductthough poor child it is natural to her to seek a mate i mean to accept a mate and an establishment and reginald is a very hopeful fellowi was saying they jump on me out of an ambush and i wish them every happiness and she is an ardent soldier and a soldier she must marry but ten thousand it is to secure the happiness of your daughter general pounds my lady it would rather cripple me you would have my house general you would have the moiety as the lawyers say of my purse you would have horses carriages servants i do not divine what more you would wish to have but madama pensioner on the government i can look back on past services i say old services and i accept my position but madam a pensioner on my wife bringing next to nothing to the common estate i fear my selfrespect would i say would well and what would it do general ople i was saying my selfrespect as my wifes pensioner my lady i could not come to her emptyhanded do you expect that i should be the person to settle money on your daughter to save her from mischances a rakish husband for example for reginald is young and no one can guess what will be made of him undoubtedly your ladyship is correct we might try absence for the poor girl i have no female relation but i could send her to the seaside to a ladyfriend general ople i forbid you as you value my esteem everand i repeat i forbid you everto afflict my ears with that phrase ladyfriend the general blinked in a state of insurgent humility these incessant whippings could not but sting the humblest of men and ladyfriend he was sure was a very common term used he was sure in the very best society he had never heard her majesty speak at levees of a ladyfriend but he was quite sure that she had one and if so what could be the objection to her subjects mentioning it as a term to suit their own circumstances he was harassed and perplexed by old lady campers treatment of him and he resolved not to call her angela even upon supplicationnot that day at least she said you will not need to bring property of any kind to the common estate i neither look for it nor desire it the generous thing for you to do would be to give your daughter all you have and come to me but lady camper if i denude myself or curtail my incomea man at his wifes discretion i was saying a man at his wifes mercy general ople was really forced by his manly dignity to make this protest on its behalf he did not see how he could have escaped doing so he was more an agent than a principal my wifes mercy he said again but simply as a herald proclaiming superior orders lady campers brows were wrathful a deep bloodcrimson overcame the rouge and gave her a terrible stormy look the congress now ceases to sit and the treaty is not concluded was all she said she rose bowed to him good morning general and turned her back he sighed he was a free man but this could not be deniedwhatever the ladys age she was a grand woman in her carriage and when looking angry she had a queenlike aspect that raised her out of the reckoning of time so now he knew there was a worse behind what he had previously known he was precipitate in calling it the worst now said he to himself i know the worst no man should ever say it least of all one who has entered into relations with an eccentric lady chapter vi politeness required that general ople should not appear to rejoice in his dismissal as a suitor and should at least make some show of holding himself at the beck of a reconsidering mind he was guilty of running up to london early next day and remaining absent until nightfall and he did the same on the two following days when he presented himself at lady campers lodgegates the astonishing intelligence that her ladyship had departed for the continent and egypt gave him qualms of remorse which assumed a more definite shape in something like awe of her triumphant constitution he forbore to mention her age for he was the most honourable of men but a habit of teatable talkativeness impelled him to say and repeat an idea that had visited him to the effect that lady camper was one of those wonderful women who are comparable to brilliant generals and defend themselves from the siege of time by various aggressive movements fearful of not being understood owing to the rarity of the occasions when the squat plain squad of honest saxon regulars at his command were called upon to explain an idea he recast the sentence but as it happened that the regulars of his vocabulary were not numerous and not accustomed to work upon thoughts and images his repetitions rather succeeded in exposing the piece of knowledge he had recently acquired than in making his meaning plainer so we need not marvel that his acquaintances should suppose him to be secretly aware of an extreme degree in which lady camper was a veteran general ople entered into the gaieties of the neighbourhood once more and passed through the winter cheerfully in justice to him however it should be said that to the intent dwelling of his mind upon lady camper and not to the festive life he led was due his entire ignorance of his daughters unhappiness she lived with him and yet it was in other houses he learnt that she was unhappy after his last interview with lady camper he had informed elizabeth of the ruinous and preposterous amount of money demanded of him for a settlement upon her and elizabeth like the girl of good sense that she was had replied immediately it could not be thought of papa he had spoken to reginald likewise the young man fell into a dramatic tearingofhair and longstride fury not ill becoming an enamoured dragoon but he maintained that his aunt though an eccentric was a cordially kind woman he seemed to feel if he did not partly hint that the general might have accepted lady campers terms the young officer could no longer be welcome at douro lodge so the general paid him a morning call at his quarters and was distressed to find him breakfasting very late tapping eggs that he forgot to openone of the surest signs of a young man downright and deep in love as the general knew from experienceand surrounded by uncut sporting journals of past weeks which dated from the day when his blow had struck him as accurately as the watch of the drowned man marks his minute lady camper had gone to italy and was in communication with her nephew reginald was not further explicit his legs were very prominent in his despair and his fingers frequently performed the part of blunt combs consequently the general was impressed by his passion for elizabeth the girl who if she was often meditative always met his eyes with a smile and quietly said yes papa and no papa gave him little concern as to the state of her feelings yet everybody said now that she was unhappy mrs barcop the widow raised her voice above the rest so attentive was she to elizabeth that the general had it kindly suggested to him that some one was courting him through his daughter he gazed at the widow now she was not much past thirty and it was really singularhe could have laughedthinking of mrs barcop set him persistently thinking of lady camper that is to say his mad fancy reverted from the lady of perhaps thirtyfive to the lady of seventy such thought he is genius in a woman of his neighbours generally mrs baerens the wife of a german merchant an exquisite player on the pianoforte was the most inclined to lead him to speak of lady camper she was a kind prattling woman and was known to have been a governess before her charms withdrew the gastronomic gottfried baerens from his devotion to the wellserved city club where as he exclaimed ever turning fondly to his wife as he vocalized the compliment he had found every necessity every luxury in life as you cannot have dem out of londonall save de female mrs baerens a lady of teutonic extraction was distinguishable as of that sex at least she was not masculine she spoke with great respect of lady camper and her family and seemed to agree in the generals eulogies of lady campers constitution still he thought she eyed him strangely one april morning the general received a letter with the italian postmark opening it with his usual calm and happy curiosity he perceived that it was composed of penandink drawings and suddenly his heart sank like a scuttled ship he saw himself the victim of a caricature the first sketch had merely seemed picturesque and he supposed it a clever play of fancy by some travelling friend or perhaps an actual scene slightly exaggerated even on reading a distant view of the city of wilsonople he was only slightly enlightened his heart beat still with befitting regularity but the second and the third sketches betrayed the terrible hand the distant view of the city of wilsonople was fair with glittering domes which in the succeeding near view proved to have been soapbubbles for a place of extreme flatness begirt with crazy oldfashioned fortifications was shown and in the third view representing the interior stood for sole place of habitation a sentrybox most minutely drawn and alas with fearful accuracy a military gentleman in undress occupied the box not a doubt could exist as to the person it was meant to be the general tried hard to remain incredulous he remembered too well who had called him wilsonople but here was the extraordinary thing that sent him over the neighbourhood canvassing for exclamations on the fourth page was the outline of a lovely feminine hand holding a pen as in the act of shading and under it these words what i say is i say i think it exceedingly unladylike now consider the generals feelings when turning to this fourth page having these very words in his mouth as the accurate expression of his thoughts he discovered them written an enemy who anticipates the actions of our mind has a quality of the malignant divine that may well inspire terror the senses of general ople were struck by the aspect of a lurid goddess who penetrated him read him through and had both power and will to expose and make him ridiculous for ever the loveliness of the hand too in a perplexing manner contested his denunciation of her conduct it was ladylike eminently and it involved him in a confused mixture of the moral and material as great as young people are known to feel when they make the attempt to separate them in one of their frenzies with a petty bitter laugh he folded the letter put it in his breast pocket and sallied forth for a walk chiefly to talk to himself about it but as it absorbed him entirely he showed it to the rector whom he met and what the rector said is of no consequence for general ople listened to no remarks calling in succession on the pollingtons the goslings the baerens and others early though it was and the lords of those houses absent amassing hoards and to the ladies everywhere he displayed the sketches he had received observing that wilsonople meant himself and there he was he said pointing at the capped fellow in the sentrybox done unmistakably the likeness indeed was remarkable she is a woman of genius he ejaculated with utter melancholy mrs baerens by the aid of a magnifying glass assisted him to read a line under the sentrybox that he had taken for a mere trembling dash it ran a gentlemanly residence what eyes she has the general exclaimed i say it is miraculous what eyes she has at her time of i was saying i should never have known it was writing he sighed heavily his shuddering sensitiveness to caricature was increased by a certain evident dread of the hand which struck the knowing that he was absolutely bare to this woman defenceless open to exposure in his little whims foibles tricks incompetencies in what lay in his heart and the words that would come to his tongue he felt like a man haunted so deeply did he feel the blow that people asked how it was that he could be so foolish as to dance about assisting lady camper in her efforts to make him ridiculous he acted the parts of publisher and agent for the fearful caricaturist in truth there was a strangely double reason for his conduct he danced about for sympathy he had the intensest craving for sympathy but more than this or quite as much he desired to have the powers of his enemy widely appreciated in the first place that he might be excused to himself for wincing under them and secondly because an awful admiration of her that should be deepened by a corresponding sentiment around him helped him to enjoy luxurious recollections of an hour when he was near making her his ownhis own in the holy abstract contemplation of marriage without realizing their probable relative conditions after the ceremony i say that is the very image of her ladyships hand he was especially fond of remarking i say it is a beautiful hand he carried the letter in his pocketbook and beginning to fancy that she had done her worst for he could not imagine an inventive malignity capable of pursuing the theme he spoke of her treatment of him with compassionate regret not badly assumed from being partly sincere two letters dated in france the one dijon the other fontainebleau arrived together and as the general knew lady camper to be returning to england he expected that she was anxious to excuse herself to him his fingers were not so confident for he tore one of the letters to open it the city of wilsonople was recognizable immediately so likewise was the sole inhabitant general oples petty bitter laugh recurred like a weakchested patients cough in the shifting of our winds eastward a faceless womans shadow kneels on the ground near the sentrybox weeping a faceless shadow of a young man on horseback is beheld galloping toward a gulf the sole inhabitant contemplates his largely substantial full fleshed face and figure in a glass next we see the standard of great britain furled next unfurled and borne by a troop of shadows to the sentrybox the officer within says i say i should be very happy to carry it but i cannot quit this gentlemanly residence next the standard is shown assailed by popguns several of the shadows are prostrate i was saying i assure you that nothing but this gentlemanly residence prevents me from heading you says the gallant officer general ople trembled with protestant indignation when he saw himself reclining in a magnified sentrybox while detachments of shadows hurry to him to show him the standard of his country trailing in the dust and he is maliciously made to say i dislike responsibility i say i am a fervent patriot and very fond of my comforts but i shun responsibility the second letter contained scenes between wilsonople and the moon he addresses her as his neighbour and tells her of his triumphs over the sex he requests her to inform him whether she is a female that she may be triumphed over he hastens past her window on foot with his head bent just as the general had been in the habit of walking he drives a mousepony furiously by he cuts down a tree that she may peep through then from the moons point of view wilsonople a silenus is discerned in an armchair winking at a couple too plainly pouting their lips for a doubt of their intentions to be entertained a fourth letter arrived bearing date of paris this one illustrated wilsonoples courtship of the moon and ended with his saying in his peculiar manner in spite of her paint i could not have conceived her age to be so enormous how break off his engagement with the lady moon consent to none of her terms little used as he was to read behind a veil acuteness of suffering sharpened the generals intelligence to a degree that sustained him in animated dialogue with each succeeding sketch or poisoned arrow whirring at him from the moment his eyes rested on it and here are a few samples wilsonople informs the moon that she is sweetly pretty he thanks her with thanks for a handsome piece of lunar green cheese he points to her apparently telling some one my ladyfriend he sneezes bijou bijou bijou they were trifles but they attacked his habits of speech and he began to grow more and more alarmingly absurd in each fresh caricature of his person he looked at himself as the malicious womans hand had shaped him it was unjust it was no resemblanceand yet it was there was a corner of likeness left that leavened the lump henceforth he must walk abroad with this distressing image of himself before his eyes instead of the satisfactory reflex of the man who had and was happy in thinking that he had done mischief in his time such an end for a conquering man was too pathetic the general surprised himself talking to himself in something louder than a hum at neighbours dinnertables he looked about and noticed that people were silently watching him chapter vii lady campers return was the subject of speculation in the neighbourhood for most people thought she would cease to persecute the general with her preposterous and unwarrantable penandink sketches when living so closely proximate and how he would behave was the question those who made a hero of him were sure he would treat her with disdain others were uncertain he had been so severely hit that it seemed possible he would not show much spirit he for his part had come to entertain such dread of the post that lady campers return relieved him of his morning apprehensions and he would have forgiven her though he feared to see her if only she had promised to leave him in peace for the future he feared to see her because of the too probable furnishing of fresh matter for her ladyships hand of course he could not avoid being seen by her and that was a particular misery a gentlemanly humility or demureness of aspect when seen would he hoped disarm his enemy it should he thought he had borne unheardof things no one of his friends and acquaintances knew they could not know what he had endured it has caused him fits of stammering it had destroyed the composure of his gait elizabeth had informed him that he talked to himself incessantly and aloud she poor child looked pale too she was evidently anxious about him young rolles whom he had met now and then persisted in praising his aunts good heart so perhaps having satiated her revenge she might now be inclined for peace on the terms of distant civility yes poor elizabeth sighed the general in pity of the poor girls disappointment poor elizabeth she little guesses what her father has gone through poor child i say she hasnt an idea of my sufferings general ople delivered his card at lady campers lodgegates and escaped to his residence in a state of prickly heat that required the brushing of his hair with hard brushes for several minutes to comfort and reestablish him he had fallen to working in his garden when lady campers card was brought to him an hour after the delivery of his own a pleasing promptitude showing signs of repentance and suggesting to the general instantly some sharp sarcasms upon women which he had come upon in quotations in the papers and the pulpit his two main sources of information instead of handing back the card to the maid he stuck it in his hat and went on digging the first of a series of letters containing shameless realistic caricatures was handed to him the afternoon following they came fast and thick not a days interval of grace was allowed niobe under the shafts of diana was hardly less violently and mortally assailed the deadliness of the attack lay in the ridicule of the daily habits of one of the most sensitive of men as to his personal appearance and the opinion of the world he might have concealed the sketches but he could not have concealed the bruises and people were perpetually asking the unhappy general what he was saying for he spoke to himself as if he were repeating something to them for the tenth time i say said he i say that for a lady really an educated lady to sit as she musti was saying she must have sat in an attic to have the right view of me and there you seethis is what she has done this is the last this is the afternoons delivery her ladyship has me correctly as to costume but i could not exhibit such a sketch to ladies a back view of the general was displayed in his act of digging i say i could not allow ladies to see it he informed the gentlemen who were suffered to inspect it freely but you see i have no means of escape i am at her mercy from morning to night the general said with a quivering tongue unless i stay at home inside the house and that is death to me or unless i abandon the place and my lease and i shalli say i shall find nowhere in england for anything like the money or conveniences such a genta residence you would call fit for a gentleman i call it a bi it is in short a gem but i shall have to go young rolles offered to expostulate with his aunt angela the general said tha i thank you very much i would not have her ladyship suppose i am so susceptible i hardly know he confessed pitiably what it is right to say and what notwhat not iii never know when i am not looking a fool i hurry from tree to tree to shun the light i am seriously affected in my appetite i say i shall have to go reginald gave him to understand that if he flew the shafts would follow him for lady camper would never forgive his running away and was quite equal to publishing a book of the adventures of wilsonople sunday afternoon walking in the park with his daughter on his arm general ople met mr rolles he saw that the young man and elizabeth were mortally pale and as the very idea of wretchedness directed his attention to himself he addressed them conjointly on the subject of his persecution giving neither of them a chance of speaking until they were constrained to part a sketch was the consequence in which a withered cupid and a fading psyche were seen divided by wilsonople who keeps them forcibly asunder with policemans fists while courteously and elegantly entreating them to hear him meet he tells them as often as you like in my company so long as you listen to me and the pathos of his aspect makes hungry demand for a sympathetic audience now this and not the series representing the martyrdom of the old couple at douro lodge gates whose rigid frames bore witness to the close packing of a gentlemanly residence this was the sketch general ople in his madness from the pursuing bite of the gadfly handed about at mrs pollingtons lawnparty some have said that he should not have betrayed his daughter but it is reasonable to suppose he had no idea of his daughters being the psyche or if he had it was indistinct owing to the violence of his personal emotion assuming this to have been the very sketch he handed it to two or three ladies in turn and was heard to deliver himself at intervals in the following snatches as you like my lady as you like strike i say strike i bear it i say i bear it if her ladyship is unforgiving i say i am enduring i may go i was saying i may go mad but while i have my reason i walk upright i walk upright mr pollington and certain city gentlemen hearing the poor generals renewed soliloquies were seized with disgust of lady campers conduct and stoutly advised an application to the law courts he gave ear to them abstractedly but after pulling out the whole chapter of the caricatures which it seemed that he kept in a case of morocco leather in his breastpocket showing them with comments on them and observing there will be more there must be more i say i am sure there are things i do that her ladyship will discover and expose he declined to seek redress or simple protection and the miserable spectacle was exhibited soon after of this courtly man listening to mrs barcop on the weather and replying in acquiescence it is hotif your ladyship will only abstain from colours very hot as you say madami do not complain of pen and ink but i would rather escape colours and i dare say you find it hot too mrs barcop shut her eyes and sighed over the wreck of a handsome military officer she asked him what is your objection to colours his hand was at his breastpocket immediately as he said have you not seenthough but a few minutes back he had shown her the contents of the packet including a hurried glance of the famous digging scene by this time the entire district was in fervid sympathy with general ople the ladies did not as their lords did proclaim astonishment that a man should suffer a woman to goad him to a state of semilunacy but one or two confessed to their husbands that it required a great admiration of general ople not to despise him both for his susceptibility and his patience as for the men they knew him to have faced the balls in bellowing battlestrife they knew him to have endured privation not only cold but downright want of food and drinkan almost unimaginable horror to these brave daily feasters so they could not quite look on him in contempt but his want of sense was offensive and still more so his submission to a scourging by a woman not one of them would have deigned to feel it would they have allowed her to see that she could sting them they would have laughed at her or they would have dragged her before a magistrate it was a sunday in early summer when general ople walked to morning service unaccompanied by elizabeth who was unwell the church was of the considerate oldfashioned order with deaf square pews permitting the mind to abstract itself from the sermon or wrestle at leisure with the difficulties presented by the preacher as general ople often did feeling not a little in love with his sincere attentiveness for grappling with the knotty point and partially allowing the struggle to be seen the church was besides a sanctuary for him hither his enemy did not come he had this one place of refuge and he almost looked a happy man again he had passed into his hat and out of it which he habitually did standing when who should walk up to within a couple of yards of him but lady camper her pew was full of poor people who made signs of retiring she signified to them that they were to sit then quietly took her seat among them fronting the general across the aisle during the sermon a low voice sharp in contradistinction to the monotone of the preachers was heard to repeat these words i say i am not sure i shall survive it considerable muttering in the same quarter was heard besides after the customary ceremonious game when all were free to move of nobody liking to move first lady camper and a charity boy were the persons who took the lead but lady camper could not quit her pew owing to the sticking of the door she smiled as with her pretty hand she twice or thrice essayed to shake it open general ople strode to her aid he pulled the door gave the shadow of a respectful bow and no doubt he would have withdrawn had not lady camper while acknowledging the civility placed her prayerbook in his hands to carry at her heels there was no choice for him he made a sort of slipping dance back for his hat and followed her ladyship all present being eager to witness the spectacle the passage of lady camper dragging the victim general behind her was observed without a stir of the welldressed members of the congregation until a desire overcame them to see how lady camper would behave to her fish when she had him outside the sacred edifice none could have imagined such a scene lady camper was in her carriage general ople was holding her prayerbook hat in hand at the carriage step and he looked as if he were toasting before the bars of a furnace for while he stood there lady camper was rapidly pencilling outlines in a small pocket sketchbook there are dogs whose shyness is put to it to endure human observation and a direct address to them even on the part of their masters and these dear simple dogs wag tail and turn their heads aside waveringly as though to entreat you not to eye them and talk to them so general ople in the presence of the sketchbook was much like the nervous animal he would fain have run away he glanced at it and round about and again at it and at the heavens her ladyships cruelty and his inexplicable submission to it were witnessed of the multitude the generals friends walked very slowly lady campers carriage whirled by and the general came up with them accosting them and himself alternately they asked him where elizabeth was and he replied poor child yes i am told she is pale but i cannot believe i am so perfectly i say so perfectly ridiculous when i join the responses he drew forth half a dozen sheets and showed them sketches that lady camper had taken in church caricaturing him in the sitting down and the standing up she had torn them out of the book and presented them to him when driving off i was saying worship in the ordinary sense will be interdicted to me if her ladyship said the general woefully shuffling the sketchpaper sheets in which he figured he made the following odd confession to mr and mrs gosling on the roadthat he had gone to his chest and taken out his swordbelt to measure his girth and found himself thinner than when he left the service which had not been the case before his attendance at the last levee of the foregoing season so the deduction was obvious that lady camper had reduced him she had reduced him as effectually as a harassing siege but why do you pay attention to her why exclaimed mr gosling a gentleman of the city whose roundness would have turned a rifleshot to allow her to wound you so seriously exclaimed mrs gosling madam if she were my wife the general explained i should feel it i say it is the fact of it i feel it if i appear so extremely ridiculous to a human eye to any one eye to lady campers eye he admitted it might be that he had not thought of ascribing the acuteness of his pain to the miserable image he presented in this particular ladys eye no it really was true curiously true another ladys eye might have transformed him to a pumpkin shape exaggerated all his foibles fiftyfold and he though not liking it of course not would yet have preserved a certain manly equanimity how was it lady camper had such power over hima lady concealing seventy years with a rougebox or paintpot it was witchcraft in its worst character he had for six months at her bidding been actually living the life of a beast degraded in his own esteem scorched by every laugh he heard running pursued overtaken and as it were scored or branded and then let go for the process to be repeated chapter viii our young barbarians have it all their own way with us when they fall into loveliking they lead us whither they please and interest us in their wishings their weepings and that fine performance their kissings but when we see our veterans tottering to their fall we scarcely consent to their having a wish as for a kiss we halloo at them if we discover them on a byway to the sacred grove where such things are supposed to be done by the venerable and this piece of rank injustice not to say impoliteness is entirely because of an unsound opinion that nature is not in it as though it were our esteem for nature which caused us to disrespect them they in truth show her to us discreet civilized in a decent moral aspect vistas of real life views of the minds eye are opened by their touching little emotions whereas those bully youngsters who come bellowing at us and catch us by the senses plainly prove either that we are no better than they or that we give our attention to nature only when she makes us afraid of her if we cared for her we should be up and after her reverentially in her sedater steps deeply studying her in her slower paces she teaches them nothing when they are whirling our closest instructors the true philosophers the storytellers in shortwill learn in time that nature is not of necessity always roaring and as soon as they do the world may be said to be enlightened meantime in the contemplation of a pair of white whiskers fluttering round a pair of manifestly painted cheeks be assured that nature is in it not that hectoring wantonbut let the young have their fun let the superior interest of the passions of the aged be conceded and not a word shall be said against the young if then nature is in it how has she been made active the reason of her launch upon this last adventure is that she has perceived the person who can supply the virtue known to her by experience to be wanting thus in the broader instance many who have journeyed far down the road turn back to the worship of youth which they have lost some are for the graceful worldliness of wit of which they have just share enough to admire it some are captivated by hands that can wield the rod which in earlier days they escaped to their cost in the case of general ople it was partly her whippings of him partly her penetration her ability that sat so finely on a wealthy woman her indifference to conventional manners that so well beseemed a noblyborn one and more than all her correction of his little weaknesses and incompetencies in spite of his dislike of it won him he began to feel a sort of nibbling pleasure in her grotesque sketches of his person a tendency to recur to the old ones while dreading the arrival of new you hear old gentlemen speak fondly of the swish and they are not attached to pain but the instrument revives their feeling of youth and general ople half enjoyed while shrinking lady campers foregone outlines of him for in the distance the whipsend may look like a clinging caress instead of a stinging flick but this craven melting in his heart was rebuked by a very worthy pride that flew for support to the injury she had done to his devotions and the offence to the sacred edifice after thinking over it he decided that he must quit his residence and as it appeared to him in the light of duty he with an unspoken anguish commissioned the houseagent of his town to sell his lease or let the house furnished without further parley from the houseagents shop he turned into the chemists for a tonic a foolish proceeding for he had received bracing enough in the blow he had just dealt himself but he had been cogitating on tonics recently imagining certain valiant effects of them with visions of a former careless happiness that they were likely to restore so he requested to have the tonic strong and he took one glass of it over the counter fifteen minutes after the draught he came in sight of his house and beholding it he could have called it a gentlemanly residence aloud under lady campers windows his insurgency was of such violence he talked of it incessantly but forbore to tell elizabeth as she was looking pale the reason why its modest merits touched him so he longed for the hour of his next dose and for a caricature to follow that he might drink and defy it a caricature was really due to him he thought otherwise why had he abandoned his bijou dwelling lady camper however sent none he had to wait a fortnight before one came and that was rather a likeness and a handsome likeness except as regarded a certain disorderliness in his dress which he knew to be very unlike him still it despatched him to the lookingglass to bring that verifier of facts in evidence against the sketch while sitting there he heard the housemaids knock at the door and the strange intelligence that his daughter was with lady camper and had left word that she hoped he would not forget his engagement to go to mrs baerens lawnparty the general jumped away from the glass shouting at the absent elizabeth in a fit of wrath so foreign to him that he returned hurriedly to have another look at himself and exclaimed at the pitch of his voice i say i attribute it to an indigestion of that tonic do you hear the housemaid faintly answered outside the door that she did alarming him for there seemed to be confusion somewhere his hope was that no one would mention lady campers name for the mere thought of her caused a rush to his head i believe i am in for a touch of apoplexy he said to the rector who greeted him in advance of the ladies on mr baerens lawn he said it smilingly but wanting some show of sympathy instead of the whisper and meaningless hand at his clerical band with which the rector responded he cried apoplexy and his friend seemed then to understand and disappeared among the ladies several of them surrounded the general and one inquired whether the series was being continued he drew forth his pocketbook handed her the latest and remarked on the gross injustice of it for as he requested them to take note her ladyship now sketched him as a person inattentive to his dress and he begged them to observe that she had drawn him with his necktie hanging loose and that i say that has never been known of me since i first entered society the ladies exchanged looks of profound concern for the fact was the general had come without any necktie and any collar and he appeared to be unaware of the circumstance the rector had told them that in answer to a hint he had dropped on the subject of neckties general ople expressed a slight apprehension of apoplexy but his careless or merely partial observance of the laws of buttonment could have nothing to do with such fears they signified rather a disorder of the intelligence elizabeth was condemned for leaving him to go about alone the situation was really most painful for a word to so sensitive a man would drive him away in shame and for good and still to let him parade the ground in the state compared with his natural self of scarecrow and with the dreadful habit of talking to himself quite rageing was a horrible alternative mrs baerens at last directed her husband upon the general trembling as though she watched for the operations of a fish torpedo and other ladies shared her excessive anxiousness for mr baerens had the manner and the look of artillery and on this occasion carried a surcharge of powder the general bent his ear to mr baerens whose germanenglish and repeated remark i am to do it wid delicassy did not assist his comprehension and when he might have been enlightened he was petrified by seeing lady camper walk on the lawn with elizabeth the great lady stood a moment beside mrs baerens she came straight over to him contemplating him in silence then she said your arm general ople and she made one circuit of the lawn with him barely speaking at her request he conducted her to her carriage he took a seat beside her obediently he felt that he was being sketched and comported himself like a childs flat man that jumps at the pulling of a string where have you left your girl general before he could rally his wits to answer the question he was asked and what have you done with your necktie and collar he touched his throat i am rather nervous today i forgot elizabeth he said sending his fingers in a dotting run of wonderment round his neck lady camper smiled with a triumphing humour on her closedrawn lips the verified absence of necktie and collar seemed to be choking him never mind you have been abroad without them said lady camper and that is a victory for me and you thought of elizabeth first when i drew your attention to it and that is a victory for you it is a very great victory pray do not be dismayed general you have a handsome campaigning air and no apologies if you please i like you well enough as you are there is my hand general ople understood her last remark he pressed the ladys hand in silence very nervously but do not shrug your head into your shoulders as if there were any possibility of concealing the thunderingly evident said lady camper electrifying him what with her cordial squeeze her kind eyes and her singular language you have omitted the collar well the collar is the fatal finishing touch in mens dress it would make apollo look bourgeois her hand was in his and watching the play of her features a spark entered general oples brain causing him in forgetfulness of collar and caricatures to ejaculate seventy did your ladyship say seventy utterly impossible you trifle with me we will talk when we are free of this accompaniment of carriagewheels general said lady camper i will beg permission to go and fetch elizabeth madam rightly thought of fetch her in my carriage and by the way mrs baerens was my old musicmistress and is i think one year older than i she can tell you on which side of seventy i am i shall not require to ask my lady he said sighing then we will send the carriage for elizabeth and have it out together at once i am impatient yes general impatient for what forgiveness of me my lady the general breathed profoundly of whom else do you know what it isi dont think you do you english have the smallest experience of humanity i mean this to strike so hard that in the end you soften your heart to the victim well that is my weakness and we of our blood put no restraint on the blows we strike when we think them wanted so we are always overdoing it general ople assisted lady camper to alight from the carriage which was forthwith despatched for elizabeth he prepared to listen to her with a disconnected smile of acute attentiveness she had changed she spoke of money ten thousand pounds must be settled on his daughter and now said she you will remember that you are wanting a collar he acquiesced he craved permission to retire for ten minutes simplest of men what will cover you she exclaimed and peremptorily bidding him sit down in the drawingroom she took one of the famous pair of pistols in her hand and said if i put myself in a similar position and make myself decodletee too will that satisfy you you see these murderous weapons well i am a coward i dread firearms they are laid there to impose on the world and i believe they do they have imposed on you now you would never think of pretending to a moral quality you do not possess but silly simple man that you are you can give yourself the airs of wealth buy horses to conceal your nakedness and when you are taken upon the standard of your apparent income you would rather seem to be beating a miserly retreat than behave frankly and honestly i have a little overstated it but i am near the mark your ladyship wanting courage cried the general refresh yourself by meditating on it said she and to prove it to you i was glad to take this house when i knew i was to have a gallant gentleman for a neighbour no visitors will be admitted general ople so you are barethroated only to me sit quietly one day you speculated on the paint in my cheeks for the space of a minute and a halfi had said that i freckled easily your look signified that you really could not detect a single freckle for the paint i forgave you or i did not but when i found you on closer acquaintance as indifferent to your daughters happiness as you had been to her reputation my daughter her reputation her happiness general ople raised his eyes under a wave half uttering the outcries so indifferent to her reputation that you allowed a young man to talk with her over the wall and meet her by appointment so reckless of the girls happiness that when i tried to bring you to a treaty on her behalf you could not be dragged from thinking of yourself and your own affair when i found that perhaps i was predisposed to give you some of what my sisters used to call my spice you would not honestly state the proportions of your income and you affected to be faithful to the woman of seventy most preposterous could any caricature of mine exceed in grotesqueness your sketch of yourself you are a brave and a generous man all the same and i suspect it is more hoodwinking than egotismor extreme egotismthat blinds you a certain amount you must have to be a man you did not like my paint still less did you like my sincerity you were annoyed by my corrections of your habits of speech you were horrified by the age of seventy and you were credulousgeneral ople listen to me and remember that you have no collar onyou were credulous of my statement of my great age or you chose to be so or chose to seem so because i had brushed your cats coat against the fur and then full of yourself not thinking of elizabeth but to withdraw in the chivalrous attitude of the man true to his word to the old woman only stickling to bring a certain independence to the common stock because i quote you and you have no collar on mindyou could not be at your wifes mercy you broke from your proposal on the money question where was your consideration for elizabeth then well general you were fond of thinking of yourself and i thought i would assist you i gave you plenty of subject matter i will not say i meant to work a homoeopathic cure but if i drive you to forget your collar is it or is it not a triumph no added lady camper it is no triumph for me but it is one for you if you like to make the most of it your fault has been to quit active service general and love your ease too well it is the fault of your countrymen you must get a militia regiment or inspectorship of militia you are ten times the man in exercise why do you mean to tell me that you would have cared for those drawings of mine when marching i think so i say i think so remarked the general seriously i doubt it said she but to the point here comes elizabeth if you have not much money to spare for her according to your prudent calculation reflect how this money has enfeebled you and reduced you to the level of the people round about us herewho are what inhabitants of gentlemanly residences yes but what kind of creature they have no mental standard no moral aim no native chivalry you were rapidly becoming one of them only fortunately for you you were sensitive to ridicule elizabeth shall have half my money settled on her said the general though i fear it is not much and if i can find occupation my lady something worthier than that said lady camper pencilling outlines rapidly on the margin of a book and he saw himself lashing a pony or that and he was plucking at a cabbage or that and he was bowing to three petticoated posts the likeness is exact general ople groaned so you may suppose i have studied you said she but there is no real likeness slight exaggerations do more harm to truth than reckless violations of it you would not have cared one bit for a caricature if you had not nursed the absurd idea of being one of our conquerors it is the very tragedy of modesty for a man like you to have such notions my poor dear good friend the modest are the most easily intoxicated when they sip at vanity and reflect whether you have not been intoxicated for these young people have been wretched and you have not observed it though one of them was living with you and is the child you love there i have done pray show a good face to elizabeth the general obeyed as well as he could he felt very like a sheep that has come from a shearing and when released he wished to run away but hardly had he escaped before he had a desire for the renewal of the operation she sees me through she sees me through he was heard saying to himself and in the end he taught himself to say it with a secret exultation for as it was on her part an extraordinary piece of insight to see him through it struck him that in acknowledging the truth of it he made a discovery of new powers in human nature general ople studied lady camper diligently for fresh proofs of her penetration of the mysteries in his bosom by which means as it happened that she was diligently observing the two betrothed young ones he began to watch them likewise and took a pleasure in the sight their meetings their partings their rides out and home furnished him themes of converse he soon had enough to talk of and previously as he remembered he had never sustained a conversation of any length with composure and the beneficent sense of fulness five thousand pounds to which sum lady camper reduced her stipulation for elizabeths dowry he signed over to his dear girl gladly and came out with the confession to her ladyship that a wellinvested twelve thousand comprised his fortune she shrugged she had left off pulling him this way and that so his chains were enjoyable and he said to himself if ever she should in the dead of night want a man to defend her he mentioned it to reginald who had been the repository of elizabeths lamentations about her father being left alone forsaken and the young man conceived a scheme for causing his aunts great bell to be rung at midnight which would certainly have led to a dramatic issue and the happy reestablishment of our masculine ascendancy at the close of this history but he forgot it in his bridegrooms delight until he was making his miserable official speech at the weddingbreakfast and set elizabeth winking over a tear as she stood in the hall ready to depart a great van was observed in the road at the gates of douro lodge and this the men in custody declared to contain the goods and knickknacks of the people who had taken the house furnished for a year and were coming in that very afternoon i remember i say now i remember i had a notice the general said cheerily to his troubled daughter but where are you to go papa the poor girl cried close on sobbing i shall get employment of some sort said he i was saying i want it i need it i require it you are saying three times what once would have sufficed for said lady camper and she asked him a few questions frowned with a smile and offered him a lodgement in his neighbours house really dearest aunt angela said elizabeth what else can i do child i have it seems driven him out of a gentlemanly residence and i must give him a ladylike one true i would rather have had him at call but as i have always wished for a policeman in the house i may as well be satisfied with a soldier but if you lose your character my lady said reginald then i must look to the general to restore it general ople immediately bowed his head over lady campers fingers an odd thing to happen to a woman of fortyone she said to her great people and they submitted with the best grace in the world while the generals ears tingled till he felt younger than reginald this his reflections ran or it would be more correct to say waltzed this is the result of paintingthat you can believe a woman to be any age when her cheeks are tinted as for lady camper she had been floated accidentally over the ridicule of the bruit of a marriage at a time of life as terrible to her as her fiction of seventy had been to general ople she resigned herself to let things go with the tide she had not been blissful in her first marriage she had abandoned the chase of an ideal man and she had found one who was tunable so as not to offend her ears likely ever to be a fund of amusement for her humour good impressible and above all very picturesque there is the secret of her and of how it came to pass that a simple man and a complex woman fell to union after the strangest division etext editors bookmarks can believe a woman to be any age when her cheeks are tinted modest are the most easily intoxicated when they sip at vanity nature is not of necessity always roaring only to be described in the tongue of auctioneers respected the vegetable yet more than he esteemed the flower she seems honest and that is the most we can hope of girls spare me that word female as long as you live the mildness of assured dictatorship when we see our veterans tottering to their fall the end

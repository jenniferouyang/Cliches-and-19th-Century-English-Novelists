the adventures of harry richmond by george meredith book vii a free life on the road viii janet ilchester ix an evening with captain bulsted x an expedition xi the great fog and the fire at midnight xii we find ourselves bound on a voyage xiii we conduct several learned arguments with the captain of the priscilla xiv i meet old friends chapter vii a free life on the road i woke very early though i had taken kindly to my pillow as i found by my having an arm round my companions neck and her fingers intertwisted with mine for awhile i lay looking at her eyes which had every imaginable light and signification in them they advised me to lie quiet they laughed at my wonder they said dear little fellow they flashed as from under a cloud darkened flashed out of it seemed to dip in water and shine and were sometimes like a view into a forest sometimes intensely sunny never quite still i trusted her and could have slept again but the sight of the tent stupefied me i fancied the sky had fallen and gasped for air my head was extremely dizzy too not one idea in it was kept from wheeling this confusion of my head flew to my legs when imitating her i rose to go forth in a fit of horror i thought i ve forgotten how to walk summoning my manful resolution i made the attempt to step across the children swaddled in matting and straw and old gowns or petticoats the necessity for doing it with a rush seized me after the first step i pitched over one little bundle right on to the figure of a sleeping woman all she did was to turn round murmuring naughty jackie my companion pulled me along gravely and once in the air with a good breath of it in my chest i felt tall and strong and knew what had occurred the tent where i had slept struck me as more curious than my own circumstances i lifted my face to the sky it was just sunrise beautiful bits of long and curling cloud brushed any way close on the blue and rosy and white deliciously cool the grass was all grey our dell in shadow and the tops of the trees burning a few birds twittering i sucked a blade of grass i wish it was all water here i said come and have a drink and a bathe said my companion we went down the dell and over a juniper slope reminding me of my day at john salters house and the last of dear heriot rather to my shame my companion beat me at running she was very swift and my legs were stiff can you swim she asked me i can row and swim and fence and ride and fire a pistol i said oh dear said she after eyeing me enviously i could see that i had checked a recital of her accomplishments we arrived at a clear stream in a gentlemans park where grass rolled smooth as seawater on a fine day and cows and horses were feeding i can catch that horse and mount him she said i was astonished straddle she nodded down for yes no saddle she nodded level for no my respect for her returned but she could not swim only up to my knees she confessed have a look at me said i and i stripped and shot into the water happy as a fish and thinking how much nicer it was than champagne my enjoyment made her so envious that she plucked off her stockings and came in as far as she dared i called to her youre like a cow and she showed her teeth bidding me not say that a cow a cow i repeated in my superior pleasure she spun out in a breath if you say that i ll run away with every bit of your clothes and youll come out and run about naked you will now i float was my answer now i dive and when i came up she welcomed me with a big bright grin a smart run in the heat dried me i dressed finding half my money on the grass she asked me to give her one of those bitsa shilling i gave her two upon which she asked me invitingly if ever i tossed i replied that i never tossed for money but she had caught a shilling and i could not resist guessing heads and won the same with her second shilling she handed them to me sullenly sobbing yet she would not take them back byandby you give me another two she said growing lively again we agreed that it would be a good thing if we entered the village and bought something none of the shops were open we walked through the churchyard i said heres where dead people are buried ill dance if you talk about dead people said she and began whooping at the pitch of her voice on my wishing to know why she did it her reply was that it was to make the dead people hear my feelings were strange the shops not open and no living people to be seen we climbed trees and sat on a branch talking of birds eggs till hunger drove us to the village street where near the publichouse we met the mantramp who whistled he was rather amusing he remarked that he put no questions to me because he put no question to anybody because answers excited him about subjects that had no particular interest to him and did not benefit him to the extent of a pipe of tobacco and all through not being inquisitive yesterday afternoon he had obtained as if it had been chucked into his lap a fineflavoured fat goose honourably for his supper besides bottles of ale bottles of gingerpop and a fairearned halfcrown that was through his not being inquisitive and he was not going to be inquisitive now knowing me for a gentleman my master had tipped him halfacrown fortunately for him and perhaps for my liberty he employed a verb marvellously enlightening to a schoolboy i tipped him another half crown he thanked me observing that there were days when you lay on your back and the sky rained apples while there were other days when you wore your fingers down to the first joint to catch a flea such was fortune in a friendly manner he advised me to go to school if not there then to go home my idea which i had only partly conceived was to have a look at riversley over a hedge kiss my aunt dorothy unaware and fly subsequently in search of my father breakfast however was my immediate thought he and the girl sat down to breakfast at the inn as my guests we ate muttonchops and eggs and drank coffee after it though i had no suspicions i noticed that the man grew thoughtful he proposed to me supposing i had no objection against slow travelling to join company for a couple of days if i was for hampshire which i stated was the county i meant to visit well then here now come along d ye see look said he i mustnt be pounced on and no missing young gentleman in my society and me took halfacrown for his absence that wont do you get on pretty well with the gal and that s a screaming farce none of us do lord she looks down on such scum as us shes gipsy blood true sort everythings sausages that gets into their pockets no matter what it was when it was out well then now here you and the gal go t other side o bedlming and you wait for us on the heath and we ll be there to comfort ye fore dark is it a fister he held out his hand i agreed and he remarked that he now counted a breakfast in the list of his gains from never asking questions i was glad enough to quit the village in a hurry for the driver of the geese or a man dreadfully resembling him passed me near the public house and attacked my conscience on the cowardly side which is i fear the first to awaken and always the liveliest half while we are undisciplined i would have paid him money but the idea of a conversation with him indicated the road back to school my companion related her history she belonged to a hampshire gipsy tribe and had been on a visit to a relative down in the east counties who died on the road leaving her to be brought home by these tramps she called them mumpers and made faces when she spoke of them gipsies she said were a different sort gipsies camped in gentlemens parks gipsies horses fiddles and the wide worldthat was what she liked the wide world she described as a heath where you looked and never saw the end of it i let her talk on for me to talk of my affairs to a girl without bonnet and boots would have been absurd otherwise her society pleased me she was so like a boy and unlike any boy i knew my mental occupation on the road was to calculate how many hilltops i should climb before i beheld riversley the sunday bells sounded homely from village to village as soon as i was convinced that i heard no bells summoning boarders to rippengers school the shops in the villages continued shut however i told the girl they should pay me for it next day and we had an interesting topic in discussing as to the various things we would buy she was for bright ribands and drapers stuff i for pastry and letterpaper the smell of peoples dinners united our appetites going through a village i saw a man carrying a great baked pie smelling overpoweringly so that to ask him his price for it was a natural impulse with me what sell my sunday dinner he said and appeared ready to drop the dish nothing stopped his staring until we had finished a plateful apiece and some beer in his cottage among his family he wanted to take me in alone shes a common tramp he said of the girl thats a lie she answered of course i would not leave her hungry outside so in the end he reluctantly invited us both and introduced us to his wife heres a young gentleman asks a bit o dinner and a young idnknow what s after the same i leaves it to you missus his wife took it off his shoulders in good humour saying it was lucky she made the pie big enough for her family and strays they would not accept more than a shilling for our joint repast the man said that was the account to a farthing if i was too proud to be a poor mans guest and insisted on treating him like a public perhaps i would shake hands at parting i did cordially and remembered him when people were not so civil they wanted to know whether we had made a runaway match of it the fun of passing a boysschool and hearing the usher threaten to punish one fellow for straying from ranks entertained me immensely i laughed at them just as the stupid people we met laughed at me which was unpleasant for the time but i knew there was not a single boy who would not have changed places with me only give him the chance though my companion was a gipsy girl and she certainly did look odd company for a gentlemans son in a teagarden and publichouse parlour at nightfall however i was glad of her and she of me and we walked hand in hand i narrated tales of roman history it was very well for her so say ill mother you as we lay down to sleep i discovered that she would never have hooted over churchyard graves in the night she confessed she believed the devil went about in the night our bed was a cart under a shed our bedclothes fernleaves and armfuls of straw the shafts of the cart were down so we lay between upright and level and awakening in the early light i found our four legs hanging over the seat in front how you have been kicking said i she accused me of the same next minute she pointed over the side of the cart and i saw the tramps horse and his tents beneath a broad roadside oaktree her face was comical just like a boys who thinks he has escaped and is caught lets run she said preferring positive independence i followed her and then she told me that she had overheard the tramp last night swearing i was as good as a fistful of halfcrowns lost to him if he missed me the image of rippengers school overshadowed me at this communication with some melancholy i said youll join your friends wont you she snapped her fingers mumpers and walked on carelessly we were now on the great heaths they brought the memory of my father vividly the smell of the air half inclined me to turn my steps toward london i grew so full of longing for him nevertheless i resolved to have one gaze at riversley my aunt dorothy and sewis the old grey brown butler and the lamb that had grown a sheep wonderful contrasts to my grand kings of england career my first clear recollection of riversley was here like an outline of a hill seen miles away i might have shed a tear or two out of love for my father had not the thought that i was a very queer boy displaced his image i could not but be a very queer boy such a lot of things happened to me suppose i joined the gipsies my companion wished me to she had brothers horse dealers beautiful fiddlers suppose i learnt the fiddle suppose i learnt their language and went about with them and became king of the gipsies my companion shook her head she could not encourage this ambitious idea because she had never heard of a king of the gipsies or a queen either we fool people she said and offended me for our school believed in a gipsy king and one fellow hackman used to sing a song of a gipsy king and it was as much as to say that my schoolfellows were fools every one of them i accused her of telling lies she grinned angrily i dont tell em to friends she said we had a quarrel the truth was i was enraged at the sweeping out of my prospects of rising to distinction among the gipsies after breakfast at an inn where a waiter laughed at us to our faces and we fed scowling shy and hungry we had another quarrel i informed her of my opinion that gipsies could not tell fortunes they can and you come to my mother and my aunt and see if they cant tell your fortune said she in a fury yes and thats how they fool people said i i enjoyed seeing the flash of her teeth but my daring of her to look me in the eyes and swear on her oath she believed the fortunes true ones sent her into a fit of sullenness go along you nasty little fellow your shadow isnt half a yard she said and i could smile at that my shadow stretched half across the road we had a quarrelsome day wherever we went rarely walking close together till nightfall when she edged up to my hand with i say ill keep you warm tonight i will she hugged me almost too tight but it was warm and social and helped to the triumph of a feeling i had that nothing made me regret running away from rippengers school an adventure befell us in the night a farmers wife whom we asked for a drink of water after dark lent us an old blanket to cover us in a dry ditch on receiving our promise not to rob the orchard an old beggar came limping by us and wanted to share our covering my companion sank right under the blanket to peer at him through one of its holes he stood enormous above me in the moonlight like an apparition touching earth and sky cold cold he whined theres neer a worse off but theres a better off young un his words dispersed the fancy that he was something horrible or else my father in disguise going to throw off his rags and shine and say he had found me are ye one or are ye two he asked i replied that we were two then ill come and lie in the middle said he you cant theres no room i sang out lord said he theres room for any reckoning o empty stomachs in a ditch no i prefer to be alone goodnight said i why he exclaimed where ha you been t learn language halloa please leave me alone its my intention to go to sleep i said vexed at having to conciliate him he had a big stick oho went the beggar then he recommenced tell me youve stole nothing in your life youve stole a gentlemans tongue i knows the ring o that how comes you out here whos your mate there down below now see im going to lift my stick at these menacing words the girl jumped out of the blanket and i called to him that i would rouse the farmer why because im goin to knock down a apple or two on your head he inquired in a tone of reproach its a young woman youve got there eh well odd grows odder like the man who turned three shillings into five now you gi me a lie under your blanket i ll knock down a apple apiece if ever youve tasted gin you ll say a apple at nights a cordial though it dont intoxicate the girl whispered in my ear hes lame as ducks her meaning seized me at once we both sprang out of the ditch and ran dragging our blanket behind us he pursued but we eluded him and dropped on a quiet sleepingplace among furzes next morning when we took the blanket to the farmhouse we heard that the old wretch had traduced our characters and got a breakfast through charging us with the robbery of the apple tree i proved our innocence to the farmers wife by putting down a shilling the sight of it satisfied her she combed my hair brought me a bowl of water and a towel and then gave us a bowl of milk and bread and dismissed us telling me i had a fair face and daredevil written on it as for the girl she said of her that she knew gipsies at a glance and what god almighty made them for there was no guessing this set me thinking all through the day what can they have been made for i bought a red scarf for the girl and other things she fixed her eyes on but i lost a great deal of my feeling of fellowship with her i dare say they were made for fun i thought when people laughed at us now and i laughed also i had a day of rollicking laughter puzzling the girl who could only grin two or three seconds at a time and then stared like a dog that waits for his master to send him off again running the corners of her mouth twitching for me to laugh or speak exactly as a dog might wag his tail i studied her in the light of a harmless sort of unaccountable creature witness at any rate for the fact that i had escaped from school we loitered half the morning round a cricketers booth in a field where there was moderately good cricketing the people thought it of first rate quality i told them i knew a fellow who could bowl out either eleven in an hour and a half one of the men frightened me by saying by gearge ill in with you into a gig and off with you after that ther faller he pretended to mean it and started up i watched him without flinching he remarked that if i had not cut my lucky from school and tossed my cap for a free life he was whatever may be expressed by a slap on the thigh we played a singlewicket side game he giving me six runs and crestfallen he was to find himself beaten but as i let him know one who had bowled to heriot for hours and stood against saddlebanks bowling was a tough customer never mind his age this man offered me his friendship he made me sit and eat beside him at the afternoon dinner of the elevens and sent platefuls of food to the girl where she was allowed to squat and said he you and ill tie a knot and be friends for life i replied with pleasure we nodded over a glass of ale in answer to his questions i stated that i liked farms i would come and see his farm i would stay with him two or three days i would give him my address if i had one i was on my way to have a look at riversley grange hey says he riversley grange well to be sure now im a tenant of squire belthams and a right sort of landlord too oh says i hes my grandfather but i dont care much about him lord says he what be you the little boy why master harry richmond that was carried off in the night and the old squire shut up doors for a fortnight and made out you was gone in a hearse why i know all about you you see and back you are hurrah the squire ll be hearty that he will weve noticed a change in him ever since you left gouts been at his leg off and on a deal shrewder but he rides to hounds and dines his tenants still that he does hes one o th old style everything you eat and drinks off his estate the day he dines his tenants no humbug bout old squire beltham i asked him if sewis was alive why old sewis says he youre acquainted with old sewis why of course you are yes old sewis s alive master harry and you bet me at singlewicket that ll be something to relate to em all by gearge if i didnt think id got a nettle in my fist when i saw you pitch into my stumps dash it thinks i but th old squire ll be proud of you that he will my farm lies three miles away you look at a crow flying due southeast five minutes from riversley and hes over throckham farm and there i ll drive ye tonight and tomorrow clean and tidy out o my wifes soap and water straight to riversley done eh my names eckerthy no matter where you comes from here you are eh master harry and i see you last time in a donkeybasket and here you come in breeches and defy me to singlewicket and you bet me too he laughed for jollity an extraordinary number of emotions had possession of me the most intelligible one being a restless vexation at myself as the principal person concerned for not experiencing anything like the farmers happiness i preferred a gipsy life to riversley gipsies were on the road and that road led to my father i endeavoured to explain to farmer eckerthy that i was travelling in this direction merely to have a short look at riversley but it was impossible he could not understand me the more i tried the more he pressed me to finish my glass of ale which had nothing to do with it i drank nevertheless and i suppose said many funny things in my anxiety that the farmer should know what i meant he laughed enough while he was fielding against the opposite eleven the tramp came into the booth and we had a match of cunning schoolmasters out after you young gentleman said he advising me to hurry along the road if i sought to baffle pursuit i pretended alarm and then said oh youll stand by me and treated him to ale he assured me i left as many tracks behind me as if i went spilling a box of lucifermatches he was always for my hastening on until i ordered fresh ale for him the girl and he grimaced at one another in contempt so we remained seeing the game out by the time the game ended the tramp had drunk numbers of glasses of ale a fineflavoured fat goose he counted his gains since the commencement of our acquaintance bottles of ale and gingerpop two halfcrowns more ale and more to follow lets hope you only stick to your friends young gentleman wont you sir its a hard case for a poor man like me if you dont we aint got such chances every morning of our lives do you perceive sir i request you to inform me do you perceive sir im muddled a bit sir but a man must look after his interests i perceived he was so muddled as to be unable to conceal that his interests were involved in my capture but i was merry too farmer eckerthy dealt the tramp a scattering slap on the back when he returned to the booth elated at having beaten the enemy by a single run master harry richmond go to riversley to his grandfather in your company you scoundrel he cried in a rage after listening to him i mean to drive him over it s a comfortable tenmile and no more but i say master harry what do you say to a peck o supper he communicated to me confidentially that he did not like to seem to slink away from the others who had made up their minds to stop and sup so we would drive home by moonlight singing songs and so we did i sat beside the farmer the girl scrambled into the hinder part of the cart and the tramp stood moaning oh dear oh dear you goes away to riversley without your best friend i tossed him a shilling we sang beginnings and ends of songs the farmer looked at the moon and said lord she stares at us then he sang the moon is shining on latworth lea and wherell she see such a jovial three as we boys we and why is she pale its because she drinks water instead of ale where s the remainder theres the song oh handsome miss gammon has married lord mammon and jilted her suitors all cupids sharpshooters and gone in a carriage and six to her marriage singing hey for ive landed my salmon my salmon wheres the remainder i heard it th only time i ever was in london town never rested till id learnt it and now its clean gone whats come to me he sang to mary of ellingmere and another maid of some place and a loud song of britons it was startling to me to wake up to twilight in the open air and silence for i was unaware that i had fallen asleep the girl had roused me and we crept down from the cart horse and farmer were quite motionless in a green hollow beside the roadway looking across fields and fir plantations i beheld a house in the strange light of the hour and my heart began beating but i was overcome with shyness and said to myself no no thats not riversley im sure it isnt though the certainty of it was in my teeth refuting me i ran down the fields to the park and the bright little river and gazed when i could say yes it is riversley i turned away hurt even to a sense of smarting pain without knowing the cause i dare say it is true as the girl declared subsequently that i behaved like one in a fit i dropped and i may have rolled my body and cried an indefinite resentment at riversley was the feeling i grew conscious of after very fast walking i would not have accepted breakfast there about midday crossing a stubblefield the girl met a couple of her peoplemen near evening we entered one of their tents the women set up a cry kiomi kiomi like a rising rookery their eyes and teeth made such a flashing as when you dabble a hand in a dark waterpool the strange tongue they talked with a kind of peck of the voice at a word rapid never high or low and then a slide of similar tones all round not musical but catching and incessantgave me an idea that i had fallen upon a society of birds exceedingly curious ones they welcomed me kindly each of them looking me in the face a bright second or so i had two helps from a splendid pot of broth that hung over a fire in the middle of the tent kiomi was my companions name she had sisters adeline and eveleen and brothers osric and william and she had a cousin a prizefighter thats what ill be said i fiddling for money was not a prospect that charmed me though it was pleasant lying in kiomis arms to hear osric play us off to sleep it was like floating down one of a number of visible rivers i could see them converging and breaking away while i floated smoothly and a wonderful fair country nodded drowsy from that to cockcrow at a stride sleep was no more than the passage through the arch of a canal kiomi and i were on the heath before sunrise jumping gravelpits chasing sandpipers mimicking pewits it seemed to me i had only just heard the last of osrics fiddle when yellow colour filled in along the sky over riversley the curious dark thrill of the fiddle in the tent by night seemed close up behind the sun and my quiet fancies as i lay dropping to sleep followed me like unobtrusive shadows during daylight or to speak truthfully till about dinnertime when i thought of nothing but the great stewpot we fed on plenty nicer food than rippengers minus puddings after dinner i was ready for mischief my sensations on seeing kiomi beg of a gentleman were remarkable i reproached her she showed me sixpence shining in the palm of her hand i gave her a shilling to keep her from it she had now got one and sixpence she said meaning i supposed upon reflection that her begging had produced that sum and therefore it was a good thing the money remaining in my pocket amounted to five shillings and a penny i offered it to kiomis mother who refused to accept it so did the father and osric also i might think of them they observed on my return to my own house they pointed at riversley no said i i shant go there you may be sure the women grinned and the men yawned the business of the men appeared to be to set to work about everything as if they had a fire inside them and then to stretch out their legs and lie on their backs exactly as if the fire had gone out excepting osrics practice on the fiddle and the fathers bringing in and leading away of horses they did little work in my sight but brown themselves in the sun one morning osrics brother came to our camp with their cousin the prizefightera young man of lighter complexion upon whom i gazed remembering john threshers reverence for the heroical profession kiomi whispered some story concerning her brother having met the tramp i did not listen i was full of a tempest owing to two causes a studious admiration of the smart young prizefighters person and wrathful disgust at him for calling kiomi his wife and telling her he was prepared to marry her as soon as she played her harp like king david the intense folly of his asking a girl to play like david made me despise him but he was splendidly handsome and strong and to see him put on the gloves for a spar with big william kiomis brother and evade and ward the huge blows would have been a treat to others besides old john of dipwell farm he had the agile grace of a leopard his waistcoat reminded me of one he was like a piece of machinery in free action pleased by my enthusiasm he gave me a lesson promising me more hell be champion some day said kiomi at gnaw upon an apple he had given her i knocked the apple on the ground and stamped on it she slapped my cheek in a minute we stood in a ring i beheld the girl actually squaring at me fight away i said to conceal my shame and imagining i could slip from her hits as easily as the prizefighter did from big williams i was mistaken oh you think i cant defend myself said kiomi and rushed in with one two quick as a cat and cool as a statue fight my merry one she takes punishment the prizefighter sang out first blood to you kiomi uncork his claret my duck straight at the nozzle he sees more lamps than shine in london i warrant make him lively cook him tell him who taught you a downer to him and ill marry you tomorrow i conceived a fury against her as though she had injured me by appearing the mans propertyand i was getting the worst of it her little fists shot straight and hard as bars of iron she liked fighting she was at least my match to avoid the disgrace of seriously striking her or of being beaten at an open exchange of blows i made a feint and caught her by the waist and threw her not very neatly for i fell myself in her grip they had to pluck her from me by force and youve gone a course of tuition in wrestling squire the prizefighter said to me rather savagely the others were cordial and did not snarl at me for going to the ropes as he called it kiomi desired to renew the conflict i said aloud i never fight girls and i tell you i dont like their licking me then you come down to the river and wash your face said she and pulled me by the fingers and when she had washed my face clear of blood kissed me i thought she tasted of the prizefighter late in the afternoon osric proposed that he and i and the prizefighter should take a walk i stipulated for kiomi to be of the party which was allowed and the gipsywomen shook my hand as though i had been departing on a long expedition entreating me not to forget them and never to think evil of poor gipsyfolk why i mean to stay with you said i they grinned delightedly and said i must be back to see them break up camp in the evening every two or three minutes kiomi nudged my elbow and pointed behind where i saw the women waving their coloured neckerchiefs out of sight of our tents we came in view of the tramp kiomi said hide i dived into a furze dell the tramp approached calling out for news of me now at rippengers school thanks to heriot lying was not the fashion still i had heard boys lie and they can let it out of their mouths like a fish so lively simple and solid that you could fancy a master had asked them for it and they answered there it is but boys cannot lie in one key spontaneously a number of them to the same effect as my friends here did i was off they said all swung round to signify the direction of my steps my plans were hinted at particulars were not stated on the plea that there should be no tellings it was remarked that i ought to have fair play and law kiomi said she hoped he would not catch me the tramp winced with vexation and the gipsies chaffed him i thanked them in my heart for their loyal conduct creeping under cover of the dell i passed round to the road over a knoll of firs as quick as my feet could carry me and had just cried now im safe when a lady stepping from a carriage on the road caught me in her arms and hugged me blind it was my aunt dorothy chapter viii janet ilchester i was a prisoner captured by fraud and with five shillings and a penny still remaining to me for an assurance of my power to enjoy freedom osric and kiomi did not show themselves on the road they answered none of my shouts she is afraid to look me in the face i said keeping my anger on kiomi harry harry said my aunt they must have seen me here do you grieve and you have me dear her eager brown eyes devoured me while i stood panting to be happy if only i might fling my money at kiomis feet and tell her there take all i have i hate you one minute i was curiously perusing the soft shade of a moustache on my aunts upper lip the next we jumped into the carriage and she was my dear aunt dorothy again and the world began rolling another way the gipsies had made an appointment to deliver me over to my aunt farmer eckerthy had spoken of me to my grandfather the tramp had fetched mr rippenger on the scene rippenger paid the tramp i dare say my grandfather paid rippengers bill and for saddlebanks goose my aunt paid the gipsies and i think it doubtful that they handed the tramp a share so he came to the end of his list of benefits from not asking questions i returned to riversley more of a man than most boys of my age and more of a child a small child would not have sulked as i did at kiomis behaviour but i met my grandfathers ridiculous politeness with a mans indifference so youre back sir are you i am sir ran like a hare stead of a fox eh i didnt run like either sir do you ride yes sir a horse that was his greeting and how i took it i had not run away from him so i had a quiet conscience he said shortly after look here your name is harry richmond in my housedo you understand my servants have orders to call you master harry richmond according to your christening you were born here sir you will please to recollect ill have no vagabond names herehe puffed himself hot muttering nor vagabond airs neither i knew very well what it meant a sore spirit on my fathers behalf kept me alive to any insult of him and feeling that we were immeasurably superior to the beltham blood i merely said apart to old sewis shrugging my shoulders the squire expects me to recollect where i was born im not likely to forget his nonsense sewis in reply counselled me to direct a great deal of my attention to the stables and drink claret with the squire in the evening things so little difficult to do that i moralized reflectively here s a way of gaining a relatives affection the squires punctilious regard for payments impressed me it is true he had saved me from the disgrace of owing money to my detested schoolmaster and besides i was under his roof eating of his bread my late adventurous life taught me that i incurred an obligation by it kiomi was the sole victim of my anger that really seemed to lie down to be trampled on as she deserved for her unpardonable treachery by degrees my grandfather got used to me and commenced saying in approval of certain of my performances theres beltham in thatbeltham in that once out hunting i took a nasty hedge and ditch in front of him he bawled proudly beltham all over and praised me at night drinking claret he said on a sudden and egad harry you must jump your head across hedges and ditches my little fellow it wont do in these confounded days to have you clever all at the wrong end in my time good in the saddle was good for everything but now you must get your brains where you canpick here pick thereand sell em like a huckster some do natures goneits damned artifice rules i tell ye and a squire of our country must be three parts lawyer to keep his own you must learn by god sir you must cogitate you must stew at books and maps or youll have some infernal upstart taking the lead of you and leaving you nothing but the whiff of his tail he concluded im glad to see you toss down your claret my boy thus i grew in his favour till i heard from him that i was to be the heir of riversley and his estates but on one condition which he did not then mention if i might have spoken to him of my father i should have loved him as it was i liked old sewis better for he would talk to me of the night when my father carried me away and though he never uttered the flattering words i longed to hear he repeated the story often and made the red hall glow with beams of my fathers image my walks and rides were divided between the road he must have followed toward london bearing me in his arms and the vacant place of kiomis camp kiomi stood for freedom pointing into the darkness i wished to penetrate that i might find him if i spoke of him to my aunt she trembled she said yes harry tell me all you are thinking about whatever you want to know but her excessive trembling checked me and i kept my feelings to myselfa boy with a puzzle in his head and hunger in his heart at times i rode out to the utmost limit of the hour giving me the proper number of minutes to race back and dress for dinner at the squires table and a great wrestling i had with myself to turn my little horses head from hills and valleys lying east they seemed to have the secret of my father blank enough they looked if ever i despaired of their knowing more than i my winter and summer were the moods of my mind constantly shifting i would have a week of the belief that he was near riversley calling for me a week of the fear that he was dead long dreams of him as travelling through foreign countries patting the foreheads of boys and girls on his way or driving radiantly and people bowing radiantly i say had there been touches of colour in these visions i should have been lured off in pursuit of him the dreams passed colourlessly i put colouring touches to the figures seen in them afterward when i was cooler and could say what is the use of fancying things yet knew that fancying things was a consolation by such means i came to paint the mystery surrounding my father in tender colours i built up a fretted cathedral from what i imagined of him and could pass entirely away out of the world by entering the doors want of boys society as well as hard headwork produced this mischief my lessons were intermittent resident tutors arrived to instruct me one after another they were clergymen and they soon proposed to marry my aunt dorothy or they rebuked the squire for swearing the devil was in the parsons he said in his time they were modest creatures and stuck to the bottle and heaven my aunt was of the opinion of our neighbours who sent their boys to school and thought i should be sent likewise no no said the squire my lifes short when the gouts marching up to my middle and ill see as much of my heir as i can why the lads my daughters son he shall grow up among his tenantry well beat the country and start a man at last to drive his yard of learning into him without rolling sheeps eyes right and left unfortunately the squires description of man was not started my aunt was handsome an heiress that is she had money of her own coming from her mothers side of the family and the tenderest woman alive with a voice sweeter than flutes there was a saying in the county that to marry a beltham you must pochay her a greataunt of mine the squires sister had been carried off she died childless a favourite young cousin of his likewise had run away with a poor baronet sir roderick ilchester whose son charles was now and then our playmate and was a scapegrace but for me he would have been selected by the squire for his heir he said and he often confounded me to my face on that account as he shook my hand breaking out id as lief fetch you a cuff o the head harry richmond upon my honour and cursing at his luck for having to study for his living and be what he called a sloppy curate now that i had come to riversley for good he informed me that i should have to marry his sister janet for that they could not allow the money to go out of the family janet ilchester was a quaint girl a favourite of my aunt dorothy and the squires especial pet redcheeked with a good upright figure in walking and riding and willing to be friendly but we always quarrelled she detested hearing of kiomi dont talk of creatures you met when you were a beggar harry richmond she said i never was a beggar i replied then she was a beggar said janet and i could not deny it though the only difference i saw between janet and kiomi was that janet continually begged favours and gifts of people she knew and kiomi of people who were strangers my allowance of pocketmoney from the squire was fifty pounds a year i might have spent it all in satisfying janets wishes for ridingwhips knives pencilcases cairngorm buttons and dogs a large part of the money went that way she was always getting notice of fine dogs for sale i bought a mastiff for her a brown retriever and a little terrier she was permitted to keep the terrier at home but i had to take care of the mastiff and retriever when janet came to look at them she called them by their names of course they followed me in preference to her she cried with jealousy we had a downright quarrel lady ilchester invited me to spend a day at her house charley being home for his midsummer holidays charley janet and i fished the river for trout and janet to flatter me of which i was quite aware while i dressed her rod as if she was likely to catch something talked of heriot and then said oh dear we are good friends arent we charley says we shall marry one another some day but mamas such a proud woman she wont much like your having such a father as you ve got unless he s dead by that time and i neednt go up to him to be kissed i stared at the girl in wonderment but not too angrily for i guessed that she was merely repeating her brothers candid speculations upon the future i said now mind what i tell you janet i forgive you this once for you are an ignorant little girl and know no better speak respectfully of my father or you never see me again here charley sang out hulloa you dont mean to say youre talking of your father janet whimpered that i had called her an ignorant little girl if she had been silent i should have pardoned her the meanness of the girl in turning on me when the glaring offence was hers struck me as contemptible beyond words charley and i met half way he advised me not to talk to his sister of my father they all knew he said that it was no fault of mine and for his part had he a rascal for a father he should pension him and cut him to tell the truth no objection against me existed in his family except on the score of the sort of father i owned to and i had better make up my mind to shake him off before i grew a man he spoke as a friend i might frown at him and clench my fists but he did speak as a friend janet all the while was nibbling a biscuit glancing over it at me with mouseeyes her short frock and her greediness contrasting with the talk of my marrying her filled me with renewed scorn though my heart was sick at the mention of my father i asked her what she knew of him she nibbled her biscuit mumbling he went to riversley pretending he was a singingmaster i know thats true and more oh and a drawingmaster and a professor of legerdemain added her brother expunge him old fellow hes no good no im sure hes no good said janet i took her hand and told her you dont know how you hurt me but youre a child you dont know anything about the world i love my father remember that and what you want me to do is mean and disgraceful but you dont know better i would forfeit everything in the world for him and when youre of age to marry marry anybody you likeyou wont marry me and goodbye janet think of learning your lessons and not of marrying i cant help laughing so i said but without the laughter her brother tried hard to get me to notice him janet betook herself to the squire her prattle of our marriage in days to come was excuseable it was the squires notion he used to remark generally that he liked to see things look safe and fast and he had as my aunt confided to me arranged with lady ilchester in the girls hearing that we should make a match my grandfather pledged his word to janet that he would restore us to an amicable footing he thought it a light task invitations were sent out to a large party at riversley and janet came with all my gifts on her dress or in her pockets the squire led the company to the gates of his stables the gates opened and a beautiful pony with a sidesaddle on was trotted forth amid cries of admiration then the squire put the bridlereins in my hands bidding me present it myself i asked the name of the person he pointed at janet i presented the pony to janet and said its from the squire she forgot in her delight our being at variance no no you stupid harry im to thank you hes a darling pony i want to kiss you i retired promptly but the squire had heard her back sir he shouted swearing by this and that you slink from a kiss and youre beltham blood back to her lad take it up with her in your arms or down on your knees take it manfully somehow see there she s got it ready for you ive got a letter ready for you harry to sayoh so sorry for offending you janet whispered when i reached the ponys head and if youd rather not be kissed before people then byandby but do shake hands pull the ponys mane said i that will do as well observei pull and now you pull janet mechanically followed my actions she grimaced and whimpered i could pull the ponys mane right out dont treat animals like your dolls said i she ran to the squire and refused the pony the squires face changed from merry to black young man he addressed me dont show that worse half of yours in genteel society or by the lord you wont carry beltham buttons for long this young lady mind you is a lady by birth both sides she thinks she is marriageable said i and walked away leaving loud laughter behind me but laughter did not console me for the public aspersion of him i loved i walked off the grounds and thought to myself it was quite time i should be moving wherever i stayed for any length of time i was certain to hear abuse of my father why not wander over the country with kiomi go to sea mount the andes enlist in a prussian regiment and hear the soldiers tell tales of frederick the great i walked over kiomis heath till dark when one of our grooms on horseback overtook me saying that the squire begged me to jump on the horse and ride home as quick as possible two other lads and the coachman were out scouring the country to find me and the squire was anxious it appeared i rode home like a wounded man made to feel proud by victory but with no one to stop the bleeding of his wounds and the more my pride rose the more i suffered pain there at home sat my grandfather dejected telling me that the loss of me a second time would kill him begging me to overlook his roughness calling me his little harry and his heir his bravespirited boy yet i was too sure that a word of my father to him would have brought him very near another ejaculation concerning beltham buttons youre a fiery young fellow i suspect he said when he had recovered his natural temper i like you for it plucks beltham have a will of your own sweat out the bad blood here drink my health harry youre three parts beltham at least and itll go hard if youre not all beltham before i die old blood always wins that race i swear we re the oldest in the county damn the mixing my father never let any of his daughters marry if he could help it norll i bar rascals heres to you young squire beltham harry lepel belthamdoes that suit ye anon anon as they say in the play take my name and drop the richmond no drop the subject well talk of it byandby so he wrestled to express his hatred of my father without offending me and i studied him coldly thinking that the sight of my father in beggars clothes raising a hand for me to follow his steps would draw me forth though riversley should beseech me to remain clad in wealth chapter ix an evening with captain bulsted a dream that my father lay like a wax figure in a bed gave me thoughts of dying i was ill and did not know it and imagined that my despair at the foot of the stairs of ever reaching my room to lie down peacefully was the sign of death my aunt dorothy nursed me for a week none but she and my dogs entered the room i had only two faint wishes left in me one that the squire should be kept out of my sight the other that she would speak to me of my mothers love for my father she happened to say musing harry you have your mothers heart i said no my fathers from that we opened a conversation the sweetest i had ever had away from him though she spoke shyly and told me very little it was enough for me in the narrow world of my dogs faces and the redleaved creeper at the window the firtrees on the distant heath and her hand clasping mine my father had many faults she said but he had been cruelly used or deceived and he bore a grievous burden and then she said yes and yes and yes in the voice one supposes of a ghost retiring to my questions of his merits i was refreshed and satisfied like the parched earth with dews when it gets no rain and i was soon well when i walked among the household again i found that my week of seclusion had endowed me with a singular gift i found that i could see through everybody looking at the squire i thought to myself my father has faults but he has been cruelly used and immediately i forgave the old man his antipathy to my father seemed a craze and to account for it i lay in wait for his numerous illogical acts and words and smiled visibly in contemplation of his rough unreasonable nature and of my magnanimity he caught the smile and interpreted it grinning at me harry have i made a slip in my grammar eh who could feel any further sensitiveness at his fits of irritation reading him as i did i saw through my aunt she was always in dread of a renewal of our conversation i could see her ideas flutter like birds to escape me and i penetrated the others who came in my way just as unerringly farmer eckerthy would acknowledge astonished his mind was running on cricket when i taxed him with it crops was the cartload of my thoughts master harry but there was a bit o cricket in it too neer a doubt my aunts maid davis was shocked by my discernment of the fact that she was in love and it was useless for her to pretend the contrary for i had seen her granting tender liberties to lady ilchesters footman old sewis said gravely youve been to the witches master harry and others were sure i had got it from the gipsies off the common the maids were partly incredulous but i perceived that they disbelieved as readily as they believed with my latest tutor the rev simon hart i was not sufficiently familiar to offer him proofs of my extraordinary power so i begged favours of him and laid hothouse flowers on his table in the name of my aunt and had the gratification of seeing him blush his approval of my latin exercise was verbal and weak praise in comparison besides i cared nothing for praises not referring to my grand natural accomplishment and my father now is thinking of me that was easy to imagine but the certainty of it confirmed me in my conceit how can you tellhow is it possible for you to know peoples thoughts said janet ilchester whose head was as open to me as a hat she pretended to be rather more frightened of me than she was and now you think you are flattering me i said she looked nervous and now youre asking yourself what you can do better than i can she said go on i stopped she charged me with being pulled up short i denied it guess guess said she you cant my reply petrified her you were thinking that you are a lady by birth on both sides at first she refused to admit it no it wasnt that harry it wasnt really i was thinking how clever you are yes after not before no harry but you are clever i wish i was half as clever fancy reading peoples ideas i can read my ponys but thats different i know by his ears and as for my being a lady of course i am and so are youi mean a gentleman i was thinkingnow this is really what i was thinkingi wished your father lived near that we might all be friends i cant bear the squire when he talks and you quite as good as me and better dont shake me off harry i shook her in the gentlest manner not suspecting that she had read my feelings fully as well as i her thoughts janet and i fell to talking of my father incessantly and were constantly together the squire caught one of my smiles rising when he applauded himself lustily for the original idea of matching us but the idea was no longer distasteful to me it appeared to me that if i must some day be married a wife who would enjoy my narratives and travel over the four quarters of the globe as janet promised to do in search of him i loved would be the preferable person i swore her to secresy she was not to tell her brother charley the subject we conversed on oh dear no said she and told him straightway charley home for his winter holidays blurted out at the squires table so harry richmond youre the cleverest fellow in the world are you theres janet telling everybody your fathers the cleverest next to you and shes never seen him how hulloa what s that sang out the squire charley was speaking of my father sir i said preparing for thunder we all rose the squire looked as though an apoplectic seizure were coming on dont sit at my table again he said after a terrible struggle to be articulate his hand was stretched at me i swung round to depart no no not you that fellow he called getting his arm level toward charley i tried to intercedethe last who should have done it you like to hear him eh said the squire i was ready to say that i did but my aunt whose courage was up when occasion summoned it hushed the scene by passing the decanter to the squire and speaking to him in a low voice biters bit ive dished myself thats clear said charley and he spoke the truth and such was his frankness that i forgave him he and janet were staying at riversley they left next morning for the squire would not speak to him nor i to janet i ll tell you what there s no doubt about one thing said charley janets rightsome of those girls are tremendously deep youre about the cleverest fellow ive ever met in my life i thought of working into the squire in a sort of collateral manner you know a cornetcy in the dragoon guards in a year or two i thought the squire might do that for me without much damaging youperhaps a couple of hundred a year just to reconcile me to a nose out of joint for upon my honour the squire spoke of making me his heiror words to that effect neatly conjugated before you came back and rather than be a curate like that reverend hart of yours who hands raisins and almonds and orangeflower biscuits to your aunt the way of all the reverends who drop down on riversleyi d betray my bosom friend im regularly hoist on my own petard as they say in the newspapers im a curate and no mistake you did it with a turn of the wrist without striking out and i like neat boxing i bear no malice when im floored neatly five minutes after he had spoken it would have been impossible for me to tell him that my simplicity and not my cleverness had caused his overthrow from this i learnt that simplicity is the keenest weapon and a beautiful refinement of cleverness and i affected it extremely i pushed it so far that i could make the squire dance in his seat with suppressed fury and jealousy at my way of talking of venice and other continental cities which he knew i must have visited in my fathers society and though he raged at me and pshawed the continent to the deuce he was ready out of sheer rivalry to grant anything i pleased to covet at every stage of my growth one or another of my passions was alert to twist me awry and now i was getting a false self about me and becoming liker to the creature people supposed me to be despising them for blockheads in my heart as boys may who preserve a last trace of the ingenuousness denied to seasoned men happily my aunt wrote to mr rippenger for the address of little gus temples father to invite my schoolfellow to stay a month at riversley temple came everybody liked him as for me my delight was unbounded and in spite of a feeling of superiority due to my penetrative capacity and the suspicion it originated that temple might be acting the plain well bred schoolboy he was i soon preferred his pattern to my own he confessed he had found me changed at first his father it appeared was working him as hard at latin as mr hart worked me and he sat down beside me under my tutor and stumbled at tacitus after his fluent cicero i offered excuses for him to mr hart saying he would soon prove himself the better scholar theres my old richie said temple fondling me on the shoulder and my nonsensical airs fell away from me at once we roamed the neighbourhood talking old schooldays over visiting houses hunting and dancing declaring every day we would write for heriot to join us instead of which we wrote a valentine to julia rippenger and despatched a companion one composed in a very different spirit to her father lady ilchester did us the favour to draw a sea monster an andromeda and a perseus in the shape of a flying british hussar for julias valentine it seemed to us so successful that we scattered halfadozen over the neighbourhood and rode round it on the morning of st valentines day to see the effect of them meeting the postman on the road he gave me two for myself one was transparently from janet a provoking counterstroke of mine to her but when i opened the other my heart began beating the standard of great britain was painted in colours at the top down each side encricled in laurels were kings and queens of england with their sceptres and in the middle i read the initials a fg r r embedded in blue forgetmehots i could not doubt it was from my father riding out in the open air as i received it i could fancy in my hot joy that it had dropped out of heaven hes alive i shall have him with me i shall have him with me soon i cried to temple oh why cant i answer him where is he what address lets ride to london dont you understand temple this letters from my father he knows im here ill find him never mind what happens yes but said temple if he knows where you are and you dont know where he is theres no good in your going off adventuring if a fellow wants to be hit the best thing he can do is to stop still struck by the perspicacity of his views i turned homeward temple had been previously warned by me to avoid speaking of my father at riversley but i was now in such a boiling state of happiness believing that my father would certainly appear as he had done at dipwell farm brilliant and cheerful to bear me away to new scenes and his own dear society that i tossed the valentine to my aunt across the breakfasttable laughing and telling her to guess the name of the sender my aunt flushed miss bannerbridge she said a stranger was present the squire introduced us my grandson harry richmond captain william bulsted frigate polyphemus captain bulsted master augustus temple for the sake of conversation temple asked him if his ship was fully manned all but a mate said the captain i knew him by reputation as the brother of squire gregory bulsted of bulsted notorious for his attachment to my aunt and laughingstock of the county so youve got a valentine the captain addressed me i went on shore at rio last year on this very day of the month just as lively as you youngsters for one saltwater keeps a mans youth in pickle no valentine for me paid off my ship yesterday at spithead and here i am again on valentines day temple and i stared hard at a big man with a bronzed skin and a rubicund laugh who expected to receive valentines my aunt thrust the letter back to me secretly it must be from a lady said she why whod have a valentine from any but a lady exclaimed the captain the squire winked at me to watch his guest captain bulsted fed heartily he was thoroughly a sailorgentleman between the old school and the new and as i perceived as far gone in love with my aunt as his brother was presently sewis entered carrying a foaming tankard of old ale and he and the captain exchanged a word or two upon jamaica now when youve finished that washy tea of yours take a draught of our october brewed here long before you were a lieutenant captain said the squire thank you sir the captain replied i know that ale a moment and i will gladly i wish to preserve my faculties i dont wish to have it supposed that i speak under fermenting influences sewis hold by if you please my aunt made an effort to retire no no fair play stay said the squire trying to frown but twinkling my aunt tried to smile and sat as if on springs miss beltham the captain bowed to her and to each one as he spoke squire beltham mr harry richmond mr temple my ship was paid off yesterday and till a captains ship is paid off he s not his own master you are aware if you think my behaviour calls for comment reflect i beseech you on the nature of a sailors life a threeyears cruise in a cabin is pretty much equivalent to the same amount of time spent in a coffin i can assure you with the difference that youre hard at work thinking all the time like thehum ay he thinks hard enough the squire struck in pardon me sir like thehumplumbline on a leeshore i meant to observe this is now the thirdthe fourth occasion on which i have practised the observance of paying my first visit to riversley to know my fate that i might not have it on my conscience that i had missed a day a minute as soon as i was a free man on english terra firma my brother greg and i were brought up in close association with riversley one of the beauties of riversley we lost one was left and we both tried our luck with her honourably in turn each of us nothing underhand above board on the quarterdeck before all the company i ll say it of my brother i can say it of myself gregs chances i need not remark are superior to mine he is always in port if he wins then i tell him god bless you my boy youve won the finest woman the handsomest and the best in or out of christendom but my chance is my property though it may be value only one farthing coin of the realm and there is always pity for poor sinners in the female bosom miss beltham i trespass on your kind attention if i am to remain a bachelor and you a maiden lady why the will of heaven be done if you marry another never mind who the man theres my stock to the fruit of the union never mind what the sex but if you will have one so unworthy of you as me my hand and heart are at your feet maam as i have lost no time in coming to tell you so captain bulsted concluded our eyes were directed on my aunt the squire bade her to speak out for she had his sanction to act according to her judgement and liking she said with a gracefulness that gave me a little aching of pity for the poor captain i am deeply honoured by you captain bulsted but it is not my intention to marry the captain stood up and bowing humbly replied i am ever your servant maam my aunt quitted the room now for the tankard sewis said the captain gradually the bottom of the great tankard turned up to the ceiling he drank to the last drop in it the squire asked him whether he found consolation in that the captain sighed prodigiously and said it s a commencement sir egad its a commencement d be something like a final end to any dozen of our fellows round about here ill tell you what if stout stomachs gained the day in loveaffairs i suspect youd run a good race against the male half of our county william and a damned good test of a mans metal i say it is what are you going to do today i am going to get drunk sir well you might do worse then stop here william and give my old port the preference no tongue in the morning i promise you and pleasant dreams at night the captain thanked him cordially but declined saying that he would rather make a beast of himself in another place the squire vainly pressed his hospitality by assuring him of perfect secresy on our part as regarded my aunt and offering him sewis and one of the footmen to lift him to bed you are very good squire said the captain nothing but a sense of duty restrains me i am bound to convey the information to my brother that the coast is clear for him well then fall light and forard said the squire shaking him by the hand forty years ago a gentleman a baronet had fallen on the back of his head and never recovered ay ay launch stern foremost if you like said the captain nodding no no i dont go into port pulled by the tail my word for it squire and good day to you sir no ill will about this bothering lovebusiness of yours william on my soul sir i cherish none temple and i followed him out of the house fascinated by his manners and oddness he invited us to jump into the chariot beside him we were witnesses of the meeting between him and his brother a little sniffling man as like the captain as a withered nut is like a milky one same luck william said squire gregory not a point of change in the wind greg said the captain they wrenched hands thereupon like two carpetshakers with a report and much in a similar attitude these young gentlemen will testify to you solemnly greg that i took no unfair advantage said the captain no whispering in passages no appointments in gardens no letters i spoke out bravely man and now greg referring to the state of your cellar our young friends here mean to float with us tonight it is now halfpast eleven am your dinnerhour the same as usual of course therefore at four pm the hour of execution and come greg you and i will visit the cellar a dozen and half of light and halfadozen of the old familythat will be about the number of bottles to give me my quietus and you yoursall of us and you young gentlemen take your guns or your rods and back and be dressed by the four bell or you ll not find the same man in billy bulsted temple was enraptured with him he declared he had been thinking seriously for a long time of entering the navy and his admiration of the captain must have given him an intuition of his character for he persuaded me to send to riversley for our eveningdress clothes appearing in which at the dinnertable we received the captains compliments as being gentlemen who knew how to attire ourselves to suit an occasion the occasion squire gregory said happened to him too often for him to distinguish it by the cut of his coat i observe nevertheless greg that you have a black tie round your neck instead of a red one said the captain then it came there by accident said squire gregory accident theres no such thing as accident if i wander out of the house with a half dozen or so in me and topple into the brook am i accidentally drowned if a squall upsets my ship is she an accidental residue of spars and timber and old iron if a woman refuses me is that an accident theres a cause for every disaster too much cargo want of foresight want of pluck pooh when im hauled prisoner into a foreign port in time of war you may talk of accidents mr harry richmond mr temple i have the accidental happiness of drinking to your healths in a tumbler of hock wine nominative hic haec hoc squire gregory carried on the declension not without pride the vocative confused him claret will do for the vocative said the captain gravely the more so as there is plenty of it at your table greg ablative hoc hac hoc which sounds as if the gentleman had become incapable of speech beyond the name of his wine so we will abandon the declension of the article for a dash of champagne which theres no declining i hope wonderful men those romans they fought their ships well too a question to you greg those heathen pagan dogs had a religion that encouraged them to swear now my experience of life pronounces it to be a human necessity to rap out an oath here and there what do you say squire gregory said drinking and no thinking at dinner william the captain pledged him i ll take the opportunity as were not on board ship of drinking to you sir now temple addressed the captain whose face was resplendent and he bowed and drank and said as we are not on board ship i like you temple thanked him for the compliment no compliment my lad you see me in my weakness and you have the discernment to know me for something better than i seem you promise to respect me on my own quarterdeck you are of the right stuff do i speak correctly mr harry temple is my dear friend i replied and he would not be so if not of the right stuff good that s a way of putting much in little by jove a royal style and harrys a royal fellow said temple we all drank to one another the captains eyes scrutinized me speculatingly this boy might have been yours or mine greg i heard him say in a faltering rough tone they forgot the presence of temple and me but spoke as if they thought they were whispering the captain assured his brother that squire beltham had given him as much fair play as one who holds a balance squire gregory doubted it and sipped and kept his nose at his wineglass crabbedly repeating his doubts of it the captain then remarked that doubting it his conscience permitted him to use stratagems though he the captain not doubting it had no such permission i count i run away with her every night of my life said squire gregory nothing comes of it but empty bottles court her serenade her said the captain blockade the port lay siege to the citadel id give a year of service for your chances greg half a word from her and you have your horses ready shes past pochaises squire gregory sighed shes to be won by a bold stroke brother greg oh lord no shes past pochaises humph its come to be halfbottle halfbeauty with your worship greg i suspect no i tell you william shes got her mind on that fellow you cant pochay her after he jilted her for her sister wrong greg wrong you are muddled she has a fright about matrimonya common thing at her age i am told wheres the man in the bench of course whered you have him i sir if i knew my worst enemy to be there id send him six dozen of the best in my cellar temple shot a walnut at me i pretended to be meditating carelessly and i had the heat and roar of a conflagration round my head presently the captain said are you sure the mans in the bench cock squire gregory replied he had money from his wife and he had the wheels to make it go here they whispered in earnest oh the billings were as rich as the belthams said the captain aloud pretty nigh william thats our curse greg money settled on their male issue and money in hand by the lord weve always had the look of a pair of highwaymen lurking for purses when it was the woman the woman penniless naked mean destitute nothing but the woman we wanted and there was one apiece for us greg old boy when will the old county show such another couple of beauties greg sir youre not half a man or youd have carried her with your opportunities the fellows in the bench you say how are you cocksure of that mr greg company was the answer and the captain turned to temple and me apologizing profusely for talking over family matters with his brother after a separation of three years i had guessed but hastily at the subject of their conversation until they mentioned the billings the family of my maternal grandmother the name was like a tongue of fire shooting up in a cloud of smoke i saw at once that the man in the bench must be my father though what the bench was exactly and where it was i had no idea and as i was left to imagination i became as usual childish in my notions and brooded upon thoughts of the man in the iron mask things i dared not breathe to temple of whose manly sense i stood in awe when under these distracting influences remember our feast in the combe i sang across the table to him never forget it said he and we repeated the tale of the goose at rippengers school to our entertainers making them laugh and next morning richie ran off with a gipsy girl said temple and i composed a narrative of my wanderings with kiomi much more amusing than the real one the captain vowed he would like to have us both on board his ship but that times were too bad for him to offer us a prospect of promotion spin round the decanters said he nows the hour for them to go like a hummingtop and each man lend a hand whip hard my lads its once in three years hurrah and the cause is a cruel woman toast her but no name heres to the nameless fair for its not my intention to marry says she and maam im a man of honour or id catch you tight my nutbrown maid and clap you into a cage fallal like a squirrel to trot the wheel of mattrimony shame to the first man down that wont be i said temple be me sir me the captain corrected his grammar pardon me captain bulsted the verb to be governs the nominative case in our climate said temple then im nominative hic i say sir im in the tropics mr tem mr tempus point of honour not forget a mans name rippenger your schoolmaster mr rippenger youve knocked some knowledge into this young gentleman temple and i took counsel together hastily we cried in a breath here s to julia rippenger the prettiest nicest girl living and we drank to her julia the captain echoed us i join your toast gentlemen mr richmond mr tempusjulia by all thats holy she floats a sinking ship julia consoles me for the fairest cruellest woman alive a rough sailor julia at your feet the captain fell commendably forward squire gregory had already dropped temple and i tried to meet but did not accomplish it till next morning at breakfast a couple of footmen carried us each upstairs in turn as if they were removing furniture out of this strange evening came my discovery of my father and the captains winning of a wife chapter x an expedition i wondered audibly where the bench was when temple and i sat together alone at squire gregorys breakfasttable next morning very thirsty for tea he said it was a place in london but did not add the sort of place only that i should soon be coming to london with him and i remarked shall i and smiled at him as if in a fit of careless affection then he talked runningly of the theatres and pantomimes and londons charms the fear i had of this bench made me passingly conscious of temples delicacy in not repeating its name though why i feared it there was nothing to tell me i must have dreamed of it just before waking and i burned for reasonable information concerning it temple respected my father too much to speak out the extent of his knowledge on the subject so we drank our tea with the grandeur of london for our theme where temple assured me you never had a headache after a carouse overnight a communication that led me to think the country a far less favourable place of abode for gentlemen we quitted the house without seeing our host or the captain and greatly admired by the footmen the maids and the grooms for having drunk their masters under the table which it could not be doubted that we had done as temple modestly observed while we sauntered off the grounds under the eyes of the establishment we had done it fairly too with none of those jack the giantkiller tricks my grandfather accused us of the squire would not and he could not believe our story until he heard the confession from the mouth of the captain after that he said we were men and heroes and he tipped us both much to janet ilchesters advantage for the squire was a royal giver and temples money had already begun to take the same road as mine temple in fact was falling desperately in love for this reason he shrank from quitting riversley i perceived it as clearly as a thing seen through a windowpane he was always meditating upon dogs and what might be the price of this dog or that and whether lapdogs were good travellers the fashionable value of pugs filled him with a sort of despair my goodness he used an exclamation more suitable to women forty or fifty pounds you say one costs richie i pretended to estimate the probable cost of one yes about that but ill buy you one one day or other temple the dear little fellow coloured hot he was too much in earnest to laugh at the absurdity of his being supposed to want a pug for himself and walked round me throwing himself into attitudes with shrugs and loud breathings i dont dont think that i i care for nothing but newfoundlands and mastiffs said he he went on shrugging and kicking up his heels girls like pugs i remarked i fancy they do said temple with a snort of indifference then i suggested a pocketknife for the huntingfield is a very good thing do you think so was temples rejoinder and i saw he was dreadfully afraid of my speaking the persons name for whom it would be such a very good thing you can get one for thirty shillings well get one when were in london theyre just as useful for women as they are for us you know why of course they are if they hunt said temple and we mustnt lose time i drew him to the point i had at heart for hunting ll soon be over it s february mind oh lots of time temple cried out and on every occasion when i tried to make him understand that i was bursting to visit london he kept evading me simply because he hated saying goodbye to janet ilchester his dulness of apprehension in not perceiving that i could not commit a breach of hospitality by begging him downright to start struck me as extraordinary and i was so acute i saw every single idea in his head every shift of his mind and how he half knew that he profited by my shunning to say flatly i desired to set out upon the discovery of the bench he took the benefit of my shamefacedness for which i daily punished his i really felt that i was justified in giving my irritability an airing by curious allusions to janet yet though i made him wince it was impossible to touch his conscience he admitted to having repeatedly spoken of londons charms and oh yes you and ill go back together richie and saying that satisfied him he doubled our engagements with janet that afternoon and it was a riding party a dancingparty and a drawing of a pond for carp and we over to janet and janet over to us until i grew so sick of her i was incapable of summoning a spark of jealousy in order the better to torture temple now he was a quickwitted boy well i one day heard janet address my big dog ajax in the style she usually employed to inform her hearers and especially the proprietor that she coveted a thing oh you own dear precious pet darling beauty if i might only feed you every day of my life i should be happy i curtsey to him every time i see him if i were his master the men should all off hats and the women all curtsey to emperor ajax my dog my own my great dear irresistible love then she nodded at me i would make them though and then at temple you see if i wouldnt ajax was a source of pride to me however i heard temple murmur in a tone totally unlike himself he would be a great protection to you and i said to him you know temple i shall be going to london tomorrow or the next day not later i dont know when i shall be back i wish you would dispose of the dog just as you like get him a kind master or mistress thats all i sacrificed my dog to bring temple to his senses i thought it would touch him to see how much i could sacrifice just to get an excuse for begging him to start he did not even thank me ajax soon wore one of janets collars like two or three other of the riversley dogs and i had the satisfaction of hearing temple accept my grandfathers invitation for a further fortnight and meanwhile i was the one who was charged with going about looking lovelorn i smothered my feelings and my reflections on the wisdom of people at last my aunt dorothy found the means of setting me at liberty on the road to london we had related to her how captain bulsted toasted julia rippenger and we had both declared in joke that we were sure the captain wished to be introduced to her my aunt reserved her ideas on the subject but byandby she proposed to us to ride over to julia and engage her to come and stay at riversley for some days kissing me my aunt said she was my harrys friend when he was an outcast the words revived my affection for julia strong in the sacred sense of gratitude i turned on temple reproaching him with selfish forgetfulness of her good heart and pretty face without defending himself as he might have done he entreated me to postpone our journey for a day he and janet had some appointment here was given me a noble cause and matter i need not shrink from speaking of i lashed temple in my aunts presence with a rod of real eloquence that astonished her and him and myself too and as he had a sense of guilt not quite explicable in his mind he consented to bear what was in reality my burden for julia had distinguished me and not him with all the signs of affection and of the two i had the more thoroughly forgotten her i believe temple was first in toasting her at squire gregorys table there is nothing like a pent up secret of the heart for accumulating powers of speech i mean in youth the mental distilling process sets in later and then you have irony instead of eloquence from brooding on my father and not daring to mention his name lest i should hear evil of it my thoughts were a proud family proud of their origin proud of their isolationand not to be able to divine them was for the world to confess itself basely beneath their level but when they did pour out they were tremendous as temple found this oratorical display of mine gave me an ascendancy over him he adored eloquence not to say grandiloquence he was the son of a barrister let s go and see her at once richie he said of julia i m ready to be off as soon as you like im ready to do anything that will please you which was untrue but it was useless to tell him so i sighed at my sad gift of penetration and tossed the fresh example of it into the treasury of vanity temple said i dissembling a little i tell you candidly you wont please me by doing anything disagreeable to you a dog pulled by the collar is not much of a companion i start for julia tomorrow before daylight if you like your bed best stop there and mind you amuse janet for me duing my absence im not going to let any one make comparisons between us temple muttered he dropped dozens of similar remarks and sometimes talked downright flattery i had so deeply impressed him we breakfasted by candlelight and rode away on a frosty foggy morning keeping our groom fifty yards to the rear a laughable sight with both his coatpockets bulging a couple of riversley turnover pasties in one and a bottle of champagne in the other for our lunch on the road now and then when near him we galloped for the fun of seeing him nurse the bottlepocket he was generally invisible temple did not think it strange that we should be riding out in an unknown world with only a little ring half a stonesthrow clear around us and blots of copse and queer vanishing cottages and hard grey meadows firtrees wonderfully magnified and larches and birches rigged like fairy ships all starting up to us as we passed and melting instantly one could have fancied the firtrees black torches and here the shoulder of a hill invited us to race up to the ridge some way on we came to crossroads careless of our luck in hitting the right one yonder hung a village church in the air and churchsteeple piercing ever so high and out of the heart of the mist leaped a brook and to hear it at one moment and then to have the sharp freezing silence in ones ear was piercingly weird it all tossed the mind in my head like hay on a pitchfork i forgot the existence of everything but what i loved passionatelyand that had no shape was like a wind up on a knoll of firs in the middle of a heath glowing rosy in the frost we dismounted to lunch leaning against the warm saddles temple and i and uberly our groom who reminded me of a certain tramp of my acquaintance in his decided preference of beer to champagne he drank though and sparkled after his draught no sooner were we on horseback againere the flanks of the dear friendly brutes were in any way cool than temple shouted enthusiastically richie we shall do it yet ive been funking but now im sure we shall do it janet said whats the use of my coming over to dine at riversley if harry richmond and you dont come home before ten or eleven oclock i told her wed do it by dinnertime dont you like janet richiethat is if our horses hic haechocks didnt get strained on this hard nominativepluralmasculine of the article road dont you fancy yourself dining with the captain richie dative huic says old squire gregory i like to see him at dinner because he loves the smell of his wine oh its nothing to boast of but we did drink them under the table it cant be denied janet heard of it hulloa you talk of a huntingknife what do you say to a pair of skates here we are in for a frost of six weeks it strikes me a pair of skates this was the champagne in temple in me it did not bubble to speech and i soon drew him on at a pace that rendered conversation impossible uberly shouted after us to spare the horses legs we heard him twice out of the deepening fog i called to temple that he was right we should do it temple hurrahed rather breathlessly at the end of an hour i pulled up at an inn where i left the horses to be groomed and fed and walked away rapidly as if i knew the town temple following me with perfect confidence and indeed i had no intention to deceive him we entered a new station of a railway oh said temple the rest of the way by rail when the railway clerk asked me what place i wanted tickets for london sprang to my mouth promptly in a murmur and taking the tickets i replied to temple the rest of the way by rail uberlys sure to stop at that inn but my heart beat as the carriages slid away with us an affectionate commiseration for temple touched me when i heard him count on our being back at riversley in time to dress for dinner he laughed aloud at the idea of our plumping down on rippengers school getting a holiday for the boys tipping them and then off with julia exactly like two gods of the mythology apollo and mercury i often used to think they had the jolliest lives that ever were lived he said and trying to catch glimpses of the country and musing and singing he continued to feel like one of those blissful gods until wonder at the passage of time supervened amazement when he looked at my watch struck him dumb ten minutes later we were in yellow fog then in brown temple stared at both windows and at me he jumped from his seat and fell on it muttering no nonsense i say but he had accurately recognized londons fog i left him unanswered to bring up all his senses which the railway had outstripped for the contemplation of this fact that we two were in the city of london chapter xi the great fog and the fire at midnight it was london city and the bench was the kernel of it to me i throbbed with excitement though i sat looking out of the windows into the subterranean atmosphere quite still and firm when you think long undividedly of a single object it gathers light and when you draw near it in person the strange thing to your mind is the absence of that light but i approaching it in this dense fog seemed to myself to be only thinking of it a little more warmly than usual and instead of fading it reversed the process and became from light luminous not being able however to imagine the bench a happy place i corrected the excess of brightness and gave its walls a pinetorch glow i set them in the middle of a great square and hung the standard of england drooping over them in a sort of mournful family pride then because i next conceived it a foreign kind of place different altogether from that home growth of ours the tower of london i topped it with a multitude of domes of pumpkin or turban shape resembling the kremlin of moscow which had once leapt up in the eye of winter glowing like a million pinetorches and flung shadows of stretching red horses on the black smokedrift but what was the kremlin that had seen a city perish to this bench where my father languished there was no comparing them for tragic horror and the kremlin had snowfields around it this bench was caught out of sight hemmed in by an atmosphere thick as charon breathed it might as well be underground oh its london temple went on correcting his incorrigible doubts about it he jumped on the platform we had to call out not to lose one another i say richie this is london he said linking his arm in mine you know by the size of the station and besides theres the fog oh its london weve overshot it were positively in london i could spare no sympathy for his feelings and i did not respond to his inquiring looks now that we were here i certainly wished myself away though i would not have retreated and for awhile i was glad of the discomforts besetting me my step was hearty as i led on meditating upon asking some one the direction to the bench presently we had to walk and it was nothing but traversing on a slippery pavement atmospheric circles of black brown and brown red and sometimes a larger circle of pale yellow the colours of old bruised fruits medlars melons and the smell of them nothing is more desolate neither of us knew where we were nor where we were going we struggled through an interminable succession of squalid streets from the one lamp visible to its neighbour in the darkness you might have fancied yourself peering at the head of an old saint on a smoky canvas it was like the painting of light rather than light figures rushed by we saw no faces temple spoke solemnly our dinnerhour at home is halfpast six a streetboy overheard him and chaffed him temple got the worst of it and it did him good for he had the sweetest nature in the world we declined to be attended by linkboys they would have hurt our sense of independence possessed of a sovereign faith that by dint of resolution i should ultimately penetrate to the great square enclosing the bench i walked with the air of one who had the map of london in his eye and could thread it blindfold temple was thereby deceived into thinking that i must somehow have learnt the direction i meant to take and knew my way though at the slightest indication of my halting and glancing round his suspicions began to boil and he was for asking some one the name of the ground we stood on he murmured fellows get lost in london by this time he clearly understood that i had come to london on purpose he could not but be aware of the object of my coming and i was too proud and he still too delicate to allude to it the fog choked us perhaps it took away the sense of hunger by filling us as if we had eaten a dinner of soot we had no craving to eat until long past the dinnerhour in temples house and then i would rather have plunged into a bath and a bed than have been requested to sit at a feast temple too i fancy we knew we were astray without speaking of it temple said i wish we hadnt drunk that champagne it seemed to me years since i had tasted the delicious crushing of the sweet bubbles in my mouth but i did not blame them i was after my father he dear little fellow had no light ahead except his devotion to me he must have had a touch of conscious guilt regarding his recent behaviour enough to hold him from complaining formally he complained of a london without shops and lights wondered how any one could like to come to it in a fog and so forth and again regretted our having drunk champagne in the morning a sort of involuntary whimpering easily forgiven to him for i knew he had a gallant heart i determined as an act of signal condescension to accost the first person we met male or female for temples sake having come to this resolve which was to be an open confession that i had misled him wounding to my pride i hoped eagerly for the hearing of a footfall we were in a labyrinth of dark streets where no one was astir a wretched dog trotted up to us followed at our heels a short distance and left us as if he smelt no luck about us our cajoleries were unavailing to keep that miserable companion sinbad escaped from the pit by tracking a lynx i happened to remark temple would not hear of sinbad oh come were not mussulmen said he i declare richie if i saw a church open id go in and sleep there were you thinking of tracking the dog then beer may be had somewhere we shall have to find an hotel what can the time be i owed it to him to tell him so i climbed a lamppost and spelt out the hour by my watch when i descended we were three a man had his hands on temples shoulders examining his features now speak the man said roughly i was interposing but temple cried all right richie we are two to one the man groaned i asked him what he wanted my son ive lost my son the man replied and walked away and he would give no answer to our questions i caught hold of the lamppost overcome i meant to tell temple in response to the consoling touch of his hand that i hoped the poor man would discover his son but said instead i wish we could see the bench tonight temple exclaimed ah pretending by his tone of voice that we had recently discussed our chance of it and then he ventured to inform me that he imagined he had heard of the place being shut up after a certain hour of the night my heart felt released and gushed with love for him very well temple i said then well wait till tomorrow and strike out for some hotel now off we went at a furious pace saddlebanks goose was reverted to by both of us with an exchange of assurances that we should meet a dish the fellow to it before we slept as for life said i as soon as the sharp pace had fetched my breathing to a regular measure adventures are what i call life temple assented theyre capital if you only see the end of them we talked of ulysses and penelope temple blamed him for leaving calypso i thought ulysses was right otherwise we should have had no slaying of the suitors but temple shyly urged that to have a goddess caring for you and she was handsomer than penelope who must have been an oldish woman was something to make you feel as you do on a hunting morning when there are halfadozen ridinghabits speckling the field a whole glorious day your own among them this view appeared to me very captivating save for an obstruction in my mind which was that goddesses were always conceived by me as statues they talked and they moved it was true but the touch of them was marble and they smiled and frowned but they had no variety they were never warm if i thought that muttered temple puffing at the raw fog he admitted he had thought just the contrary and that the cold had suggested to him the absurdity of leaving a goddess look here temple said i has it never struck you i wont say im like him its true ive always admired ulysses he could fight best talk best and plough and box and how clever he was take him all round who wouldnt rather have had him for a father than achilles and there were just as many women in love with him more said temple well then i continued thanking him in my heart for it must have cost him something to let ulysses be set above achilles telemachus is the one i mean he was in search of his father he found him at last upon my honour temple when i think of it i m ashamed to have waited so long i call that luxury ive lived in senseless yes while i was uncertain whether my father had enough to eat or not i say hush temple breathed in pain at such allusions richie the squire has finished his bottle by about now bottle number two he wont miss us till the morning but miss beltham will shell be at your bedroom door three or four times in the night i know its getting darker and darker we must be in some dreadful part of london the contrast he presented to my sensations between our pleasant home and this foggy solitude gave me a pang of dismay i diverged from my favourite straight line which seemed to pierce into the bowels of the earth sharp to the right soon or late after i cannot tell we were in the midst of a thin stream of people mostly composed of boys and young women going at double time hooting and screaming with the delight of loosened animals not quite so agreeably but animals never hunted on a better scent a dozen turnings in their company brought us in front of a fire there we saw two houses preyed on by the flames just as if a lion had his paws on a couple of human creatures devouring them we heard his jaws the cracking of bones shrieks and the voracious inandout of his breath edged with anger a girl by my side exclaimed its not the bench after all would i have run to see a paltry twostory washerwomans manglingshed flare up when six pennorth of squibs and shavings and a cracker make twice the fun i turned to her hardly able to speak where s the bench if you please she pointed i looked on an immense high wall the blunt flames of the fire opposite threw a sombre glow on it the girl said and dont you go hopping into debt my young cock sparrow or youll know one side o the turnkey better than t other she had a friend with her who chid her for speaking so freely is it too late to go in tonight i asked she answered that it was and that she and her friend were the persons to show me the way in there her friend answered more sensibly yes you cant go in there before some timein the morning i learnt from her that the bench was a debtors prison the saucy girl of the pair asked me for money i handed her a crown piece now wont you give another big bit to my friend said she i had no change and the wellmannered girl bade me never mind the saucy one pressed for it and for a treat she was amusing in her talk of the quantity of different fires she had seen she had also seen accidental death corpses but never a suicide in the act and here she regretted the failure of her experiences this conversation of a goodlooking girl amazed me presently temple cried a third house caught and no engines yet richie theres an old woman in her nightdress we cant stand by the saucy girl joked at the poor halfnaked old woman temple stood humping and agitating his shoulders like a cat before it springs both the girls tried to stop us the one i liked best seized my watch and said leave this to me to take care of and i had no time to wrestle for it i had a glimpse of her face that let me think she was not fooling me the watchchain flew off my neck temple and i clove through the crowd of gapers we got into the heat which was in a minute scorching three men were under the window they had sung out to the old woman above to drop a blanketshe tossed them a waterjug she was saved by the blanket of a neighbour temple and i strained at one corner of it to catch her she came down the men said like a singed turkey the flames illuminated her as she descended there was a great deal of laughter in the crowd but i was shocked temple shared the painful impression produced on me i cannot express my relief when the old woman was wrapped in the blanket which had broken her descent and stood like a blot instead of a figure i handed a sovereign to the three men complimenting them on the humanity of their dispositions they cheered us and the crowd echoed the cheer and temple and i made our way back to the two girls both of us lost our pockethandkerchiefs and temple a penknife as well then the engines arrived and soused the burning houses we were all in a crimson mist boys smoking girls laughing and staring men hallooing hats and caps flying about fights going on people throwing their furniture out of the windows the great wall of the bench was awful in its reflection of the labouring flamesit rose out of sight like the flametops till the columns of water brought them down i thought of my father and of my watch the two girls were not visible a glorious life a firemans said temple the firemen were on the roofs of the houses handsome as greek heroes and it really did look as if they were engaged in slaying an enormous dragon that hissed and tongued at them and writhed its tail paddling its broken big red wings in the pit of wreck and smoke twisting and darkeningsomething fine to conquer i felt with temple a mutual disgust at the inconvenience created by the appropriation of our pockethandkerchiefs by members of the crowd induced us to disentangle ourselves from it without confiding to any one our perplexity for supper and a bed we were now extremely thirsty i had visions of my majority bottles of burgundy lying under john threshers care at dipwell and would have abandoned them all for one on the spot after ranging about the outskirts of the crowd seeking the two girls we walked away not so melancholy but that a draught of porter would have cheered us temple punned on the loss of my watch and excused himself for a joke neither of us had spirit to laugh at just as i was saying with a last glance at the fire anyhow it would have gone in that crowd the nice good girl ran up behind us crying there as she put the watchchain over my head there temple said i didnt i tell you so and temple kindly supposed so the girl said i was afraid id missed you little fellow and youd take me for a thief and thank god im no thief yet i rushed into the crowd to meet you after you caught that old creature and i could have kissed you both youre so brave we always go in for it together said temple i made an offer to the girl of a piece of gold oh im poor she cried yet kept her hand off it like a bird alighting on ground not on prey when i compelled her to feel the money tight she sighed if i wasnt so poor i dont want your gold why are you out so late we informed her of our arrival from the country and wanderings in the fog and youll say youre not tired i know the girl remarked and laughed to hear how correctly she had judged of our temper our thirst and hunger however filled her with concern because of our not being used to it as she was and no place was open to supply our wants her friend the saucy one accompanied by a man evidently a sailor joined us and the three had a consultation away from temple and me at the end of which the sailor whose name was joe raised his leg dancingly and smacked it we gave him our hands to shake and understood without astonishment that we were invited on board his ship to partake of refreshment we should not have been astonished had he said on board his balloon down through thick fog of a lighter colour we made our way to a narrow lane leading to the riverside where two men stood thumping their arms across their breasts smoking pipes and swearing we entered a boat and were rowed to a ship i was not aware how frozen and befogged my mind and senses had become until i had taken a desperate and long gulp of smoking rumandwater and then the whole of our adventures from morning to midnight with the firtrees in the country fog and the lamps in the london fog and the man who had lost his son the fire the bench the old woman with her fowllike cry and limbs in the air and the row over the misty river swam flashing before my eyes and i cried out to the two girls who were drinking out of one glass with the sailor joe my entertainer well im awake now and slept straight off the next instant chapter xii we find ourselves bound on a voyage it seemed to me that i had but taken a turn from right to left or gone round a wheel when i repeated the same words and i heard temple somewhere near me mumble something like them he drew a long breath so did i we cleared our throats with a sort of whinny simultaneously the enjoyment of lying perfectly still refreshed incurious unexcited yet having our minds animated excursive reaping all the incidents of our lives at leisure and making a dream of our latest experiences kept us tranquil and incommunicative occasionally we let fall a sigh fathoms deep then byandby began blowing a bit of a wanton laugh at the end of it i raised my foot and saw the boot on it which accounted for an uneasy sensation setting in through my frame i said softly what a pleasure it must be for horses to be groomed just what i was thinking said temple we started up on our elbows and one or the other cried theres a chart these are bunks hark at the row overhead were in a ship the ships moving is it foggy this morning its time to get up ive slept in my clothes oh for a dip how i smell of smoke what a noise of a steamer and the squire at riversley fancy uberlys tale temple with averted face asked me whether i meant to return to riversley that day i assured him i would on my honour if possible and of course he also would have to return there why youve an appointment with janet ilchester said i and we may find a pug well buy the huntingknife and the skates and she shall know you saved an old womans life no dont talk about that temple entreated me biting his lip richie were going fast through the water it reminds me of breakfast i should guess the hour to be nine am my watch was unable to assist us the hands pointed to halfpast four and were fixed we ran up on deck looking over the stern of the vessel across a line of rippling eddying red gold we saw the sun low upon cushions of beautiful cloud no trace of fog anywhere blue sky overhead and a mild breeze blowing sunrise i said temple answered yes most uncertainly we looked round a steamtug was towing our ship out toward banks of redreflecting cloud and a smell of sea air why thats the east there cried temple we faced about to the sun and behold he was actually sinking nonsense we exclaimed in a breath from seaward to this stupefying sunset we stood staring the river stretched to broad lengths gulls were on the grey water knots of seaweed and the seafoam curled in advance of us by jingo temple spoke out musing heres a whole day struck out of our existence it cant be said i for that any sensible being could be tricked of a piece of his life in that manner i thought a preposterous notion but the sight of a lessening windmill in the west shadows eastward the wide water and the air now full salt convinced me we two had slept through an entire day and were passing rapidly out of hail of our native land we must get these fellows to put us on shore at once said temple we wont stop to eat theres a town a boat will row us there in halfan hour then we can wash too ive got an idea nothings clean here and confound these fellows for not having the civility to tell us they were going to start we were rather angry a little amused not in the least alarmed at our position a sailor to whom we applied for an introduction to the captain said he was busy another gave us a similar reply with a monstrous grimace which was beyond our comprehension the sailor joe was nowhere to be seen none of the sailors appeared willing to listen to us though they stopped as they were running by to lend half an ear to what we had to say some particular movement was going on in the ship temple was the first to observe that the steamtug was casting us loose and cried he shell take us on board and back to london bridge lets hail her he sang out whoop ahoy i meanwhile had caught sight of joe well young gentleman he accosted me and he hoped i had slept well my courteous request to him to bid the tug stand by to take us on board only caused him to wear a look of awful gravity youre such a deuce of a sleeper he said you see we had to be off early to make up for forty hours lost by that there fog i tried to wake you both no good so i let you snore away we took up our captain midway down the river and now youre in his hands and hell do what he likes with you and that s a fact and my opinion is you ll see a foreign shore before youre in the arms of your family again at these words i had the horrible sensation of being caged and worse transported into the bargain i insisted on seeing the captain a big bright round moon was dancing over the vessels bowsprit and this together with the tug thumping into the distance and the land receding gave mecoming on my wrath suffocating emotions no difficulties were presented in my way i was led up to a broad man in a pilotcoat who stood square and looked by the bend of his eyebrows as if he were always making head against a gale he nodded to my respectful salute cabin he said and turned his back to me i addressed him excuse me i want to go on shore captain i must and will go i am here by some accident you have accidentally overlooked me here i wish to treat you like a gentleman but i wont be detained joe spoke a word to the captain who kept his back as broad to me as a schoolslate for geography and euclids propositions cabin cabin the captain repeated i tried to get round him to dash a furious sentence or so in his face since there was no producing any impression on his back but he occupied the whole of a way blocked with wirecoil and rope and boxes and it would have been ridiculous to climb this barricade when by another right aboutface he could in a minute leave me volleying at the blank space between his shoulders joe touched my arm which in as friendly a way as i could assume i bade him not do a second time for i could ill contain myself as it was and beginning to think i had been duped and tricked i was ready for hostilities i could hardly bear meeting temple on my passage to the cabin captain jasper welsh he was reiterating as if sounding it to discover whether it had an ominous ring it was the captains name that he had learnt from one of the seamen irritated by his repetition of it i said i know not why or how the words came a highwayman notorious for his depredations in the vicinity of the city of bristol this set temple off laughing and so he bought a ship and had traps laid down to catch young fellows for ransom i was obliged to request temple not to joke but the next moment i had launched captain jasper welsh on a piratical exploit temple lifted the veil from his history revealing him amid the excesses of a cannibal feast i dragged him before a british jury temple hanged him in view of an excited multitude as he boasted that there was the end of captain welsh i broke the rope but temple spoiled my triumph by depriving him of the use of his lower limbs after the fall for he was a heavy man i could not contradict it and therefore pitched all his ships crew upon the gallows in a rescue temple allowed him to be carried off by his faithful ruffians only stipulating that the captain was never after able to release his neck from the hangmans slip knot the consequence was that he wore a shirtcollar up to his eyebrows for concealment by day and a pillowcase over his head at night and his wife said she was a deceived unhappy woman and died of curiosity the talking of even such nonsense as this was a relief to us in our impatience and helplessness with the lights of land heaving far distant to our fretful sight through the cabin windows when we had to talk reasonably we were not so successful captain welsh was one of those men who show you whether you care to see them or not all the processes by which they arrive at an idea of you upon which they forthwith shape their course thus when he came to us in the cabin he took the oillamp in his hand and examined our faces by its light he had no reply to our remonstrances and petitions all he said was humph well i suppose youre both gentlemen born and he insisted on prosecuting his scrutiny without any reference to the tenour of our observations we entreated him half imperiously to bring his ship to and put us on shore in a boat he bunched up his mouth remarking know their grammar habit o speaking to grooms eh humph we offered to pay largely loose o their cash was his comment and so on and he was the more exasperating to us because he did not look an evilminded man only he appeared to be cursed with an evil opinion of us i tried to remove it i spoke forbearingly temple imitating me was sugarsweet we exonerated the captain from blame excused him for his error named the case a mistake on both sides that long sleep of ours we said was really something laughable we laughed at the recollection of it a lamentable piece of merriment our artfulness and patience becoming exhausted for the captain had vouchsafed us no direct answer i said at last captain welsh here we are on board your ship will you tell us what you mean to do with us he now said bluntly i will youll behave like a man of honour said i and to that he cried vehemently i will well then said i call out the boat if you please were anxious to be home so you shall the captain shouted and per shipmy barque priscilla and better men than you left or i m no christian temple said briskly thank you captain you may wait awhile with that my lad he answered and to our astonishment recommended us to go and clean our faces and prepare to drink some tea at his table thank you very much captain well do that when we re on shore said we youll have black figureheads and empty gizzards then by that time he remarked we beheld him turning over the leaves of a bible now this sight of the bible gave me a sense of personal security and a notion of hypocrisy in his conduct as well and perceiving that we had conjectured falsely as to his meaning to cast us on shore per ship his barque priscilla i burst out in great heat what we are prisoners you dare to detain us temple chimed in in a similar strain fairly enraged we flung at him without anything of what i thought eloquence the captain ruminated up and down the columns of his bible i was stung to feel that we were like two small terriers baiting a huge mild bull at last he said the story of the prodigal son oh groaned temple at the mention of this wornout old fellow who has gone in harness to tracts ever since he ate the fatted calf but the captain never heeded his interruption young gentlemen ive finished it while you ve been barking at me if i d had him early in life on board my vessel i hope im not presumptuous in sayingthe lord forgive me if i be soid have stopped his downward careeray sowith a trip in the right direction the lord young gentlemen has not thrown you into my hands for no purpose whatsoever thank him on your knees tonight and thank joseph double my mate when you rise for he was the instrument of saving you from bad company if this was a vessel where you d hear an oath or smell the smell of liquor i d have let you run when there was terra firma within stones throw i came on board i found you both asleep with those marks of dissipation round your eyes and i sworein the lords name mind youid help pluck you out of the pit while you had none but one leg in its said its no use barking i am not to be roused the devil in me is chained by the waist and a twentypound weight on his tongue with your assistance ill do the same for the devil in you since youve had plenty of sleep i ll trouble you to commit to memory the whole story of the prodigal son twixt now and morrows sunrise we ll have our commentary on it after labour done labour you will in my vessel for your souls health and let me advise you not to talk in your situation talkings temptation to lying youll do me the obligation to feed at my table and when i hand you back to your parents why theyll thank me if you wont but its not thanks i look for its my bounden christian duty i look to i reckon a couple o stray lambs equal to one lost sheep the captain uplifted his arm ejaculating solemnly by and faltered you were going to swear said temple with savage disdain by the blessing of omnipotence ill save a pair o pups from turning wolves and im a weak mortal man that s too true he was going to swear temple muttered to me i considered the detection of captain welshs hypocrisy unnecessary almost a condescension toward familiarity but the ire in my bosom was boiling so that i found it impossible to roll out the flood of eloquence with which i was big soon after i was trying to bribe the man with all my money and my watch who gave you that watch said he downright church catechism muttered temple my grandfather said i the captains head went like a mechanical hammer to express something indescribable my grandfather i continued will pay you handsomely for any service you do to me and my friend now thats not far off forgoing said the captain in a tone as much as to say we were bad all over i saw the waters slide by his cabinwindows my desolation my humiliation my chained fury tumbled together out it came captain do behave to us like a gentleman and you shall never repent it our relatives will be miserable about us theycaptainthey dont know where we are we havent even a change of clothes of course we know were at your mercy but do behave like an honest man you shall be paid or not just as you please for putting us on shore but we shall be eternally grateful to you of course you mean kindly to us we see that i thank the lord for it he interposed only you really are under a delusion it s extraordinary you cant be quite in your right senses about us you must bei dont mean to speak disrespectfullywhat we call on shore cracked about us doddered dont they say in one of the shires he remarked halfencouraged and in the belief that i might be getting eloquent i appealed to his manliness why should he take advantage of a couple of boys i struck the key of his possible fatherly feelings what misery were not our friends suffering now ay a bucketful now saves an ocean in time to come he flung in his word i bade him with more pathetic dignity reflect on the dreadful hiatus in our studies is that latin or greek he asked i would not reply to the coldblooded question he said the new testament was written in greek he knew and happy were those who could read it in the original well and how can we be learning to read it on board ship said temple an observation that exasperated me because it seemed more to the point than my lengthy speech and betrayed that he thought so however i took it up how can we be graduating for our sphere in life captain welsh on board your vessel tell us that he played thumb and knuckles on his table just when i was hoping that good would come of the senseless tune temple cried tell us what your exact intentions are captain welsh what do you mean to do with us mean to take you the voyage out and the voyage home providence willing said the captain and he rose we declined his offer of tea though i fancy we could have gnawed at a bone theres no compulsion in that matter he said you share my cabin while youre my guests shipmates and apprentices in the path of living my cabin and my substance the same as if you were what the north countrymen call bairns o mine ive none o my own my wife was a barren woman ive none but my old mother at home have your sulks out lads youll come round like the priscilla on a tack and discover youve made way by it we quitted his cabin bowing stiffly temple declared old rippenger was better than this canting rascal the sea was around us a distant yellow twinkle telling of land his wife a barren woman whats that to us temple went on exploding at intervals so was sarah his cabin and his substance he talks more like a preacher than a sailor i should like to see him in a storm hes no sailor at all his men hate him it wouldnt be difficult to get up a mutiny on board this ship richie i understand the whole plot hes in want of cabinboys the fellow has impressed us we shall have to serve till we touch land thank god theres a british consul everywhere i say that seriously i love my country may she always be powerful my life is always at her did you feel that pitch of the ship of all the names ever given to a vessel i do think priscilla is without exception the most utterly detestable oh there again no itll be too bad richie if we re beaten in this way if you are beaten said i scarcely venturing to speak lest i should cry or be sick we both felt that the vessel was conspiring to ruin our selfrespect i set my head to think as hard as possible on latin verses my instinct must have drawn me to them as to a species of intellectual biscuit steeped in spirit tough and comforting and fundamentally opposed to existing circumstances otherwise i cannot account for the attraction they helped me for a time they kept off selfpity and kept the machinery of the mind at work they lifted me as it were to an upper floor removed from the treacherously sighing priscilla but i came down quickly with a crash no dexterous management of my mental resources could save me from the hemplike smell of the ship nor would leaning over the taffrail nor lying curled under a tarpaulin the sailors heaped pilotcoats upon us it was a bad ship they said to be sick on board of for no such thing as brandy was allowed in the old priscilla still i am sure i tasted some before i fell into a state of semi insensibility as in a trance i heard temples moans and the captains voice across the gusty wind and the forlorn crunching of the ship down great waves the captains figure was sometimes stooping over us more greatcoats were piled on us sometimes the wind whistled thinner than one fancies the shrieks of creatures dead of starvation and restless that spend their souls in a shriek as long as they can hold it on say nurserymaids the ship made a truce with the waters and grunted we took two or three playful blows we were drenched with spray uphill we laboured we caught the moon in a net of rigging away we plunged we mounted to plunge again and again i reproached the vessel in argument for some imaginary inconsistency memory was like a heavy barrel on my breast rolling with the sea chapter xiii we conduct several learned arguments with the captain of the priscilla captain welsh soon conquered us the latest meal we had eaten was on the frosty common under the firtrees after a tremendous fast with sea sickness supervening the eggs and bacon and pleasant benevolent smelling tea on the captains table were things not to be resisted by two healthy boys who had previously stripped and faced buckets of maddening icecold saltwater dashed at us by a jolly sailor an open mind for new impressions came with the warmth of our clothes we ate bearing within us the souls of injured innocents nevertheless we were thankful and to the captains grace a long one we bowed heads decently it was a glorious breakfast for which land and sea had prepared us in about equal degrees i confess my feelings when i jumped out of the cabin were almost those of one born afresh to life and understanding temple and i took counsel we agreed that sulking would be ridiculous unmanly ungentlemanly the captain had us fast as if we were under a lions paw he was evidently a wellmeaning man a fanatic deluded concerning our characters the barque priscilla was bound for a german port and should arrive there in a few dayswhy not run the voyage merrily since we were treated with kindness neither the squire nor temples father could complain of our conduct we were simply victims of an error that was assisting us to a knowledge of the world a youths proper ambition and were not going to be starved said temple i smiled thinking i perceived the reason why i had failed in my oration overnight so i determined that on no future occasion would i let pride stand in the way of provender breakfast had completely transformed us we held it due to ourselves that we should demand explanations from joseph double the mate and then after hearing him furnish them with a cordial alacrity to which we might have attached unlimited credence had he not protested against our dreaming him to have supplied hot rumand water on board we wrote our names and addresses in the captains log book and immediately asked permission to go to the masthead he laughed out of his cabin there was no smack of the preacher in him his men said he was a stout seaman mad on the subject of grog and girls why it was on account of grog and girls that he was giving us this dish of saltwater to purify us grog and girls cried we we vowed upon our honour as gentlemen we had tasted grog for the first time in our lives on board the priscilla how about the girls they asked we informed them we knew none but girls who were ladies thereupon one sailor nodded one sent up a crow one said the misfortune of the case lay in all girls being such precious fine ladies and one spoke in dreadfully blank language he accused us of treating the priscilla as a tavern for the entertainment of bad company stating that he had helped to row me and my associates from the shore to the ship poor mr double says he there was only one way for him to jump you two young gentlemen out o that snapdragon bowl you was inor quashmire call it so he ticed you on board wi the bait you was swallowing which was making the devil serve the lords turn and ill remember that night for i yielded to swearing and drank too the other sailors roared with laughter i tipped them not to appear offended by their suspicions we thought them all hypocrites and were as much in error as if we had thought them all honest things went fairly well with the exception of the lessons in scripture our work was mere playing at sailoring helping furl sails haul ropes study charts carry messages and such like temple made his voice shrewdly emphatic to explain to the captain that we liked the work but that such lessons as these out of scripture were what the eeriest youngsters were crammed with such lessons as these maybe dont have the meaning on land they get to have on the high seas replied the captain and those youngsters you talk of were not called in to throw a light on passages for i may teach you ships business aboard my barque but were all children inside the book he groaned heartily to hear that our learning lay in the direction of pagan gods and goddesses and heathen historians and poets adding it was not new to him and perhaps that was why the world was as it was nor did he wonder he said at our running from studies of those filthy writings loose upon london it was as natural as dunghill steam temple pretended he was forced by the captains undue severity to defend venus he said i thought rather wittily sailors ought to have a respect for her for she was born in the middle of the sea and she steered straight for land so she must have had a pretty good idea of navigation but the captain answered none the less keenly she had her idea of navigating as the devil of mischief always has in the direction where theres most to corrupt and my lad she teaches the navigation that leads to the bottom beneath us he might be right still our mien was evil in reciting the lessons from scripture and though captain welsh had intelligence we could not draw into it the how and the why of the indignity we experienced we had rather he had been a savage captain to have braced our spirits to sturdy resistance instead of a mild goodhumoured man of kind intentions who lent us his linen to wear fed us at his table and taxed our most gentlemanly feelings to find excuses for him our way of revenging ourselves becomingly was to laud the heroes of antiquity as if they had possession of our souls and touched the fountain of worship whenever captain welsh exclaimed well done or the equivalent that s an idea we referred him to plutarch for our great exemplar it was alcibiades gracefully consuming his black broth that won the captains thanks for theological acuteness or the young telemachus suiting his temper to the dolphins moods since he must somehow get on shore on the dolphins back captain welsh could not perceive in temple the personifier of alcibiades nor telemachus in me but he was aware of an obstinate obstruction behind our compliance this he called the devil coiled like a snake in its winter sleep he hurled texts at it openly or slyly dropped a particularly heavy one in the hope of surprising it with a deathblow we beheld him poring over his bible for texts that should be sovereign medicines for us deadly for the devil within us consequently we were on the defensive bits of cicero bits of seneca soundly and nobly moral did service on behalf of paganism we remembered them certainly almost as if an imp had brought them from afar nor had we any desire to be in opposition to the cause he supported what we were opposed to was the dogmatic arrogance of a just but ignorant man who had his one specific for everything and saw mortal sickness in all other remedies or recreations temple said to him if the archbishop of canterbury were to tell me greek and latin authors are bad for me i should listen to his remarks because he s a scholar he knows the languages and knows what they contain captain welsh replied if the archbishop o canterbury sailed the sea and lived in foul alley waterside when on shore and so felt what it is to toss on top of the waves o perdition hed understand the value of a big clean well manned wellprovisioned ship instead o your galliots wi gaudy sails your barges that cant rise to a sea your yachts that run to port like mothers pets at first pipe o the storm your trimbuilt wherries so youd have only one sort of vessel afloat said i theres the difference of a man whos a scholar id have said the captain every lad like you my lad trained in the big ship and he wouldnt capsize and be found betrayed by his light timbers as i found you serve your apprenticeship in the lords three decker then to command what you may no no captain welsh says temple you must grind at latin and greek when you re a chick or you wont ever master the rudiments upon my honour i declare it s the truth you must if youd like to try and are of a mind for a go at greek well do our best to help you through the aorists it looks harder than latin but after a start it s easier only im afraid your threedeckers apprenticeship ll stand in your way greek s to be done for me i can pay clever gentlemen for doing greek for me said the captain the knowledge and the love of virtue i must do for myself and not to be wrecked i must do it early well thats neither learning nor human nature said i its the knowledge o the right rules for human nature my lad would you kidnap youngsters to serve in your ship captain id bless the wind that blew them there foul or not my lad and there theyd stick when you had them captain id think it was the lords will they should stick there awhile my ladyes and what of their parents youngsters out like gossamers on a wind their parents are where they sow themselves my lad i call that hard on the real parents captain welsh said temple its harder on providence when parents breed that kind o light creature my lad we were all getting excited talking our best such as it was the captain leaning over his side of the table clasping his hands unintentionally preacherlike we on our side supporting our chins on our fists quick to be at him temple was brilliant he wanted to convert the captain and avowed it for said he youre not like one of those tractfellows youre a man we can respect a good seaman master of your ship and hearty and no mewing sanctimoniousness and we can see and excuse your mistake as to us two but now theres my father at homehes a good man but he s a man of the world and reads his classics and his bible hes none the worse for it i assure you where was his son the night of the fog said the captain well he happened to be out in it whered he be now but for one o my men who can answer that captain welsh i can my ladstewing in an anteroom of hellgates i verily believe temple sighed at the captains infatuation and said ill tell you of a fellow at our school named drew he was old rippengers best theological scholaralways got the prize for theology well he was a confirmed sneak ive taken him into a corner and described the torments of dying to him and his look was disgustinghe broke out in a clammy sweat dont dont hed cry youre just the fellow to suffer intensely i told him and what was his idea of escaping it why by learning the whole of deuteronomy and the acts of the apostles by heart his idea of judgement day was old rippengers halfyearly examination these are facts you know captain welsh i testified to them briefly the captain said a curious thing ill make an appointment with you in leviathans jaws the night of a storm my lad with pleasure said temple the lord send it exclaimed the captain his head was bent forward and he was gazing up into his eyebrows before we knew that anything was coming he was out on a narrative of a scholar of one of the universities our ears were indifferent to the young mans career from the heights of fortune to delirium tremens down the cataract of brandy until the captain spoke of a dark night on the pool of the thames and here his voice struggled and we tried hard to catch the thread of the tale two men and a girl were in the boat the men fought the girl shrieked the boat was upset the three were drowned all this came so suddenly that nothing but the captains heavy thump of his fist on the table kept us from laughing he was quite unable to relate the tale and we had to gather it from his exclamations one of the men was mate of a vessel lying in the pool having only cast anchor that evening the girl was his sweetheart the other man had once been a fine young university gentleman and had become an outfitters drunken agent the brave sailor had nourished him often when on shore and he with the fluent tongue which his college had trimmed for him had led the girl to sin during her lovers absence howsoever they put off together to welcome him on his arrival never suspecting that their secret had been whispered to robert welsh beforehand howsoever robert gave them hearty greeting and down to the cabin they went and there sat drinking up to midnight three lost souls said the captain see how they run temple sang half audibly and flushed hot ashamed of himself twas i had to bear the news to his mother the captain pursued and it was a task my lads for i was then little more than your age and the glass was roberts only fault and he was my only brother i offered my hand to the captain he grasped it powerfully that crew in a boat and wouldnt you know the devild be coxswain he called loudly and buried his face no he said looking up at us i pray for no storm but by the lords mercy for a way to your hearts through fire or water and now on deck my lads while your beds are made up three blind things we verily are captain welsh showed he was sharp of hearing his allusion to the humming of the tune of the mice gave temple a fit of remorse and he apologized ay said the captain it is so own it frivolitys the fruit of that training thats all for the flesh but dip you into some o my books on my shelves here and learn to see living man half skeleton like life and shadow and never to living man need you pray forgiveness my lad by sheer force of character he gained the command of our respect though we agreed on deck that he had bungled his story it impressed us we felt less able to cope with him and less willing to encounter a storm we shall have one of course temple said affecting resignation with a glance aloft i was superstitiously of the same opinion and praised the vessel oh priscillas the very name of a ship that founders with all hands and sends a bottle on shore said temple there isnt a bottle on board said i and this piece of nonsense helped us to sleep off our gloom chapter xiv i meet old friends notwithstanding the prognostications it pleased us to indulge we had a tolerably smooth voyage on a clear cold sunday morning we were sailing between a foreign rivers banks and temple and i were alternately reading a chapter out of the bible to the assembled ships crew in advance of the captains short exhortation we had ceased to look at ourselves inwardly and we hardly thought it strange but our hearts beat for a view of the great merchant city which was called a free city and therefore temple suggested must bear certain portions of resemblance to old england so we made up our minds to like it a wonderful place for beer cellars a sailor observed to us slyly and hitched himself up from the breech to the scalp at all events it was a place where we could buy linen for that purpose captain welsh handed us over to the care of his trusted mate mr joseph double and we were soon in the streets of the city desirous of purchasing half their contents my supply of money was not enough for what i deemed necessary purchases temple had split his clothes mine were tarred we were appearing at a disadvantage and we intended to dine at a good hotel and subsequently go to a theatre yet i had no wish to part with my watch mr double said it might be arranged it was pawned at a shop for a sum equivalent in our money to about twelve pounds and temple obliged me by taking charge of the ticket thus we were enabled to dress suitably and dine pleasantly and as mr double remarked no one could rob me of my gold watch now we visited a couple of beercellars to taste the drink of the people and discovered three of our men engaged in a similar undertaking i proposed that it should be done at my expense they praised their captain but asked us as gentlemen and scholars whether it was reasonable to object to liquor because your brother was carried out on a high tide mr double commended them to moderation their reply was to estimate an immoderate amount of liquor as due to them with profound composure those rascals mr double informed us are not in the captains confidence theyre tidy seamen though and they submit to the captains laws on board and have their liberty ashore we inquired what the difference was between their privileges and his why said he if theyre so much as accused of a disobedient act off they re scurried and lose fair wages and a kind captain and let any man jack of em accuse me and he bounds a indiarubber ball against a wall and gets it all he meant to give he gets once you fix the confidence of your superior youre waterproof we held our peace but we could have spoken mr double had no moral hostility toward theatres supposing he did not relish the performance he could enjoy a spell in the open air he said and this he speedily decided to do had we not been bound in honour to remain for him to fetch us we also should have retired from a representation of which we understood only the word ja it was tiresome to be perpetually waiting for the return of this word we felt somewhat as dogs must feel when human speech is addressed to them accordingly we professed without concealment to despise the whole performance i reminded temple of a saying of the emperor charles v as to a knowledge of languages hem he went critically its all very well for a german to talk in that way but you cant be five times an englishman if youre a foreigner we heard english laughter near us presently an english gentleman accosted us mr villiers i believe he bowed at me my name is richmond he bowed again with excuses talked of the play and telegraphed to a lady sitting in a box fronting us i saw that she wrote on a slip of paper she beckoned the gentleman quitted us and soon after placed a twisted note in my hand it ran miss goodwin whose christian name is clara wishes very much to know how it has fared with mr harry richmond since he left venice i pushed past a number of discontented knees trying on my way to her box to recollect her vividly but i could barely recollect her at all until i had sat beside her five minutes colonel goodwin was asleep in a corner of the box awakened by the sound of his native tongue he recognized me immediately on your way to your father he said as he shook my hand i thought it amazing he should guess that in germany do you know where he is sir i asked we saw him replied the colonel when was it clara a week or ten days ago yes said miss goodwin we will talk of that byandby and she overflowed with comments on my personal appearance and plied me with questions but would answer none of mine i fetched temple into the box to introduce him we were introduced in turn to captain malet the gentleman who had accosted me below you understand german then said miss goodwin she stared at hearing that we knew only the word ja for it made our presence in germany unaccountable the most dangerous word of all said colonel goodwin and begged us always to repeat after it the negative nein for an antidote you have both seen my father i whispered to miss goodwin both we have been separated do tell me everything dont look at the stage they speak such nonsense how did you remember me how happy i am to have met you oh i havent forgotten the gondolas and the striped posts and stali and the other word but soon after we were separated and i havent seen him since she touched her fathers arm at once if you like said he jumping up erect in germany was it i persisted she nodded gravely and leaned softly on my arm while we marched out of the theatre to her hoteli in such a state of happiness underlying bewilderment and strong expectation that i should have cried out loud had not pride in my partner restrained me at her teatable i narrated the whole of my adventure backwards to the time of our parting in venice hurrying it over as quick as i could with the breathless termination and now they had an incomprehensible reluctance to perform their part of the implied compact miss goodwin looked at captain malet he took his leave then she said how glad i am you have dropped that odious name of roy papa and i have talked of you frequentlylatterly very often i meant to write to you harry richmond i should have done it the moment we returned to england you must know said the colonel that i am an amateur inspector of fortresses and my poor clara has to trudge the continent with me to pick up the latest inventions in artillery and other matters for which i get no thanks at headquartersbut it s one way of serving ones country when the steel lies rusting we are now for home by way of paris i hope that you and your friend will give us your company i will see this captain welsh of yours before we start clara you decided on dragging me to the theatre tonight with your usual admirable instinct i reminded miss goodwin of my father being in germany yes he is at one of the courts a long distance from here she said rapidly and you came by accident in a merchantship you are one of those who are marked for extraordinary adventures confess you would have set eyes on me and not known me its a miracle that i should meet my little friend harrylittle no longer my friend all the same are you not i hoped so ardently she with great urgency added then come with us prove that you put faith in our friendship in desperation i exclaimed but i must i must hear of my father she turned to consult the colonels face certainly he said and eulogized a loving son clara will talk to you im for bed what was the name of the play we saw this evening oh struensee to be sure we missed the scaffold he wished us goodnight on an appointment of the hour for breakfast and ordered beds for us in the hotel miss goodwin commenced but really i have nothing to tell you or very little you know papa has introductions everywhere we are like continental people and speak a variety of languages and i am almost a foreigner we are so much abroad but i do think english boys should be educated at home i hope youll go to an english college noticing my painful look we saw him at the court of the prince of eppenwelzen she said as if her brows ached he is very kindly treated there he was there some weeks ago the place lies out in the hanover direction far from here he told us that you were with your grandfather and i must see riversley grange and the truth is you must take me there i suspect you have your peace to make perhaps i shall help you and be a true peribanou we go over amsterdam the hague brussels and you shall see the battlefield paris straight to london yes you are fickle you have not once called me peribanou her voluble rattling succeeded in fencing off my questions before i could exactly shape them as i staggered from blind to blind idea now thinking of the sombre red bench and now of the german princes court wont you tell me any more tonight i said when she paused indeed i have not any more to tell she assured me it was clear to me that she had joined the mysterious league against my father i began to have a choking in the throat i thanked her and wished her goodnight while i was still capable of smiling at my next interview with colonel goodwin he spoke promptly on the subject of my wanderings i was of an age he said to know my own interests no doubt filial affection was excellent in its way but in fact it was highly questionable whether my father was still at the court of this german prince my father had stated that he meant to visit england to obtain an interview with his son and i might miss him by a harumscarum chase over germany and besides was i not offending my grandfather and my aunt to whom i owed so much he appealed to my warmest feelings on their behalf this was just the moment he said when there was a turningpoint in my fortunes he could assure me most earnestly that i should do no good by knocking at this princes doors and have nothing but bitterness if i did in the end discover my father surely you understand the advantages of being bred a gentleman he wound up under your grandfathers care you have a career before you a fine fortune in prospect everything a young man can wish for and i must tell you candidly you run great risk of missing all these things by hunting your father to earth give yourself a little time reflect on it i have i cried i have come out to find him and i must the colonel renewed his arguments and persuasions until he was worn out i thanked him continually for his kindness clara goodwin besought me in a surprising manner to accompany her to england called herself peribanou and with that name conjured up my father to my eyes in his breathing form she said as her father had done that i was called on now to decide upon my future she had a presentiment that evil would come to me of my unchecked headstrong will which she dignified by terming it a true but reckless affection she believed she had been thrown in my path to prove herself a serviceable friend a peribanou of twentysix who would not expect me to marry her when she had earned my gratitude they set temple on me and that was very funny to hear him with his i say richie come perhaps its as well to know where a thing should stop your father knows youre at riversley and hell be after you when convenient and just fancy the squire was laughable he had some anxiety to be home again or at least at riversley i offered him to miss goodwin she reproached me and coaxed me she was exceedingly sweet well she said in an odd resigned fashion rest a day with us will you refuse me that i consented she knew not with what fretfulness we went out to gaze at the shops and edifices and i bought two light bags for slinging over the shoulder two nightshirts toothbrushes and pocketcombs and a large map of germany by dint of vehement entreaties i led her to point to the territory of the prince of eppenwelzensarkeld his income is rather less than that of your grandfather friend harry she remarked i doated on the spot until i could have dropped my finger on it blindfold two or three pitched battles brought us to a friendly arrangement the colonel exacted my promise that if i saw my father at sarkeld in eppenwelzen i would not stay with him longer than seven days and that if he was not there i would journey home forthwith when i had yielded the promise frankly on my honour he introduced me to a banker of the city who agreed to furnish me money to carry me on to england in case i should require it a diligence engaged to deliver me within a few miles of sarkeld i wrote a letter to my aunt dorothy telling her facts and one to the squire beginning we were caught on our arrival in london by the thickest fog ever remembered as if it had been settled on my departure from riversley that temple and i were bound for london miss goodwin was my postbag she said when we had dined about two hours before the starting of the diligence dont you think you ought to go and wish that captain of the vessel you sailed in goodbye i fell into her plot so far as to walk down to the quays on the riverside and reconnoitre the ship but there i saw my prison i kissed my hand to captain welshs mainmast rather ironically though not without regard for him miss goodwin lifted her eyelids at our reappearance as she made no confession of her treason i did not accuse her and perhaps it was owing to a movement of her conscience that at our parting she drew me to her near enough for a kiss to come of itself fourandtwenty german words of essential service to a traveller in germany constituted our knowledge of the language and these were on paper transcribed by miss goodwins own hand in the gloom of the diligence packed between germans of a size that not even tacitus had prepared me for smoked over from all sides it was a fascinating study temple and i exchanged the paper halfhourly while the light lasted when that had fled nothing was left us to combat the sensation that we were in the depths of a manurebed for the windows were closed the tobaccosmoke thickened the hides of animals wrapping our immense companions reeked fire occasionally glowed in their pipebowls they were silent and gave out smoke and heat incessantly like inanimate forces of nature i had most fantastic ideasthat i had taken root and ripened and must expect my head to drop off at any instant that i was deep down wedged in the solid mass of the earth but i need not repeat them they were accurately translated in imagination from my physical miseries the dim revival of light when i had wellnigh ceased to hope for it showed us all like malefactors imperfectly hanged or drowned wretches in a cabin under water i had one colossus bulging over my shoulder temple was blotted out his face emerging from beneath a block of curly bearskin was like that of one frozen in wonderment outside there was a melting snow on the higher hills the clouds over them grew steelblue we were going through a valley in a firforest etext editors bookmarks attacked my conscience on the cowardly side days when you lay on your back

gentleman on the road vii mother and son chapter i above buttons long after the hours when tradesmen are in the habit of commencing business the shutters of a certain shop in the town of lymportonthe sea remained significantly closed and it became known that death had taken mr melchisedec harrington and struck one off the list of living tailors the demise of a respectable member of this class does not ordinarily create a profound sensation he dies and his equals debate who is to be his successor while the rest of them who have come in contact with him very probably hear nothing of his great launch and final adieu till the winding up of cashaccounts on which occasions we may augur that he is not often blessed by one or other of the two great parties who subdivide this universe in the case of mr melchisedec it was otherwise this had been a grand man despite his calling and in the teeth of opprobrious epithets against his craft to be both generally blamed and generally liked evinces a peculiar construction of mortal mr melchisedec whom people in private called the great mel had been at once the sad dog of lymport and the pride of the town he was a tailor and he kept horses he was a tailor and he had gallant adventures he was a tailor and he shook hands with his customers finally he was a tradesman and he never was known to have sent in a bill such a personage comes but once in a generation and when he goes men miss the man as well as their money that he was dead there could be no doubt kilne the publican opposite had seen sally one of the domestic servants come out of the house in the early morning and rush up the street to the doctors tossing her hands and she not disinclined to dilute her grief had on her return related that her master was then at his last gasp and had refused in so many words to swallow the doctor i wont swallow the doctor he says i wont swallow the doctor sally moaned i never touched him he says and i never will kilne angrily declared that in his opinion a man who rejected medicine in extremity ought to have it forced down his throat and considering that the invalid was pretty deeply in kilnes debt it naturally assumed the form of a dishonest act on his part but sally scornfully dared any one to lay hand on her master even for his own good for said she hes got his eyes awake though he do lie so helpless he marks ye ah ah kilne sniffed the air sally then rushed back to her duties now there s a man kilne stuck his hands in his pockets and began his meditation which however was cut short by the approach of his neighbour barnes the butcher to whom he confided what he had heard and who ejaculated professionally obstinate as a pig as they stood together they beheld sally a figure of telegraph at one of the windows implying that all was just over amen said barnes as to a matteroffact affair some minutes after the two were joined by grossby the confectioner who listened to the news and observed just like him id have sworn hed never take doctors stuff and nodding at kilne liked his medicine best eh had ahemgood lot of it muttered kilne with a suddenly serious brow how does he stand on your books asked barnes kilne shouldered round crying who the deuce is to know i dont grossby sighed in he comes with his good morning grossby fine day for the hunt grossby and a tenpound note have the kindness to put that down in my favour grossby and just as i am going to say look herethis wont do he has me by the collar and theres one of the regiments going to give a supper party which hes to order or the admirals wife wants the receipt for that pie or in comes my wife and theres no talking of business then though she may have been bothering about his account all the night beforehand something or other and so we run on what i want to know said barnes the butcher is where he got his tenners from kilne shook a sagacious head no knowing i suppose we shall get something out of the fire barnes suggested that depends answered the emphatic kilne but you know if the widow carries on the business said grossby theres no reason why we shouldnt get it all eh there aint two that can make clothes for nothing and make a profit out of it said kilne that young chap in portugal added barnes he wont take to tailoring when he comes home d ye think he will kilne muttered cant say and grossby a kindly creature in his way albeit a creditor reverting to the first subject of their discourse ejaculated but what a one he waseh fineto look on kilne assented well he was like a marquis said barnes here the three regarded each other and laughed though not loudly they instantly checked that unseemliness and kilne as one who rises from the depths of a calculation with the sum in his head spoke quite in a different voice well what do you say gentlemen shall we adjourn no use standing here by the invitation to adjourn it was well understood by the committee kilne addressed that they were invited to pass his threshold and partake of a morning draught barnes the butcher had no objection whatever and if grossby a man of milder make entertained any the occasion and common interests to be discussed advised him to waive them in single file these mourners entered the publicans house where kilne after summoning them from behind the bar on the important question what it should be and receiving first perfect acquiescence in his views as to what it should be and then feeble suggestions of the drink best befitting that early hour and the speakers particular constitution poured out a toothful to each and one to himself heres to him poor fellow said kilne and was deliberately echoed twice now it wasnt that kilne pursued pointing to the bottle in the midst of a smacking of lips that wasnt what got him into difficulties it was expensive luckshries it was being above his condition horses whats a tradesman got to do with horses unless hes retired then hes a gentleman and can do as he likes its no use trying to be a gentleman if you cant pay for it it always ends bad why there was he consorting with gentlefolksgay as a lark who has to pay for it kilnes fellowvictims maintained a rather doleful tributary silence im not saying anything against him now the publican further observed it s too late and there im sorry hes gone for one he was as kind a hearted a man as ever breathed and there perhaps it was just as much my fault i couldnt say no to himdash me if i could lymport was a prosperous town and in prosperity the muchdespised british tradesman is not a harsh he is really a welldisposed easy soul and requires but management manner occasional instalmentsjust to freshen the accountand a surety that he who debits is on the spot to be a right royal king of credit only the account must never drivel stare aut crescere appears to be his feeling on that point and the departed mr melchisedec undoubtedly understood him there for the running on of the account looked deplorable and extraordinary now that mr melchisedec was no longer in a position to run on with it and it was precisely his doing so which had prevented it from being brought to a summary close long before both barnes the butcher and grossby the confectioner confessed that they too found it hard ever to say no to him and speaking broadly never could except oncesaid barnes when he wanted me to let him have a ox to roast whole out on the common for the battle of waterloo i stood out against him on that no no says i ill joint him for ye mr harrington you shall have him in joints and eat him at homeha ha just like him said grossby with true enjoyment of the princely disposition that had dictated the patriotic order ohthere kilne emphasized pushing out his arm across the bar as much as to say that in anything of such a kind the great mel never had a rival that marquis affair changed him a bit said barnes perhaps it did for a time said kilne whats in the grain you know he couldnt change he would be a gentleman and nothing d stop him and i shouldnt wonder but what that young chap out in portugal ll want to be one too though he didnt bid fair to be so fine a man as his father more of a scholar remarked kilne that i call his worst fault shillyshallying about that young chap i mean his kilne stretched a finger toward the dead mans house first the young chaps to be sent into the navy then its the army then hes to be a judge and sit on criminals then he goes out to his sister in portugal and now theres nothing but a tailor open to him as i see if were to get our money ah and he hasnt got too much spirit to work to pay his fathers debts added barnes theres a business there to make any mans fortuneproperly directed i say but i suppose like father like son hell becoming the marquis too he went to a gentlemans school and hes had foreign training i dont know what to think about it his sisters over therethey were fine women oh a fine family every one of em and married well exclaimed the publican i never had the exact rights of that marquis affair said grossby and remembering that he had previously laughed knowingly when it was alluded to pursued of course i heard of it at the time but how did he behave when he was blown upon barnes undertook to explain but kilne who relished the narrative quite as well and was readier said look here i ll tell you i had it from his own mouth one night when he wasntnot quite himself he was coming down king william street where he stabled his horse you know and i met him hed been dining outsomewhere out over fallow field i think it was and he sings out to me ah kilne my good fellow and i wishing to be equal with him says a fine night my lord and he draws himself uphe smelt of good companysays he kilne im not a lord as you know and you have no excuse for mistaking me for one sir so i pretended i had mistaken him and then he tucked his arm under mine and said youre no worse than your betters kilne they took me for one at squire uplifts tonight but a man who wishes to pass off for more than he is kilne and impose upon people he says hes contemptible kilne contemptible so that you know set me thinking about bath and the marquis and i couldnt help smiling to myself and just let slip a question whether he had enlightened them a bit kilne said he youre an honest man and a neighbour and ill tell you what happened the squire he says likes my company and i like his table now the squire d never do a dirty action but the squires nephew mr george uplift he cant forget that i earn my money and once or twice i have had to correct him and ill wager mel did it too well he goes on there was admiral sir jackson racial and his lady at dinner squire falco of bursted lady barrington admiral comblemanour admiral that was mr this and that i forget their namesand other ladies and gentlemen whose acquaintance i was not honoured with you know his way of talking and there was a goose on the table he says and looking stern at me dont laugh yet says he like thunder well he goes on mr george caught my eye across the table and said so as not to be heard by his uncle if that bird was rampant you would see your own arms marquis and mel replied quietly for him to hear and as that bird is couchant mr george you had better look to your sauce couchant means squatting you know thats heraldry well that wasnt bad sparring of mels but bless you he was never taken aback and the gentlefolks was glad enough to get him to sit down amongst em so says mr george i know youre a fireeater marquis and his dander was up for he began marquising mel and doing the mock polite at such a rate that byandby one of the ladies who didnt know mel called him my lord and his lordship and says mel i merely bowed to her and took no notice so that passed off and there sits mel telling his anecdotes as grand as a king and by andby young mr george who hadnt forgiven mel and had been pulling at the bottle pretty well he sings out it s michaelmas the death of the goose and i should like to drink the marquiss health and he drank it solemn but as far as i can make out the women part of the company was a little in the dark so mel waited till there was a sort of a pause and then speaks rather loud to the admiral by the way sir jackson may i ask you has the title of marquis anything to do with tailoring now mel was a great favourite with the admiral and with his lady too they sayand the admiral played into his hands you see and says he i m not aware that it has mr harrington and he begged for to know why he asked the questioncalled him mister you understand so mel said and i can see him now right out from his chest he spoke with his head up when i was a younger man i had the good taste to be fond of good society and the bad taste to wish to appear different from what i was in it thats mel speaking everybody was listening so he goes on i was in the habit of going to bath in the season and consorting with the gentlemen i met there on terms of equality and for some reason that i am quite guiltless of says mel the hotel people gave out that i was a marquis in disguise and upon my honour ladies and gentlemeni was young then and a fooli could not help imagining i looked the thing at all events i took upon myself to act the part and with some success and considerable gratification for in my opinion says mel no real marquis ever enjoyed his title so much as i did one day i was in my shopno main street lymportand a gentleman came in to order his outfit i received his directions when suddenly he started back stared at me and exclaimed my dear marquis i trust you will pardon me for having addressed you with so much familiarity i recognized in him one of my bath acquaintances that circumstance ladies and gentlemen has been a lesson to me since that time i have never allowed a false impression with regard to my position to exist i desire says mel smiling to have my exact measure taken everywhere and if the michaelmas bird is to be associated with me i am sure i have no objection all i can say is that i cannot justify it by letters patent of nobility thats how mel put it do you think they thought worse of him i warrant you he came out of it in flying colours gentlefolks like straightforwardness in their inferiorsthats what they do ah said kilne meditatively i see him now walking across the street in the moonlight after he d told me that a fine figure of a man and there aint many marquises to match him to this barnes and grossby not insensible to the merits of the recital they had just given ear to agreed and with a common voice of praise in the mouths of his creditors the dead mans requiem was sounded chapter ii the heritage of the son toward evening a carriage drove up to the door of the muted house and the card of lady racial bearing a hurried line in pencil was handed to the widow it was when you looked upon her that you began to comprehend how great was the personal splendour of the husband who could eclipse such a woman mrs harrington was a tall and a stately dame dressed in the high waists of the matrons of that period with a light shawl drawn close over her shoulders and bosom she carried her head well and her pale firm features with the cast of immediate affliction on them had much dignity dignity of an unrelenting physical order which need not express any remarkable pride of spirit the family gossips who on both sides were vain of this rare couple and would always descant on their beauty even when they had occasion to slander their characters said to distinguish them that henrietta maria had a port and melchisedec a presence and that the union of a port and a presence and such a port and such a presence was so uncommon that you might search england through and you would not find another not even in the highest ranks of society there lies some subtle distinction here due to the minute perceptions which compel the gossips of a family to coin phrases that shall express the nicest shades of a domestic difference by a port one may understand them to indicate something unsympathetically impressive whereas a presence would seem to be a thing that directs the most affable appeal to our poor human weaknesses his majesty king george iv for instance possessed a port beau brummel wielded a presence many it is true take a presence to mean no more than a shirtfrill and interpret a port as the art of walking erect but this is to look upon language too narrowly on a more intimate acquaintance with the couple you acknowledge the aptness of the fine distinction by birth mrs harrington had claims to rank as a gentlewoman that is her father was a lawyer of lymport the lawyer however since we must descend the genealogical tree was known to have married his cook who was the ladys mother now mr melchisedec was mysterious concerning his origin and in his cups talked largely and wisely of a great welsh family issuing from a line of princes and it is certain that he knew enough of their history to have instructed them on particular points of it he never could think that his wife had done him any honour in espousing him nor was she the woman to tell him so she had married him for love rejecting various suitors squire uplift among them in his favour subsequently she had committed the profound connubial error of transferring her affections or her thoughts from him to his business which indeed was much in want of a mate and while he squandered the guineas she patiently picked up the pence they had not lived unhappily he was constantly courteous to her but to see the port at that sordid work considerably ruffled the presenceput as it were the peculiar division between them and to behave toward her as the same woman who had attracted his youthful ardours was a task for his magnificent mind and may have ranked with him as an indemnity for his general conduct if his reflections ever stretched so far the townspeople of lymport were correct in saying that his wife and his wife alone had as they termed it kept him together nevertheless now that he was dead and could no longer be kept together they entirely forgot their respect for her in the outburst of their secret admiration for the popular man such is the constitution of the inhabitants of this dear island of britain so falsely accused by the great napoleon of being a nation of shopkeepers here let any one proclaim himself above buttons and act on the assumption his fellows with one accord hoist him on their heads and bear him aloft sweating and groaning and cursing but proud of him and if he can contrive or has any good wife at home to help him to die without going to the dogs they are one may say unanimous in crying out the same eulogistic funeral oration as that commenced by kilne the publican when he was interrupted by barnes the butcher now theres a man mrs harrington was sitting in her parlour with one of her married nieces mrs fiske and on reading lady racials card she gave word for her to be shown up into the drawingroom it was customary among mrs harringtons female relatives who one and all abused and adored the great mel to attribute his shortcomings pointedly to the ladies which was as much as if their jealous generous hearts had said that he was sinful but that it was not his fault mrs fiske caught the card from her aunt read the superscription and exclaimed the idea at least she might have had the decency she never set her foot in the house before and right enough too what can she want now i decidedly would refuse to see her aunt the widows reply was simply dont be a fool ann rising she said here take poor jacko and comfort him till i come back jacko was a middlesized south american monkey and had been a pet of her husbands he was supposed to be mourning now with the rest of the family mrs fiske received him on a shrinking lap and had found time to correct one of his indiscretions before she could sigh and say in the rear of her aunts retreating figure i certainly never would let myself down so but mrs harrington took her own counsel and jacko was of her persuasion for he quickly released himself from mrs fiskes dispassionate embrace and was slinging his body up the balusters after his mistress mrs harrington said lady racial very sweetly swimming to meet her as she entered the room i have intruded upon you i fear in venturing to call upon you at such a time the widow bowed to her and begged her to be seated lady racial was an exquisitely silken dame in whose face a winning smile was cut and she was still sufficiently youthful not to be accused of wearing a flower too artificial it was so sudden so sad she continued we esteemed him so much i thought you might be in need of sympathy and hoped i mightdear mrs harrington can you bear to speak of it i can tell you anything you wish to hear my lady the widow replied lady racial had expected to meet a woman much more like what she conceived a tradesmans wife would be and the grave reception of her proffer of sympathy slightly confused her she said i should not have come at least not so early but sir jackson my husband thought and indeed i imaginedyou have a son mrs harrington i think his name is evan my lady evan it was of him we have been speaking i imagined that is we thought sir jackson mightyou will be writing to him and will let him know we will use our best efforts to assist him in obtaining some position worthy of hissuperior tosomething that will secure him from the harassing embarrassments of an uncongenial employment the widow listened to this tender allusion to the shears without a smile of gratitude she replied i hope my son will return in time to bury his father and he will thank you himself my lady he has no taste forafor anything in the shape of trade has he mrs harrington i am afraid not my lady any positiona situationthat of a clerk evenwould be so much better for him the widow remained impassive and many young gentlemen i know who are clerks and are enabled to live comfortably and make a modest appearance in society and your son mrs harrington he would find it surely an improvement uponmany would think it a step for him i am bound to thank you for the interest you take in my son my lady does it not quite suit your views mrs harrington lady racial was surprised at the widows manner if my son had only to think of himself my lady oh but of coursethe lady understood her nowof course you cannot suppose mrs harrington but that i should anticipate he would have you to live with him and behave to you in every way as a dutiful son surely a clerks income is not very large my lady no but enough as i have said and with the management you would bring mrs harrington to produce a modest respectable maintenance my respect for your husband mrs harrington makes me anxious to press my services upon you lady racial could not avoid feeling hurt at the widows want of common gratitude a clerks income would not be more than l a year my lady to begin withno certainly not more the lady was growing brief if my son puts by the half of that yearly he can hardly support himself and his mother my lady half of that yearly mrs harrington he would have to do so and be saddled till he dies my lady i really cannot see why lady racial had a notion of some excessive niggardly thrift in the widow which was arousing symptoms of disgust mrs harrington quietly said there are his fathers debts to pay my lady his fathers debts under l but above l my lady five thousand pounds mrs harrington the ladys delicately gloved hand gently rose and fell and this poor young manshe pursued my son will have to pay it my lady for a moment the lady had not a word to instance presently she remarked but mrs harrington he is surely under no legal obligation he is only under the obligation not to cast disrespect on his fathers memory my lady and to be honest while he can but mrs harrington surely what can the poor young man do he will pay it my lady but how mrs harrington there is his fathers business my lady his fathers business then must the young man become a tradesman in order to show respect for his father preposterous that was the ladys natural inward exclamation she said rather shrewdly for one who knew nothing of such things but a business which produces debts so enormous mrs harrington the widow replied my son will have to conduct it in a different way it would be a very good business conducted properly my lady but if he has no taste for it mrs harrington if he is altogether superior to it for the first time during the interview the widows inflexible countenance was mildly moved though not to any mild expression my son will have not to consult his tastes she observed and seeing the lady after a short silence quit her seat she rose likewise and touched the fingers of the hand held forth to her bowing you will pardon the interest i take in your son said lady racial i hope indeed that his relatives and friends will procure him the means of satisfying the demands made upon him he would still have to pay them my lady was the widows answer poor young man indeed i pity him sighed her visitor you have hitherto used no efforts to persuade him to take such a stepmrs harrington i have written to mr goren who was my husbands fellowapprentice in london my lady and he is willing to instruct him in cutting and measuring and keeping accounts certain words in this speech were obnoxious to the fine ear of lady racial and she relinquished the subject your husband mrs harringtoni should so much have wishedhe did not pass away inin pain he died very calmly my lady it is so terrible so disfiguring sometimes one dreads to seeone can hardly distinguish i have known cases where death was dreadful but a peaceful death is very beautiful there is nothing shocking to the mind it suggests heaven it seems a fulfilment of our prayers would your ladyship like to look upon him said the widow lady racial betrayed a sudden gleam at having her desire thus intuitively fathomed for one moment mrs harrington we esteemed him so much may i the widow responded by opening the door and leading her into the chamber where the dead man lay at that period when threats of invasion had formerly stirred up the military fire of us islanders the great mel as if to show the great napoleon what character of being a british shopkeeper really was had by remarkable favour obtained a lieutenancy of militia dragoons in the uniform of which he had revelled and perhaps for the only time in his life felt that circumstances had suited him with a perfect fit however that may be his solemn final commands to his wife henrietta maria on whom he could count for absolute obedience in such matters had been that as soon as the breath had left his body he should be taken from his bed washed perfumed powdered and in that uniform dressed and laid out with directions that he should be so buried at the expiration of three days that havoc in his features might be hidden from men in this array lady racial beheld him the curtains of the bed were drawn aside the beams of evening fell soft through the blinds of the room and cast a subdued light on the figure of the vanquished warrior the presence dumb now for evermore was sadly illumined for its last exhibition but one who looked closely might have seen that time had somewhat spoiled that perfect fit which had aforetime been his pride and now that the lofty spirit had departed there had been extreme difficulty in persuading the sullen excess of clay to conform to the dimensions of those garments the upper part of the chest alone would bear its buttons and across one portion of the lower limbs an ancient seam had started recalling an incident to them who had known him in his brief hour of glory for one night as he was riding home from fallow field and just entering the gates of the town a mounted trooper spurred furiously past and slashing out at him gashed his thigh mrs melchisedec found him lying at his door in a not unwonted way carried him upstairs in her arms as she had done many a time before and did not perceive his condition till she saw the blood on her gown the cowardly assailant was never discovered but mel was both gallant and had in his military career the reputation of being a martinet hence divers causes were suspected the wound failed not to mend the trousers were repaired peace about the same time was made and the affair passed over looking on the fine head and face lady racial saw nothing of this she had not looked long before she found covert employment for her handkerchief the widow standing beside her did not weep or reply to her whispered excuses at emotion gazing down on his mortal length with a sort of benignant friendliness aloof as one whose duties to that form of flesh were wellnigh done at the feet of his master jacko the monkey had jumped up and was there squatted with his legs crossed very like a tailor the imitative wretch had got a towel and as often as lady racials handkerchief travelled to her eyes jackos peery face was hidden and you saw his lithe skinny body doing griefs convulsions till tired of this amusement he obtained possession of the warriors helmet from a small round table on one side of the bed a calque of the barbarous militarygeorgian form with a huge knob of horsehair projecting over the peak and under this trying to adapt it to his rogues head the tricksy image of death extinguished himself all was very silent in the room then the widow quietly disengaged jacko and taking him up went to the door and deposited him outside during her momentary absence lady racial had time to touch the dead mans forehead with her lips unseen chapter iii the daughters of the shears three daughters and a son were left to the world by mr melchisedec love well endowed had already claimed to provide for the daughters first in the shape of a lean marine subaltern whose days of obscuration had now passed and who had come to be a major of that corps secondly presenting his addresses as a brewer of distinction thirdly and for a climax as a portuguese count no other than the senor silva diaz conde de saldar and this match did seem a far more resplendent one than that of the two elder sisters with major strike and mr andrew cogglesby but the rays of neither fell visibly on lymport these escaped eurydices never reappeared after being once fairly caught away from the gloomy realms of dis otherwise trade all three persons of singular beauty a certain refinement some port and some presence hereditarily combined they feared the clutch of that fell king and performed the widest possible circles around him not one of them ever approached the house of her parents they were dutiful and loving children and wrote frequently but of course they had to consider their new position and their husbands and their husbands families and the world and what it would say if to it the dreaded rumour should penetrate lymport gossips as numerous as in other parts declared that the foreign nobleman would rave in an extraordinary manner and do things after the outlandish fashion of his country for from him there was no doubt the shop had been most successfully veiled and he knew not of plutos close relationship to his lovely spouse the marriages had happened in this way balls are given in country towns where the graces of tradesmens daughters may be witnessed and admired at leisure by other than tradesmen by occasional country gentlemen of the neighbourhood with light minds and also by small officers subalterns wishing to do tender execution upon mans fair enemy and to find a distraction for their legs the classes of our social fabric have here and there slight connecting links and provincial public balls are one of these they are dangerous for cupid is no respecter of classprejudice and if you are the son of a retired teamerchant or of a village doctor or of a halfpay captain or of anything superior and visit one of them you are as likely to receive his shot as any shopboy even masquerading lords at such places have been known to be slain outright and although society allows to its highest and dearest to save the honour of their families and heal their anguish by indecorous compromise you if you are a trifle below that mark must not expect it you must absolutely give yourself for what you hope to get dreadful as it sounds to philosophic ears you must marry this having danced with caroline harrington the gallant lieutenant strike determined to do nor when he became aware of her fathers occupation did he shrink from his resolve after a months hard courtship he married her straight out of her fathers house that he may have all the credit due to him it must be admitted that he did not once compare or possibly permit himself to reflect on the dissimilarity in their respective ranks and the step he had taken downward till they were man and wife and then not in any great degree before fortune had given him his majority an advance the good soldier frankly told his wife he did not owe to her if we may be permitted to suppose the colonel of a regiment on friendly terms with one of his corporals we have an estimate of the domestic life of major and mrs strike among the garrison males his comrades he passed for a disgustingly jealous brute the ladies in their pretty language signalized him as a finick now having achieved so capital a marriage caroline worthy creature was anxious that her sisters should not be less happy and would have them to visit her in spite of her husbands protests there can be no danger she said for she was in fresh quarters far from the nest of contagion the lieutenant himself ungrudgingly declared that looking on the ladies no one for an instant could suspect and he saw many young fellows ready to be as great fools as he had been another voluntary confession he made to his wife for the candour of which she thanked him and pointed out that it seemed to run in the family inasmuch as mr andrew cogglesby his rich relative had seen and had proposed for harriet the lieutenant flatly said he would never allow it in fact he had hitherto concealed the nonpresentable portion of his folly very satisfactorily from all save the messroom and mr andrews passion was a severe dilemma to him it need scarcely be told that his wife fortified by the fervid brewer defeated him utterly what was more she induced him to be an accomplice in deception for though the lieutenant protested that he washed his hands of it and that it was a fraud and a snare he certainly did not avow the condition of his wifes parents to mr andrew but alluded to them in passing as the country people he supposed the country people must be asked he said the brewer offered to go down to them but the lieutenant drew an unpleasant picture of the country people and his wife became so grave at the proposal that mr andrew said he wanted to marry the lady and not the country people and if she would have him there he was there he was behaving with a particular and sagacious kindness to the raw lieutenant since harriets arrival if the lieutenant sent her away mr andrew would infallibly pursue her and light on a discovery twice cursed by love twice the victim of tailordom our excellent marine gave away harriet harrington in marriage to mr andrew cogglesby thus joy clapped hands a second time and horror deepened its shadows from higher ground it was natural that the remaining sister should take a bolder flight of the loves of the fair louisa harrington and the foreign count and how she first encountered him in the brewers saloons and how she being a humorous person laughed at his loaf for her and wore the colours that pleased him and kindled and soothed his jealousy little is known beyond the fact that she espoused the count under the auspices of the affluent brewer and engaged that her children should be brought up in the faith of the catholic church which lymport gossips called paying the devil for her pride the three sisters gloriously rescued by their own charms had now to think of their one young brother how to make him a gentleman that was their problem preserve him from tailordomfrom all contact with tradethey must otherwise they would be perpetually linked to the horrid thing they hoped to outlive and bury a cousin of mr melchisedecs had risen to be an admiral and a knight for valiant action in the old war when men could rise him they besought to take charge of the youth and make a distinguished seaman of him he courteously declined they then attacked the married marinenavy or army being quite indifferent to them as long as they could win for their brother the badge of one service when he is a gentleman at once they said like those who see the end of their labours strike basely pretended to second them it would have been delightful to him of course to have the tailors son messing at the same table and claiming him when he pleased with a familiar ah brother and prating of their relationship everywhere strike had been a fool in revenge for it he laid out for himself a masterly career of consequent wisdom the breweruxorious andrew cogglesbymight and would have bought the commission strike laughed at the idea of giving money for what could be got for nothing he told them to wait in the meantime evan a lad of seventeen spent the hours not devoted to his positive professionthat of gentlemanin the offices of the brewery toying with big books and balances which he despised with the combined zeal of the sucking soldier and emancipated tailor two years passed in attendance on the astute brotherinlaw to whom fortune now beckoned to come to her and gather his laurels from the pig tails about the same time the countess sailed over from lisbon on a visit to her sister harriet in reality it was whispered in the cogglesby saloons on a diplomatic mission from the court of lisbon but that could not be made ostensible the countess narrowly examined evan whose steady advance in his profession both her sisters praised yes said the countess in a languid alien accent he has something of his fathers carriagesomething something of his deliveryhis readiness it was a remarkable thing that these ladies thought no man on earth like their father and always cited him as the example of a perfect gentleman and yet they buried him with one mind and each mounted guard over his sepulchre to secure his ghost from an airing he can walk my dears certainly and talka little teteatete i do not say i should think there he would bea stick all you english are but what sort of a bow has he got i ask you how does he enter a room and then his smile his laugh he laughs like a horse absolutely theres no music in his smile oh you should see a portuguese nobleman smile o mio deus honeyed my dears but evan has it not none of you english have you go so the countess pressed a thumb and finger to the sides of her mouth and set her sisters laughing i assure you no better not a bit i faint in your society i ask myselfwhere am i among what boors have i fallen but evan is no worse than the rest of you i acknowledge that if he knew how to dress his shoulders properly and to direct his eyesoh the eyes you should see how a portuguese nobleman can use his eyes soul my dears soul can any of you look the unutterable without being absurd you look so and the countess hung her jaw under heavily vacuous orbits something as a sheep might yawn but i acknowledge that evan is no worse than the rest of you she repeated if he understood at all the management of his eyes and mouth but thats what he cannot possibly learn in englandnot possibly as for your poor husband harriet one really has to remember his excellent qualities to forgive him poor man and that stiff bandbox of a man of yours caroline addressing the wife of the marine he looks as if he were all angles and sections and were taken to pieces every night and put together in the morning he may be a good soldiergood anything you willbut diacho to be married to that he is not civilized none of you english are you have no place in the drawingroom you are like so many intrusive oxenabsolutely one of your men trod on my toe the other night and what do you think the creature did jerks back then the half of him forwardi thought he was going to break in twothen grins and grunts oh m sure beg pardon m sure i dont know whether he didnt say marm the countess lifted her hands and fell away in laughing horror when her humour or her feelings generally were a little excited she spoke her vernacular as her sisters did but immediately subsided into the deliberate delicatelysyllabled drawl now that happened to me once at one of our great balls she pursued i had on one side of me the duchesse eugenia de formosa de fontandigua on the other sat the countess de pel a widow and we were talking of the ices that evening eugenia you must know my dears was in love with the count belmarana i was her sole confidante the countess de pela horrible creature oh she was the duchesss determined enemy would have stabbed her for belmarana one of the most beautiful men adored by every woman so we talked ices eugenic and myself quite comfortably and that horrible de pel had no idea in life eugenia had just said this ice sickens me i do not taste the flavour of the vanille i answered it is here it mustit cannot but be here you love the flavour of the vanille with her exquisite smile i see her now saying too well it is necessary to me i live on itwhen up he came in his eagerness his foot just effleured my robe oh i never shall forget in an instant he was down on one knee it was so momentary that none saw it but we three and done with ineffable grace pardon he said in his sweet portuguese pardon looking upthe handsomest man i ever beheld and when i think of that odious wretch the other night with his oh m sure beg pardon m sure pon my honour i could have kicked himi could indeed here the countess laughed out but relapsed into alas that belmarana should have betrayed that beautiful trusting creature to de pel such scandal a duelthe duke was wounded for a whole year eugenia did not dare to appear at court but had to remain immured in her countryhouse where she heard that belmarana had married de pel it was for her money of course rich as croesus and as wicked as the black man below as dear papa used to say by the way werent we talking of evan ahyes and so forth the countess was immensely admired and though her sisters said that she was foreignized overmuch they clung to her desperately she seemed so entirely to have eclipsed tailordom or demogorgon as the countess was pleased to call it who could suppose this grand mannered lady with her coroneted anecdotes and delicious breeding the daughter of that thing it was not possible to suppose it it seemed to defy the fact itself they congratulated her on her complete escape from demogorgon the countess smiled on them with a lovely sorrow safe from the whisper my dears the ceaseless dread if you knew what i have to endure i sometimes envy you pon my honour i sometimes wish i had married a fishmonger silva indeed is a most excellent husband polished such polish as you know not of in england he has a waya wriggle with his shoulders in companyi cannot describe it to you so slight so elegant and he is all that a woman could desire but who could be safe in any part of the earth my dears while papa will go about so and behave so extraordinarily i was at dinner at your english embassy a month ago and there was admiral combleman then on the station off lisbon sir jackson racials friend who was the admiral at lymport formerly i knew him at once and thought oh what shall i do my heart was like a lump of lead i would have given worlds that we might one of us have smothered the other i had to sit beside him it always happens thank heaven he did not identify me and then he told an anecdote of papa it was the dreadful old bath story i thought i should have died i could not but fancy the admiral suspected was it not natural and what do you think i had the audacity to do i asked him coolly whether the mr harrington he mentioned was not the son of sir abraham harrington of torquaythe gentleman who lost his yacht in the lisbon waters last year i brought it on myself gentleman maammaam says the horrid old creature laughing gentleman hes a i cannot speak it i choke and then he began praising papa diacho what i suffered but you know i can keep my countenance if i perish i am a harrington as much as any of us and the countess looked superb in the pride with which she said she was what she would have given her hand not to be but few feelings are single on this globe and junction of sentiments need not imply unity in our yeasty compositions after it was overmy supplice continued the countess i was questioned by all the ladiesi mean our ladiesnot your english they wanted to know how i could be so civil to that intolerable man i gained a deal of credit my dears i laid it all ondiplomacy the countess laughed bitterly diplomacy bears the burden of it all i pretended that combleman could be useful to silva oh what hypocrites we all are mio deus the ladies listening could not gainsay this favourite claim of universal brotherhood among the select who wear masks instead of faces with regard to evan the countess had far outstripped her sisters in her views a gentleman she had discovered must have one of two things a title or money he might have all the breeding in the world he might be as good as an angel but without a title or money he was under eclipse almost total on a gentleman the sun must shine now evan had no title no money the clouds were thick above the youth to gain a title he would have to scale aged mountains there was one break in his firmament through which the radiant luminary might be assisted to cast its beams on him still young that divine portal was matrimony if he could but make a rich marriage he would blaze transfigured all would be well and why should not evan marry an heiress as well as another i know a young creature who would exactly suit him said the countess she is related to the embassy and is in lisbon now a charming child just sixteen dios how the men rave about her and she isnt a beautytheres the wonder and she is a little too gauche too english in her habits and ways of thinking likes to be admired of course but doesnt know yet how to set about getting it she rather scandalizes our ladies but when you know hershe will have they say a hundred thousand pounds in her own right rose jocelyn the daughter of sir franks and that eccentric lady jocelyn she is with her uncle melville the celebrated diplomate though to tell you the truth we turn him round our fingers and spin him as the boys used to do the cockchafers i cannot forget our old fallow field schoollife you see my dears well rose jocelyn would just suit evan she is just of an age to receive an impression and i would take care she did instance me a case where i have failed or there is the portuguese widow the rostral shes thirty certainly but she possesses millions estates all over the kingdom and the sweetest creature but no evan would be out of the way there certainly butour women are very nice they have the dearest sweetest ways but i would rather evan did not marry one of them and then there s the religion this was a sore of the countesss own and she dropped a tear in coming across it no my dears it shall be rose jocelyn she concluded i will take evan over with me and see that he has opportunities it shall be rose and then i can call her mine for in verity i love the child it is not my part to dispute the countesss love for miss jocelyn and i have only to add that evan unaware of the soft training he was to undergo and the brilliant chance in store for him offered no impediment to the proposition that he should journey to portugal with his sister whose subtlest flattery was to tell him that she should not be ashamed to own him there and ultimately furnished with cash for the trip by the remonstrating brewer went so these parcae daughters of the shears arranged and settled the young mans fate his task was to learn the management of his mouth how to dress his shoulders properly and to direct his eyesrare qualities in man or woman i assure you the management of the mouth being especially admirable and correspondingly difficult these achieved he was to place his battery in position and win the heart and hand of an heiress our comedy opens with his return from portugal in company with miss rose the heiress the honourable melville jocelyn the diplomate and the count and countess de saldar refugees out of that explosive little kingdom chapter iv on board the jocasta from the tagus to the thames the government sloopofwar jocasta had made a prosperous voyage bearing that precious freight a removed diplomatist and his family for whose uses let a sufficient vindication be found in the exercise he affords our crews in the science of seamanship she entered our noble river somewhat early on a fine july morning early as it was two young people who had nothing to do with the trimming or guiding of the vessel stood on deck and watched the doubleshore beginning to embrace them more and more closely as they sailed onward one a young lady very young in manner wore a black felt hat with a floating scarlet feather and was clad about the shoulders in a mantle of foreign style and pattern the other you might have taken for a wandering don were such an object ever known so simply he assumed the dusky sombrero and dangling cloak of which one fold was flung across his breast and drooped behind him the line of an adolescent dark moustache ran along his lip and only at intervals could you see that his eyes were blue and of the land he was nearing for the youth was meditative and held his head much down the young lady on the contrary permitted an open inspection of her countenance and seemed for the moment at least to be neither caring nor thinking of what kind of judgement would be passed on her her pretty nose was up sniffing the still salt breeze with vivacious delight oh she cried clapping her hands there goes a dear old english gull how i have wished to see him i havent seen one for two years and seven months when i m at home i ll leave my window open all night just to hear the rooks when they wake in the morning there goes another she tossed up her nose again exclaiming i m sure i smell england nearer and nearer i smell the fields and the cows in them id have given anything to be a dairymaid for half an hour i used to lie and pant in that stifling air among those stupid people and wonder why anybody ever left england arent you glad to come back this time the fair speaker lent her eyes to the question and shut her lips sweet cold chaste lips she had a mouth that had not yet dreamed of kisses and most honest eyes the young man felt that they were not to be satisfied by his own and after seeking to fill them with a doleful look which was immediately succeeded by one of superhuman indifference he answered yes we shall soon have to part and commenced tapping with his foot the cheerful martyrs march speech that has to be hauled from the depths usually betrays the effort listening an instant to catch the import of this cavernous gasp upon the brink of sound the girl said part what do you mean apparently it required a yet vaster effort to pronounce an explanation the doleful look the superhuman indifference were repeated in due order sound a little more distinct uttered the words we cannot be as we have been in england and then the cheerful martyr took a few steps farther why you dont mean to say youre going to give me up and not be friends with me because weve come back to england cried the girl in a rapid breath eyeing him seriously most conscientiously he did not mean it but he replied with the quietest negative no she mimicked him why do you say no like that why are you so mysterious evan wont you promise me to come and stop with us for weeks havent you said we would ride and hunt and fish together and read books and do all sorts of things he replied with the quietest affirmative yes what does yes mean she lifted her chest to shake out the deadalive monosyllable as he had done why are you so singular this morning evan have i offended you you are so touchy the slur on his reputation for sensitiveness induced the young man to attempt being more explicit i mean he said hesitating why we must part we shall not see each other every day nothing more than that and away went the cheerful martyr in sublimest mood oh and that makes you sorry a shade of archness was in her voice the girl waited as if to collect something in her mind and was now a patronizing woman why you dear sentimental boy you dont suppose we could see each other every day for ever it was perhaps the cruelest question that could have been addressed to the sentimental boy from her mouth but he was a cheerful martyr you dear don doloroso she resumed i declare if you are not just like those young portugals this morning and over there you were such a dear english fellow and thats why i liked you so much do change do please be lively and yourself again or mind ill call you don doloroso and that shall be your name in england see therethats thats whats the name of that place hoy mr skerne she hailed the boatswain passing do tell me the name of that place mr skerne righted about to satisfy her minutely and then coming up to evan he touched his hat and said i maynt have another opportunitywe shall be busy up thereof thankin you again sir for what you did for my poor drunken brother bill and you may take my word i wont forget it sir if he does and i suppose hell be drowning his memory just as he was near drowning himself evan muttered something grimaced civilly and turned away the girls observant brows were moved to a faintly critical frown and nodding intelligently to the boatswains remark that the young gentleman did not seem quite himself now that he was nearing home she went up to evan and said im going to give you a lesson in manners to be quits with you listen sir why did you turn away so ungraciously from mr skerne while he was thanking you for having saved his brothers life now theres where youre too english cant you bear to be thanked i dont want to be thanked because i can swim said evan but it is not that oh how you trifle she cried theres nothing vexes me so much as that way you have wouldnt my eyes have sparkled if anybody had come up to me to thank me for such a thing i would let them know how glad i was to have done such a thing doesnt it make them happier dear evan my dear miss jocelyn what the honest grey eyes fixed on him narrowed their enlarged lids she gazed before her on the deck saying im sure i cant understand you i suppose its because im a girl and i never shall till im a woman heigho a youth who is engaged in the occupation of eating his heart cannot shine to advantage and is as much a burden to himself as he is an enigma to others evan felt this but he could do nothing and say nothing so he retired deeper into the folds of the don and remained picturesque and scarcely pleasant they were relieved by a summons to breakfast from below she brightened and laughed now what will you wager me evan that the countess doesnt begin sweet child how does she this morning blooming when she kisses me her capital imitation of his sisters manner constrained him to join in her laugh and he said ill back against that i get three fingers from your uncle and morrow young sir down they ran together laughing and sure enough the identical words of the respective greetings were employed which they had to enjoy with all the discretion they could muster rose went round the table to her little cousin alec aged seven kissed his reluctant cheek and sat beside him announcing a sea appetite and great capabilities while evan silently broke bread the count de saldar a diminutive tawny man just a head and neck above the tablecloth sat sipping chocolate and fingering dry toast which he would now and then dip in jelly and suck with placidity in the intervals of a curt exchange of french with the wife of the hon melville a ringleted english lady or of portuguese with the countess who likewise sipped chocolate and fingered dry toast and was mournfully melodious the hon melville as became a tall islander carved beef and ate of it like a ruler of men beautiful to see was the compassionate sympathy of the countesss face when rose offered her plate for a portion of the world subjugating viand as who should say sweet child thou knowest not yet of sorrows thou canst ballast thy stomach with beef in any other than an heiress she would probably have thought this is indeed a disgusting little animal and most unfeminine conduct rose unconscious of praise or blame rivalled her uncle in enjoyment of the fare and talked of her delight in seeing england again and anything that belonged to her native land mrs melville perceived that it pained the refugee countess and gave her the glance intelligible but the countess never missed glances or failed to interpret them she said let her i love to hear the sweet childs prattle it was fortunate she addressed the diplomatist that we touched at southampton and procured fresh provision very lucky for us said he glaring shrewdly between a mouthful the count heard the word southampton and wished to know how it was comprised a passage of portuguese ensued and then the countess said silva you know desired to relinquish the vessel at southampton he does not comprehend the word expense but she shook a dumb alas i must think of that for him now oh always avoid expense said the hon melville accustomed to be paid for by his country at what time shall we arrive may i ask do you think the countess gently inquired the watch of a man who had his eye on time was pulled out and she was told it might be two hours before dark another reckoning keenly balanced informed the company that the days papers could be expected on board somewhere about three oclock in the afternoon and then said the hon melville nodding general gratulation we shall know how the world wags how it had been wagging the countesss straining eyes under closed eyelids were eloquent of too late i fear me to wait upon lord livelyston tonight she suggested tonight the hon melville gazed blank astonishment at the notion oh certainly too late tonight ahum i think madam you had better not be in too great a hurry to see him repose a little recover your fatigue oh exclaimed the countess with a beam of utter confidence in him i shall be too happy to place myself in your handsbelieve me this was scarcely more to the taste of the diplomatist he put up his mouth and said blandly i fearyou know madam i must warn you beforehandi personally am but an insignificant unit over here you know i personally cant guarantee much assistance to younot positive what i can do of course very happy and he fell to again upon the beef not so very insignificant said the countess smiling as at a softly radiant conception of him have to bob and bow like the rest of them over here he added proof against the flattery but that you will not forsake silva i am convinced said the countess and paying little heed to his brief oh what i can do continued for over here in england we are almost friendless my relationssuch as are left of themare not in high place she turned to mrs melville and renewed the confession with a proud humility truly i have not a distant cousin in the cabinet mrs melville met her sad smile and returned it as one who understood its entire import my brotherinlawmy sister i think you knowmarried aa brewer he is rich but well such was her taste my brotherinlaw is indeed in parliament and he very little use seeing he votes with the opposite party the diplomatist interrupted her ah but he will not said the countess serenely i can trust with confidence that if it is for silvas interest he will assuredly so dispose of his influence as to suit the desiderations of his family and not in any way oppose his opinions to the powers that would willingly stoop to serve us it was impossible for the hon melville to withhold a slight grimace at his beef when he heard this extremely alienized idea of the nature of a member of the parliament of great britain he allowed her to enjoy her delusion as she pursued no so much we could offer in repayment it is little but this in verity is a case silvas wrongs have only to be known in england and i am most assured that the english people will not permit it in the days of his prosperity silva was a friend to england and england should notshould notforget it now had we money but of that arm our enemies have deprived us and i fear without it we cannot hope to have the justice of our cause pleaded in the english papers mr redner you know the correspondent in lisbon is a sworn foe to silva and why but because i would not procure him an invitation to court the man was so horridly vulgar his gloves were never clean i had to hold a bouquet to my nose when i talked to him that you say was my fault truly so but what woman can be civil to a lowbred pretentious offensive man mrs melville again appealed to smiled perfect sympathy and said to account for his character yes he is the son of a small shopkeeper of some kind in southampton i hear a very good fellow in his way said her husband oh i cant bear that class of people rose exclaimed i always keep out of their way you can always tell them the countess smiled considerate approbation of her exclusiveness and discernment so sweet a smile you were on deck early my dear she asked evan rather abruptly master alec answered for him yes he was and so was rose they made an appointment just as they used to do under the oranges children the countess smiled to mrs melville they always whisper when im by alec appended children the countesss sweetened visage entreated mrs melville to reecho but that lady thought it best for the moment to direct rose to look to her packing now that she had done breakfast and i will take a walk with my brother on deck said the countess silva is too harassed for converse the parties were thus divided the silent count was left to meditate on his wrongs in the saloon and the diplomatist alone with his lady thought fit to say to her shortly perhaps it would be as well to draw away from these people a little we ve done as much as we could for them in bringing them over here they may be trying to compromise us that womans absurd she s ashamed of the brewer and yet she wants to sell himor wants us to buy him ha i think she wants us to send a couple of frigates and threaten bombardment of the capital if they dont take her husband back and receive him with honours perhaps it would be as well said mrs melville roses invitation to him goes for nothing rose inviting the count down to hampshire the diplomatists brows were lifted no i mean the other said the diplomatists wife oh the young fellow very good young fellow gentlemanly no harm in him perhaps not said the diplomatists wife you dont suppose he expects us to keep him on or provide for him over hereeh the diplomatists wife informed him that such was not her thought that he did not understand and that it did not matter and as soon as the hon melville saw that she was brooding something essentially feminine and which had no relationship to the great game of public life curiosity was extinguished in him on deck the countess paced with evan and was for a time pleasantly diverted by the admiration she could without looking perceive that her sorrowsubdued graces had aroused in the breast of a susceptible naval lieutenant at last she spoke my dear remember this your last word to mr jocelyn will be i will do myself the honour to call upon my benefactor early to rose you will say be assured miss jocelyn miss jocelyni shall not fail in hastening to pay my respects to your family in hampshire you will remember to do it in the exact form i speak it evan laughed what call him benefactor to his face i couldnt do it ah my child besides he isnt a benefactor at all his private secretary died and i stepped in to fill the post because nobody else was handy and tell me of her who pushed you forward evan my dear sister im sure im not ungrateful no but headstrong opinionated now these people will endeavouroh i have seen it in a thousand little thingsthey wish to shake us off now if you will but do as i indicate put your faith in an older head evan it is your only chance of society in england for your brother inlawi ask you what sort of people will you meet at the cogglesbys now and then a nobleman very much out of his element in short you have fed upon a diet which will make you to distinguish and painfully to know the difference indeed yes you are looking about for rose it depends upon your behaviour now whether you are to see her at all in england do you forget you wished once to inform her of your origin think of her words at the breakfast this morning the countess imagined she had produced an impression evan said yes and i should have liked to have told her this morning that im myself nothing more than the son of a stop cried his sister glancing about in horror the admiring lieutenant met her eye blandishingly she smiled on him most beautiful weather for a welcome to dear england and passed with majesty boy she resumed are you mad i hate being such a hypocrite madam then you do not love her evan this may have been dubious logic but it resulted from a clear sequence of ideas in the ladys head evan did not contest it and assuredly you will lose her evan think of my troubles i have to intrigue for silva i look to your future i smile oh heaven how do i not smile when things are spoken that pierce my heart this morning at the breakfast evan took her hand and patted it what is your pity she sighed if it had not been for you my dear sister i should never have held my tongue you are not a harrington you are a dawley she exclaimed indignantly evan received the accusation of possessing more of his mothers spirit than his fathers in silence you would not have held your tongue she said with fervid severity and you would have betrayed yourself and you would have said you were that and you in that costume why goodness gracious could you bear to appear so ridiculous the poor young man involuntarily surveyed his person the pains of an impostor seized him the deplorable image of the don making confession became present to his mind it was a clever stroke of this female intriguer she saw him redden grievously and blink his eyes and not wishing to probe him so that he would feel intolerable disgust at his imprisonment in the don she continued but you have the sense to see your duties evan you have an excellent sense in the main no one would dreamto see you you did not i must say you did not make enough of your gallantry a portuguese who had saved a mans life evan would he have been so boorish you behaved as if it was a matter of course that you should go overboard after anybody in your clothes on a dark night so then the jocelyns took it i barely heard one compliment to you and rosewhat an effect it should have had on her but owing to your manner i do believe the girl thinks it nothing but your ordinary business to go overboard after anybody in your clothes on a dark night pon my honour i believe she expects to see you always dripping the countess uttered a burst of hysterical humour so you miss your credit that inebriated sailor should really have been gold to you be not so young and thoughtless the countess then proceeded to tell him how foolishly he had let slip his great opportunity a portuguese would have fixed the young lady long before by tender moonlight in captivating language beneath the umbrageous orangegroves a portuguese would have accurately calculated the effect of the perfume of the blossom on her sensitive nostrils and know the exact moment when to kneel and declare his passion sonorously yes said evan one of them did she told me she told you and youwhat did you do laughed at him with her to be sure laughed at him she told you and you helped her to laugh at love have you no perceptions why did she tell you because she thought him such a fool i suppose you never will know a woman said the countess with contempt much of his worldly sister at a time was more than evan could bear accustomed to the symptoms of restiveness she finished her discourse enjoyed a quiet parade up and down under the gaze of the lieutenant and could find leisure to note whether she at all struck the inferior seamen even while her mind was absorbed by the multiform troubles and anxieties for which she took such innocent indemnification the appearance of the hon melville jocelyn on deck and without his wife recalled her to business it is a peculiarity of female diplomatists that they fear none save their own sex men they regard as their natural prey in women they see rival hunters using their own weapons the countess smiled a slowlykindling smile up to him set her brother adrift and delicately linked herself to evans benefactor i have been thinking she said knowing your kind and most considerate attentions that we may compromise you in england he at once assured her he hoped not he thought not at all the idea is due to my brother she went on for iwomen know so littleand most guiltlessly should we have done so my brother perhaps does not think of us foremost but his argument i can distinguish i can see that were you openly to plead silvas cause you might bring yourself into odium mr jocelyn and heaven knows i would not that may i then ask that in england we may be simply upon the same footing of private friendship the diplomatist looked into her uplifted visage that had all the sugary sparkles of a crystallized preserved fruit of the portugal clime and observed confidentially that with every willingness in the world to serve her he did think it would possibly be better for a time to be upon that footing apart from political considerations i was very sure my brother would apprehend your views said the countess he poor boy his career is closed he must sink into a different sphere he will greatly miss the intercourse with you and your sweet family further relieved the diplomatist delivered a high opinion of the young gentleman his abilities and his conduct and trusted he should see him frequently by an apparent sacrifice the lady thus obtained what she wanted near the hour speculated on by the diplomatist the papers came on board and he unaware how he had been manoeuvred for lack of a wife at his elbow was quickly engaged in appeasing the great british hunger for news second only to that for beef it seems and equally acceptable salted when it cannot be had fresh leaving the devotee of statecraft with his legs crossed and his face wearing the cognizant air of one whose head is above the waters of events to enjoy the mighty meal of fresh and salted at discretion the countess dived below meantime the jocasta as smoothly as before she was ignorant of how the world wagged slipped up the river with the tide and the sun hung red behind the forest of masts burnishing a broad length of the serpentine haven of the nations of the earth a young englishman returning home can hardly look on this scene without some pride of kinship evan stood at the fore part of the vessel rose in quiet english attire had escaped from her aunt to join him singing in his ears to spur his senses isnt it beautiful isnt it beautiful dear old england what do you find so beautiful he asked oh you dull fellow why the ships and the houses and the smoke to be sure the ships why i thought you despised trade mademoiselle and so i do that is not trade but tradesmen of course i mean shopkeepers its they who send the ships to and fro and make the picture that pleases you nevertheless do they said she indifferently and then with a sort of fervour why do you always grow so cold to me whenever we get on this subject i cold evan responded the incessant fears of his diplomatic sister had succeeded in making him painfully jealous of this subject he turned it off why our feelings are just the same do you know what i was thinking when you came up i was thinking that i hoped i might never disgrace the name of an englishman now thats noble cried the girl and im sure you never will of an english gentleman evan i like that better would your rather be called a true english lady than a true english woman rose dont think i would my dear she answered pertly but gentleman always means more than man to me and whats a gentleman mademoiselle cant tell you don doloroso something you are sir she added surveying him evan sucked the bitter and the sweet of her explanation his sister in her anxiety to put him on his guard had not beguiled him to forget his real state his sister the diplomatist and his lady the refugee count with ladies maids servants and luggage were now on the maindeck and master alec who was as good as a newspaper correspondent for private conversations put an end to the colloquy of the young people they were all assembled in a circle when the vessel came to her moorings the diplomatist glutted with news and thirsting for confirmations the count dumb courteous and quickeyed the honourable lady complacent in the consciousness of boxes well packed the countess breathing mellifluous longdrawn adieux that should provoke invitations evan and rose regarded each other the boat to convey them on shore was being lowered and they were preparing to move forward just then the vessel was boarded by a stranger is that one of the creatures of your customs i did imagine we were safe from them exclaimed the countess the diplomatist laughingly requested her to save herself anxiety on that score while under his wing but she had drawn attention to the intruder who was seen addressing one of the midshipmen he was a man in a long brown coat and loose white neckcloth spectacles on nose which he wore considerably below the bridge and peered over as if their main use were to sight his eye a beaver hat with broadish brim on his head a man of no station it was evident to the ladies at once and they would have taken no further notice of him had he not been seen stepping toward them in the rear of the young midshipman the latter came to evan and said a fellow of the name of goren wants you says theres something the matter at home evan advanced and bowed stiffly mr goren held out his hand you dont remember me young man i cut out your first suit for you when you were breeched though yesah your poor father wouldnt put his hand to it goren embarrassed and not quite alive to the chapter of facts this name should have opened to him evan bowed again goren continued the possessor of the name he had a cracked voice that when he spoke a word of two syllables commenced with a lugubrious crow and ended in what one might have taken for a curious question it is a bad business brings me young man i m not the best messenger for such tidings its a black suit young man its your father the diplomatist and his lady gradually edged back but rose remained beside the countess who breathed quick and seemed to have lost her selfcommand thinking he was apprehended mr goren said i m going down tonight to take care of the shop he s to be buried in his old uniform you had better come with me by the nightcoach if you would see the last of him young man breaking an odd pause that had fallen the countess cried aloud suddenly in his uniform mr goren felt his arm seized and his legs hurrying him some paces into isolation thanks thanks was murmured in his ear not a word more evan cannot bear it oh you are good to have come and we are grateful my father my father she had to tighten her hand and wrist against her bosom to keep herself up she had to reckon in a glance how much rose had heard or divined she had to mark whether the count had understood a syllable she had to whisper to evan to hasten away with the horrible man she had to enliven his stunned senses and calm her own and with mournful images of her father in her brain the female spartan had to turn to rose and speculate on the girls reflective brows while she said as over a distant relative sadly but without distraction a death in the family and preserved herself from weeping her heart out that none might guess the thing who did not positively know it evan touched the hand of rose without meeting her eyes he was soon cast off in mr gorens boat then the countess murmured final adieux twilight under her lids but yet a smile stately affectionate almost genial rose her sweet rose she must kiss she could have slapped rose for appearing so reserved and cold she hugged rose as to hug oblivion of the last few minutes into her the girl leant her cheek and bore the embrace looking on her with a kind of wonder only when alone with the count in the brewers carriage awaiting her on shore did the lady give a natural course to her grief well knowing that her silva would attribute it to the darkness of their common exile she wept but in the excess of her misery two words of strangely opposite signification pronounced by mr goren two words that were at once poison and antidote sang in her brain two words that painted her dead father from head to foot his nature and his fortune these were the shop and the uniform oh what would she not have given to haveseen and bestowed on her beloved father one last kiss oh how she hoped that her inspired echo of uniform on board the jocasta had drowned the memory eclipsed the meaning of that fatal utterance of shop chapter v the family and the funeral it was the evening of the second day since the arrival of the black letter in london from lymport and the wife of the brewer and the wife of the major sat dropping tears into one anothers laps in expectation of their sister the countess mr andrew cogglesby had not yet returned from his office the gallant major had gone forth to dine with general sir george frebuter the head of the marines of his time it would have been difficult for the major he informed his wife to send in an excuse to the general for nonattendance without entering into particulars and that he should tell the general he could not dine with him because of the sudden decease of a tailor was as he let his wife understand and requested her to perceive quite out of the question so he dressed himself carefully and though peremptory with his wife concerning his linen and requiring natural services from her in the button department and a casual expression of contentment as to his ultimate makeup he left her that day without any final injunctions to occupy her mind and she was at liberty to weep if she pleased a privilege she did not enjoy undisturbed when he was present for the warrior hated that weakness and did not care to hide his contempt for it of the three sisters the wife of the major was oddly enough the one who was least inveterately solicitous of concealing the fact of her parentage reticence of course she had to study with the rest the major was a walking book of reticence and the observances he professed also in company with herself alone to have had much trouble in drilling her to mark and properly preserve them she had no desire to speak of her birthplace but for some reason or other she did not share her heros rather petulant anxiety to keep the curtain nailed down on that part of her life which preceded her entry into the ranks of the royal marines some might have thought that those fair large blue eyes of hers wandered now and then in pleasant unambitious walks behind the curtain and toyed with little flowers of palest memory utterly tasteless totally wanting in discernment not to say gratitude the major could not presume her to be and yet his wits perceived that her answers and the conduct she shaped in accordance with his repeated protests and long reaching apprehensions of what he called danger betrayed acquiescent obedience more than the connubial sympathy due to him danger on the field the major knew not of he did not scruple to name the word in relation to his wife for as he told her should he some day as in the chapter of accidents might occur sally into the street a knight companion of the bath and become known to men as sir maxwell strike it would be decidedly disagreeable for him to be blown upon by a wind from lymport moreover she was the mother of a son the major pointed out to her the duty she owed her offspring certainly the protecting aegis of his rank and title would be over the lad but she might depend upon it any indiscretion of hers would damage him in his future career the major assured her young maxwell must be considered for all this the mother and wife when the black letter found them in the morning at breakfast had burst into a fit of grief and faltered that she wept for a father mrs andrew to whom the letter was addressed had simply held the letter to her in a trembling hand the major compared their behaviour with marked encomiums of mrs andrew now this lady and her husband were in obverse relative positions the brewer had no will but his harriets his esteem for her combined the constitutional feelings of an insignificantlybuilt little man for a majestic woman and those of a worthy soul for the wife of his bosom possessing or possessed by her the good brewer was perfectly happy she it might be thought under these circumstances would not have minded much his hearing what he might hear it happened however that she was as jealous of the winds of lymport as the major himself as vigilant in debarring them from access to the brewery as now the countess could have been we are not dissecting human nature suffice it therefore from a mere glance at the surface to say that just as moneyed men are careful of their coin women who have all the advantages in a conjunction are miserly in keeping them and shudder to think that one thing remains hidden which the world they move in might put down pityingly in favour of their spouse even though to the little man twere naught she assumed that a revelation would diminish her moral stature and certainly it would not increase that of her husband so no good could come of it besides andrew knew his whole conduct was a tacit admission that she had condescended in giving him her hand the features of their union might not be changed altogether by a revelation but it would be a shock to her consequently harriet tenderly rebuked caroline for her outcry at the breakfasttable and caroline the elder sister who had not since marriage grown in so free an air excused herself humbly and the two were weeping when the countess joined them and related what she had just undergone hearing of carolines misdemeanour however louisas eyes rolled aloft in a paroxysm of tribulation it was nothing to caroline it was comparatively nothing to harriet but the count knew not louisa had a father believed that her parents had long ago been wiped out and the count was by nature inquisitive and if he once cherished a suspicion he was restless he was pointed in his inquiries he was pertinacious in following out a clue there never would be peace with him and then as they were secure in their privacy louisa cried aloud for her father her beloved father harriet wept silently caroline alone expressed regret that she had not set eyes on him from the day she became a wife how could we dear the countess pathetically asked under drowning lids papa did not wish it sobbed mrs andrew i never shall forgive myself said the wife of the major drying her cheeks perhaps it was not herself whom she felt she never could forgive ah the man their father was incomparable melchisedec he might well be called so generous so lordly when the rain of tears would subside for a moment one would relate an anecdote or childish reminiscence of him and provoke a more violent outburst never among the nobles of any land never have i seen one like him exclaimed the countess and immediately requested harriet to tell her how it would be possible to stop andrews tongue in silvas presence at present you know my dear they may talk as much as they likethey cant understand one another one bit mrs cogglesby comforted her by the assurance that andrew had received an intimation of her wish for silence everywhere and toward everybody and that he might be reckoned upon to respect it without demanding a reason for the restriction in other days caroline and louisa had a little looked down on harriets alliance with a dumpy mana brewerand had always kind christian compassion for him if his name were mentioned they seemed now by their silence to have a happier estimate of andrews qualities while the three sisters sat mingling their sorrows and alarms their young brother was making his way to the house as he knocked at the door he heard his name pronounced behind him and had no difficulty in recognizing the worthy brewer what van my boy how are you quite a foreigner by george what a hat mr andrew bounced back two or three steps to regard the dusky sombrero how do you do sir said evan sir to you mr andrew briskly replied dont they teach you to give your fist in portugal eh ill sir you wait till im sir andrew and then sir away you do speak english still van eh quite jolly my boy mr andrew rubbed his hands to express that state in himself suddenly he stopped blinked queerly at evan grew pensive and said bless my soul i forgot the door opened mr andrew took evans arm murmured a hush and trod gently along the passage to his library were safe here he said theretheres something the matter up stairs the women are upset about something harriet mr andrew hesitated and branched off you ve heard we ve got a new baby evan congratulated him but another inquiry was in mr andrews aspect and evans calm sad manner answered it yesmr andrew shook his head dolefullya splendid little chap a rare little chap a we cant help these things van they will happen sit down my boy mr andrew again interrogated evan with his eyes my father is dead said evan yes mr andrew nodded and glanced quickly at the ceiling as if to make sure that none listened overhead my parliamentary duties will soon be over for the season he added aloud pursuing in an under breath going down tonight van he is to be buried tomorrow said evan then of course you go yes quite right love your father and mother always love your father and mother old tom and i never knew ours toms quite wellsame as ever ill he rang the bell have my chop in here with you you must try and eat a bit van here we are and there we go old toms wandering for one of his weeks youll see him some day he aint like me no dinner today i suppose charles this was addressed to the footman he announced dinner today at halfpast six as usual sir bowed and retired mr andrew pored on the floor and rubbed his hair back on his head an odd world was his remark evan lifted up his face to sigh i m almost sick of it damn appearances cried mr andrew jumping on his legs the action cooled him i m sorry i swore he said bad habit the majors hereyou know that and he assumed the majors voice and strutted in imitation of the stalwart marine majorastrike of the royal marines returned from china covered with glorya hero van we cant expect him to be much of a mourner and we shant have him to dine with us todaythats something he sank his voice i hope the widow ll bear it i hope to god my mother is well evan groaned thatll do said mr andrew dont say any more as he spoke he clapped evan kindly on the back a message was brought from the ladies requiring evan to wait on them he returned after some minutes how do you think harriets looking asked mr andrew and not waiting for an answer whispered are they going down to the funeral my boy evans brow was dark as he replied they are not decided wont harriet go she is not goingshe thinks not and the countesslouisas upstairs ehwill she go she cannot leave the countshe thinks not wont caroline go caroline can go shehei meancaroline can go the major objects she wishes to mr andrew struck out his arm and uttered the majora compromise for a loud anathema but the compromise was vain for he sinned again in an explosion against appearances im a brewer van do you think im ashamed of it not while i brew good beer my boynot while i brew good beer they dont think worse of me in the house for it it isnt ungentlemanly to brew good beer van but whats the use of talking mr andrew sat down and murmured poor girl poor girl the allusion was to his wife for presently he said i cant see why harriet cant go whats to prevent her evan gazed at him steadily deaths levelling influence was in evans mind he was ready to say why and fully mr andrew arrested him with a sharp never mind harriet does as she likes im accustomed tohem what she does is best after all she doesnt interfere with my business nor i with hers man and wife pausing a moment or so mr andrew intimated that they had better be dressing for dinner with his hand on the door which he kept closed he said in a businesslike way you know van as for me i should be very willingonly too happyto go down and pay all the respect i could he became confused and shot his head from side to side looking anywhere but at evan happy now and tomorrow to do anything in my power if harrietfollow the funeralone of the familyanything i could do butawe d better be dressing for dinner and out the enigmatic little man went evan partly divined him then but at dinner his behaviour was perplexing he was too cheerful he pledged the count he would have the portuguese for this and that and make anglican efforts to repeat it and laugh at his failures he would not see that there was a father dead at a table of actors mr andrew overdid his part and was the worst his wife could not help thinking him a heartless little man the poor show had its term the ladies fled to the boudoir sacred to grief evan was whispered that he was to join them when he might without seeming mysterious to the count before he reached them they had talked tearfully over the clothes he should wear at lymport agreeing that his present foreign apparel being black would be suitable and would serve almost as disguise to the inhabitants at large and as evan had no english wear and there was no time to procure any for him that was well they arranged exactly how long he should stay at lymport whom he should visit the manner he should adopt toward the different inhabitants by all means he was to avoid the approach of the gentry for hours evan in a trance half stupefied had to listen to the countesss directions how he was to comport himself in lymport show that you have descended among them dear van but are not of them our beautiful noble english poet expresses it so you have come to pay the last mortal duties which they will respect if they are not brutes and attempt no familiarities allow none gently but firmly imitate silva you remember at dona risbondas ball when he met the comte de dartigues and knew he was to be in disgrace with his court on the morrow oh the exquisite shade of difference in silvas behaviour towards the comte so finely delicately perceptible to the comte and not a soul saw it but that wretched frenchman he came to me madame he said is a question permitted i replied asmany as you please m le comte but no answers promised he said may i ask if the courier has yet come innay m le comte i replied this is diplomacy inquire of me or better give me an opinion on the new glace silk from parismadame said he bowing i hope paris may send me aught so good or that i shall grace half so well i smiled you shall not be single in your hopes m le comte the gift would be base that you did not embellish he lifted his hands frenchfashion madame it is that i have received the giftindeed m le comteeven now from the count de saldar your husband i looked most innocently from my husband m le comtefrom him madame a portrait an ambassador without his coat the portrait was a finished performance i said and may one beg the permission to inspect itmais said he laughing were it you alone it would be a privilege to me i had to check him believe me m le comte that when i look upon it my praise of the artist will be extinguished by my pity for the subject he should have stopped there but you cannot have the last word with a frenchmannot even a woman fortunately the queen just then made her entry into the saloon and his mot on the charity of our sex was lost we bowed mutually and were separated the countess employed her handkerchief yes dear van that is how you should behave imply things with dearest mama of course you are the dutiful son alas you must stand for son and daughters mama has so much sense she will understand how sadly we are placed but in a week i will come to her for a day and bring you back so much his sister louisa his sister harriet offered him her house for a home in london thence to project his new career his sister caroline sought a word with him in private but only to weep bitterly in his arms and utter a faint moan of regret at marriages in general he loved this beautiful creature the best of his three sisters partly it may be because he despised her superior officer and tried with a few smothered words to induce her to accompany him but she only shook her fair locks and moaned afresh mr andrew in the farewell squeeze of the hand at the streetdoor asked him if he wanted anything he negatived the requirement of anything whatever with an air of careless decision though he was aware that his purse barely contained more than would take him the distance but the instincts of this amateur gentleman were very fine and sensitive on questions of money his family had never known him beg for a shilling or admit his necessity for a penny nor could he be made to accept money unless it was thrust into his pocket somehow his sisters had forgotten this peculiarity of his harriet only remembered it when too late but i dare say andrew has supplied him she said andrew being interrogated informed her what had passed between them and you think a harrington would confess he wanted money was her scornful exclamation evan would walkhe would die rather it was treating him like a mendicant andrew had to shrink in his brewers skin by some fatality all who were doomed to sit and listen to the countess de saldar were sure to be behindhand in an appointment when the young man arrived at the coachoffice he was politely informed that the vehicle in which a seat had been secured for him was in close alliance with time and tide and being under the same rigid laws could not possibly have waited for him albeit it had stretched a point to the extent of a pair of minutes at the urgent solicitation of a passenger a gentleman who speaks so sir said a volunteer mimic of the office crowing and questioning from his throat in gorens manner yok yok that was how he spoke sir evan reddened for it brought the scene on board the jocasta vividly to his mind the heavier business obliterated it he took counsel with the clerks of the office and eventually the volunteer mimic conducted him to certain livery stables where evan like one accustomed to command ordered a chariot to pursue the coach received a touch of the hat for a lordly fee and was soon rolling out of london chapter vi my gentleman on the road the postillion had every reason to believe that he carried a real gentleman behind him in other words a purse long and liberal he judged by all the points he knew of a firm voice a brief commanding style an apparent indifference to expense and the inexplicable minor characteristics such as polished boots and a striking wristband and so forth which will show a creature accustomed to step over the heads of men he had therefore no particular anxiety to part company and jogged easily on the white highway beneath a moon that walked high and small over marble clouds evan reclined in the chariot revolving his sensations in another mood he would have called them thoughts perhaps and marvelled at their immensity the theme was love and death one might have supposed from his occasional mutterings at the pace regulated by the postillion that he was burning with anxiety to catch the flying coach he had forgotten it forgotten that he was giving chase to anything a pair of wondering feminine eyes pursued him and made him fret for the miles to throw a thicker veil between him and them the serious level brows of rose haunted the poor youth and reflecting whither he was tending and to what sight he had shadowy touches of the holiness there is in death from which came a conflict between the imaged phantoms of his father and of rose and he sided against his love with some bitterness his sisters weeping for their father and holding aloof from his ashes evan swept from his mind he called up the man his father was the kindliness the readiness the gallant gaiety of the great mel youths are fascinated by the barbarian virtues and to evan under present influences his father was a pattern of manhood he asked himself was it infamous to earn ones bread and answered it very strongly in his fathers favour the great mels creditors were not by to show him another feature of the case hitherto in passive obedience to the indoctrination of the countess evan had looked on tailors as the proscribed race of modern society he had pitied his father as a man superior to his fate but despite the fitfully honest promptings with rose tempting to him because of the wondrous chivalry they argued and at bottom false probably as the hypocrisy they affected to combat he had been by no means sorry that the world saw not the spot on himself other sensations beset him now since such a man was banned by the world which was to be despised the clear result of evans solitary musing was to cast a sort of halo over tailordom death stood over the pale dead man his father and dared the world to sneer at him by a singular caprice of fancy evan had no sooner grasped this image than it was suggested that he might as well inspect his purse and see how much money he was master of are you impatient with this young man he has little character for the moment most youths are like popes women they have no character at all and indeed a character that does not wait for circumstances to shape it is of small worth in the race that must be run to be set too early is to take the work out of the hands of the sculptor who fashions men happily a youth is always at school and if he was shut up and without mark two or three hours ago he will have something to show you now as i have seen blooming seaflowers and other graduated organisms when left undisturbed to their own action where the fates have designed that he shall present his figure in a story this is sure to happen to the postillion evan was indebted for one of his first lessons about an hour after midnight pastoral stillness and the moon begat in the postillion desire for a pipe daylight prohibits the dream of it to mounted postillions at night the question is more human and allows appeal the moon smiles assentingly and smokers know that she really lends herself to the enjoyment of tobacco the postillion could remember gentlemen who did not object who had even given him cigars turning round to see if haply the present inmate of the chariot might be smoking he observed a head extended from the window how far are we was inquired the postillion numbered the milestones passed do you see anything of the coach cant say as i do sir he was commanded to stop evan jumped out i dont think ill take you any farther he said the postillion laughed to scorn the notion of his caring how far he went with a pipe in his mouth he insinuatingly remarked he could jog on all night and throw sleep to the dogs fresh horses at hillford fresh at fallow field and the gentleman himself would reach lymport fresh in the morning no no i wont take you any farther evan repeated but what do it matter sir urged the postillion id rather go on as i am iamade no arrangement to take you the whole way oh cried the postillion dont you go troublin yourself about that sir master knows it s touchandgo about catchin the coach im all right so infatuated was the fellow in the belief that he was dealing with a perfect gentlemanan easy pocket now you would not suppose that one who presumes he has sufficient would find a difficulty in asking how much he has to pay with an effort indifferently masked evan blurted by the way tell mehow muchwhat is the charge for the distance weve come there are gentlemenscrews there are conscientious gentlemen they calculate and remonstrating or not they pay the postillion would rather have had to do with the gentleman royal who is above base computation but he knew the humanity in the class he served and with his conception of evan only partially dimmed he remarked ohhh that wont hurt you sir jump along insettle that byand by but when my gentleman stood fast and renewed the demand to know the exact charge for the distance already traversed the postillion dismounted glanced him over and speculated with his fingers tipping up his hat meantime evan drew out his purse a long one certainly but limp out of this drownedlooking wretch the last spark of life was taken by the sum the postillion ventured to name and if paying your utmost farthing without examination of the charge and cheerfully stepping out to walk fifty miles penniless constituted a postillions gentleman evan would have passed the test the sight of poverty however provokes familiar feelings in poor men if you have not had occasion to show them you possess particular qualities the postillions eye was more on the purse than on the sum it surrendered there said evan i shall walk good night and he flung his cloak to step forward stop a bit sir arrested him the postillion rallied up sideways with an assumption of genial respect i didnt calclate myself in that there amount were these words think you of a character to strike a young man hard on the breast send the blood to his head and set up in his heart a derisive chorus my gentleman could pay his money and keep his footing gallantly but to be asked for a penny beyond what he possessed to be seen beggared and to be claimed a debtoraleck pride was the one developed faculty of evans nature the fates who mould us always work from the mainspring i will not say that the postillion stripped off the mask for him at that instant completely but he gave him the first true glimpse of his condition from the vague sense of being an impostor evan awoke to the clear fact that he was likewise a fool it was impossible for him to deny the mans claim and he would not have done it if he could acceding tacitly he squeezed the ends of his purse in his pocket and with a let me see tried his waistcoat not too impetuously for he was careful of betraying the horrid emptiness till he was certain that the powers who wait on gentlemen had utterly forsaken him they had not he discovered a small coin under ordinary circumstances not contemptible but he did not stay to reflect and was guilty of the error of offering it to the postillion the latter peered at it in the centre of his palm gazed queerly in the gentlemans face and then lifting the spit of silver for the disdain of his mistress the moon he drew a long breath of regret at the original mistake he had committed and said thats what youre goin to give me for my nights work the powers who wait on gentlemen had only helped the pretending youth to try him a rejection of the demand would have been infinitely wiser and better than this paltry compromise the postillion would have fought it he would not have despised his fare how much it cost the poor pretender to reply it s the last farthing i have my man the postillion could not know a scabby sixpence the postillion continued his question you heard what i said evan remarked the postillion drew another deep breath and holding out the coin at arms length well sir he observed as one whom mental conflict has brought to the philosophy of the case now was we to change places i couldnt a done it i couldnt a done it he reiterated pausing emphatically take it sir he magnanimously resumed take it you rides when you can and you walks when you must lord forbid i should rob such a gentleman as you one who feels a death is for the hour lifted above the satire of postillions a good genius prompted evan to avoid the silly squabble that might have ensued and made him ridiculous he took the money quietly saying thank you not to lose his vantage the postillion though a little staggered by the move rejoined dont mention it evan then said good night my man i wont wish for your sake that we changed places you would have to walk fifty miles to be in time for your fathers funeral good night you are it to look at was the postillions comment seeing my gentleman depart with great strides he did not speak offensively rather it seemed to appease his conscience for the original mistake he had committed for subsequently came my oath on it i dont get took in again by a squash hat in a hurry unaware of the ban he had by a sixpenny stamp put upon an unoffending class evan went ahead hearing the wheels of the chariot still dragging the road in his rear the postillion was in a dissatisfied state of mind he had asked and received more than his due but in the matter of his sweet self he had been choused as he termed it and my gentleman had baffled him he could not quite tell how but he had been got the better of his sarcasms had not stuck and returned to rankle in the bosom of their author as a jew therefore may eye an erewhile bondsman who has paid the bill but stands out against excess of interest on legal grounds the postillion regarded evan of whom he was now abreast eager for a controversy fine night said the postillion to begin and was answered by a short assent lateish for a poor man to be outdont you think sir eh i ought to think so said evan mastering the shrewd unpleasantness he felt in the colloquy forced on him oh you youre a gentleman the postillion ejaculated you see i have no money feel it too sir i am sorry you should be the victim victim the postillion seized on an objectionable word i aint no victim unless you was up to a joke with me sir just now was that the game evan informed him that he never played jokes with money or on men cause it looks like it sir to go to offer a poor chap sixpence the postillion laughed hollow from the end of his lungs sixpence for a nights work it is a joke if you dont mean it for one why do you know sir i could gothere i dont care where it isi could go before any magistrate livin and hed make ye pay its a charge as custom is and hed make ye pay or prhaps youre a goin on my generosity and ll say he gev back that sixpence well i shouldnt a thought a gentlemand make that his defence before a magistrate but there my man if it makes ye happy keep it but you take my advice sir when you hires a chariot see youve got the shiners and dont you go never again offerin a sixpence to a poor man for a nights work they dont like it it hurts their feelins dont you forget that sir lay that up in your mind now the postillion having thus relieved himself jeeringly asked permission to smoke a pipe to which evan said pray smoke if it pleases you and the postillion hardly mollified added the baccys paid for and smoked as will sometimes happen the feelings of the man who had spoken out and behaved doubtfully grew gentle and christian whereas those of the man whose bearing under the trial had been irreproachable were much the reverse the postillion smokedhe was a lord on his horse he beheld my gentleman trudging in the dust awhile he enjoyed the contrast dividing his attention between the footfarer and moon to have had the last word is always a great thing and to have given my gentleman a lecture because he shunned a dispute also counts and then there was the poor young fellow trudging to his fathers funeral the postillion chose to remember that now in reality he allowed he had not very much to complain of and my gentlemans courteous avoidance of provocation the apparent fact that he the postillion had humbled him and got the better of him equally it may be acted on his fine english spirit i should not like to leave out the tobacco in this good change that was wrought in him however he presently astonished evan by pulling up his horses and crying that he was on his way to hillford to bait and saw no reason why he should not take a lift that part of the road at all events evan thanked him briefly but declined and paced on with his head bent it wont cost you nothingnot a sixpence the postillion sang out pursuing him come sir be a man i aint a hintin at anything jump in evan again declined and looked out for a side path to escape the fellow whose bounty was worse to him than his abuse and whose mention of the sixpence was unlucky dash it cried the postillion youre going down to a funeral i think you said your fathers siryou may as well try and get there respectableas far as i go its one to me whether youre in or out the horses wont feel it and i do wish youd take a lift and welcome its because youre too much of a gentleman to be beholden to a poor man i suppose evans young pride may have had a little of that base mixture in it and certainly he would have preferred that the invitation had not been made to him but he was capable of appreciating what the rejection of a piece of friendliness involved and as he saw that the man was sincere he did violence to himself and said very well then ill jump in the postillion was off his horse in a twinkling and trotted his bandy legs to undo the door as to a gentleman who paid this act of service evan valued suppose i were to ask you to take the sixpence now he said turning round with one foot on the step well sir the postillion sent his hat aside to answer i dont want itid rather not have it but there ill take itdash the sixpence and well cry quits evan surprised and pleased with him dropped the bit of money in his hand saying it will fill a pipe for you while you re smoking it think of me as in your debt youre the only man i ever owed a penny to the postillion put it in a side pocket apart and observed a sixpence kindly meant is worth any crownpiece thats grudgedthat it is in you jump sir its a jolly night thus may one not a conscious sage play the right tune on this human nature of ours by forbearance put it in the wrong and then by not refusing the burden of an obligation confer something better the instrument is simpler than we are taught to fancy but it was doubtless owing to a strong emotion in his soul as well as to the stuff he was made of that the youth behaved as he did we are now and then above our own actions seldom on a level with them evan i dare say was long in learning to draw any gratification from the fact that he had achieved without money the unparalleled conquest of a man perhaps he never knew what immediate influence on his fortune this episode effected at hillford they went their different ways the postillion wished him good speed and evan shook his hand he did so rather abruptly for the postillion was fumbling at his pocket and evidently rounding about a proposal in his mind my gentleman has now the road to himself money is the clothing of a gentleman he may wear it well or ill some you will mark carry great quantities of it gracefully some with a stinted supply present a decent appearance very few i imagine will bear inspection who are absolutely stripped of it all save the shameless are toiling to escape that trial my gentleman treading the white highway across the solitary heaths that swell far and wide to the moon is by the postillion who has seen him pronounced no sham nor do i think the opinion of any man worthless who has had the postillions authority for speaking but it is i am told a finer test to embellish much gentlemanapparel than to walk with dignity totally unadorned this simply tries the soundness of our faculties that tempts them in erratic directions it is the difference between active and passive excellence as there is hardly any situation however so interesting to reflect upon as that of a man without a penny in his pocket and a gizzard full of pride we will leave mr evan harrington to what fresh adventures may befall him walking toward the funeral plumes of the firs under the soft midsummer flush westward where his father lies chapter vii mother and son rare as epic song is the man who is thorough in what he does and happily so for in life he subjugates us and he makes us bondsmen to his ashes it was in the order of things that the great mel should be borne to his final restingplace by a troop of creditors you have seen since the occasion demands a pompous simile clouds that all day cling about the sun and in seeking to obscure him are compelled to blaze in his livery at fall of night they break from him illumined hang mournfully above him and wear his natural glories long after he is gone thus then these worthy fellows faithful to him to the dust fulfilled mels triumphant passage amongst them and closed his career to regale them when they returned mrs mel whose mind was not intent on greatness was occupied in spreading meat and wine mrs fiske assisted her as well as she could seeing that one hand was entirely engaged by her handkerchief she had already stumbled and dropped a glass which had brought on her sharp condemnation from her aunt who bade her sit down or go upstairs to have her cry out and then return to be serviceable oh i cant help it sobbed mrs fiske that he should be carried away and none of his children to see him the last time i can understand louisaand harriet too perhaps but why could not caroline and that they should be too fine ladies to let their brother come and bury his father oh it does seem mrs fiske fell into a chair and surrendered to grief where is the cold tongue said mrs mel to sally the maid in a brief undervoice please mum jacko he must be whipped you are a careless slut please i cant think of everybody and everything and poor master sally plumped on a seat and took sanctuary under her apron mrs mel glanced at the pair continuing her labour oh aunt aunt cried mrs fiske why didnt you put it off for another day to give evan a chance master d have kept another two days he would whimpered sally oh aunt to think cried mrs fiske and his coffin not bearin of his spurs whimpered sally mrs mel interrupted them by commanding sally to go to the drawingroom and ask a lady there of the name of mrs wishaw whether she would like to have some lunch sent up to her mrs fiske was requested to put towels in evans bedroom yes aunt if youre not infatuated said mrs fiske as she prepared to obey while sally seeing that her public exhibition of sorrow and sympathy could be indulged but an instant longer unwound herself for a violent paroxysm blurting between stops if hed onyve gone to his last bed comfortable if hed ony ve been that decent as not for to go to his last bed with his clothes on if hed onyve had a comfortable sheet it makes a woman feel cold to think of him full dressed there as if he was goin to be a soldier on the day o judgement to let people speak was a maxim of mrs mels and a wise one for any form of society when emotions are very much on the surface she continued her arrangements quietly and having counted the number of plates and glasses and told off the guests on her fingers she sat down to await them the first one who entered the room was her son you have come said mrs mel flushing slightly but otherwise outwardly calm you didnt suppose i should stay away from you mother evan kissed her cheek i knew you would not mrs mel examined him with those eyes of hers that compassed objects in a single glance she drew her finger on each side of her upper lip and half smiled saying that wont do here what asked evan and proceeded immediately to make inquiries about her health which she satisfied with a nod you saw him lowered van yes mother then go and wash yourself for you are dirty and then come and take your place at the head of the table must i sit here mother without a doubtyou must you know your room quick in this manner their first interview passed mrs fiske rushed in to exclaim so you were right aunthe has come i met him on the stairs oh how like dear uncle mel he looks in the militia with that moustache i just remember him as a child and oh what a gentleman he is at the end of the sentence mrs mels face suddenly darkened she said in a deep voice dont dare to talk that nonsense before him ann mrs fiske looked astonished what have i done aunt he shant be ruined by a parcel of fools said mrs mel there go women have no place here how the wretches can force themselves to touch a morsel after this morning mrs fiske exclaimed glancing at the table men must eat said mrs mel the mourners were heard gathering outside the door mrs fiske escaped into the kitchen mrs mel admitted them into the parlour bowing much above the level of many of the heads that passed her assembled were messrs barnes kilne and grossby whom we know mr doubleday the ironmonger mr joyce the grocer mr perkins commonly called lawyer perkins mr welbeck the piermaster of lymport bartholomew fiske mr coxwell a fallow field maltster brewer and farmer creditors of various dimensions all of them mr goren coming last behind his spectacles my son will be with you directly to preside said mrs mel accept my thanks for the respect you have shown my husband i wish you good morning morning maam answered several voices and mrs mel retired the mourners then set to work to relieve their hats of the appendages of crape an undertakers man took possession of the long black cloaks the gloves were generally pocketed thats my second black pair this year said joyce theyll last a time to come i dont need to buy gloves while neighbours pop off undertakers gloves seem to me as if theyre made for mutton fists remarked welbeck upon which kilne nudged barnes the butcher with a sharp aha and barnes observed oh i never wear emthey does for my boys on sundays i smoke a pipe at home the fallow field farmer held his length of crape aloft and inquired what shall do with this oh you keep it said one or two coxwell rubbed his chin dont like to rob the widder whats left goes to the undertaker asked grossby to be sure said barnes and kilne added its a job lawyer perkins ejaculating confidently perquisites of office gentlemen perquisites of office which settled the dispute and appeased every conscience a survey of the table ensued the mourners felt hunger or else thirst but had not it appeared amalgamated the two appetites as yet thirst was the predominant declaration and grossby after an examination of the decanters unctuously deduced the fact which he announced that port and sherry were present try the port said kilne good barnes inquired a very intelligent i ought to know with a reserve of regret at the extension of his intimacy with the particular vintage under that roof was winked by kilne lawyer perkins touched the arm of a mourner about to be experimental on kilnes port i think we had better wait till young mr harrington takes the table dont you see yesah croaked goren the head of the family as the saying goes i suppose we shant go into business today joyce carelessly observed lawyer perkins answered no you cant expect it mr harrington has led me to anticipate that he will appoint a day dont you see oh i see returned joyce i aint in such a hurry whats he doing doubleday whose propensities were waggish suggested shaving but half ashamed of it since the joke missed fell to as if he were soaping his face and had some trouble to contract his jaw the delay in evans attendance on the guests of the house was caused by the fact that mrs mel had lain in wait for him descending to warn him that he must treat them with no supercilious civility and to tell him partly the reason why on hearing the potential relations in which they stood toward the estate of his father evan hastily and with the assurance of a son of fortune said they should be paid thats what they would like to hear said mrs mel you may just mention it when theyre going to leave say you will fix a day to meet them every farthing pursued evan on whom the tidings were beginning to operate what debts my poor father and a thumping sum van you will open your eyes wider but it shall be paid motherit shall be paid debts i hate them id slave night and day to pay them mrs mel spoke in a more positive tense and so will i van now go it mattered little to her what sort of effect on his demeanour her revelation produced so long as the resolve she sought to bring him to was nailed in his mind and she was a woman to knock and knock again till it was firmly fixed there with a strong purpose and no plans there were few who could resist what in her circle she willed not even a youth who would gaily have marched to the scaffold rather than stand behind a counter a purpose wedded to plans may easily suffer shipwreck but an unfettered purpose that moulds circumstances as they arise masters us and is terrible character melts to it like metal in the steady furnace the projector of plots is but a miserable gambler and votary of chances of a far higher quality is the will that can subdue itself to wait and lay no petty traps for opportunity poets may fable of such a will that it makes the very heavens conform to it or i may add what is almost equal thereto one who would be a gentleman to consent to be a tailor the only person who ever held in his course against mrs mel was melher husband but with him she was under the physical fascination of her youth and it never left her in her heart she barely blamed him what he did she took among other inevitable matters the door closed upon evan and waiting at the foot of the stairs a minute to hear how he was received mrs mel went to the kitchen and called the name of dandy which brought out an illbuilt lowbrowed small man in a baggy suit of black who hopped up to her with a surly salute dandy was a bird mrs mel had herself brought down and she had for him something of a sportsmans regard for his victim dandy was the cleaner of boots and runner of errands in the household of melchisedec having originally entered it on a dark night by the cellar mrs mel on that occasion was sleeping in her dressinggown to be ready to give the gallant nighthawk her husband the service he might require on his return to the nest hearing a suspicious noise below she rose and deliberately loaded a pair of horsepistols weapons mel had worn in his holsters in the heroic days gone and with these she stepped downstairs straight to the cellar carrying a lantern at her girdle she could not only load but present and fire dandy was foremost in stating that she called him forth steadily three times before the pistol was discharged he admitted that he was frightened and incapable of speech at the apparition of the tall terrific woman after the third time of asking he had the ball lodged in his leg and fell mrs mel was in the habit of bearing heavier weights than dandy she made no ado about lugging him to a chamber where with her own hands for this woman had some slight knowledge of surgery and was great in herbs and drugs she dressed his wound and put him to bed crying contempt ever present in dandys memory at such a poor creature undertaking the work of housebreaker taught that he really was a poor creature for the work dandy his nursing over begged to be allowed to stop and wait on mrs mel and she who had like many strong natures a share of pity for the objects she despised did not cast him out a jerk in his gait owing to the bit of lead mrs mel had dropped into him and a little perhaps to her self satisfied essay in surgical science on his person earned him the name he went by when her neighbours remonstrated with her for housing a reprobate mrs mel would say dandy is wellfed and wellphysicked theres no harm in dandy by which she may have meant that the food won his gratitude and the physic reduced his humours she had observed human nature at any rate dandy was her creature and the great mel himself rallied her about her squire when were you drunk last was mrs mels address to dandy as he stood waiting for orders he replied to it in an altogether injured way there now youve been and called me away from my dinner to ask me that why when i had the last chance to be sure and you were at dinner in your new black suit well growled dandy i borrowed sallys apron seems i cant please ye mrs mel neither enjoined nor cared for outward forms of respect where she was sure of complete subserviency if dandy went beyond the limits she gave him an extra dose up to the limits he might talk as he pleased in accordance with mrs mels maxim that it was a necessary relief to all talking creatures now take off your apron she said and wash your hands dirty pig and go and wait at table in there she pointed to the parlourdoor come straight to me when everybody has left well there i am with the bottles again returned dandy it s your fault this time mind ill come as straight as i can dandy turned away to perform her bidding and mrs mel ascended to the drawingroom to sit with mrs wishaw who was as she told all who chose to hear an old flame of mels and was besides what mrs mel thought more of the wife of mels principal creditor a wholesale dealer in cloth resident in london the conviviality of the mourners did not disturb the house still men who are not accustomed to see the colour of wine every day will sit and enjoy it even upon solemn occasions and the longer they sit the more they forget the matter that has brought them together pleading their wives and shops however they released evan from his miserable office late in the afternoon his mother came down to himand saying i see how you did the journey you walked it told him to follow her yes mother evan yawned i walked part of the way i met a fellow in a gig about ten miles out of fallow field and he gave me a lift to flatsham i just reached lymport in time thank heaven i wouldnt have missed that by the way ive satisfied these men oh said mrs mel they wantedone or two of themwhat a penance it is to have to sit among those people an hourthey wanted to ask me about the business but i silenced them i told them to meet me here this day week mrs mel again said oh and pushing into one of the upper rooms heres your bedroom van just as you left it ah so it is muttered evan eyeing a print the douglas and the percy he took the dead man by the hand what an age it seems since i last saw that theres sir hugh montgomery on horsebackhe hasnt moved dont you remember my father calling it the battle of titfor tat gallant percy i know he wished he had lived in those days of knights and battles it does not much signify whom one has to make clothes for observed mrs mel her son happily did not mark her i think we neither of us were made for the days of pence and pounds he continued now mother sit down and talk to me about him did he mention me did he give me his blessing i hope he did not suffer id have given anything to press his hand and looking wistfully at the percy lifting the hand of douglas dead evans eyes filled with big tears he suffered very little returned mrs mel and his last words were about you what were they evan burst out i will tell you another time now undress and go to bed when i talk to you van i want a cool head to listen you do nothing but yawn yard measures the mouth of the weary youth instinctively snapped short the abhorred emblem here i will help you van in spite of his remonstrances and petitions for talk she took off his coat and waistcoat contemptuously criticizing the cloth of foreign tailors and their absurd cut have you heard from louisa asked evan yes yesabout your sisters byandby now be good and go to bed she still treated him like a boy whom she was going to force to the resolution of a man dandys sleepingroom was on the same floor as evans thither when she had quitted her son she directed her steps she had heard dandy tumble upstairs the moment his duties were over and knew what to expect when the bottles had been in his way for drink made dandy savage and a terror to himself it was her command to him that when he happened to come across liquor he should immediately seek his bedroom and bolt the door and dandy had got the habit of obeying her on this occasion he was vindictive against her seeing that she had delivered him over to his enemy with malice prepense a good deal of knocking and summoning of dandy by name was required before she was admitted and the sight of her did not delight him as he testified i m drunk he bawled will that do for ye mrs mel stood with her two hands crossed above her apronstring noting his sullen lurking eye with the calm of a tamer of beasts you go out of the room im drunk dandy repeated and pitched forward on the bedpost in the middle of an oath she understood that it was pure kindness on dandys part to bid her go and be out of his reach and therefore on his becoming so abusive as to be menacing she without a shade of anger and in the most unruffled manner administered to him the remedy she had reserved in the shape of a smart box on the ear which sent him flat to the floor he rose after two or three efforts quite subdued now dandy sit on the edge of the bed dandy sat on the extreme edge and mrs mel pursued now dandy tell me what your master said at the table talked at em like a lord he did said dandy stupidly consoling the boxed ear what were his words dandys peculiarity was that he never remembered anything save when drunk and mrs mels dose had rather sobered him by degrees scratching at his head haltingly he gave the context gentlemen i hear for the first time youve claims against my poor father nobody shall ever say he died and any man was the worse for it ill meet you next week and ill bind myself by law heres lawyer perkins no mr perkins ill pay off every penny gentlemen look upon me as your debtor and not my father delivering this with tolerable steadiness dandy asked will that do that will do said mrs mel ill send you up some tea presently lie down dandy the house was dark and silent when evan refreshed by his rest descended to seek his mother she was sitting alone in the parlour with a tenderness which mrs mel permitted rather than encouraged evan put his arm round her neck and kissed her many times one of the symptoms of heavy sorrow a longing for the signs of love made evan fondle his mother and bend over her yearningly mrs mel said once dear van good boy and quietly sat through his caresses sitting up for me mother he whispered yes van we may as well have our talk out ah he took a chair close by her side tell me my fathers last words he said he hoped you would never be a tailor evans forehead wrinkled up theres not much fear of that then his mother turned her face on him and examined him with a rigorous placidity all her features seeming to bear down on him evan did not like the look you object to trade van yes decidedly motherhate it but thats not what i want to talk to you about didnt my father speak of me much he desired that you should wear his militia sword if you got a commission i have rather given up hope of the army said evan mrs mel requested him to tell her what a colonels full pay amounted to and again the number of years it required on a rough calculation to attain that grade in reply to his statement she observed a tailor might realize twice the sum in a quarter of the time what if he doesdouble or treble cried evan impetuously and to avoid the theme and cast off the bad impression it produced on him he rubbed his hands and said i want to talk to you about my prospects mother what are they mrs mel inquired the severity of her mien and sceptical coldness of her speech caused him to inspect them suddenly as if she had lent him her eyes he put them by till the gold should recover its natural shine saying by the way mother i ve written the half of a history of portugal have you said mrs mel for louisa no mother of course not to sell it albuquerque what a splendid fellow he was informing him that he knew she abominated foreign names she said and your prospects are writing histories of portugal no mother i was going to tell you i expect a government appointment mr jocelyn likes my worki think he likes me you know i was his private secretary for ten months you write a good hand his mother interposed and im certain i was born for diplomacy for an easy chair and an inkdish before you and lacqueys behind whats to be your income van evan carelessly remarked that he must wait and see a very proper thing to do said mrs mel for now that she had fixed him to some explanation of his prospects she could condescend in her stiff way to banter slightly touched by it evan pursued half laughing as men do who wish to propitiate common sense on behalf of what seems tolerably absurd it s not the immediate income you know mother one thinks of ones future in the diplomatic service as louisa says you come to be known to ministers gradually i mean that is they hear of you and if you show you have some capacitylouisa wants me to throw it up in time and stand for parliament andrew she thinks would be glad to help me to his seat once in parliament and known to ministers youyour career is open to you in justice to mr evan harrington it must be said he built up this extraordinary cardcastle to dazzle his mothers mind he had lost his right grasp of her character for the moment because of an undefined suspicion of something she intended and which sent him himself to take refuge in those flimsy structures while the very altitude he reached beguiled his imagination and made him hope to impress hers mrs mel dealt it one fillip and in the meantime how are you to live and pay the creditors though evan answered cheerfully oh they will wait and i can live on anything he was nevertheless floundering on the ground amid the ruins of the superb edifice and his mother upright and rigid continuing you can live on anything and they will wait and call your father a rogue he started grievously bitten by one of the serpents of earth good heaven mother what are you saying that they will call your father a rogue and will have a right to said the relentless woman not while i live evan exclaimed you may stop one mouth with your fist but you wont stop a dozen van evan jumped up and walked the room what am i to do he cried i will pay everything i will bind myself to pay every farthing what more can i possibly do make the money said mrs mels deep voice evan faced her my dear mother you are very unjust and inconsiderate i have been working and doing my best i promise what do the debts amount to something like l in all van very well youth is not alarmed by the sound of big sums very well i will pay it evan looked as proud as if he had just clapped down the full amount on the table out of the history of portugal half written and the prospect of a government appointment mrs mel raised her eyelids to him in timein time mother mention your proposal to the creditors when you meet them this day week she said neither of them spoke for several minutes then evan came close to her saying what is it you want of me mother i want nothing vani can support myself but what would you have me do mother be honest do your duty and dont be a fool about it i will try he rejoined you tell me to make the money where and how can i make it i am perfectly willing to work in this house said mrs mel and as this was pretty clear speaking she stood up to lend her figure to it here faltered evan what be a tailor the word did not sting her tongue i oh thats quite impossible said evan and visions of leprosy and rose shrinking her skirts from contact with him shadowed out and away in his mind understand your choice mrs mel imperiously spoke what are brains given you for to be played the fool with by idiots and women you have l to pay to save your father from being called a rogue you can only make the money in one way which is open to you this business might produce a thousand pounds ayear and more in seven or eight years you may clear your fathers name and live better all the time than many of your bankrupt gentlemen you have told the creditors you will pay them do you think theyre gaping fools to be satisfied by a history of portugal if you refuse to take the business at once they will sell me up and quite right too understand your choice theres mr goren has promised to have you in london a couple of months and teach you what he can he is a kind friend would any of your gentlemen acquaintance do the like for you understand your choice you will be a beggarthe son of a rogueor an honest man who has cleared his fathers name during this strenuously uttered allocution mrs mel though her chest heaved but faintly against her crossed hands showed by the dilatation of her eyes and the light in them that she felt her words there is that in the aspect of a fine frame breathing hard facts which to a youth who has been tumbled headlong from his cardcastles and airy fabrics is masterful and like the pressure of a fate evan drooped his head now said mrs mel you shall have some supper evan told her he could not eat i insist upon your eating said mrs mel empty stomachs are foul counsellors mother do you want to drive me mad cried evan she looked at him to see whether the string she held him by would bear the slight additional strain decided not to press a small point then go to bed and sleep on it she saidsure of himand gave her cheek for his kiss for she never performed the operation but kept her mouth as she remarked for food and speech and not for slobbering mummeries evan returned to his solitary room he sat on the bed and tried to think oppressed by horrible sensations of selfcontempt that caused whatever he touched to sicken him there were the douglas and the percy on the wall it was a happy and a glorious time was it not when men lent each other blows that killed outright when to be brave and cherish noble feelings brought honour when strength of arm and steadiness of heart won fortune when the fair stars of earthsweet womenwakened and warmed the love of squires of low degree this legacy of the dead mans hand evan would have paid it with his blood but to be in bondage all his days to it through it to lose all that was dear to him to wear the length of a loathed existencewe should pardon a young mans wretchedness at the prospect for it was in a time before our joyful era of universal equality yet he never cast a shade of blame upon his father the hours moved on and he found himself staring at his small candle which struggled more and more faintly with the morning light like his own flickering ambition against the facts of life etext editors

garb of peace we had across channel a host of dreadful military officers flashing swords at us for some critical observations of ours upon their sovereign threatening africs fires and savagery the case occurred in old days now and again sometimes upon imagined provocation more furiously than at others we were unarmed and the spectacle was distressing we had done nothing except to speak our minds according to the habit of the free and such an explosion appeared as irrational and excessive as that of a powder magazine in reply to nothing more than the light of a spark it was known that a valorous general of the algerian wars proposed to make a clean march to the capital of the british empire at the head of ten thousand men which seems a small quantity to think much about but they wore wide red breeches blown out by fame big as her cheeks and a ten thousand of that sort would never think of retreating their spectral advance on quaking london through kentish hopgardens sussex corn fields or by the pleasant hills of surrey after a gymnastic leap over the riband of salt water haunted many pillows and now those horrid shouts of the legions of caesar crying to the inheritor of an invading name to lead them against us as the origin of his title had led the army of gaul of old gloriously scared sweet sleep we saw them in imagination lining the opposite shore eagle and standard bearers and gallifers brandishing their fowls and their banners in a manner to frighten the decorum of the universe where were our men the returns of the census of our population were oppressively satisfactory and so was the condition of our youth we could row and ride and fish and shoot and breed largely we were athletes with a fine history and a full purse we had first rate sporting guns unrivalled park hacks and hunters promising babies to carry on the renown of england to the next generation and a wonderful press and a constitution the highest reach of practical human sagacity but where were our armed men where our great artillery where our proved captains to resist a sudden sharp trial of the national mettle where was the first line of englands defence her navy these were questions and ministers were called upon to answer them the press answered them boldly with the appalling statement that we had no navy and no army at the most we could muster a few old ships a couple of experimental vessels of war and twenty five thousand soldiers indifferently weaponed we were in fact as naked to the imperial foe as the merely painted britons this being apprehended by the aid of our own shortness of figures and the agitated images of the red breeched only waiting the signal to jump and be at us there ensued a curious exhibition that would be termed in simple language writing to the newspapers for it took the outward form of letters in reality it was the deliberate saddling of our ancient nightmare of invasion putting the postillion on her and trotting her along the high road with a winding horn to rouse old panic panic we will for the sake of convenience assume to be of the feminine gender and a spinster though properly she should be classed with the large mixed race of mental and moral neuters which are the bulk of comfortable nations she turned in her bed at first like the sluggard of the venerable hymnist but once fairly awakened she directed a stare toward the terrific foreign contortionists and became in an instant all stormy nightcap and fingers starving for the bell rope forthwith she burst into a series of shrieks howls and high piercing notes that caused even the parliamentary opposition in the heat of an assault on a parsimonious government to abandon its temporary advantage and be still awhile yet she likewise performed her part with a certain deliberation and method as if aware that it was a part she had to play in the composition of a singular people she did a little mischief by dropping on the stock markets in other respects she was harmless and inasmuch as she established a subject for conversation useful then lest she should have been taken too seriously the press which had kindled proceeded to extinguish her with the formidable engines called leading articles which fling fire or water as the occasion may require it turned out that we had ships ready for launching and certain regiments coming home from india hedges we had and a spirited body of yeomanry and we had pluck and patriotism the father and mother of volunteers innumerable things were not so bad panic however sent up a plaintive whine what country had anything like our treasures to defend countless riches beautiful women an inviolate soil true and it must be done ministers were authoritatively summoned to set to work immediately they replied that they had been at work all the time and were at work now they could assure the country that though they flourished no trumpets they positively guaranteed the safety of our virgins and coffers then the people rather ashamed abused the press for unreasonably disturbing them the press attacked old panic and stripped her naked panic with a desolate scream arraigned the parliamentary opposition for having inflated her to serve base party purposes the opposition challenged the allegations of government pointed to the trimness of army and navy during its term of office and proclaimed itself watch dog of the country which is at all events an office of a kind hereupon the ambassador of yonder ireful soldiery let fall a word saying by the faith of his master there was no necessity for watch dogs to bark an ardent and a reverent army had but fancied its beloved chosen chief insulted the chief and chosen held them in he despite obloquy discerned our merits and esteemed us so then panic or what remained of her was put to bed again the opposition retired into its kennel growling the people coughed like a man of two minds doubting whether he has been divinely inspired or has cut a ridiculous figure the press interpreted the cough as a warning to government and government launched a big ship with hurrahs and ordered the recruiting sergeant to be seen conspicuously and thus we obtained a moderate reinforcement of our arms it was not arrived at by connivance all round though there was a look of it certainly it did not come of accident though there was a look of that as well nor do we explain much of the secret by attributing it to the working of a complex machinery the housewifes remedy of a good shaking for the invalid who will not arise and dance away his gout partly illustrates the action of the press upon the country and perhaps the country shaken may suffer a comparison with the family chariot of the last century built in a previous one commodious furnished agreeably being all that the inside occupants could require of a conveyance until the report of horsemen crossing the heath at a gallop sets it dishonourably creaking and complaining in rapid motion and the squire curses his miserly purse that would not hire a guard and his dame says i told you sofoolhardy man to suppose because we have constables in the streets of big cities we have dismissed the highwayman to limbo and here he is and he will cost you fifty times the sum you would have laid out to keep him at a miles respectful distance but see the wretch is bowing he smiles at our carriage and tells the coachman that he remembers he has been our guest and really thinks we need not go so fast he leaves word for you sir on your peril to denounce him on another occasion from the magisterial bench for that albeit he is a gentleman of the road he has a mission to right society and succeeds legitimately to that bold good robin hood who fed the poorfresh from this polite encounter the squire vows money for his personal protection and he determines to speak his opinion of sherwoods latest captain as loudly as ever that he will i do not say it might involve a large sum per annum similes are very well in their way none can be sufficient in this case without levelling a finger at the taxpayernay directly mentioning him he is the key of our ingenuity he pays his dues he will not pay the additional penny or two wanted of him that we may be a step or two ahead of the day we live in unless he is frightened but scarcely anything less than the wild alarum of a tocsin will frighten him consequently the tocsin has to be sounded and the effect is woeful past measure his hugging of his army his kneeling on the shore to his navy his implorations of his yeomanry and his hedges are sad to note his bursts of pot valiancy the male side of the maiden panic within his bosom are awful to his friends particular care must be taken after he has begun to cool and calculate his chances of security that he do not gather to him a curtain of volunteers and go to sleep again behind them for they cost little in proportion to the much they pretend to be to him patriotic taxpayers doubtless exist prophetic ones provident ones do not at least we show that we are wanting in them the taxpayer of a free land taxes himself and his disinclination for the bitter task save under circumstances of screaming urgencyas when the night gear and bed linen of old convulsed panic are like the churned channel sea in the track of two hundred hostile steamboats let me sayis of the kind the gentle schoolboy feels when death or an expedition has relieved him of his tyrant and he is entreated notwithstanding to go to his books will you not own that the working of the system for scaring him and bleeding is very ingenious but whether the ingenuity comes of native sagacity as it is averred by some or whether it shows an instinct labouring to supply the deficiencies of stupidity according to others i cannot express an opinion i give you the position of the country undisturbed by any moralizings of mine the youth i introduce to you will rarely let us escape from it for the reason that he was born with so extreme and passionate a love for his country that he thought all things else of mean importance in comparison and our union is one in which following the counsel of a sage and seer i must try to paint for you what is not that which i imagine this day this hour this life and even politics the centre and throbbing heart of it enough when unburlesqued to blow the down off the gossamer stump of fiction at a single breath i have heard tell must be treated of men and the ideas of men which areit is policy to be emphatic upon truismsare actually the motives of men in a greater degree than their appetites these are my theme and may it be my fortune to keep them at bloodheat and myself calm as a statue of memnon in prostrate egypt he sits there waiting for the sunlight i here and readier to be musical than you think i can at any rate be impartial and do but fix your eyes on the sunlight striking him and swallowing the day in rounding him and you have an image of the passive receptivity of shine and shade i hold it good to aim at if at the same time i may keep my characters at blood heat i shoot my arrows at a mark that is pretty certain to return them to me and as to perfect success i should be like the panic stricken shopkeepers in my alarm at it for i should believe that genii of the air fly above our tree tops between us and the incognizable spheres catching those ambitious shafts they deem it a promise of fun to play pranks with young mr beauchamp at that period of the panic had not the slightest feeling for the taxpayer he was therefore unable to penetrate the mystery of our roundabout way of enlivening him he pored over the journals in perplexity and talked of his indignation nightly to his pretty partners at balls who knew not they were lesser andromedas of his dear andromeda country but danced and chatted and were gay and said they were sure he would defend them the men he addressed were civil they listened to him sometimes with smiles and sometimes with laughter but approvingly liking the lads quick spirit they were accustomed to the machinery employed to give our land a shudder and to soothe it and generally remarked that it meant nothing his uncle everard and his uncles friend stukely culbrett expounded the nature of frenchmen to him saying that they were uneasy when not periodically thrashed it would be cruel to deny them their crow beforehand and so the pair of gentlemen pooh poohed the affair agreeing with him however that we had no great reason to be proud of our appearance and the grounds they assigned for this were the activity and the prevalence of the ignoble doctrines of manchestera power whose very existence was unknown to mr beauchamp he would by no means allow the burden of our national disgrace to be cast on one part of the nation we were insulted and all in a poultry flutter yet no one seemed to feel it but himself outside the press and parliament which must necessarily be the face we show to the foreigner absolute indifference reigned navy men and red coats were willing to join him or anybody in sneers at a clipping and paring miserly government but they were insensible to the insult the panic the startled poultry show the shame of our exhibition of ourselves in europe it looked as if the blustering french guard were to have it all their own way and what would they what could they but think of us he sat down to write them a challenge he is not the only englishman who has been impelled by a youthful chivalry to do that he is perhaps the youngest who ever did it and consequently there were various difficulties to be overcome as regards his qualifications for addressing frenchmen a year of his prae neptunal time had been spent in their capital city for the purpose of acquiring french of paris its latest refinements of pronunciation and polish and the art of conversing he had read the french tragic poets and molire he could even relish the gallic classicquil mourut and he spoke french passably being quite beyond the bullish treatment of the tongue writing a letter in french was a different undertaking the one he projected bore no resemblance to an ordinary letter the briefer the better of course but a tone of dignity was imperative and the tone must be individual distinctive nevil beauchamps though not in his native language first he tried his letter in french and lost sight of himself completely messieurs de la garde franaise was a good beginning the remainder gave him a false air of a masquerader most uncomfortable to see it was nevil beauchamp in moustache and imperial and bagbreeches badly fitting he tried english which was really himself and all that heart could desire supposing he addressed a body of midshipmen just a little loftily but the english when translated was bald and blunt to the verge of offensiveness gentlemen of the french guard i take up the glove you have tossed us i am an englishman that will do for a reason this might possibly pass with the gentlemen of the english guard but read messieurs de la garde franaise jaccepte votre gant je suis anglais la raison est suffisante and imagine french guardsmen reading it mr beauchamp knew the virtue of punctiliousness in epithets and phrases of courtesy toward a formal people and as the officers of the french guard were gentlemen of birth he would have them to perceive in him their equal at a glance on the other hand a bare excess of phrasing distorted him to a likeness of mascarille playing marquis how to be english and think french the business was as laborious as if he had started on the rough sea of the channel to get at them in an open boat the lady governing his uncle everards house mrs rosamund culling entered his room and found him writing with knitted brows she was young that is she was not in her middleage and they were the dearest of friends each had given the other proof of it nevil looked up and beheld her lifted finger you are composing a love letter nevil the accusation sounded like irony no said he puffing i wish i were what can it be then he thrust pen and paper a hands length on the table and gazed at her my dear nevil is it really anything serious said she i am writing french maam then i may help you it must be very absorbing for you did not hear my knock at your door now could he trust her the widow of a british officer killed nobly fighting for his country in india was a person to be relied on for active and burning sympathy in a matter that touched the countrys honour she was a woman and a woman of spirit men had not pleased him of late something might be hoped from a woman he stated his occupation saying that if she would assist him in his french she would oblige him the letter must be written and must go this was uttered so positively that she bowed her head amused by the funny semi tone of defiance to the person to whom he confided the secret she had humour and was ravished by his english boyishness with the novel blush of the heroical nonsensical in it mrs culling promised him demurely that she would listen objecting nothing to his plan only to his french messieurs de la garde franaise he commenced her criticism followed swiftly i think you are writing to the garde impriale he admitted his error and thanked her warmly messieurs de la garde impriale does not that she said include the non commissioned officers the privates and the cooks of all the regiments he could scarcely think that but thought it provoking the french had no distinctive working title corresponding to gentlemen and suggested messieurs les officiers which might mrs culling assured him comprise the barbers he frowned and she prescribed his writing messieurs les colonels de la garde impriale this he set down the point was that a stand must be made against the flood of sarcasms and bullyings to which the country was exposed in increasing degrees under a belief that we would fight neither in the mass nor individually possibly if it became known that the colonels refused to meet a midshipman the gentlemen of our household troops would advance a step mrs cullings adroit efforts to weary him out of his project were unsuccessful he was too much on fire to know the taste of absurdity nevil repeated what he had written in french and next the english of what he intended to say the lady conscientiously did her utmost to reconcile the two languages she softened his downrightness passed with approval his compliments to france and the ancient high reputation of her army and seeing that a loophole was left for them to apologize asked how many french colonels he wanted to fight i do not want maam said nevil he had simply taken up the glove they had again flung at our feet and he had done it to stop the incessant revilings little short of positive contempt which we in our indolence exposed ourselves to from the foreigner particularly from frenchmen whom he liked and precisely because he liked them he insisted on forcing them to respect us let his challenge be accepted and he would find backers he knew the stuff of englishmen they only required an example french officers are skilful swordsmen said mrs culling my husband has told me they will spend hours of the day thrusting and parrying they are used to duelling we nevil answered dont get apprenticed to the shambles to learn our duty on the field duelling is i know sickening folly we go too far in pretending to despise every insult pitched at us a man may do for his country what he wouldnt do for himself mrs culling gravely said she hoped that bloodshed would be avoided and mr beauchamp nodded she left him hard at work he was a popular boy a favourite of women and therefore full of engagements to balls and dinners and he was a modest boy though his uncle encouraged him to deliver his opinions freely and argue with men the little drummer attached to wheeling columns thinks not more of himself because his short legs perform the same strides as the grenadiers he is happy to be able to keep the step and so was nevil and if ever he contradicted a senior it was in the interests of the country veneration of heroes living and dead kept down his conceit he worshipped devotedly from an early age he exacted of his flattering ladies that they must love his hero not to love his hero was to be strangely in error to be in need of conversion and he proselytized with the ardour of the moslem his uncle everard was proud of his good looks fire and nonsense during the boys extreme youth he traced him by cousinships back to the great earl beauchamp of froissart and would have it so and he would have spoilt him had not the young fellows mind been possessed by his reverence for men of deeds how could he think of himself who had done nothing accomplished nothing so long as he brooded on the images of signal englishmen whose names were historic for daring and the strong arm and artfulness all given to the service of the countrymen of a magnanimity overcast with simplicity which nevil held to be pure insular english our type of splendid manhood not discoverable elsewhere a method of enraging him was to distinguish one or other of them as irish scottish or cambrian he considered it a dismemberment of the country and notwithstanding the pleasure he had in uniting in his person the strong red blood of the chivalrous lord beauchamp with the hard and tenacious romfrey blood he hated the title of norman we are englishbritish he said a family resting its pride on mere ancestry provoked his contempt if it did not show him one of his men he had also a disposition to esteem lightly the family which having produced a man settled down after that effort for generations to enjoy the countrys pay boys are unjust but nevil thought of the country mainly arguing that we should not accept the countrys money for what we do not ourselves perform these traits of his were regarded as characteristics hopeful rather than the reverse none of his friends and relatives foresaw danger in them he was a capital boy for his elders to trot out and banter mrs rosamund culling usually went to his room to see him and doat on him before he started on his rounds of an evening she suspected that his necessary attention to his toilet would barely have allowed him time to finish his copy of the letter certain phrases had bothered him the thrice recurrence of ma patrie jarred on his ear sentiments afflicted his acute sense of the declamatory twice cest avec les sentiments du plus profond regret and again je suis bien sr que vous comprendrez mes sentiments et maccorderez lhonneur que je rclame au nom de ma patrie outrage the word patrie was broadcast over the letter and honneur appeared four times and a more delicate word to harp on than the others not to frenchmen said his friend rosamund i would put je suis convaincu it is not so familiar but i have written out the fair copy maam and that alteration seems a trifle i would copy it again and again nevil to get it right no id rather see it off than have it right said nevil and he folded the letter how the deuce to address it and what direction to write on it were further difficulties he had half a mind to remain at home to conquer them by excogitation rosamund urged him not to break his engagement to dine at the halketts where perhaps from his friend colonel halkett who would never imagine the reason for the inquiry he might learn how a letter to a crack french regiment should be addressed and directed this proved persuasive and as the hour was late nevil had to act on her advice in a hurry his uncle everard enjoyed a perusal of the manuscript in his absence chapter ii uncle nephew and another the honourable everard romfrey came of a race of fighting earls toughest of men whose high stout western castle had weathered our cyclone periods of history without changeing hands more than once and then but for a short year or two as if to teach the original possessors the wisdom of inclining to the stronger side they had a queens chamber in it and a kings and they stood well up against the charge of having dealt darkly with the king he died among themhow has not been told we will not discuss the conjectures here a savour of north sea foam and ballad pirates hangs about the early chronicles of the family indications of an ancestry that had lived between the wave and the cloud were discernible in their notions of right and wrong but a settlement on solid earth has its influences they were chivalrous knights bannerets and leaders in the tented field paying and taking fair ransom for captures and they were good landlords good masters blithely followed to the wars sing an old battle of normandy picardy gascony and you celebrate deeds of theirs at home they were vexatious neighbours to a town of burghers claiming privileges nor was it unreasonable that the earl should flout the pretensions of the town to read things for themselves documents titleships rights and the rest as well might the flat plain boast of seeing as far as the pillar earl and town fought the fight of barons and commons in epitome the earl gave way the barons gave way mighty men may thrash numbers for a time in the end the numbers will be thrashed into the art of beating their teachers it is bad policy to fight the odds inch by inch those primitive school masters of the million liked it and took their pleasure in that way the romfreys did not breed warriors for a parade at court wars though frequent were not constant and they wanted occupation they may even have felt that they were bound in no common degree to the pursuit of an answer to what may be called the parent question of humanity am i thy master or thou mine they put it to lords of other castles to town corporations and sometimes brother to brother and notwithstanding that the answer often unseated and once discastled them they swam back to their places as born warriors urged by a passion for land are almost sure to do are indeed quite sure so long as they multiply sturdily and will never take no from fortune a family passion for land that survives a generation is as effective as genius in producing the object it conceives and through marriages and conflicts the seizure of lands and brides bearing land these sharp feeding eagle eyed earls of romfrey spied few spots within their top towers wide circle of the heavens not their own it is therefore manifest that they had the root qualities the prime active elements of men in perfection and notably that appetite to flourish at the cost of the weaker which is the blessed exemplification of strength and has been mans cheerfulest encouragement to fight on since his comparative subjugation on the whole it seems complete of the animal world by and by the struggle is transferred to higher ground and we begin to perceive how much we are indebted to the fighting spirit strength is the brute form of truth no conspicuously great man was born of the romfreys who were better served by a succession of able sons they sent undistinguished able men to army and navylieutenants given to be critics of their captains but trustworthy for their work in the later life of the family they preferred the provincial state of splendid squires to court and political honours they were renowned shots long limbed stalking sportsmen in field and bower fast friends intemperate enemies handsome to feminine eyes resembling one another in build and mostly of the northern colour or betwixt the tints with an hereditary nose and mouth that cried romfrey from faces thrice diluted in cousinships the hon everard stephen denely craven romfrey third son of the late earl had some hopes of the title and was in person a noticeable gentleman in mind a mediaeval baron in politics a crotchety unintelligible whig he inherited the estate of holdesbury on the borders of hampshire and wilts and espoused that of steynham in sussex where he generally resided his favourite in the family had been the lady emily his eldest sister who contrary to the advice of her other brothers and sisters had yielded her hand to his not wealthy friend colonel richard beauchamp after the death of nevils parents he adopted the boy being himself childless and a widower childlessness was the affliction of the family everard having no son could hardly hope that his brother the earl and craven lord avonley would have one for he loved the prospect of the title yet as there were no cousins of the male branch extant the lack of an heir was a serious omission and to become the earl of romfrey and be the last earl of romfrey was a melancholy thought however brilliant so sinks the sun but he could not desire the end of a great day at one time he was a hot parliamentarian calling himself a whig called by the whigs a radical called by the radicals a tory and very happy in fighting them all round this was during the decay of his party before the liberals were defined a liberal deprived him of the seat he had held for fifteen years and the clearness of his understanding was obscured by that black vision of popular ingratitude which afflicts the free fighting man yet more than the malleable public servant the latter has a clerkly humility attached to him like a second nature from his habit of doing as others bid him the former smacks a voluntarily sweating forehead and throbbing wounds for witness of his claim upon your palpable thankfulness it is an insult to tell him that he fought for his own satisfaction mr romfrey still called himself a whig though it was whig mean vengeance on account of his erratic vote and voice on two or three occasions that denied him a peerage and a seat in haven thither let your good sheep go your echoes your wag tail dogs your wealthy pursy manufacturers he decried the attractions of the sublimer house and laughed at the transparent whiggery of his party in replenishing it from the upper shoots of the commonalty dragging it down to prop it up swamping it to keep it swimming he said he was nevertheless a vehement supporter of that house he stood for king lords and commons in spite of his personal grievances harping the triad as vigorously as bard of old britain commons he added out of courtesy or from usage or policy or for emphasis or for the sake of the constitutional number of the estates of the realm or it was because he had an intuition of the folly of omitting them the same to some extent that builders have regarding bricks when they plan a fabric thus although king and lords prove the existence of commons in days of the political deluge almost syllogistically the example of not including one of the estates might be imitated and commons and king do not necessitate the conception of an intermediate third while lords and commons suggest the decapitation of the leading figure the united three however no longer cast reflections on one another and were an assurance to this acute politician that his birds were safe he preserved game rigorously and the deduction was the work of instinct with him to his mind the game laws were the corner stone of law and of a mans right to hold his own and so delicately did he think the country poised that an attack on them threatened the structure of justice the three conjoined estates were therefore his head gamekeepers their duty was to back him against the poacher if they would not see the country tumble as to his under gamekeepers he was their intimate and their friend saying with none of the misanthropy which proclaims the virtues of the faithful dog to the confusion of humankind he liked their company better than that of his equals and learnt more from them they also listened deferentially to their instructor the conversation he delighted in most might have been going on in any century since the conquest grant him his not unreasonable argument upon his property in game he was a liberal landlord no tenants were forced to take his farms he dragged none by the collar he gave them liberty to go to australia canada the americas if they liked he asked in return to have the liberty to shoot on his own grounds and rear the marks for his shot treating the question of indemnification as a gentleman should still there were grumbling tenants he swarmed with game and though he was liberal his hares and his birds were immensely destructive computation could not fix the damage done by them probably the farmers expected them not to eat there are two parties to a bargain said everard and one gets the worst of it but if he was never obliged to make it wheres his right to complain men of sense rarely obtain satisfactory answers they are provoked to despise their kind but the poacher was another kind of vermin than the stupid tenant everard did him the honour to hate him and twice in a fray had he collared his ruffian and subsequently sat in condemnation of the wretch for he who can attest a villany is best qualified to punish it gangs from the metropolis found him too determined and alert for their sport it was the factiousness of here and there an unbroken young scoundrelly colt poacher of the neighbourhood a born thief a fellow damned in an inveterate taste for game which gave him annoyance one night he took master nevil out with him and they hunted down a couple of sinners that showed fight against odds nevil attempted to beg them off because of their boldness i dont set my traps for nothing said his uncle silencing him but the boy reflected that his uncle was perpetually lamenting the cowed spirit of the common english formerly such fresh and merry men he touched rosamund cullings heart with his description of their attitudes when they stood resisting and bawling to the keepers come on well die for it they did not die everard explained to the boy that he could have killed them and was contented to have sent them to gaol for a few weeks nevil gaped at the empty magnanimity which his uncle presented to him as a remarkably big morsel at the age of fourteen he was despatched to sea he went unwillingly not so much from an objection to a naval life as from a wish incomprehensible to grown men and boys and especially to his cousin cecil baskelett that he might remain at school and learn the fellow would like to be a parson everard said in disgust no parson had ever been known of in the romfrey family or in the beauchamp a legend of a parson that had been a tutor in one of the romfrey houses and had talked and sung blandly to a damsel of the blooddegenerate maidto receive a handsome trouncing for his pains instead of the holy marriage tie he aimed at was the only connection of the romfreys with the parsonry as everard called them he attributed the boys feeling to the influence of his great aunt beauchamp who would he said infallibly have made a parson of him id rather enlist for a soldier nevil said and he ceased to dream of rebellion and of his little property of a few thousand pounds in the funds to aid him in it he confessed to his dear friend rosamund culling that he thought the parsons happy in having time to read history and oh to feel for certain which side was the wrong side in our civil war so that one should not hesitate in choosing such puzzles are never he seemed to be aware solved in a midshipmans mess he hated bloodshed and was guilty of the cotton spinners babble abhorred of everard in alluding to it rosamund liked him for his humanity but she too feared he was a slack romfrey when she heard him speak in precocious contempt of glory somewhere somehow he had got hold of manchester sarcasms concerning glory a weedy word of the newspapers had been sown in his bosom perhaps he said i dont care to win glory i know all about that ive seen an old hat in the louvre and he would have had her to suppose that he had looked on the campaigning head cover of napoleon simply as a shocking bad bald brown rubbed old tricorne rather than as the nod of extinction to thousands the great orb of darkness the still trembling gloomy quiverthe brain of the lightnings of battles now this boy nursed no secret presumptuous belief that he was fitted for the walks of the higher intellect he was not having his impudent boys fling at superiority over the superior as here and there a subtle minded vain juvenile will nor was he a parrot repeating a line from some lancastrian pamphlet he really disliked war and the sword and scorning the prospect of an idle life confessing that his abilities barely adapted him for a sailors he was opposed to the career opened to him almost to the extreme of shrinking and terror or that was the impression conveyed to a not unsympathetic hearer by his forlorn efforts to make himself understood which were like the tappings of the stick of a blind man mystified by his sense of touch at wrong corners his bewilderment and speechlessness were a comic display tragic to him just as his uncle everard predicted he came home from his first voyage a pleasant sailor lad his features more than handsome to a woman so mobile they were shone of sea and spirit the chance lights of the sea and the spirit breathing out of it as to war and bloodshed a mans first thought must be his country young jacket remarked and ich dien was the best motto afloat rosamund noticed the peculiarity of the books he selected for his private reading they were not boys books books of adventure and the like his favourite author was one writing of heroes in so she esteemed it a style resembling either early architecture or utter dilapidation so loose and rough it seemed a wind in the orchard style that tumbled down here and there an appreciable fruit with uncouth bluster sentences without commencements running to abrupt endings and smoke like waves against a sea wall learned dictionary words giving a hand to street slang and accents falling on them haphazard like slant rays from driving clouds all the pages in a breeze the whole book producing a kind of electrical agitation in the mind and the joints this was its effect on the lady to her the incomprehensible was the abominable for she had our countrys high critical feeling but he while admitting that he could not quite master it liked it he had dug the book out of a booksellers shop in malta captivated by its title and had since the day of his purchase gone at it again and again getting nibbles of golden meaning by instalments as with a solitary pick in a very dark mine until the illumination of an idea struck him that there was a great deal more in the book than there was in himself this was sufficient to secure the devoted attachment of young mr beauchamp rosamund sighed with apprehension to think of his unlikeness to boys and men among his countrymen in some things why should he hug a book he owned he could not quite comprehend he said he liked a bone in his mouth and it was natural wisdom though unappreciated by women a bone in a boys mind for him to gnaw and worry corrects the vagrancies and promotes the healthy activities whether there be marrow in it or not supposing it furnishes only dramatic entertainment in that usually vacant tenement or powder shell it will be of service nevil proposed to her that her next present should be the entire list of his beloved incomprehensibles published works and she promised and was not sorry to keep her promise dangling at the skirts of memory to drop away in time for that fire and smoke writer dedicated volumes to the praise of a regicide nice reading for her dear boy some weeks after nevil was off again she abused herself for her half hearted love of him and would have given him anythingthe last word in favour of the country versus the royal martyr for example had he insisted on it she gathered bit by bit that he had dashed at his big blustering cousin cecil to vindicate her good name the direful youths fought in the steynham stables overheard by the grooms everard received a fine account of the tussle from these latter and rosamund knowing him to be of the order of gentlemen who whatsoever their sins will at all costs protect a womans delicacy and a dependants man or woman did not fear to have her ears shocked in probing him on the subject everard was led to say that nevils cousins were bedevilled with womanfolk from which rosamund perceived that women had been at work and if so it was upon the business of the scandal monger and if so nevil fought his cousin to protect her good name from a babbler of the family gossip she spoke to stukely culbrett her dead husbands friend to whose recommendation she was indebted for her place in everard romfreys household nevil behaved like a knight i hear your beauty was disputed said he and nevil knocked the blind man down for not being able to see she thought not my beauty nevil struck his cousin on behalf of the only fair thing i have left to me this was a moment with her when many sensations rush together and form a knot in sensitive natures she had been very good looking she was good looking still but she remembered the bloom of her looks in her husbands days the tragedy of the mirror is one for a woman to write i am ashamed to find myself smiling while the poor lady weeps she remembered his praises her pride his death in battle her anguish then on her strange entry to this house her bitter wish to be older and then the oppressive calm of her recognition of her wishs fulfilment the heavy drop to dead earth when she could say or pretend to think she could sayi look old enough will they tattle of me now nevils championship of her good name brought her history spinning about her head and threw a finger of light on her real position in that she saw the slenderness of her hold on respect as well as felt her personal stainlessness the boy warmed her chill widowhood it was written that her second love should be of the pattern of mothers love she loved him hungrily and jealously always in fear for him when he was absent even anxiously when she had him near for some cause born one may fancy of the hour of her loves conception his image in her heart was steeped in tears she was not happily one of the women who betray strong feeling and humour preserved her from excesses of sentiment chapter iii contains baronial views of the present time upon the word of honour of rosamund the letter to the officers of the french guard was posted post it post it everard said on her consulting him with the letter in her hand let the fellow stand his luck it was addressed to the colonel of the first regiment of the imperial guard paris that superscription had been suggested by colonel halkett rosamund was in favour of addressing it to versailles nevil to the tuileries but paris could hardly fail to hit the mark and nevil waited for the reply half expecting an appointment on the french sands for the act of posting a letter though it be to little short of the pleiades even will stamp an incredible proceeding as a matter of business so ready is the ardent mind to take footing on the last thing done the flight of mr beauchamps letter placed it in the common order of occurrences for the youthful author of it jack wilmore a messmate offered to second him though he should be dismissed the service for it another second would easily be found somewhere for as nevil observed you have only to set these affairs going and british blood rises we are not the people you see on the surface wilmores father was a parson for instance what did he do he could not help himself he supplied the army and navy with recruits one son was in a marching regiment the other was jack and three girls had vowed never to quit the rectory save as brides of officers nevil thought that seemed encouraging we were evidently not a nation of shopkeepers at heart and he quoted sayings of mr stukely culbretts in which neither his ear nor wilmores detected the under ring stukely was famous for as that england had saddled herself with india for the express purpose of better obeying the commandments in europe and that it would be a lamentable thing for the continent and our doctrines if ever beef should fail the briton and such like depend upon it were a fighting nation naturally jack said nevil how can we submit however i shall not be impatient i dislike duelling and hate war but i will have the country respected they planned a defence of the country drawing their strategy from magazine articles by military pens reverberations of the extinct voices of the daily and weekly journals customary after a panic and making bloody stands on spots of extreme pastoral beauty which they visited by coach and rail looking back on unfortified london with particular melancholy rosamunds word may be trusted that she dropped the letter into a london post office in pursuance of her promise to nevil the singular fact was that no answer to it ever arrived nevil without a doubt of her honesty proposed an expedition to paris he was ordered to join his ship and he lay moored across the water in the port of bevisham panting for notice to be taken of him the slight of the total disregard of his letter now affected him personally it took him some time to get over this indignity put upon him especially because of his being under the impression that the country suffered not he at all the letter had served its object ever since the transmission of it the menaces and insults had ceased but they might be renewed and he desired to stop them altogether his last feeling was one of genuine regret that frenchmen should have behaved unworthily of the high estimation he held them in with which he dismissed the affair he was rallied about it when he next sat at his uncles table and had to pardon rosamund for telling nevil replied modestly i dare say you think me half a fool sir all i know is i waited for my betters to speak first i have no dislike of frenchmen everard shook his head to signify not half but he was gentle enough in his observations theres a motto ex pede herculem you stepped out for the dogs to judge better of us its an infernally tripping motto for a composite structure like the kingdom of great britain and manchester boy nevil we can fight foreigners when the time comes he directed nevil to look home and cast an eye on the cotton spinners with the remark that they were binding us hand and foot to sell us to the biggest buyer and were not englishmen but germans and jews and quakers and hybrids diligent clerks and speculators and commercial travellers who have raised a fortune from foisting drugged goods on an idiot population he loathed them for the curse they were to the country and he was one of the few who spoke out the fashion was to pet them we stood against them were halfhearted and were beaten and then we petted them and bit by bit our privileges were torn away we made lords of them to catch them and they grocers of us by way of a return already said everard they have knocked the nations head off and dry rotted the bone of the people dont they nevil asked belong to the liberal party ill tell you everard replied they belong to any party that upsets the party above them they belong to the george foxe party and my poultry roosts are the mark they aim at you shall have a glance at the manufacturing district some day you shall see the machines they work with you shall see the miserable lank jawed half stewed pantaloons theyve managed to make of englishmen there my bloods past boiling they work young children in their factories from morning to night their manufactories are spreading like the webs of the devil to suck the blood of the country in that district of theirs an epidemic levels men like a disease in sheep skeletons cant make a stand on the top of it all they sing sunday tunes this behaviour of corn law agitators and protectors of poachers was an hypocrisy too horrible for comment everard sipped claret nevil lashed his head for the clear idea which objurgation insists upon implanting but batters to pieces in the act manchesters the belly of this country everard continued so long as manchester flourishes were a country governed and led by the belly the head and the legs of the country are sound still i dont guarantee it for long but the middles rapacious and corrupt take it on a question of foreign affairs its an alderman after a feast bring it upon home politics you meet a wolf the faithful whig veteran spoke with jolly admiration of the speech of a famous tory chief that was the way to talk to them denounce them traitors up whip and set the ruffians capering hit them facers our men are always for the too clever trick they pluck the sprouts and eat them as if the loss of a sprout or two thinned manchester your policy of absorption is good enough when youre dealing with fragments its a devilish unlucky thing to attempt with a concrete mass you might as well ask your head to absorb a wall by running at it like a pugnacious nigger i dont want you to go into parliament ever youre a fitter man out of it but if ever youre bittenand its the curse of our country to have politics as well as the other diseasesdont follow a flag be independent keep a free vote remember how ive been tied and hold foot against manchester do it blindfold you dont want counselling youre sure to be right ill lay you a blood brood mare to a cabstand skeleton youll have an easy conscience and deserve the thanks of the country nevil listened gravely the soundness of the head and legs of the country he took for granted the inflated state of the unchivalrous middle denominated manchester terrified him could it be true that england was betraying signs of decay and signs how ignoble half a dozen crescent lines cunningly turned sketched her figure before the world and the reflection for one ready to die upholding her was that the portrait was no caricature such an emblematic presentation of the land of his filial affection haunted him with hideous mockeries surely the foreigner hearing our boasts of her must compare us to showmen bawling the attractions of a fat lady at a fair swoln manchester bore the blame of it everard exulted to hear his young echo attack the cotton spinners but nevil was for a plan a system immediate action the descending among the people and taking an initiative leading them insisting on their following not standing aloof and shrugging we lead them in war said he why not in peace theres a front for peace as well as war and thats our place rightly were pushed aside why it seems to me were treated like old fashioned ornaments the fault must be ours shrugging and sneering is about as honourable as blazing fireworks over your own defeat back we have to go thats the point sir and as for jeering the cotton spinners i cant while theyve the lead of us we let them have it and we have thrice the stake in the country i dont mean properties and titles deuce you dont said his uncle i mean our names our histories i mean our duties as for titles the way to defend them is to be worthy of them damned fine speech remarked everard now you get out of that trick of prize orationing i call it snuffery sir its all to your own nose youre talking to me not to a gallery worthy of them caesar wraps his head in his robe he gets his dig in the ribs for all his attitudinizing its very well for a man to talk like that who owns no more than his barebodkin life poor devil tall talks his jewelry he must have his dandification in bunkum you ought to know better property and titles are worth having whether you are worthy of them or a disgrace to your class the best way of defending them is to keep a strong fist and take care you dont draw your fore foot back more than enough please propose something to be done said nevil depressed by the recommendation of that attitude everard proposed a fight for every privilege his class possessed they say he said a nobleman fighting the odds is a sight for the gods and i wouldnt yield an inch of ground its no use calling things by fine namesthe countrys ruined by cowardice poursuivez i cry haro at them the biggest hart wins in the end i havent a doubt about that and i havent a doubt we carry the tonnage theres the people sighed nevil entangled in his uncles haziness what people i suppose the people of great britain count sir of course they do when the battles done the fight lost and won do you expect the people to look on sir the people always wait for the winner boy nevil the young fellow exclaimed despondingly if it were a race its like a race and were confoundedly out of training said everard there he rested a mediaeval gentleman with the docile notions of the twelfth century complacently driving them to grass and wattling them in the nineteenth could be of no use to a boy trying to think though he could set the youngster galloping nevil wandered about the woods of steynham disinclined to shoot and lend a hand to country sports the popping of the guns of his uncle and guests hung about his ears much like their speech which was unobjectionable in itself but not sufficient a little hard he thought a little idle he wanted something and wanted them to give their time and energy to something that was not to be had in a market the nobles he felt sure might resume their natural alliance with the people and lead them as they did of old to the battle field how might they a comely sussex lass could not well tell him how sarcastic reports of the troublesome questioner represented him applying to a nymph of the country for enlightenment he thrilled surprisingly under the charm of feminine beauty the fellows sound at bottom his uncle said hearing of his having really been seen walking in the complete form proper to his budding age that is in two halves nevil showed that he had gained an acquaintance with the struggles of the neighbouring agricultural poor to live and rear their children his uncles table roared at his enumeration of the sickly little beings consumptive or bandy legged within a radius of five miles of steynham action was what he wanted everard said nevil perhaps thought the same for he dashed out of his mooning with a wave of the tory standard delighting the ladies though in that conflict of the lion and the unicorn which was a tory song he seemed rather to wish to goad the dear lion than crush the one horned intrusive upstart his calling on the crack corps of peers to enrol themselves forthwith in the front ranks and to anticipate opposition by initiating measures and so cut out that funny old crazy old galleon the people from under the batteries of the enemy highly amused the gentlemen before rejoining his ship nevil paid his customary short visit of ceremony to his great aunt beauchampa venerable lady past eighty hitherto divided from him in sympathy by her dislike of his uncle everard who had once been his living hero that was when he was in frocks and still the tenacious fellow could not bear to hear his uncle spoken ill of all the men of that family are heartless and he is a man of wood my dear and a bad man the old lady said he should have kept you at school and sent you to college you want reading and teaching and talking to such a house as that is should never be a home for you she hinted at rosamund nevil defended the persecuted woman but with no better success than from the attacks of the romfrey ladies with this difference however that these decried the womans vicious arts and mistress elizabeth mary beauchamp put all the sin upon the man such a man she said let me hear that he has married her i will not utter another word nevil echoed married in a different key i am as much of an aristocrat as any of you only i rank morality higher said mrs beauchamp when you were a child i offered to take you and make you my heir and i would have educated you you shall see a great nephew of mine that i did educate he is eating his dinners for the bar in london and comes to me every sunday i shall marry him to a good girl and i shall show your uncle what my kind of man making is nevil had no desire to meet the other great nephew especially when he was aware of the extraordinary circumstance that a beauchamp great niece having no money had bestowed her hand on a manchester man defunct whereof this young blackburn tuckham the lawyer was issue he took his leave of mrs elizabeth beauchamp respecting her for her constitutional health and brightness and regretting for the sake of the country that she had not married to give england men and women resembling her on the whole he considered her wiser in her prescription for the malady besetting him than his uncle he knew that action was but a temporary remedy college would have been his chronic medicine and the old ladys acuteness in seeing it impressed him forcibly she had given him a peaceable two days on the upper thames in an atmosphere of plain good sense and just mindedness he wrote to thank her saying my england at sea will be your parlour window looking down the grass to the river and rushes and when you do me the honour to write please tell me the names of those wildflowers growing along the banks in summer the old lady replied immediately enclosing a cheque for fifty pounds colonel halkett informs me you are under a cloud at steynham and i have thought you may be in want of pocket money the wild flowers are willowherb meadow sweet and loosestrife i shall be glad when you are here in summer to see them nevil despatched the following i thank you but i shall not cash the cheque the steynham tale is this i happened to be out at night and stopped the keepers in chase of a young fellow trespassing i caught him myself but recognized him as one of a family i take an interest in and let him run before they came up my uncle heard a gun i sent the head gamekeeper word in the morning to out with it all uncle e was annoyed and we had a rough parting if you are rewarding me for this i have no right to it mrs beauchamp rejoined your profession should teach you subordination if it does nothing else that is valuable to a christian gentleman you will receive from the publisher the life and letters of lord collingwood whom i have it in my mind that a young midshipman should task himself to imitate spend the money as you think fit nevils ship commanded by captain robert hall a most gallant officer one of his heroes and of lancashire origin strangely flew to the south american station in and about lord cochranes waters then as swiftly back for like the frail norwegian bark on the edge of the maelstrom liker to a country of conflicting interests and passions that is not mentally on a level with its good fortune england was drifting into foreign complications a paralyzed minister proclaimed it the governing people which is looked to for direction in grave dilemmas by its representatives and reflectors shouted that it had been accused of pusillanimity no one had any desire for war only we really had and it was perfectly true been talking gigantic nonsense of peace and of the everlastingness of the exchange of fruits for money with angels waving raw groceries of eden in joy of the commercial picture therefore to correct the excesses of that fit we held the standing by the moslem on behalf of the mediterranean and the moslem is one of our customers bearing an excellent reputation for the payment of debts to be good granting the necessity we deplored the necessity the press wept over it that however was not the politic tone for us while the imperial berg of polar ice watched us keenly and the press proceeded to remind us that we had once been bull dogs was there not an animal within us having a right to a turn now and then and was it not falstaff on a calm world was quoted for the benefit of our constitutions now and then to loosen the animal granting the necessity of course by dint of incessantly speaking of the necessity we granted it unknowingly the lighter hearts regarded our period of monotonously lyrical prosperity as a man sensible of fresh morning air looks back on the snoring bolster many of the graver were glad of a change after all that maundering over the blessed peace which brings the raisin and the currant for the pudding and shuts up the cannon with a sheeps head it became a principle of popular taste to descant on the vivifying virtues of war even as after ten months of money mongering in smoky london the citizen hails the sea breeze and an immersion in unruly brine despite the cost that breeze and brine may make a man of him according to the doctors prescription sweet is home but health is sweeter then was there another curious exhibition of us gentlemen to the exact number of the graces dressed in drab of an ancient cut made a pilgrimage to the icy despot and besought him to give way for pietys sake he courteous colossal and immoveable waved them homeward they returned and were hooted for belying the bellicose by their mission and interpreting too well the peaceful they were the unparalyzed ministers of the occasion but helpless and now came war the purifier and the pestilence the cry of the english people for war was pretty general as far as the criers went they put on their sabbath face concerning the declaration of war and told with approval how the royal hand had trembled in committing itself to the form of signature to which its action is limited if there was money to be paid there was a bugbear to be slain for it and a bugbear is as obnoxious to the repose of commercial communities as rivals are to kings the cry for war was absolutely unanimous and a supremely national cry everard romfrey said for it excluded the cotton spinners he smacked his hands crowing at the vociferations of disgust of those negrophiles and sweaters of christians whose isolated clamour amid the popular uproar sounded of gagged mouths one of the half stifled cotton spinners a notorious one a spouter of rank sedition and hater of aristocracy a political poacher managed to make himself heard he was tossed to the press for morsel and tossed back to the people in strips everard had a sharp return of appetite in reading the daily and weekly journals they printed logic they printed sense they abused the treasonable barking cur unmercifully they printed almost as much as he would have uttered excepting the strong salt of his similes likening that rascal and his crew to the american weed in our waters to the rotting wild bees nest in our trees to the worm in our ships timbers and to lamentable afflictions of the human frame and of sheep oxen honest hounds manchester was in eclipse the world of england discovered that the peace party which opposed was the actual cause of the war never was indication clearer but my business is with mr beauchamp to know whom and partly understand his conduct in after days it will be as well to take a birdseye glance at him through the war now said everard we shall see what staff there is in that fellow nevil he expected as you may imagine a true young beauchamp romfrey to be straining his collar like a leash hound chapter iv a glimpse of nevil in action the young gentleman to whom everard romfrey transferred his combative spirit despatched a letter from the dardanelles requesting his uncle not to ask him for a spark of enthusiasm he despised our moslem allies he said and thought with pity of the miserable herds of men in regiments marching across the steppes at the bidding of a despot that we were helping to popularize he certainly wrote in the tone of a jejune politician pardonable stuff to seniors entertaining similar opinions but most exasperating when it runs counter to them though one question put by nevil was not easily answerable he wished to know whether the english people would be so anxious to be at it if their man stood on the opposite shore and talked of trying conclusions on their green fields and he suggested that they had become so ready for war because of their having grown rather ashamed of themselves and for the special reason that they could have it at a distance the rascals livers out of order everard said coming to the sentence who speaks out in this crisis there is one and i am with him mr romfreys compassionate sentiments veered round to irate amazement for the person alluded to was indeed the infamous miauling cotton spinner nevil admired him he said so bluntly he pointed to that traitorous george foxite as the one heroical englishman of his day declaring that he felt bound in honour to make known his admiration for the man and he hoped his uncle would excuse him if we differ i am sorry sir but i should be a coward to withhold what i think of him when he has all england against him and he is in the right as england will discover i maintain he speaks wiselyi dont mind saying like a prophet and he speaks on behalf of the poor as well as of the country he appears to me the only public man who looks to the state of the poori mean their interests they pay for war and if we are to have peace at home and strength for a really national war the only war we can ever call necessary the poor must be contented he sees that i shall not run the risk of angering you by writing to defend him unless i hear of his being shamefully mishandled and the bearer of an old name can be of service to him i cannot say less and will say no more everard apostrophized his absent nephew you jackass i am reminded by mr romfreys profound disappointment in the youth that it will be repeatedly shared by many others and i am bound to forewarn readers of this history that there is no plot in it the hero is chargeable with the official disqualification of constantly offending prejudices never seeking to please and all the while it is upon him the narrative hangs to be a public favourite is his last thought beauchampism as one confronting him calls it may be said to stand for nearly everything which is the obverse of byronism and rarely woos your sympathy shuns the statuesque pathetic or any kind of posturing for beauchamp will not even look at happiness to mourn its absence melodious lamentations demoniacal scorn are quite alien to him his faith is in working and fighting with every inducement to offer himself for a romantic figure he despises the pomades and curling irons of modern romance its shears and its labels in fine every one of those positive things by whose aid and by some adroit flourishing of them the nimbus known as a mysterious halo is produced about a gentlemans head and a highly alluring adornment it is we are all given to lose our solidity and fly at it although the faithful mirror of fiction has been showing us latterly that a too superhuman beauty has disturbed popular belief in the bare beginnings of the existence of heroes but this very likely is nothing more than a fit of republicanism in the nursery and a deposition of the leading doll for lack of variety in him that conqueror of circumstances will the dullest soul may begin predicting return on his cockhorse to favour and authority meantime the exhibition of a hero whom circumstances overcome and who does not weep or ask you for a tear who continually forfeits attractiveness by declining to better his own fortunes must run the chances of a novelty during the interregnum nursery legitimists will be against him to a man republicans likewise after a queer sniff at his pretensions it is to be feared for me i have so little command over him that in spite of my nursery tastes he drags me whither he lists it is artless art and monstrous innovation to present so wilful a figure but were i to create a striking fable for him and set him off with scenic effects and contrasts it would be only a momentary tonic to you to him instant death he could not live in such an atmosphere the simple truth has to be told how he loved his country and for another and a broader love growing out of his first passion fought it and being small by comparison and finding no giant of the philistines disposed to receive a stone in his fore skull pummelled the obmutescent mass to the confusion of a conceivable epic his indifferent england refused it to him that is all i can say the greater power of the two she seems with a quiet derision that does not belie her amiable passivity to have reduced in beauchamps career the boldest readiness for public action and some good stout efforts besides to the flat result of an optically discernible influence of our heros character in the domestic circle perhaps a faintly outlined circle or two beyond it but this does not forbid him to be ranked as one of the most distinguishing of her children of the day he lived in blame the victrix if you think he should have been livelier nevil soon had to turn his telescope from politics the torch of war was actually lighting and he was not fashioned to be heedless of what surrounded him our diplomacy after dancing with all the suppleness of stilts gravely resigned the gift of motion our dauntless lancastrian thundered like a tempest over a gambling tent disregarded our worthy people consenting to the doctrine that war is a scourge contracted the habit of thinking it in this case the dire necessity which is the sole excuse for giving way to an irritated pugnacity and sucked the comforting caramel of an alliance with their troublesome next door neighbour profuse in comfits as in scorpions nevil detected that politic element of their promptitude for war his recollections of dissatisfaction in former days assisted him to perceive the nature of it but he was too young to hold his own against the hubbub of a noisy people much too young to remain sceptical of a modern peoples enthusiasm for war while journals were testifying to it down the length of their columns and letters from home palpitated with it and shipmates yawned wearily for the signal and shiploads of red coats and blue infantry cavalry artillery were singing farewell to the girl at home and hurrah for anything in foreign waters he joined the stream with a cordial spirit since it must be so the wind of that haughty proceeding of the great bear in putting a paw over the neutral brook brushed his cheek unpleasantly he clapped hands for the fezzy defenders of the border fortress and when the order came for the fleet to enter the old romantic sea of storms and fables he wrote home a letter fit for his uncle everard to read then there was the sailing and the landing and the march up the heights which nevil was condemned to look at to his joy he obtained an appointment on shore and after that everard heard of him from other channels the two were of a mind when the savage winter advanced which froze the attack of the city and might be imaged as the hoar god of hostile elements pointing a hand to the line reached and menacing at one farther step both blamed the government but they divided as to the origin of governmental inefficiency nevil accusing the lords guilty of foulest sloth everard the quakers of dry rotting the country he passed with a shrug nevils puling outcry for the enemy as well as our own poor fellows at his steppes again and he had to be forgiving when reports came of his nephews turn for overdoing his duty show fighting as he termed it braggadocioing in deeds is only next bad to mouthing it he wrote very rationally stick to your line dont go out of it till you are ordered out remember that we want soldiers and sailors we dont want suicides he condescended to these italics considering impressiveness to be urgent in his heart notwithstanding his implacably clear judgement he was passably well pleased with the congratulations encompassing him on account of his nephews gallantry at a period of dejection in britain for the winter was dreadful every kind heart that went to bed with cold feet felt acutely for our soldiers on the frozen heights and thoughts of heroes were as good as warming pans heroes we would have it happens in war as in wit that all the birds of wonder fly to a flaring reputation he that has done one wild thing must necessarily have done the other so nevil found himself standing in the thick of a fame that blew rank eulogies on him for acts he had not performed the earl of romfrey forwarded hampers and a letter of praise they tell me that while you were facing the enemy temporarily attaching yourself to one of the regimentsi forget which though i have heard it namedyou sprang out under fire on an eagle clawing a hare i like that i hope you had the benefit of the hare she is our property and i have issued an injunction that she shall not go into the newspapers everard was entirely of a contrary opinion concerning the episode of eagle and hare though it was a case of a bird of prey interfering with an object of the chase nevil wrote home most entreatingly and imperatively like one wincing begging him to contradict that and certain other stories and prescribing the form of a public renunciation of his proclaimed part in them the hare he sent word is the property of young michell of the rodney and he is the humanest and the gallantest fellow in the service i have written to my lord pray help to rid me of burdens that make me feel like a robber and impostor everard replied i have a letter from your captain informing me that i am unlikely to see you home unless you learn to hold yourself in i wish you were in another battery than robert halls he forgets the force of example however much of a dab he may be at precept but there you are and please clap a hundredweight on your appetite for figuring will you do you think there is any good in helping to frenchify our army i loathe a fellow who shoots at a medal i wager he is easy enough to be caught by circumventionput me in the open with him tom biggot the boxer went over to paris and stood in the ring with one of their dancing pugilists and the first round he got a crack on the chin from the rogues foot the second round he caught him by the lifted leg and punished him till pec was all he could say of peccavi fight the straightforward fight hang flan battle is a game of give and take and if our men get elanned we shall see them refusing to come up to time this new crossing and medalling is the devils own notion for upsetting a solid british line and tempting fellows to get invalided that they may blaze it before the shopkeepers and their wives in the city give us an armynone of your caperers here are lots of circusy heroes coming home to rest after their fatigues one was spouting at a public dinner yesterday night he went into it upright and he ran out of it uprightat the head of his menand here he is feasted by the citizens and making a speech upright and my boy fronting the enemy everards involuntary break down from his veterans roughness to a touch of feeling thrilled nevil who began to perceive what his uncle was driving at when he rebuked the coxcombry of the field and spoke of the description of compliment your hero was paying englishmen in affecting to give them examples of bravery and preternatural coolness nevil sent home humble confessions of guilt in this respect with fresh praises of young michell for though everard as nevil recognized it was perfectly right in the abstract and generally right there are times when an example is needed by brave mentimes when the fiery furnace of deaths dragon jaw is not inviting even to englishmen receiving the word that duty bids them advance and they require a leader of the way a national coxcombry that pretends to an independence of human sensations and makes a motto of our dandiacal courage is more perilous to the armies of the nation than that of a few heroes it is this coxcombry which has too often caused disdain of the wise chiefs maxim of calculation for winners namely to have always the odds on your side and which has bled shattered and occasionally disgraced us young michells carrying powder bags to the assault and when ordered to retire bearing them on his back and helping a wounded soldier on the way did surely well nor did mr beauchamp himself behave so badly on an occasion when the sailors of his battery caught him out of a fire of shell that raised jets of dust and smoke like a range of geysers over the open and hugged him as loving women do at a meeting or a parting he was penitent before his uncle admitting first that the men were not in want of an example of the contempt of death and secondly that he doubted whether it was contempt of death on his part so much as pridea hatred of being seen running i dont like the fellow to be drawing it so fine said everard it sounded to him a trifle parsonical but his heart was won by nevils determination to wear out the campaign rather than be invalided or entrusted with a holiday duty i see with shame admiration of them old infantry captains and colonels of no position beyond their rank in the army sticking to their post said nevil and a lord and a lord and a lord slipping off as though the stuff of the man in him had melted i shall go through with it everard approved him colonel halkett wrote that the youth was a skeleton still everard encouraged him to persevere and said of him i like him for holding to his work after the strains over that tells the man he observed at his table in reply to commendations of his nephew nevils leak is his political craze and that seems to be going i hope it is you cant rear a man on politics when i was of his age i never looked at the newspapers except to read the divorce cases i came to politics with a ripe judgement he shines in action and hell find that out and leave others the palavering it was upon the close of the war that nevil drove his uncle to avow a downright undisguised indignation with him he caught a fever in the french camp where he was dispensing vivers and provends out of english hampers those french fellows are every man of them trained up to snapping point said everard youre sure to have them if you hold out long against them and greedy dogs too theyre for half our hampers and all the glory and theres nevil down on his back in the thick of them will anybody tell me why the devil he must be poking into the french camp they were ready enough to run to him and beg potatoes its all for humanity he does itmark that never was a word fitter for a quacks mouth than humanity two syllables more and the parsons would be riding it to sawdust humanity humanitomtity its the best word of the two for half the things done in the name of it a tremendously bracing epistle excellent for an access of fever was despatched to humanitys curate and everard sat expecting a hot rejoinder or else a black sealed letter but neither one nor the other arrived suddenly to his disgust came rumours of peace between the mighty belligerents the silver trumpets of peace were nowhere hearkened to with satisfaction by the bull dogs though triumph rang sonorously through the music for they had been severely mangled as usual at the outset and they had at last got their grip and were in high condition for fighting the most expansive panegyrists of our deeds did not dare affirm of the most famous of them that england had embarked her costly cavalry to offer it for a mark of artillery balls on three sides of a square and the belief was universal that we could do more business like deeds and play the great game of blunders with an ability refined by experience everard romfrey was one of those who thought themselves justified in insisting upon the continuation of the war in contempt of our allies his favourite saying that constitution beats the world was being splendidly manifested by our bearing he was very uneasy he would not hear of peace and not only that the imperial gentleman soberly committed the navet of sending word to nevil to let him know immediately the opinion of the camp concerning it as perchance an old roman knight may have written to some young aquilifer of the praetorians allies however are of the description of twins joined by a membrane and supposing that one of them determines to sit down the other will act wisely in bending his knees at once and doing the same he cannot but be extremely uncomfortable left standing besides there was the ottoman cleverly poised again the muscovite was battered fresh guilt was added to the military glory of the gaul english grumblers might well be asked what they had fought for if they were not contented colonel halkett mentioned a report that nevil had received a slight thigh wound of small importance at any rate something was the matter with him and it was naturally imagined that he would have double cause to write home and still more so for the reason his uncle confessed that he had foreseen the folly of a war conducted by milky cotton spinners and their adjuncts in partnership with a throned gambler who had won his stake and now snapped his fingers at them everard expected he had prepared himself for the young naval politicians crow and he meant to admit frankly that he had been wrong in wishing to fight anybody without having first crushed the cotton faction but nevil continued silent dead in hospital or a turk hotel sighed everard and no more to the scoundrels over there than a body to be shovelled into slack lime rosamund culling was the only witness of his remarkable betrayal of grief chapter v rene at last one morning arrived a letter from a french gentleman signing himself comte cresnes de croisnel in which everard was informed that his nephew had accompanied the son of the writer captain de croisnel on board an austrian boat out of the east and was lying in venice under a return attack of fevernot the count stated pointedly in the hands of an italian physician he had brought his own with him to meet his son who was likewise disabled everard was assured by m de croisnel that every attention and affectionate care were being rendered to his gallant and adored nephewvrai type de tout ce quil y a de noble et de chevaleresque dans la vieille angleterrefrom a family bound to him by the tenderest obligations personal and national one as dear to every member of it as the brother the son they welcomed with thankful hearts to the divine interposition restoring him to them in conclusion the count proposed something like the embrace of a fraternal friendship should everard think fit to act upon the spontaneous sentiments of a loving relative and join them in venice to watch over his nephews recovery already m nevil was stronger the gondola was a medicine in itself the count said everard knitted his mouth to intensify a peculiar subdued form of laughter through the nose in hopeless ridicule of a frenchmans notions of an englishmans occupationspresumed across channel to allow of his breaking loose from shooting engagements at a minutes notice to rush off to a fetid foreign city notorious for mud and mosquitoes and commence capering and grimacing pouring forth a jugful of ready made extravagances with mon fils mon cher neveu dieu and similar fiddlededee these were matters for women to do if they chose women and frenchmen were much of a pattern moreover he knew the hotel this comte de croisnel was staying at he gasped at the name of it he had rather encounter a grisly bear than a mosquito any night of his life for no stretch of cunning outwits a mosquito and enlarging on the qualities of the terrific insect he vowed it was damnation without trial or judgement eventually mrs cullings departure was permitted he argued why go the fellows comfortable getting himself together and you say the french are good nurses but her entreaties to go were vehement though venice had no happy place in her recollections and he withheld his objections to her going for him the fields forbade it he sent hearty messages to nevil and that was enough considering that the young dog of humanity had clearly been running out of his way to catch a jaundice and was bereaving his houses of the matronly government deprived of which they were all of them likely soon to be at sixes and sevens with disorderly lacqueys peccant maids and cooks in hysterics now if the master of his fortunes had come to venicenevil started the supposition in his mind often after hope had sunkeverard would have seen a young sailor and a soldier the thinner for wear reclining in a gondola half the day fanned by a brunette of the fine lineaments of the good blood of france she chattered snatches of venetian caught from the gondoliers she was like a delicate cup of crystal brimming with the beauty of the place and making one of them drink in all his impressions through her her features had the soft irregularities which run to rarities of beauty as the ripple rocks the light mouth eyes brows nostrils and bloomy cheeks played into one another liquidly thought flew tongue followed and the flash of meaning quivered over them like night lightning or oftener to speak truth tongue flew thought followed her age was but newly seventeen and she was french her name was rene she was the only daughter of the comte de croisnel her brother roland owed his life to nevil this englishman proud of a french namenevil beauchamp if there was any warm feeling below the unruffled surface of the girls deliberate eyes while gazing on him it was that he who had saved her brother must be nearly brother himself yet was not quite yet must be loved yet not approached he was her brothers brother in arms brother in heart not hers yet hers through her brother his french name rescued him from foreignness he spoke her language with a piquant accent unlike the pitiable english unlike them he was gracious and could be soft and quick the battle scarlet battle black rolands tales of him threw round him in her imagination made his gentleness a surprise if then he was hers through her brother what was she to him the question did not spring clearly within her though she was alive to every gradual change of manner toward the convalescent necessitated by the laws overawing her sex venice was the french girls dream she was realizing it hungrily revelling in it anatomizing it picking it to pieces reviewing it comparing her work with the original and the original with her first conception until beautiful sad venice threatened to be no more her dream and in dread of disenchantment she tried to take impressions humbly really tasked herself not to analyze not to dictate from a french footing not to scorn not to be petulant with objects disappointing her was an impossible task she could not consent to a compromise with the people the merchandize the odours of the city gliding in the gondola through the narrow canals at low tide she leaned back simulating stupor with one wordvenezia her brother was commanded to smoke fumez fumez roland as soon as the steel crested prow had pushed into her paradise of the canal grande she quietly shrouded her hair from tobacco and called upon rapture to recompense her for her sufferings the black gondola was unendurable to her she had accompanied her father to the accademia and mused on the golden venetian streets of carpaccio she must have an open gondola to decorate in his manner gaily splendidly and mock at her effortsa warning to all that might hope to improve the prevailing gloom and squalor by levying contributions upon the merceria her most constant admiration was for the english lord who used once to ride on the lido sands and visit the armenian conventa lord and a poet lord byron dw this was to be infinitely more than a naval lieutenant but nevil claimed her as little personally as he allowed her to be claimed by another the graces of her freaks of petulance and airy whims her sprightly jets of wilfulness fleeting frowns of contempt imperious decisions were all beautiful like silver shifting waves in this lustrous planet of her pure freedom and if you will seize the divine conception of artemis and own the goddess french you will understand his feelings but though he admired fervently and danced obediently to her tunes nevil could not hear injustice done to a people or historic poetic city without trying hard to right the mind guilty of it a newspaper correspondent a mr john holles lingering on his road home from the army put him on the track of an englishmans bookstouching the spirit as well as the stones of venice and nevil thanked him when he had turned some of the leaves the study of the books to school rene was pursued like the bianchinas sleep in gondoletta and was not unlike it at intervals a translated sentence was the key to a reverie rene leaned back meditating he forward the book on his knee roland left them to themselves and spied for the bianchina behind the window bars the count was in the churches or the galleries rene thought she began to comprehend the spirit of venice and chided her rebelliousness but our venice was the venice of the decadence then she said complaining nevil read on distrustful of the perspicuity of his own ideas ah but said she when these venetians were rough men chanting like our huguenots how cold it must have been here she hoped she was not very wrong in preferring the times of the great venetian painters and martial doges to that period of faith and stone cutting what was done then might be beautiful but the life was monotonous she insisted that it was huguenot harsh nasal sombre insolent self sufficient her eyes lightened for the flashing colours and pageantries and the threads of desperate adventure crossing the rii to this and that palace door and balcony like faint blood streaks the times of venice in full flower she reasoned against the hard eloquent englishman of the books but we are known by our fruits are we not and the venice i admire was surely the fruit of these stonecutters chanting hymns of faith it could not but be and if it deserved as he says to die disgraced i think we should go back to them and ask them whether their minds were as pure and holy as he supposes her french wits would not be subdued nevil pointed to the palaces pride said she he argued that the original venetians were not responsible for their offspring you say it she cried you of an old race oh no you do not feel it and the trembling fervour of her voice convinced him that he did not could not rene said i know my ancestors are bound up in me by my sentiments to them and so do you m nevil we shame them if we fail in courage and honour is it not so if we break a single pledged word we cast shame on them why that makes us what we are that is our distinction we dare not be weak if we would and therefore when venice is reproached with avarice and luxury i choose to saywhat do we hear of the children of misers and i say i am certain that those old cold huguenot stonecutters were proud and grasping i am sure they were and they shall share the blame nevil plunged into his volume he called on roland for an opinion friend said roland opinions may differ mine is considering the defences of the windows that the only way into these houses or out of them bodily was the doorway roland complimented his sister and friend on the prosecution of their studies he could not understand a word of the subject and yawning he begged permission to be allowed to land and join the gondola at a distant quarter the gallant officer was in haste to go rene stared at her brother he saw nothing he said a word to the gondoliers and quitted the boat mars was in pursuit she resigned herself and ceased then to be a girl chapter vi love in venice the air flashed like heaven descending for nevil alone with rene they had never been alone before such happiness belonged to the avenue of wishes leading to golden mists beyond imagination and seemed coming on him suddenly miraculous he leaned toward her like one who has broken a current of speech and waits to resume it she was all unsuspecting indolence with gravely shadowed eyes i throw the book down he said she objected no continue i like it both of them divined that the book was there to do duty for roland he closed it keeping a finger among the leaves a kind of anchorage in case of indiscretion permit me to tell you m nevil you are inclined to play truant to day i am now is the very time to read for my poor roland is at sea when we discuss our questions and the book has driven him away but we have plenty of time to read we miss the scenes the scenes are green shutters wet steps barcaroli brown women striped posts a scarlet night cap a sick fig tree an old shawl faded spots of colour peeling walls they might be figured by a trodden melon they all resemble one another and so do the days here thats the charm i wish i could look on you and think the same you as you are for ever would you not let me live my life i would not have you alter please to be pathetic on that subject after i am wrinkled monsieur you want commanding mademoiselle rene nestled her chin and gazed forward through her eyelashes venice is like a melancholy face of a former beauty who has ceased to rouge or wipe away traces of her old arts she said straining for common talk and showing the strain wait now we are rounding said he now you have three of what you call your theatre bridges in sight the people mount and drop mount and drop i see them laugh they are full of fun and good temper look on living venice provided that my papa is not crossing when we go under would he not trust you to me yes he would and you i do believe they are improvizing an operetta on the second bridge you trust yourself willingly as to my second brother you hear them how delightfully quick and spontaneous they are ah silly creatures they have stopped they might have held it on for us while we were passing where would the naturalness have been then perhaps m nevil i do want commanding i am wilful half my days will be spent in fits of remorse i begin to think come to me to be forgiven shall i i should be forgiven too readily i am not so sure of that can you be harsh no not even with enemies least of all with with us oh for the black gondolathe little gliding dusky chamber for two instead of this open flaunting gold and crimson cotton work which exacted discretion on his part and that of the mannerly gondoliers and exposed him to window balcony bridge and borderway they slipped on beneath a red balcony where a girl leaned on her folded arms and eyed them coming and going by with egyptian gravity how strange a power of looking these people have said rene whose vivacity was fascinated to a steady sparkle by the girl tell me is she glancing round at us nevil turned and reported that she was not she had exhausted them while they were in transit she had no minor curiosity let us fancy she is looking for her lover he said rene added let us hope she will not escape being seen i give her my benediction said nevil and i said rene and adieu to her if you please look for roland you remind me i have but a few instants m nevil you are a preux of the times of my brothers patronymic and there is my roland awaiting us is he not handsome how glad you are to have him to relieve guard rene bent on nevil one of her singular looks of raillery she had hitherto been fencing at a serious disadvantage not so very glad she said if that deprived me of the presence of his friend roland was her tower but roland was not yet on board she had peeped from her citadel too rashly nevil had time to spring the flood of crimson in her cheeks bright as the awning she reclined under would you have me with you always assuredly said she feeling the hawk in him and trying to baffle him by fluttering always forever andlistengive me a title rene sang out to roland like a bird in distress and had some trouble not to appear too providentially rescued roland on board she resumed the attack m nevil vows he is a better brother to me than you who dart away on an impulse and leave us threading all venice till we do not know where we are naughty brother my little sister the spot where you are rejoined roland is precisely the spot where i left you and i defy you to say you have gone on without me this is the identical riva i stepped out on to buy you a packet of venetian ballads they recognized the spot and for a confirmation of the surprising statement roland unrolled several sheets of printed blotting paper and rapidly read part of a canzonetta concerning una giovine who reproved her lover for his extreme addiction to wine ma s ma s cotanto bev mi n mi n no ve sposer this astounding vagabond preferred nostrani to his hearts mistress i tasted some of their nostrani to see if it could be possible for a frenchman to exonerate him rolands wry face at the mention of nostrani brought out the chief gondolier who delivered himself signore there be hereditary qualifications one must be born italian to appreciate the merits of nostrani roland laughed he had covered his delinquency in leaving his sister and was full of an adventure to relate to nevil a story promising well for him chapter vii an awakening for both rene was downcast had she not coquetted the dear young englishman had reduced her to defend herself the which fair ladies like besieged garrisons cannot always do successfully without an attack at times which when the pursuer is ardent is followed by a retreat which is a provocation and these things are coquettry her still fresh convent conscience accused her of it pitilessly she could not forgive her brother and yet she dared not reproach him for that would have inculpated nevil she stepped on to the piazzetta thoughtfully her father was at florians perusing letters from france we are to have the marquis here in a week my child he said rene nodded involuntarily she looked at nevil he caught the look with a lovers quick sense of misfortune in it she heard her brother reply to him who the marquis de rouaillout it is a jolly gaillard of fifty who spoils no fun you mistake his age roland she said forty nine then my sister he is not that he looks it you have been absent probably my arithmetical sister he has employed the interval to grow younger they say it is the way with green gentlemen of a certain age they advance and they retire they perform the first steps of a quadrille ceremoniously and we admire them whats that exclaimed the comte de croisnel you talk nonsense roland m le marquis is hardly past forty he is in his prime without question mon pere for me i was merely offering proof that he can preserve his prime unlimitedly he is not a subject for mockery roland quite the contrary for reverence another than you my boy and he would march you out i am to imagine then that his hand continues firm imagine to the extent of your capacity but remember that respect is always owing to your own family and deliberate before you draw on yourself such a chastisement as mercy from an accepted member of it roland bowed and drummed on his knee the conversation had been originated by rene for the enlightenment of nevil and as a future protection to herself now that it had disclosed its burden she could look at him no more and when her father addressed her significantly marquise you did me the honour to consent to accompany me to the church of the frari this afternoon she felt her self accusation of coquettry biting under her bosom like a thing alive roland explained the situation to nevil it is the mania with us my dear nevil to marry our girls young to established men your established man carries usually all the signs visible to the multitude or not of the stages leading to that eminence we cannot i believe unless we have the good fortune to boast the paternity of hercules disconnect ourselves from the steps we have mounted not even the priests inform us if we are ascending to heaven we carry them beyond the grave however it seems that our excellent marquis contrives to keep them concealed and he is ready to face marriagethe grandest inquisitor next to death two furious matchmakersour country beautiful france abounds in themmet one day they were a comtesse and a baronne and they settled the alliance the bell was rung and rene came out of school there is this to be said she has no mother the sooner a girl without a mother has a husband the better that we are all agreed upon i have no personal objection to the marquis he has never been in any great scandals he is norman and has estates in normandy dauphiny touraine he is hospitable luxurious rene will have a fine htel in paris but i am eccentric i have read in our old fabliaux of december and may say the marquis is november say october he is still some distance removed from the plump spring month and we in our family have wits and passions in fine a bud of a rose in an old gentlemans button hole it is a challenge to the whole world of youth and if the bud should leap enough of this matter friend nevil but sometimes a friend must allow himself to be bothered i have perfect confidence in my sister you see i simply protest against her being exposed to you know men i protest that is in the privacy of my cigar case for i have no chance elsewhere the affair is on wheels the very respectable matchmakers have kindled the marquis on the one hand and my father on the other and rene passes obediently from the latter to the former in india they sacrifice the widows in france the virgins roland proceeded to relate his adventure nevils inattention piqued him to salt and salt it wonderfully until the old story of he and she had an exciting savour in its introductory chapter but his friend was flying through the circles of the inferno and the babble of an ephemeral upper world simply affected him by its contrast with the overpowering horrors repugnances despairs pities rushing at him surcharging his senses those that live much by the heart in their youth have sharp foretastes of the issues imaged for the soul st marks was in a minute struck black for him he neither felt the sunlight nor understood why column and campanile rose nor why the islands basked and boats and people moved all were as remote little bits of mechanism nevil escaped and walked in the direction of the frari down calle and campiello only to see herto compare her with the rene of the past hour but that rene had been all the while a feast of delusion she could never be resuscitated in the shape he had known not even clearly visioned not a day of her not an hour not a single look had been his own she had been sold when he first beheld her and should he muttered austerely have been ticketed the property of a middle aged man a worn out french marquis whom she had agreed to marry unwooed without lovethe creature of a transaction but she was innocent she was unaware of the sin residing in a loveless marriage and this restored her to him somewhat as a drowned body is given back to mourners after aimless walking he found himself on the zattere where the lonely giudecca lies in front covering mud and marsh and lagune flames of later afternoon and you have sight of the high mainland hills which seem to fling forth one over other to a golden sea cape midway on this unadorned zattere with its young trees and spots of shade he was met by rene and her father their gondola was below close to the riva and the count said she is tired of standing gazing at pictures there is a veronese in one of the churches of the giudecca opposite will you m nevil act as parade escort to her here for half an hour while i go over rene complains that she loses the vulgar art of walking in her complaisant attention to the fine arts i weary my poor child rene protested in a rapid chatter must i avow it said the count she damps my enthusiasm a little nevil mutely accepted the office twice that day was she surrendered to him once in his ignorance when time appeared an expanse of many sunny fields on this occasion it puffed steam yet after seeing the count embark he commenced the parade in silence this is a nice walk said rene we have not the steps of the riva dei schiavoni it is rather melancholy though how did you discover it i persuaded my papa to send the gondola round and walk till we came to the water tell me about the giudecca the giudecca was a place kept apart for the jews i believe you have seen their burial ground on the lido those are i think the euganean hills you are fond of petrarch m nevil omitting the allusion to the poet you have permit me to remark the brevity without the precision of an accredited guide to notabilities i tell you what i know said nevil brooding on the finished tone and womanly aplomb of her language it made him forget that she was a girl entrusted to his guardianship his heart came out rene if you loved him i on my honour would not utter a word for myself your hearts inclinations are sacred for me i would stand by and be your friend and his if he were young that i might see a chance of it she murmured you should not have listened to roland roland should have warned me how could i be near you and not but i am nothing forget me do not think i speak interestedly except to save the dearest i have ever known from certain wretchedness to yield yourself hand and foot for life i warn you that it must end miserably your countrywomen you have the habit in france but like what are you treated you none like you in the whole world you consent to be extinguished and i have to look on listen to me now rene glanced at the gondola conveying her father and he has not yet landed she thought and said do you pretend to judge of my welfare better than my papa yes in this he follows a fashion you submit to it his anxiety is to provide for you but i know the system is cursed by nature and that means by heaven because it is not english o rene my beloved for ever well then tell me tell me you can say with pride and happiness that the marquis de rouaillout is to be yourtheres the wordhusband rene looked across the water friend if my father knew you were asking me i will speak to him useless he is generous he loves you he cannot break an engagement binding his honour would you rene would youit must be saidconsent to have it known to himi beg for more than lifethat your are not averse that you support me his failing breath softened the bluntness she replied i would not have him ever break an engagement binding his honour you stretch the point of honour it is our way dear friend we are french and i presume to think that our french system is not always wrong for if my father had not broken it by treating you as one of us and leaving me with you should i have heard i have displeased you do not suppose that but i mean a mother would not have left me you wished to avoid it do not blame me i had some instinct you were very pale you knew i loved you no yes for this morning this morning it seemed to me and i regretted my fancy that you were inclined to trifle as they say young men do with rene with your friend rene and those are the hills of petrarchs tomb they are mountains they were purple beneath a large brooding cloud that hung against the sun waiting for him to enfold him and nevil thought that a tomb there would be a welcome end if he might lift rene in one wild flight over the chasm gaping for her he had no language for thoughts of such a kind only tumultuous feeling she was immoveable in perfect armour he said despairingly can you have realized what you are consenting to she answered it is my duty your duty its like taking up a dice box and flinging once to certain ruin i must oppose my father to you friend do you not understand duty to parents they say the english are full of the idea of duty duty to country duty to oaths and obligations but with us the heart is free to choose free to choose and when it is most ignorant the heart ask it nothing is surer that is not what we are taught we are taught that the heart deceives itself the heart throws your dicebox not prudent parents she talked like a woman to plead the cause of her obedience as a girl and now silenced in the same manner that she had previously excited him then you are lost to me he said they saw the gondola returning how swiftly it comes home it loitered when it went said rene there sits my father brimming with his picture he has seen one more we will congratulate him this little boulevard is not much to speak of the hills are lovely friend she dropped her voice on the gondolas approach we have conversed on common subjects nevil had her hand in his to place her in the gondola she seemed thankful that he should prefer to go round on foot at least she did not join in her fathers invitation to him she leaned back nestling her chin and half closing her eyes suffering herself to be divided from him borne away by forces she acquiesced in roland was not visible till near midnight on the piazza the promenaders chiefly military of the garrison were few at that period of social protestation and he could declare his disappointment aloud ringingly as he strolled up to nevil looking as if the cigar in his mouth and the fists entrenched in his wide trowsers pockets were mortally at feud his adventure had not pursued its course luminously he had expected romance and had met merchandize and his vanity was offended to pacify him nevil related how he had heard that since the venetian rising of venetian ladies had issued from the ordeal of fire and famine of another pattern than the famous old benzon one in which they touched earthiest earth he praised republicanism for that the spirit of the new and short lived republic wrought that change in venice oh if theyre republican as well as utterly decayed said roland i give them up let them die virtuous nevil told roland that he had spoken to rene he won sympathy but roland could not give him encouragement they crossed and recrossed the shadow of the great campanile on the warm white stones of the square nevil admitting the weight of whatsoever roland pointed to him in favour of the arrangement according to french notions and indeed of aristocratic notions everywhere saving that it was imperative for rene to be disposed of in marriage early why rob her of her young springtime french girls replied roland confused by the nature of the explication in his headwell theyre not english they want a hand to shape them otherwise they grow all awry my father will not have one of her aunts to live with him so there she is but my dear nevil i owe my life to you and i was no party to this affair i would do anything to help you what says rene she obeys exactly you see our girls are chess pieces until theyre married then they have life and character sometimes too much she is not like them roland she is like none when i spoke to her first she affected no astonishment never was there a creature so nobly sincere shes a girl in heart not in mind think of her sacrificed to this man thrice her age she differs from other girls only on the surface nevil as for the man i wish she were going to marry a younger i wish yes my friend roland squeezed nevils hand i wish im afraid its hopeless she did not tell you to hope not by one single sign said nevil you see my friend for that reason nevil rejoined with the calm fanaticism of the passion of love i hope all the more because i will not believe that she so pure and good can be sacrificed put me asidei am nothing i hope to save her from that we have now said roland struck the current of duplicity you are really in love my poor fellow lover and friend came to no conclusion except that so lovely a night was not given for slumber a small round brilliant moon hung almost globed in the depths of heaven and the image of it fell deep between san giorgio and the dogana rene had the scene from her window like a dream given out of sleep she lay with both arms thrown up beneath her head on the pillow her eyelids wide open and her visage set and stern her bosom rose and sank regularly but heavily the fluctuations of a night stormy for her hitherto unknown had sunk her to this trance in which she lay like a creature flung on shore by the waves she heard her brothers voice and nevils and the pacing of their feet she saw the long shaft of moonlight broken to zigzags of mellow lightning and wavering back to steadiness dark san giorgio and the sheen of the doganas front but the visible beauty belonged to a night that had shivered repose humiliated and wounded her destroyed her confident happy half infancy of heart and she had flown for a refuge to hard feelings her predominant sentiment was anger an anger that touched all and enveloped none for it was quite fictitious though she felt it and suffered from it she turned it on nevil as against an enemy and became the victim in his place tears for him filled in her eyes and ran over she disdained to notice them and blinked offendedly to have her sight clear of the weakness but these interceding tears would flow it was dangerous to blame him harshly she let them roll down figuring to herself with quiet simplicity of mind that her spirit was independent of them as long as she restrained her hands from being accomplices by brushing them away as weeping girls do that cry for comfort nevil had saved her brothers life and had succoured her countrymen he loved her and was a hero he should not have said he loved her that was wrong and it was shameful that he should have urged her to disobey her father but this heros love of her might plead excuses she did not know of and if he was to be excused he unhappy that he was had a claim on her for more than tears she wept resentfully forces above her own swayed and hurried her like a lifeless body dragged by flying wheels they could not unnerve her will or rather what it really was her sense of submission to a destiny looked at from the height of the palm waving cherubs over the fallen martyr in the picture she seemed as nerveless as a dreamy girl the raised arms and bent elbows were an illusion of indifference her shape was rigid from hands to feet as if to keep in a knot the resolution of her mind for the second and in that young season the stronger nature grafted by her education fixed her to the religious duty of obeying and pleasing her father in contempt almost in abhorrence of personal inclinations tending to thwart him and imperil his pledged word she knew she had inclinations to be tender her hands released how promptly might she not have been confiding her innumerable perplexities of sentiment and emotion to paper undermining self governance self respect perhaps further than that she did not understand the feelings she struggled with nor had she any impulse to gaze on him the cause of her trouble who walked beside her brother below talking betweenwhiles in the nights grave undertones her trouble was too overmastering it had seized her too mysteriously coming on her solitariness without warning in the first watch of the night like a spark crackling serpentine along dry leaves to sudden flame a thought of nevil and a regret had done it chapter viii a night on the adriatic the lovers met after roland had spoken to his sisternot exactly to advocate the cause of nevil though he was under the influence of that grave nights walk with him but to sound her and see whether she at all shared nevils view of her situation roland felt the awfulness of a french family arrangement of a marriage and the impertinence of a foreign cupids intrusion too keenly to plead for his friend at the same time he loved his friend and his sister and would have been very ready to smile blessings on them if favourable circumstances had raised a signal if for example apoplexy or any other cordial ex machina intervention had removed the middle aged marquis and perhaps if rene had shown the repugnance to her engagement which nevil declared she must have in her heart he would have done more than smile he would have laid the case deferentially before his father his own opinion was that young unmarried women were incapable of the passion of love being as it were but half feathered in that state and unable to fly and rene confirmed it the suspicion of an advocacy on nevils behalf steeled her his tentative observations were checked at the outset can such things be spoken of to me roland i am plighted you know it he shrugged said a word of pity for nevil and went forth to let his friend know that it was as he had predicted rene was obedience in person like a rightly educated french girl he strongly advised his friend to banish all hope of her from his mind but the mind he addressed was of a curious order far shooting tough persistent and when acted on by the spell of devotion indomitable nevil put hope aside or rather he clad it in other garments in which it was hardly to be recognized by himself and said to roland you must bear this from me you must let me follow you to the end and if she wavers she will find me near roland could not avoid asking the use of it considering that rene however much she admired and liked was not in love with him nevil resigned himself to admit that she was not and therefore said he you wont object to my remaining rene greeted nevil with as clear a conventional air as a woman could assume she was going she said to attend high mass in the church of s moise and she waved her devoutest roman catholicism to show the breadth of the division between them he proposed to go likewise she was mute after some discourse she contrived to say inoffensively that people who strolled into her churches for the music or out of curiosity played the barbarian well i will not go said nevil but i do not wish to number you among them she said then said nevil i will go for it cannot be barbarous to try to be with you no that is wickedness said rene she was sensible that conversation betrayed her and nevils apparently deliberate pursuit signified to her that he must be aware of his mastery and she resented it and stumbled into pitfalls whenever she opened her lips it seemed to be denied to them to utter what she meant if indeed she had a meaning in speaking save to hurt herself cruelly by wounding the man who had caught her in the toils and so long as she could imagine that she was the only one hurt she was the braver and the harsher for it but at the sight of nevil in pain her heart relented and shifted and discovering it to be so weak as to be almost at his mercy she defended it with an aggressive unkindness for which in charity to her sweeter nature she had to ask his pardon and then had to fib to give reasons for her conduct and then to pretend to herself that her pride was humbled by him a most humiliating round constantly recurring the worse for the reflection that she created it she attempted silence nevil spoke and was like the magical piper she was compelled to follow him and dance the round again with the wretched thought that it must resemble coquettry nevil did not think so but a very attentive observer now upon the scene and possessed of his half of the secret did and warned him rosamund culling added that the french girl might be only an unconscious coquette for she was young the critic would not undertake to pronounce on her suggestion whether the candour apparent in merely coquettish instincts was not more dangerous than a battery of the arts of the sex she had heard nevils frank confession and seen rene twice when she tried in his service though not greatly wishing for success to stir the sensitive girl for an answer to his attachment probably she went to work transparently after the insular fashion of opening a spiritual mystery with the lancet rene suffered herself to be probed here and there and revealed nothing of the pain of the operation she said to nevil in rosamunds hearing have you the sense of honour acute in your country nevil inquired for the apropos none said she such pointed insolence disposed rosamund to an irritable antagonism without reminding her that she had given some cause for it rene said to her presently he saved my brothers life the propos being as little perceptible as before her voice dropped to her sweetest deep tones and there was a supplicating beam in her eyes unintelligible to the direct englishwoman except under the heading of a power of witchery fearful to think of in one so young and loved by nevil the look was turned upon her not upon her hero and rosamund thought does she want to entangle me as well it was in truth a look of entreaty from woman to woman signifying need of womanly help rene would have made a confidante of her if she had not known her to be nevils and devoted to him i would speak to you but that i feel you would betray me her eyes had said the strong sincerity dwelling amid multiform complexities might have made itself comprehensible to the english lady for a moment or so had rene spoken words to her ears but belief in it would hardly have survived the girls next convolutions she is intensely french rosamund said to nevila volume of insular criticism in a sentence you do not know her maam said nevil you think her older than she is and that is the error i fell into she is a child a serpent in the egg is none the less a serpent nevil forgive me but when she tells you the case is hopeless no case is hopeless till a man consents to think it is and i shall stay but then again nevil you have not consulted your uncle let him see her let him only see her rosamund culling reserved her opinion compassionately his uncle would soon be calling to have him home society panted for him to make much of him and here he was cursed by one of his notions of duty in attendance on a captious young french beauty who was the less to be excused for not dismissing him peremptorily if she cared for him at all his career which promised to be so brilliant was spoiling at the outset rosamund thought of rene almost with detestation as a species of sorceress that had dug a trench in her heros road and unhorsed and fast fettered him the marquis was expected immediately rene sent up a little note to mrs callings chamber early in the morning and it was with an air of one day more to ourselves that meeting her she entreated the english lady to join the expedition mentioned in her note roland had hired a big chioggian fishing boat to sail into the gulf at night and return at dawn and have sight of venice rising from the sea her father had declined but m nevil wished to be one of the party and in that case rene threw herself beseechingly into the mute interrogation keeping both of rosamunds hands they could slip away only by deciding to and this rare englishwoman had no taste for the petty overt hostilities if i can be of use to you she said if you can bear sea pitching and tossing for the sake of the loveliest sight in the whole world said rene i know it well rosamund replied rene rippled her eyebrows she divined a something behind that remark and as she was aware of the grief of rosamunds life her quick intuition whispered that it might be connected with the gallant officer dead on the battle field madame if you know it too well she said no it is always worth seeing said rosamund and i think mademoiselle with your permission i should accompany you it is only a whim of mine madame i can stay on shore not when it is unnecessary to forego a pleasure say my last day of freedom rene kissed her hand she is terribly winning rosamund avowed rene was in debate whether the woman devoted to nevil would hear her and help just then roland and nevil returned from their boat where they had left carpenters and upholsterers at work and the delicate chance for an understanding between the ladies passed by the young men were like waves of ocean overwhelming it they were so full of their boat and the scouring and cleaning out of it and provisioning and making it worthy of its freight nevil was surprised that mrs culling should have consented to come and asked her if she really wished itreally and really said rosamund certainly without dubitation cried roland and now my little rene has no more shore qualms she is smoothly chaperoned and madame will present us tea on board all the etcteras of life are there and a mariners eye in me spies a breeze at sunset to waft us out of malamocco the count listened to the recital of their preparations with his usual absent interest in everything not turning upon art politics or social intrigue he said yes good good at the proper intervals and walked down the riva to look at the busy boat said to nevil you are a sailor i confide my family to you and prudently counselled rene to put on the dresses she could toss to the deep without regrets mrs culling he thanked fervently for a wonderful stretch of generosity in lending her presence to the madcaps altogether the day was a reanimation of external venice but there was a thunderbolt in it for about an hour before sunset when the ladies were superintending and trying not to criticize the ingenious efforts to produce a make believe of comfort on board for them word was brought down to the boat by the counts valet that the marquis de rouaillout had arrived rene turned her face to her brother superciliously roland shrugged note this my sister he said an anticipation of dates in paying visits precludes the ripeness of the sentiment of welcome it is however true that the marquis has less time to spare than others we have started we are on the open sea how can we put back said rene you hear franois we are on the open sea roland addressed the valet monsieur has cut loose his communications with land franois responded and bowed from the landing nevil hastened to make this a true report but they had to wait for tide as well as breeze and pilot through intricate mud channels before they could see the outside of the lido and meanwhile the sun lay like a golden altarplatter on mud banks made bare by the ebb and curled in drowsy yellow links along the currents all they could do was to push off and hang loose bumping to right and left in the midst of volleys and countervolleys of fishy venetian chioggian and dalmatian quite as strong as anything ever heard down the canalaggio the representatives of these dialects trotted the decks and hung their bodies half over the sides of the vessels to deliver fire flashed eyes and snapped fingers not a whit less fierce than hostile crews in the old wars hurling an interchange of stink pots and then resumed the trot apparently in search of fresh ammunition an austrian sentinel looked on passively and a police inspector peeringly they were used to it happily the combustible import of the language was unknown to the ladies and nevils attempts to keep his crew quiet contrasting with rolands phlegm which a frenchman can assume so philosophically when his tongue is tied amused them during the clamour rene saw her father beckoning from the riva she signified that she was no longer in command of circumstances the vessel was off but the count stamped his foot and nodded imperatively thereupon roland repeated the eloquent demonstrations of rene and the count lost patience and roland shouted for the love of heaven dont join this babel were nearly bursting the rage of the babel was allayed by degrees though not appeased for the boat was behaving wantonly as the police officer pointed out to the count rene stood up to bend her head it was in reply to a salute from the marquis de rouaillout and nevil beheld his rival m le marquis seeing it is out of the question that we can come to you will you come to us cried roland the marquis gesticulated with alacrity in every limb we will bring you back on to morrow midnights tide safe we promise you the marquis advanced a foot and withdrew it could he have heard correctly they were to be out a whole night at sea the count dejectedly confessed his incapability to restrain them the young desperadoes were ready for anything he had tried the voice of authority and was laughed at as to rene an english lady was with her the english lady must be as mad as the rest said the marquis the english are mad said the count but their women are strict upon the proprieties possibly my dear count but what room is there for the proprieties on board a fishing boat it is even as you say my dear marquis you allow it can i help myself look at them they tell me they have given the boat the fittings of a yacht and the young man that is the m beauchamp of whom i have spoken to you the very pick of his country fresh lively original and he can converse you will like him i hope so said the marquis and roused a doleful laugh it would seem that one does not arrive by hastening oh but my dear marquis you have paid the compliment you are like spring thrusting in a bunch of lilac while the winds of winter blow if you were not expected your expeditiousness is appreciated be sure roland fortunately did not hear the marquis compared to spring he was saying i wonder what those two elderly gentlemen are talking about and nevil confused his senses by trying to realize that one of them was destined to be the husband of his now speechless rene the marquis was clad in a white silken suit and a dash of red round the neck set off his black beard but when he lifted his broad straw hat a baldness of sconce shone there was elegance in his gestures he looked a gentleman though an ultra gallican one that is too scrupulously finished for our taste smelling of the valet he had the habit of balancing his body on the hips as if to emphasize a juvenile vigour and his general attitude suggested an idea that he had an oration for you seen from a distance his baldness and strong nasal projection were not winning features the youthful standard he had evidently prescribed to himself in his dress and his ready jerks of acquiescence and delivery might lead a forlorn rival to conceive him something of an ogre straining at an adonis it could not be disputed that he bore his disappointment remarkably well the more laudably because his position was within a step of the ridiculous for he had shot himself to the mark despising sleep heat dust dirt diet and lo that charming object was deliberately slipping out of reach proving his headlong journey an absurdity as he stood declining to participate in the lunatic voyage and bidding them perforce good speed off the tips of his fingers rene turned her eyes on him and away she felt a little smart of pity arising partly from her antagonism to rolands covert laughter but it was the colder kind of feminine pity which is nearer to contempt than to tenderness she sat still placid outwardly in fear of herself so strange she found it to be borne out to sea by her sailor lover under the eyes of her betrothed she was conscious of a tumultuous rush of sensations none of them of a very healthy kind coming as it were from an unlocked chamber of her bosom hitherto of unimagined contents and the marquis being now on the spot to defend his own she no longer blamed nevil it was otherwise utterly all the sweeter side of pity was for him he was at first amazed by the sudden exquisite transition tenderness breathed from her in voice in look in touch for she accepted his help that he might lead her to the stern of the vessel to gaze well on setting venice and sent lightnings up his veins she leaned beside him over the vessels rails not separated from him by the breadth of a fluttering riband like him she scarcely heard her brother when for an instant he intervened and with nevil she said adieu to venice where the faint red doges palace was like the fading of another sunset north westward of the glory along the hills venice dropped lower and lower breasting the waters until it was a thin line in air the line was broken and ran in dots with here and there a pillar standing on opal sky at last the topmost campanile sank rene looked up at the sails and back for the submerged city it is gone she said as though a marvel had been worked and swiftly we have one night she breathed it half like a question like a petition catching her breath the adieu to venice was her assurance of liberty but venice hidden rolled on her the sense of the return and plucked shrewdly at her tether of bondage they set their eyes toward the dark gulf ahead the night was growing starry the softly ruffled adriatic tossed no foam one night said nevil one why only one rene shuddered oh do not speak then give me your hand there my friend he pressed a hand that was like a quivering chord she gave it as though it had been his own to claim but that it meant no more than a hand he knew by the very frankness of her compliance in the manner natural to her and this was the charm it filled him with her peculiar image and spirit and while he held it he was subdued lying on the deck at midnight wrapt in his cloak and a coil of rope for a pillow considerably apart from jesting roland the recollection of that little sanguine spot of time when renes life blood ran with his began to heave under him like a swelling sea for nevil the starred black night was rene half his heart was in it but the combative division flew to the morning and the deadly iniquity of the marriage from which he resolved to save her in pure devotedness he believed and so he closed his eyes she a girl with a heart fluttering open and fearing felt only that she had lost herself somewhere and she had neither sleep nor symbols nothing but a sense of infinite strangeness as though she were borne superhumanly through space chapter ix morning at sea under the alps the breeze blew steadily enough to swell the sails and sweep the vessel on smoothly the night air dropped no moisture on deck nevil beauchamp dozed for an hour he was awakened by light on his eyelids and starting up beheld the many pinnacles of grey and red rocks and shadowy high white regions at the head of the gulf waiting for the sun and the sun struck them one by one they came out in crimson flame till the vivid host appeared to have stepped forward the shadows on the snow fields deepened to purple below an irradiation of rose and pink and dazzling silver there of all the world you might imagine gods to sit a crowd of mountains endless in range erect or flowing shattered and arid or leaning in smooth lustre hangs above the gulf the mountains are sovereign alps and the sea is beneath them the whole gigantic body keeps the sea as with a hand to right and left nevils personal rapture craved for rene with the second long breath he drew and now the curtain of her tent cabin parted and greeting him with a half smile she looked out the adriatic was dark the alps had heaven to themselves crescents and hollows rosy mounds white shelves shining ledges domes and peaks all the towering heights were in illumination from friuli into farthest tyrol beyond earth to the stricken senses of the gazers colour was stedfast on the massive front ranks it wavered in the remoteness and was quick and dim as though it fell on beating wings but there too divine colour seized and shaped forth solid forms and thence away to others in uttermost distances where the incredible flickering gleam of new heights arose that soared or stretched their white uncertain curves in sky like wings traversing infinity it seemed unlike morning to the lovers but as if night had broken with a revelation of the kingdom in the heart of night while the broad smooth waters rolled unlighted beneath that transfigured upper sphere it was possible to think the scene might vanish like a view caught out of darkness by lightning alp over burning alp and around them a hueless dawn the two exulted they threw off the load of wonderment and in looking they had the delicious sensation of flight in their veins rene stole toward nevil she was mystically shaken and at his mercy and had he said then over to the other land away from venice she would have bent her head she asked his permission to rouse her brother and madame so that they should not miss the scene roland lay in the folds of his military greatcoat too completely happy to be disturbed nevil beauchamp chose to think and rosamund culling he told rene had been separated from her husband last on these waters ah to be unhappy here sighed rene i fancied it when i begged her to join us it was in her voice the impressionable girl trembled he knew he was dear to her and for that reason judging of her by himself he forbore to urge his advantage conceiving it base to fear that loving him she could yield her hand to another and it was the critical instant she was almost in his grasp a word of sharp entreaty would have swung her round to see her situation with his eyes and detest and shrink from it he committed the capital fault of treating her as his equal in passion and courage not as metal ready to run into the mould under temporary stress of fire even later in the morning when she was cooler and he had come to speak more than her own strength was needed to resist him the struggle was hard the boats head had been put about for venice and they were among the dusky red chioggian sails in fishing quarters expecting momently a campanile to signal the sea city over the level rene waited for it in suspense to her it stood for the implacable key of a close and stifling chamber so different from this brilliant boundless region of air that she sickened with the apprehension but she knew it must appear and soon and therewith the contraction and the gloom it indicated to her mind he talked of the beauty she fretted at it and was her petulant self again in an epigrammatic note of discord he let that pass last night you said one night he whispered we will have another sail before we leave venice one night and in a little time one hour and next one minute and theres the end said rene her tone alarmed him have you forgotten that you gave me your hand i gave my hand to my friend you gave it to me for good no i dared not it is not mine it is mine said beauchamp rene pointed to the dots and severed lines and isolated columns of the rising city black over bright sea mine there as well as here said beauchamp and looked at her with the fiery zeal of eyes intent on minutest signs for a confirmation to shake that sad negation of her face rene you cannot break the pledge of the hand you gave me last night you tell me how weak a creature i am you are me myself more better than me and say would you not rather coast here and keep the city under water she could not refrain from confessing that she would be glad never to land there so when you land go straight to your father said beauchamp to whose conception it was a simple act resulting from the avowal oh you torture me she cried her eyelashes were heavy with tears i cannot do it think what you will of me and my friend help me should you not help me i have not once actually disobeyed my father and he has indulged me but he has been sure of me as a dutiful girl that is my source of self respect my friend can always be my friend yes while its not too late said beauchamp she observed a sudden stringing of his features he called to the chief boatman made his command intelligible to that portly capitano and went on to roland who was puffing his after breakfast cigarette in conversation with the tolerant english lady you condescend to notice us signor beauchamp said roland the vessel is up to some manuvre we have decided not to land replied beauchamp and roland he checked the frenchmans shout of laughter i think of making for trieste let me speak to you to both rene is in misery she must not go back roland sprang to his feet stared and walked over to rene nevil said rosamund culling do you know what you are doing perfectly said he come to her she is a girl and i must think and act for her roland met them my dear nevil are you in a state of delusion rene denies theres no delusion roland i am determined to stop a catastrophe i see it as plainly as those alps there is only one way and thats the one i have chosen chosen my friend but allow me to remind you that you have others to consult and rene herself she is a girl she loves me and i speak for her she has said it she has more than said it you strike me to the deck nevil either you are downright madwhich seems the likeliest or we are all in a nightmare can you suppose i will let my sister be carried away the deuce knows where while her father is expecting her and to fulfil an engagement affecting his pledged word beauchamp simply replied come to her chapter x a singular council the four sat together under the shadow of the helmsman by whom they were regarded as voyagers in debate upon the question of some hours further on salt water no bora he threw in at intervals to assure them that the obnoxious wind of the adriatic need not disturb their calculations it was an extraordinary sitting but none of the parties to it thought of it so when nevil beauchamp had plunged them into it he compelled them even reneand she would have flown had there been wings on her shouldersto feel something of the life and death issues present to his soul and submit to the discussion in plain language of the market place of the most delicate of human subjects for her for him and hardly less for the other two an overmastering fervour can do this it upsets the vessel we float in and we have to swim our way out of deep waters by the directest use of the natural faculties without much reflection on the change in our habits to others not under such an influence the position seems impossible this discussion occurred beauchamp opened the case in a couple of sentences and when the turn came for rene to speak and she shrank from the task in manifest pain he spoke for her and no one heard her contradiction she would have wished the fearful impetuous youth to succeed if she could have slept through the storm he was rousing roland appealed to her you my sister it is you that consent to this wild freak enough to break your fathers heart he had really forgotten his knowledge of her characterwhat much he knewin the dust of the desperation flung about her by nevil beauchamp she shook her head she had not consented the man she loves is her voice and her will said beauchamp she gives me her hand and i lead her roland questioned her it could not be denied that she had given her hand and her bewildered senses made her think that it had been with an entire abandonment and in the heat of her conflict of feelings the deliciousness of yielding to him curled round and enclosed her as in a cool humming sea shell rene said roland brother she cried you see that i cannot suffer you to be borne away no do not but the boat was flying fast from venice and she could have fallen at his feet and kissed them for not countermanding it you are in my charge my sister yes and now nevil between us two said roland beauchamp required no challenge he seemed to rosamund culling twice older than he was strangely adept yet more strangely wise of worldly matters and eloquent too but it was the eloquence of frenzy madness in rolands ear the arrogation of a terrible foresight that harped on present and future to persuade him of the righteousness of this headlong proceeding advocated by his friend vexed his natural equanimity the argument was out of the domain of logic he could hardly sit to listen and tore at his moustache at each end nevertheless his sister listened the mad englishman accomplished the miracle of making her listen and appear to consent roland laughed scornfully why trieste i ask you why trieste you cant have a catholic priest at your bidding without her fathers sanction we leave rene at trieste under the care of madame said beauchamp and we return to venice and i go to your father this method protects rene from annoyance it strikes me that if she arrives at any determination she must take the consequences she does she is brave enough for that but she is a girl she has to fight the battle of her life in a day and i am her lover and she leaves it to me is my sister such a coward said roland rene could only call out his name it will never do my dear nevil roland tried to deal with his unreasonable friend affectionately i am responsible for her its your own faultif you had not saved my life i should not have been in your way here i am and your proposal cant be heard of do as you will both of you when you step ashore in venice if she goes back she is lost said beauchamp and he attacked roland on the side of his love for rene and for him roland was inflexible seeing which rene said to venice quickly my brother and now she almost sighed with relief to think that she was escaping from this hurricane of a youth who swept her off her feet and wrapt her whole being in a delirium we were in sight of the city just now cried roland staring and frowning whats this beauchamp answered him calmly the boats under my orders talk madness but dont act it said roland round with the boat at once hundred devils you havent your wits to his amazement beauchamp refused to alter the boats present course you heard my sister said roland you frighten her said beauchamp you heard her wish to return to venice i say she has no wish that is not mine it came to rolands shouting his command to the men while beauchamp pointed the course on for them you will make this a ghastly pleasantry said roland i do what i know to be right said beauchamp you want an altercation before these fellows there wont be one they obey me roland blinked rapidly in wrath and doubt of mind madame he stooped to rosamund culling with a happy inspiration convince him you have known him longer than i and i desire not to lose my friend and tell me madamei can trust you to be truth itself and you can see it is actually the time for truth to be spokenis he justified in taking my sisters hand you perceive that i am obliged to appeal to you is he not dependent on his uncle and is he not therefore in your opinion bound in reason as well as in honour to wait for his uncles approbation before he undertakes to speak for my sister and since the occasion is urgent let me ask you one thing more whether by your knowledge of his position you think him entitled to presume to decide upon my sisters destiny she you are aware is not so young but that she can speak for herself there you are wrong roland said beauchamp she can neither speak nor think for herself you lead her blindfolded and you my friend suppose that you are wiser than any of us it is understood i venture to appeal to madame on the point in question the poor ladys heart beat dismally she was constrained to answer and said his uncle is one who must be consulted you hear that nevil said roland beauchamp looked at her sharply angrily rosamund feared she had struck his hot brain with the vision of everard romfrey as with a bar of iron if rosamund had inclined to the view that he was sure of his uncles support it would have seemed to him a simple confirmation of his sentiments but he was not of the same temper now as when he exclaimed let him see her and could imagine give him only renes love the world of men subservient to his wishes then he was dreaming he was now in fiery earnest for that reason accessible to facts presented to him and rosamunds reluctantly spoken words brought his stubborn uncle before his eyes inflicting a sense of helplessness of the bitterest kind they were all silent beauchamp stared at the lines of the deck planks his scheme to rescue rene was right and good but was he the man that should do it and was she moreover he thoughtspeculating on her bent headthe woman to be forced to brave the world with him and poverty she gave him no sign he was assuredly not the man to pretend to powers he did not feel himself to possess and though from a personal and still more from a lovers inability to see all round him at one time and accurately to weigh the forces at his disposal he had gone far he was not a wilful dreamer nor so very selfish a lover the instant his consciousness of a superior strength failed him he acknowledged it rene did not look up she had none of those lightnings of primitive energy nor the noble rashness and reliance on her lover which his imagination had filled her with none that was plain she could not even venture to second him had she done so he would have held out he walked to the head of the boat without replying soon after this the boat was set for venice again when he rejoined his companions he kissed rosamunds hand and rene despite a confused feeling of humiliation and anger loved him for it glittering venice was now in sight the dome of sta maria salute shining like a globe of salt roland flung his arm round his friends neck and said forgive me you do what you think right said beauchamp you are a perfect man of honour my friend and a woman would adore you girls are straws its part of renes religion to obey her father thats why i was astonished i owe you my life and i would willingly give you my sister in part payment if i had the giving of her most willingly the case is that shes a child and you yes im dependent beauchamp assented i cant act i see it that scheme wants two to carry it out she has no courage i feel that i could carry the day with my uncle but i cant subject her to the risks since she dreads them i see it yes i see that i should have done well i believe i should have saved her run to england get your uncles consent and then try no i shall go to her father my dear nevil and supposing you have rene to back yousupposing it i saywont you be falling on exactly the same bayonet point if i leave her beauchamp interjected he perceived the quality of renes unformed character which he could not express but we are to suppose that she loves you she is a girl you return my friend to the place you started from as you did on the canal without knowing it in my opinion frankly she is best married and i think so all the more after this mornings lesson you understand plainly that if you leave her she will soon be pliant to the legitimate authorities and why not listen to me roland i tell you she loves me i am bound to her and whenif ever i see her unhappy i will not stand by and look on quietly roland shrugged the future not being born my friend we will abstain from baptizing it for me less privileged than my fellows i have never seen the future consequently i am not in love with it and to declare myself candidly i do not care for it one snap of the fingers let us follow our usages and attend to the future at the hour of its delivery i prefer the sage femme to the prophet from my heart nevil i wish i could help you we have charged great guns together but a family arrangement is something different from a hostile battery theres venice and as soon as you land my responsibilitys ended reflect i pray you on what i have said about girls upon my word i discover myself talking wisdom to you girls are precious fragilities marriage is the mould for them they get shape substance solidity that is to say sense passion a will of their own and grace and tenderness delicacy all out of the rude raw quaking creatures we call girls paris my dear nevil paris its the book of women the grandeur of the decayed sea city where folly had danced parisianly of old spread brooding along the waters in morning light beautiful but with that inner light of history seen through the beauty venice was like a lowered banner the great white dome and the campanili watching above her were still brave emblems would paris leave signs of an ancient vigour standing to vindicate dignity when her fall came nevil thought of rene in paris she avoided him she had retired behind her tent curtains and reappeared only when her fathers voice hailed the boat from a gondola the count and the marquis were sitting together and there was a spare gondola for the voyagers so that they should not have to encounter another babel of the riva salutes were performed with lifted hats nods and bows well my dear child it has all been very wonderful and uncomfortable said the count wonderful papa splendid no qualms of any kind none i assure you and madame madame will confirm it if you find a seat for her rosamund culling was received in the counts gondola cordially thanked and placed beside the marquis i stay on board and pay these fellows said roland rene was told by her father to follow madame he had jumped into the spare gondola and offered a seat to beauchamp no cried rene arresting beauchamp it is i who mean to sit with papa up sprang the marquis with an entreating mademoiselle m beauchamp will entertain you m le marquis i want him here said the count and beauchamp showed that his wish was to enter the counts gondola but rene had recovered her aplomb and decisively said no and beauchamp had to yield that would have been an opportunity of speaking to her father without a formal asking of leave she knew it as well as nevil beauchamp rene took his hand to be assisted in the step down to her fathers arms murmuring do nothingnothing until you hear from me chapter xi captain baskelett our england meanwhile was bustling over the extinguished war counting the cost of it with a rather rueful eye on manchester and soothing the taxed by an exhibition of heroes at brilliant feasts of course the first to come home had the cream of the praises she hugged them in a manner somewhat suffocating to modest men but heroism must be brought to bear upon these excesses of maternal admiration modesty too when it accepts the place of honour at a public banquet should not protest overmuch to be just the earliest arrivals which were such as reached the shores of albion before her war was at an end did cordially reciprocate the hug they were taught and they believed most naturally that it was quite as well to repose upon her bosom as to have stuck to their posts surely there was a conscious weakness in the spartans who were always at pains to discipline their men in heroical conduct and rewarded none save the stand fasts a system of that sort seems to betray the sense of poverty in the article our england does nothing like it all are welcome home to her so long as she is in want of them besides she has to please the taxpayer you may track a shadowy line or crazy zigzag of policy in almost every stroke of her domestic history either it is the forethought finding it necessary to stir up an impulse or else dashing impulse gives a lively pull to the afterthought policy becomes evident somehow clumsily very possibly how can she manage an enormous middle class to keep it happy other than a little clumsily the managing of it at all is the wonder and not only has she to stupefy the taxpayer by a timely display of feastings and fireworks she has to stop all that nonsense to quote a satiated man lightened in his purse at the right moment about the hour when the old standfasts who have simply been doing duty return poor jog trot fellows and a complimentary motto or two is the utmost she can present to them on the other hand it is true she gives her first loves those early birds fully to understand that a change has come in their island mothers mind if there is a balance to be righted she leaves that business to society and if it be the season for the gathering of society it will be righted more or less and if no righting is done at all perhaps the press will incidentally toss a leaf of laurel on a name or two thus in the exercise of grumbling doing good with few exceptions nevil beauchamps heroes received the motto instead of the sweetmeat england expected them to do their duty they did it and she was not dissatisfied nor should they be beauchamp at a distance from the scene chafed with customary vehemence concerning the unjust measure dealt to his favourites captain hardist of the diomed twenty years a captain still a captain young michell denied the cross colonel evans cuff on the heights from first to last and not advanced a step but prancer and plunger and lammakin were thoroughly well taken care of this critic of the war wrote savagely reviving an echo of a queer small circumstance occurring in the midst of the high dolour and anxiety of the whole nation and which a politic country preferred to forget as we will do for it was but an instance of strong family feeling in high quarters and is not the unity of the country founded on the integrity of the family sentiment is it not certain which the master tells us that a line is but a continuation of a number of dots nevil beauchamp was for insisting that great government officers had paid more attention to a dot or two than to the line he appeared to be at war with his country after the peace so far he had a lively ally in his uncle everard but these remarks of his were a portion of a letter whose chief burden was the request that everard romfrey would back him in proposing for the hand of a young french lady she being beauchamp smoothly acknowledged engaged to a wealthy french marquis under the approbation of her family could mortal folly outstrip a petition of that sort and apparently according to the wording and emphasis of the letter it was the mature age of the marquis which made mr beauchamp so particularly desirous to stop the projected marriage and take the girl himself he appealed to his uncle on the subject in a reallyreally remonstrative tone quite overwhelming to read it ought not to be permitted by all the laws of chivalry i should write to the girls father to interdict it i really am particeps criminis in a sin against nature if i dont mr romfrey interjected in burlesque of his ridiculous nephew with collapsing laughter but he expressed an indignant surprise at nevil for allowing rosamund to travel alone i can take very good care of myself rosamund protested you can do hundreds of things you should never be obliged to do while hes at hand or i maam said mr romfrey the fellows insane he forgets a gentlemans duty heres his humanity dogging a french frock and poohthe age of the marquis fifty a mans beginning his prime at fifty or there never was much man in him its the mark of a fool to take everybody for a bigger fool than himselfor he wouldnt have written this letter to me he cant come home yet not yet and he doesnt know when he can has he thrown up the service i am to preserve the alliance between england and france by getting this french girl for him in the teeth of her marquis at my peril if i refuse rosamund asked will you let me see where nevil says that sir mr romfrey tore the letter to strips hes one of your fellows who cock their eyes when they mean to be cunning he sends you to do the wheedling thats plain i dont say he has hit on a bad advocate but tell him i back him in no mortal marriage till he shows a pair of epaulettes on his shoulders tell him lieutenants are fledglingshes not marriageable at present its a very pretty sacrifice of himself he intends for the sake of the alliance tell him that but a lieutenants not quite big enough to establish it you will know what to tell him maam and say its the fellows best friend that advises him to be out of it and home quick if he makes one of a french trio hes dished hes too late for his luck in england have him out of that mire we cant hope for more now rosamund postponed her mission to plead her heart was with nevil her understanding was easily led to side against him and for better reasons than mr romfrey could be aware of so she was assured by her experience of the character of mademoiselle de croisnel a certain belief in her personal arts of persuasion had stopped her from writing on her homeward journey to inform him that nevil was not accompanying her and when she drove over steynham common triumphal arches and the odour of a roasting ox richly browning to celebrate the heros return afflicted her mind with all the solid arguments of a common sense country in contravention of a wild lovers vaporous extravagances why had he not come with her the disappointed ox put the question in a wavering drop of the cheers of the villagers at the sight of the carriage without their bleeding hero mr romfrey at his hall doors merely screwed his eyebrows for it was the quality of this gentleman to foresee most human events and his capacity to stifle astonishment when they trifled with his prognostics rosamund had left nevil fast bound in the meshes of the young french sorceress no longer leading but submissively following expecting blindly seeing strange new virtues in the lurid indication of what appeared to border on the reverse how could she plead for her infatuated darling to one who was common sense in person everards pointed interrogations reduced her to speak defensively instead of attacking and claiming his aid for the poor enamoured young man she dared not say that nevil continued to be absent because he was now encouraged by the girl to remain in attendance on her and was more than half inspired to hope and too artfully assisted to deceive the count and the marquis under the guise of simple friendship letters passed between them in books given into one anothers hands with an audacious openness of the saddest augury for the future of the pair and nevil could be so lost to reason as to glory in renes intrepidity which he justified by their mutual situation and cherished for a proof that she was getting courage in fine rosamund abandoned her task of pleading nevils communications gave the case a worse and worse aspect rene was prepared to speak to her father she delayed it then the two were to part they were unable to perform the terrible sacrifice and slay their last hope and then nevil wrote of destinylanguage hitherto unknown to him evidently the tongue of rene he slipped on from italy to france his uncle was besieged by a series of letters and his cousin cecil baskelett a captain in englands grand reserve forceher horse guards of the blue divisionhelped everard romfrey to laugh over them it was not difficult alack letters of a lover in an extremity of love crying for help are as curious to cool strong men as the contortions of the proved heterodox tied to a stake must have been to their chastening ecclesiastical judges why go to the fire when a recantation will save you from it why not break the excruciating faggot bands and escape when you have only to decide to do it we naturally ask why those martyrs of love or religion are madmen altogether nevils adjurations and supplications his threats of wrath and appeals to reason were an odd mixture he wont lose a chance while theres breath in his body everard said quite good humouredly though he deplored that the chance for the fellow to make his hero parade in society and haply catch an heiress was waning there was an heiress at steynham on her way with her father to italy very anxious to see her old friend nevilcecilia halkettand very inquisitive this young lady of sixteen was to know the cause of his absence she heard of it from cecil and one morning last week mademoiselle was running away with him and the next morning she was married to her marquis cecil was able to tell her that i used to be so fond of him said the ingenuous young lady she had to thank nevil for a circassian dress and pearls which he had sent to her by the hands of mrs cullinga pretty present to a girl in the nursery she thought and in fact she chose to be a little wounded by the cause of his absence hes a good creature really cecil spoke on his cousins behalf mad he always will be mad a dear old savage always amuses me he does i get half my entertainment from him captain baskelett was gifted with the art which is a fine and a precious one of priceless value in society and not wanting a benediction upon it in our elegant literature namely the art of stripping his fellow man and so posturing him as to make every movement of the comical wretch puppet like constrained stiff and foolish he could present you heroical actions in that fashion for example a long shanked trooper bearing the name of john thomas drew was crawling along under fire of the batteries out pops old nevil tries to get the man on his back it wont do nevil insists that its exactly one of the cases that ought to be and they remain arguing about it like a pair of nine pins while the muscovites are at work with the bowls very well let me tell you my story its perfectly true i give you my word so nevil tries to horse drew and drew proposes to horse nevil as at school then drew offers a compromise he would much rather have crawled on you know and allowed the shot to pass over his head but hes a briton old nevil the same but old nevils peculiarity is that as you are aware he hates a compromisewont have itretro sathanas and drews proposal to take his arm instead of being carried pickaback disgusts old nevil still it wont do to stop where they are like the cocoa nut and the pincushion of our friends the gipsies on the downs so they take arms and commence the journey home resembling the best of friends on the evening of a holiday in our native climetwo steps to the right half a dozen to the left etctera thus with scarce a variation from the facts with but a flowery chaplet cast on a truthful narrative as it were captain baskelett could render ludicrous that which in other quarters had obtained honourable mention nevil and drew being knocked down by the wind of a ball near the battery confound it cries nevil jumping on his feet its because i consented to a compromisea transparent piece of fiction this but so in harmony with the character stripped naked for us that it is accepted imagine nevils love affair in such hands recovering from a fever nevil sees a pretty french girl in a gondola and immediately thinks by jingo im marriageable he hears she is engaged by jingo shes marriageable too he goes through a sum in addition and the total is a couple so he determines on a marriage you cant get it out of his head he must be married instantly and to her because she is going to marry somebody else sticks to her follows her will have her in spite of her father her marquis her brother aunts cousins religion country and the young woman herself i assure you a perfect model of male fidelity she is married he is on her track he knows his time will come he has only to be handy you see old nevil believes in providence is perfectly sure he will one day hear it cry out wheres beauchamphere i amand heres your marquisei knew i should have her at last says nevil calm as mont blanc on a reduced scale the secret of captain baskeletts art would seem to be to show the automatic human creature at loggerheads with a necessity that winks at remarkable pretensions while condemning it perpetually to doll like action you look on men from your own elevation as upon a quantity of our little wooden images unto whom you affix puny characteristics under restrictions from which they shall not escape though they attempt it with the enterprising vigour of an extended leg or a pair of raised arms or a head awry or a trick of jumping and some of them are extraordinarily addicted to these feats but for all they do the end is the same for necessity rules that exactly so under stress of activity must the doll nevil the doll everard or the dolliest of dolls fair woman behave the automatic creature is subject to the laws of its construction you perceive it can this it can that but it cannot leap out of its mechanism one definition of the art is humour made easy and that may be why cecil baskelett indulged in it and why it is popular with those whose humour consists of a readiness to laugh the fun between cecil baskelett and mr romfrey over the doll nevil threatened an intimacy and community of sentiment that alarmed rosamund on behalf of her darlings material prospects she wrote to him entreating him to come to steynham nevil beauchamp replied to her both frankly and shrewdly i shall not pretend that i forgive my uncle everard and therefore it is best for me to keep away have no fear the baron likes a man of his own tastes they may laugh together if it suits them he never could be guilty of treachery and to disinherit me would be that if i were to become his open enemy to morrow i should look on the estates as mineunless i did anything to make him disrespect me you will not suppose it likely i foresee i shall want money as for cecil i give him as much rope as he cares to have i know very well everard romfrey will see where the point of likeness between them stops i apply for a ship the moment i land to test nevils judgement of his uncle rosamund ventured on showing this letter to mr romfrey he read it and said nothing but subsequently asked from time to time has he got his ship yet it assured her that nevil was not wrong and dispelled her notion of the vulgar imbroglio of a rich uncle and two thirsty nephews she was hardly less relieved in reflecting that he could read men so soberly and accurately the desperation of the youth in love had rendered her one little bit doubtful of the orderliness of his wits after this she smiled on cecils assiduities nevil obtained his appointment to a ship bound for the coast of africa to spy for slavers he called on his uncle in london and spent the greater part of the hours visit with rosamund seemed cured of his passion devoid of rancour glad of the prospect of a run among the slaving hulls he and his uncle shook hands manfully at the full outstretch of their arms in a way so like them to rosamunds thinkingthat is in a way so unlike any other possible couple of men so situatedthat the humour of the sight eclipsed all the pleasantries of captain baskelett good bye sir nevil said heartily and everard romfrey was not behind hand with the cordial ring of his good bye nevil and upon that they separated rosamund would have been willing to speak to her beloved of his false renethe frenchwoman she termed her ie generically false needless to name and one question quivered on her tongues tip how when she had promised to fly with you how could she the very next day step to the altar with him now her husband and if she had spoken it she would have added your uncle could not have set his face against you had you brought her to england she felt strongly the mastery nevil beauchamp could exercise even over his uncle everard but when he was gone unquestioned merely caressed it came to her mind that he had all through insisted on his possession of this particular power and she accused herself of having wantonly helped to ruin his hopea matter to be rejoiced at in the abstract but what suffering she had inflicted on him to quiet her heart she persuaded herself that for the future she would never fail to believe in him and second him blindly as true love should and contemplating one so brave far sighted and self assured her determination seemed to impose the lightest of tasks practically humane though he was and especially toward cattle and all kinds of beasts mr romfrey entertained no profound fellow feeling for the negro and except as the representative of a certain amount of working power commonly requiring the whip to wind it up he inclined to despise that black spot in the creation with which our civilization should never have had anything to do so he pronounced his mind and the long habit of listening to oracles might grow us ears to hear and discover a meaning in it nevils captures and releases of the grinning freights amused him for awhile he compared them to strings of bananas and presently put the vision of the whole business aside by talking of nevils banana wreath he desired to have nevil out of it he and cecil handed nevil in his banana wreath about to their friends nevil in his banana wreath was set preaching humanitomtity at any rate they contrived to keep the remembrance of nevil beauchamp alive during the period of his disappearance from the world and in so doing they did him a service there is a pause between the descent of a diver and his return to the surface when those who would not have him forgotten by the better world above him do rightly to relate anecdotes of him if they can and to provoke laughter at him the encouragement of the humane sense of superiority over an object of interest which laughter gives is good for the object and besides if you begin to tell sly stories of one in the deeps who is holding his breath to fetch a pearl or two for you all you divert a particular sympathetic oppression of the chest that the extremely sensitive are apt to suffer from and you dispose the larger number to keep in mind a person they no longer see otherwise it is likely that he will very shortly after he has made his plunge fatigue the contemplative brains above and be shuffled off them even as great ocean smoothes away the dear vanished mans immediate circle of foam and rapidly confounds the rippling memory of him with its other agitations and in such a case the apparition of his head upon our common level once more will almost certainly cause a disagreeable shock nor is it improbable that his first natural snorts in his native element though they be simply to obtain his share of the breath of life will draw down on him condemnation for eccentric behaviour and unmannerly and this in spite of the jewel he brings unless it be an exceedingly splendid one the reason is that our brave world cannot pardon a breach of continuity for any petty bribe thus it chanced owing to the prolonged efforts of mr romfrey and cecil baskelett to get fun out of him at the cost of considerable inventiveness that the electoral address of the candidate signing himself r c s nevil beauchamp to the borough of bevisham did not issue from an altogether unremembered man he had been cruising in the mediterranean commanding the ariadne the smartest corvette in the service he had it was widely made known met his marquise in palermo it was presumed that he was dancing the round with her still when this amazing address appeared on bevishams walls in anticipation of the general election the address moreover was ultra radical museums to be opened on sundays ominous references to the land question etc no smooth passing mention of reform such as the liberal become stately adopts in speaking of that property of his but swinging blows on the heads of many a denounced iniquity cecil forwarded the address to everard romfrey without comment next day the following letter dated from itchincope the house of mr grancey lespel on the borders of bevisham arrived at steynham i have despatched you the proclamation folded neatly the electors of bevisham are summoned like a town at the swords point to yield him their votes proclamation is the word i am your born representative i have completed my political education on salt water and i tackle you on the land question i am the heir of your votes gentlemeni forgot and i apologize he calls them fellow men fraternal and not so risky here at lespels we read the thing with shouts it hangs in the smoking room we throw open the curacoa to the intelligence and industry of the assembled guests we carry the right of the multitude to our hosts cigars by a majority cest un farceur que notre bon petit cousin lespel says it is sailorlike to do something of this sort after a cruise nevils radicalism would have been clever anywhere out of bevisham of all boroughs grancey lespel knows it he and his family were bevishams whig mps before the day of manchester in bevisham an election is an arrangement made by providence to square the accounts of the voters and settle arrears they reckon up the health of their two members and the chances of an appeal to the country when they fix the rents and leases you have them pointed out to you in the street with their figures attached to them like titles mr tomkins the twenty pound man an elector of uncommon purity i saw the ruffian yesterday he has an extra breadth to his hat he has never been known to listen to a member under and is respected enormouslylike the lady of the mythology who was an intolerable tartar of virtue because her price was nothing less than a god and money down nevil will have to come down on bevisham in the jupiter style bevisham is downright the dearest of boroughsvaulting boards as stukely culbrett calls themin the kingdom i assume we still say kingdom he dashed into the radical trap exactly two hours after landing i believe he was on his way to the halketts at mount laurels a notorious old rascal revolutionist retired from his licenced business of slaughtererone of your gratis doctorsmet him on the high road and told him he was the man up went nevils enthusiasm like a bottle rid of the cork you will see a great deal about faith in the proclamation faith in the future and my faith in you when you become a radical you have faith in any quantity just as an alderman gets turtle soup it is your badge like a livery servants cockade or a corporals sleeve stripesyour badge and your bellyful calculations were gone through at the liberal newspaper office old nevil adding up hard and he was informed that he was elected by something like a topping eight or nine hundred and some fractions i am sure that a fellow who can let himself be gulled by a pile of figures trumped up in a radical newspaper office must have great faith in the fractions out came nevils proclamation i have not met him and i would rather not i shall not pretend to offer you advice for i have the habit of thinking your judgement can stand by itself we shall all find this affair a nuisance nevil will pay through the nose we shall have the ridicule spattered on the family it would be a safer thing for him to invest his money on the turf and i shall advise his doing it if i come across him perhaps the best course would be to telegraph for the marquise this was from cecil baskelett he added a postscript seriously the mad commander has not an ace of a chance grancey and i saw some working men you have to write them in capitals king and queen small they were reading the address on a board carried by a red nosed man and shrugging they are not such fools by the way i am informed shrapnel has a young female relative living with him said to be a sparkler i bet you sir she is not a radical do you take me rosamund culling drove to the railway station on her way to bevisham within an hour after mr romfreys eyebrows had made acute play over this communication chapter xii an interview with the infamous dr shrapnel in the high street of the ancient and famous town and port of bevisham rosamund met the military governor of a neighbouring fortress general sherwin once colonel of her husbands regiment in india and by him as it happened she was assisted in finding the whereabout of the young liberal candidate without the degrading recourse of an application at the newspaper office of his party the general was leisurely walking to a place of appointment to fetch his daughter home from a visit to an old school friend a miss jenny denham no other than a ward or a niece or an adoption of dr shrapnels a nice girl a great favourite of mine the general said shrapnel he knew by reputation only as a wrong headed politician but he spoke of miss denham pleasantly two or three times praising her accomplishments and her winning manners his hearer suspected that it might be done to dissociate the idea of her from the ruffling agitator is she pretty was a question that sprang from rosamunds intimate reflections the answer was yes very pretty i think very pretty said the general captivatingly clara thinks she is perfect she is tall and slim and dresses well the girls were with a french madam in paris but if you are interested about her you can come on with me and we shall meet them somewhere near the head of the street i dont the general hesitated and hummedi dont call at shrapnels i have never heard her name before to day said rosamund exactly said the general crowing at the aimlessness of a womans curiosity the young ladies were seen approaching and rosamund had to ask herself whether the first sight of a person like miss denham would be of a kind to exercise a lively influence over the political and other sentiments of a dreamy sailor just released from ship service in an ordinary case she would have said no for nevil enjoyed a range of society where faces charming as miss denhams were plentiful as roses in the rose garden but supposing him free of his bondage to the foreign woman there was she thought and feared a possibility that a girl of this description might capture a young mans vacant heart sighing for a new mistress and if so further observation assured her miss denham was likely to be dangerous far more than professedly attractive persons enchantresses and the rest rosamund watchfully gathered all the superficial indications which incite women to judge of character profoundly this new object of alarm was as the general had said of her tall and slim a friend of neatness plainly dressed but exquisitely fitted in the manner of frenchwomen she spoke very readily not too much and had the rare gift of being able to speak fluently with a smile on the mouth vulgar archness imitates it she won and retained the eyes of her hearer sympathetically it seemed rosamund thought her as little conscious as a woman could be she coloured at times quickly but without confusion when that name the key of rosamunds meditations chanced to be mentioned a flush swept over miss denhams face the candour of it was unchanged as she gazed at rosamund with a look that asked do you know him rosamund said i am an old friend of his he is here now in this town i wish to see him very much general sherwin interposed we wont talk about political characters just for the present i wish you knew him papa and would advise him his daughter said the general nodded hastily by and by by and by they had in fact taken seats at a table of mutton pies in a pastrycooks shop where dashing military men were restrained solely by their presence from a too noisy display of fascinations before the fashionable waiting women rosamund looked at miss denham as soon as they were in the street the latter said if you will be good enough to come with me madam rosamund bowed thankful to have been comprehended the two young ladies kissed cheeks and parted general sherwin raised his hat and was astonished to see mrs culling join miss denham in accepting the salute for they had not been introduced and what could they have in common it was another of the oddities of female nature my name is mrs culling and i will tell you how it is that i am interested in captain beauchamp rosamund addressed her companion i am his uncles housekeeper i have known him and loved him since he was a boy i am in great fear that he is acting rashly you honour me madam by speaking to me so frankly miss denham answered he is quite bent upon this election yes madam i am not as you can suppose in his confidence but i hear of him from dr shrapnel your uncle i call him uncle he is my guardian madam it is perhaps excuseable that this communication did not cause the doctor to shine with added lustre in rosamunds thoughts or ennoble the young lady you are not relatives then she said no unless love can make us so not blood relatives no is he not very extreme he is very sincere i presume you are a politician miss denham smiled could you pardon me madam if i said that i was the counter question was a fair retort enfolding a gentler irony rosamund felt that she had to do with wits as well as with vivid feminine intuitions in the person of this miss denham she said i really am of opinion that our sex might abstain from politics we find it difficult to do justice to both parties miss denham followed it seems to be a kind of clanship with women hardly even that rosamund was inattentive to the conversational slipshod and launched one of the heavy affirmatives which are in dialogue full stops she could not have said why she was sensible of anger but the sentiment of anger or spite if that be a lesser degree of the same affliction became stirred in her bosom when she listened to the ward of dr shrapnel a silly pretty puss of a girl would not have excited it nor an avowed blood relative of the demagogue nevils hotel was pointed out to rosamund and she left her card there he had been absent since eight in the morning there was the probability that he might be at dr shrapnels so rosamund walked on captain beauchamp gives himself no rest miss denham said oh i know him when once his mind is set on anything said rosamund is it not too early to begin tocanvass i think is the word he is studying whatever the town can teach him of its wants that is how he may serve it indeed but if the town will not have him to serve it he imagines that he cannot do better until that has been decided than to fit himself for the post acting upon your advice i mean of course your uncles that is dr shrapnels dr shrapnel thinks it will not be loss of time for captain beauchamp to grow familiar with the place and observe as well as read it sounds almost as if captain beauchamp had submitted to be dr shrapnels pupil it is natural madam that dr shrapnel should know more of political ways at present than captain beauchamp to captain beauchamps friends and relatives it appears very strange that he should have decided to contest this election so suddenly may i inquire whether he and dr shrapnel are old acquaintances no madam they are not they had never met before captain beauchamp landed the other day i am surprised i confess i cannot understand the nature of an influence that induces him to abandon a profession he loves and shines in for politics at a moments notice miss denham was silent and then said i will tell you madam how it occurred as far as circumstances explain it dr shrapnel is accustomed to give a little country feast to the children i teach and their parents if they choose to come and they generally do they are driven to northeden heath where we set up a booth for them and try with cakes and tea and games to make them spend one of their happy afternoons and evenings we succeed i know for the little creatures talk of it and look forward to the day when they are at their last romp dr shrapnel speaks to the parents can he obtain a hearing rosamund asked he has not so very large a crowd to address madam and he is much beloved by those that come he speaks to them of politics on those occasions adouci leur intention it is not a political speech but dr shrapnel thinks that in a so called free country seeking to be really free men of the lowest class should be educated in forming a political judgement and women too and women yes indeed madam we notice that the women listen very creditably they can put on the air i am afraid not more than the men do to get them to listen is something they suffer like the men and must depend on their intelligence to win their way out of it rosamunds meditation was exclamatory what can be the age of this pretentious girl an afterthought turned her more conciliatorily toward the person but less to the subject she was sure that she was lending ear to the echo of the dangerous doctor and rather pitied miss denham for awhile reflecting that a young woman stuffed with such ideas would find it hard to get a husband mention of nevil revived her feeling of hostility we had seen a gentleman standing near and listening attentively miss denham resumed and when dr shrapnel concluded a card was handed to him he read it and gave it to me and said you know that name it was a name we had often talked about during the war he went to captain beauchamp and shook his hand he does not pay many compliments and he does not like to receive them but it was impossible for him not to be moved by captain beauchamps warmth in thanking him for the words he had spoken i saw that dr shrapnel became interested in captain beauchamp the longer they conversed we walked home together captain beauchamp supped with us i left them at half past eleven at night and in the morning i found them walking in the garden they had not gone to bed at all captain beauchamp has remained in bevisham ever since he soon came to the decision to be a candidate for the borough rosamund checked her lips from uttering to be a puppet of dr shrapnels she remarked he is very eloquentdr shrapnel miss denham held some debate with herself upon the term perhaps it is not eloquence he often no he is not an orator rosamund suggested that he was persuasive possibly again the young lady deliberately weighed the word as though the nicest measure of her uncle or adoptors quality in this or that direction were in requisition and of importancean instance of a want of delicacy of perception rosamund was not sorry to detect for good looking refined looking quick witted girls can be grown but the nimble sense of fitness ineffable lightning footed tact comes of race and breeding and she was sure nevil was a man soon to feel the absence of that dr shrapnel is persuasive to those who go partly with him or whose condition of mind calls on him for great patience miss denham said at last i am only trying to comprehend how it was that he should so rapidly have won captain beauchamp to his views rosamund explained and the young lady did not reply dr shrapnels house was about a mile beyond the town on a common of thorn and gorse through which the fir bordered highway ran a fence waist high enclosed its plot of meadow and garden so that the doctor while protecting his own might see and be seen of the world as was the case when rosamund approached he was pacing at long slow strides along the gravel walk with his head bent and bare and his hands behind his back accompanied by a gentleman who could be no other than nevil rosamund presumed to think but drawing nearer she found she was mistaken that is not captain beauchamps figure she said no it is not he said miss denham rosamund saw that her companion was pale she warmed to her at once by no means on account of the pallor in itself i have walked too fast for you i fear oh no i am accused of being a fast walker rosamund was unwilling to pass through the demagogues gate on second thoughts she reflected that she could hardly stipulate to have news of nevil tossed to her over the spikes and she entered while receiving dr shrapnels welcome to a friend of captain beauchamp she observed the greeting between miss denham and the younger gentleman it reassured her they met like two that have a secret the dreaded doctor was an immoderately tall man lean and wiry carelessly clad in a long loose coat of no colour loose trowsers and huge shoes he stooped from his height to speak or rather swing the stiff upper half of his body down to his hearers level and back again like a ships mast on a billowy sea he was neither rough nor abrupt nor did he roar bullmouthedly as demagogues are expected to do though his voice was deep he was actually after his fashion courteous it could be said of him except that his mind was too visibly possessed by distant matters for rosamunds taste she being accustomed to drawing room and hunting and military gentlemen who can be all in the words they utter nevertheless he came out of his lizard like look with the down dropped eyelids quick at a resumption of the dialogue sometimes gesturing sweeping his arm round a stubborn tuft of iron grey hair fell across his forehead and it was apparently one of his lifes labours to get it to lie amid the mass for his hand rarely ceased to be in motion without an impulsive stroke at the refractory forelock he peered through his eyelashes ordinarily but from no infirmity of sight the truth was that the mans nature counteracted his spirits intenser eagerness and restlessness by alternating a state of repose that resembled dormancy and so preserved him rosamund was obliged to give him credit for straightforward eyes when they did look out and flash their filmy blue half overflown with grey by age was poignant while the fire in them lasted her antipathy attributed something electrical to the light they shot dr shrapnels account of nevil stated him to have gone to call on colonel halkett a new resident at mount laurels on the otley river he offered the welcome of his house to the lady who was captain beauchamps friend saying with extraordinary fatuity so it sounded in rosamunds ears that captain beauchamp would certainly not let an evening pass without coming to him rosamund suggested that he might stay late at mount laurels then he will arrive here after nightfall said the doctor a bed is at your service maam the offer was declined i should like to have seen him to day but he will be home shortly he will not quit bevisham till this elections decided unless to hunt a stray borough vote maam he goes to mount laurels for that purpose i do not think he will persuade colonel halkett to vote in the radical interest that is the probability with a landed proprietor maam we must knock whether the door opens or not like the doctor laughed to himself up aloft like a watchman in the night to say that he smells smoke on the premises surely we may expect captain beauchamp to consult his family about so serious a step as this he is taking rosamund said with an effort to be civil why should he asked the impending doctor his head continued in the interrogative position when it had resumed its elevation the challenge for a definite reply to so outrageous a question irritated rosamunds nerves and loth though she was to admit him to the subject she could not forbear from saying why surely his family have the first claim on him surely not maam there is no first claim a mans wife and children have a claim on him for bread a mans parents have a claim on him for obedience while he is a child a mans uncles aunts and cousins have no claim on him at all except for help in necessity which he can grant and they require nonewife children parents relativesnone has a claim to bar his judgement and his actions sound the conscience and sink the family with a clear conscience it is best to leave the family to its own debates no man ever did brave work who held counsel with his family the family view of a mans fit conduct is the weak point of the country it is no other view than better thy condition for our sakes ha in this way we breed sheep fatten oxen men are dying off resolution taken consult the family meanswaste your time those who go to it want an excuse for altering their minds the family view is everlastingly the shopkeepers purse pence ease increase of worldly goods personal importancethe pound the english pound dare do that and you forfeit your share of port wine in this world you wont be dubbed with a title youll be fingered at lord lord is it the region inside a man or out that gives him peace out they say for they have lost faith in the existence of an inner they havent it air sucker blood pump cooking machinery and a battery of trained instincts aptitudes fill up their vacuum i repeat maam why should young captain beauchamp spend an hour consulting his family they wont approve him he knows it they may annoy him and what is the gain of that they cant move him on that i let my right hand burn so it would be useless on both sides he thinks so so do i he is one of the men to serve his country on the best field we can choose for him in a ships cabin he is thrown away ay ay war and he may go aboard but now we must have him ashore too few of such as he it is matter of opinion said rosamund very tightly compressed scarcely knowing what she said how strange besides hateful it was to her to hear her darling spoken of by a stranger who not only pretended to appreciate but to possess him a stranger a man of evil with monstrous ideas a terribly strong inexhaustible man of a magical power too or would he otherwise have won such a mastery over nevil of course she could have shot a rejoinder to confute him with all the force of her indignation save that the words were tumbling about in her head like a world in disruption which made her feel a weakness at the same time that she gloated on her capacity as though she had an enormous army quite overwhelming if it could but be got to move in advance this very common condition of the silent stricken unused in dialectics heightened rosamunds disgust by causing her to suppose that nevil had been similarly silenced in his case vanquished captured ruined and he dwindled in her estimation for a moment or two she felt that among a sisterhood of gossips she would soon have found her voice and struck down the demagogues audacious sophisms not that they affected her in the slightest degree for her own sake shrapnel might think what he liked and say what he liked as far as she was concerned apart from the man she loved rosamund went through these emotions altogether on nevils behalf and longed for her affirmatizing inspiring sisterhood until the thought of them threw another shade on him what champion was she to look to to whom but to mr everard romfrey it was with a spasm of delighted reflection that she hit on mr romfrey he was like a discovery to her with his strength and skill his robust common sense and rough shrewd wit his prompt comparisons his chivalry his love of combat his old knightly blood was not he a match and an overmatch for the ramping radical who had tangled nevil in his rough snares she ran her mind over mr romfreys virtues down even to his towering height and breadth could she but once draw these two giants into collision in nevils presence she was sure it would save him the method of doing it she did not stop to consider she enjoyed her triumph in the idea meantime she had passed from dr shrapnel to miss denham and carried on a conversation becomingly tea had been made in the garden and she had politely sipped half a cup which involved no step inside the guilty house and therefore no distress to her antagonism the sun descended she heard the doctor reciting could it be poetry in her imagination the sombre hues surrounding an incendiary opposed that bright spirit she listened smiling incredulously miss denham could interpret looks and said dr shrapnel is very fond of those verses rosamunds astonishment caused her to say are they his owna piece of satiric innocency at which miss denham laughed softly as she answered no rosamund pleaded that she had not heard them with any distinctness are they written by the gentleman at his side mr lydiard no he writes but the verses are not his does he knowhas he met captain beauchamp yes once captain beauchamp has taken a great liking to his works rosamund closed her eyes feeling that she was in a nest that had determined to appropriate nevil but at any rate there was the hope and the probability that this mr lydiard of the pen had taken a long start of nevil in the heart of miss denham and struggling to be candid to ensure some meditative satisfaction rosamund admitted to herself that the girl did not appear to be one of the wanton giddy pated pusses who play two gentlemen or more on their line appearances however could be deceptive never pretend to know a girl by her face was one of rosamunds maxims she was next informed of dr shrapnels partiality for music toward the hour of sunset miss denham mentioned it and the doctor presently sauntering up invited rosamund to a seat on a bench near the open window of the drawing room he nodded to his ward to go in i am a fire worshipper maam he said the god of day is the father of poetry medicine music our best friend see him there my jenny will spin a thread from us to him over the millions of miles with one touch of the chords as quick as he shoots a beam on us ay on her wretched tinkler called a piano which tries at the whole orchestra and murders every instrument in the attempt but its convenient like our modern civilizationa taming and a diminishing of individuals for an insipid harmony you surely do not object to the organi fear i cannot wait though said rosamund miss denham entreated her oh do madam not to hear mei am not so perfect a player that i should wish itbut to see him captain beauchamp may now be coming at any instant mr lydiard added i have an appointment with him here for this evening you build a cathedral of sound in the organ said dr shrapnel casting out a league of leg as he sat beside his only half persuaded fretful guest you subject the winds to serve you thats a gain you do actually accomplish a resonant imitation of the various instruments they sing out as your two hands command themtrumpet flute dulcimer hautboy drum storm earthquake ethereal quire you have them at your option but tell me of an organ in the open air the sublimity would vanish maam both from the notes and from the structure because accessories and circumstances produce its chief effects say that an organ is a despotism just as your piano is the constitutional bourgeois match them with the trained orchestral band of skilled individual performers indoors or out where each grasps his instrument and each relies on his fellow with confidence and an unrivalled concord comes of it that is our republic each one to his work all in union theres the motto for us then you have music harmony the highest fullest finest educate your men to form a band you shame dexterous trickery and imitation sounds then for the difference of real instruments from clever shams oh ay one will set your organ going that is one in front with his couple of panting air pumpers behindhis ministers dr shrapnel laughed at some undefined mental image apparently careless of any laughing companionship one will do it for you especially if hes born to do it born a slap of the knee reported what seemed to be an immensely contemptuous sentiment but free mouths blowing into brass and wood maam beat your bellows and your whifflers your artificial chorusescrash crash your unanimous plebiscitums beat them theres no contest were in another world were in the suns worldyonder miss denhams opening notes on the despised piano put a curb on the doctor she began a mass of mozarts without the usual preliminary rattle of the keys as of a crier announcing a performance straight to her task for which rosamund thanked her liking that kind of composed simplicity she thanked her more for cutting short the doctors fanatical nonsense it was perceptible to her that a species of mad metaphor had been wriggling and tearing its passage through a thorn bush in his discourse with the furious urgency of a sheep in a panic but where the ostensible subject ended and the metaphor commenced and which was which at the conclusion she found it difficult to discernmuch as the sheep would be when he had left his fleece behind him she could now have said silly old man dr shrapnel appeared most placable he was gazing at his authority in the heavens tangled among gold clouds and purple his head bent acutely on one side and his eyes upturned in dim speculation his great feet planted on their heels faced him suggesting the stocks his arms hung loose full many a hero of the alehouse anciently amenable to leg and foot imprisonment in the grip of the parish has presented as respectable an air his forelock straggled as it willed rosamund rose abruptly as soon as the terminating notes of the mass had been struck dr shrapnel seemed to be concluding his devotions before he followed her example there maam you have a telegraphic system for the soul he said it is harder work to travel from this place to this he pointed at ear and breast than from here to yonder a similar indication traversed the distance between earth and sun mans aim has hitherto been to keep men from having a soul for this world he takes it for something infernal hei mean they that hold power they shudder to think the conservatism of the earth will be shaken by a change they dread they wont get men with souls to fetch and carry dig root mine for them rightwhat then digging and mining will be done so will harping and singing but then we have a natural optimacy then on the one hand we whip the man beast and the man sloth on the other we seize that old fatted iniquitythat tyrant that tempter that legitimated swindler cursed of christ that palpable satan whose name is capital by the neck and have him disgorging within three gasps of his life he is the villain let him live for he too comes of blood and bone he shall not grind the faces of the poor and helplessthats all the comicality of her having such remarks addressed to her provoked a smile on rosamunds lips dont go at him like samson blind said mr lydiard and miss denham who had returned begged her guardian to entreat the guest to stay she said in an undertone i am very anxious you should see captain beauchamp madam i too but he will write and i really can wait no longer rosamund replied in extreme apprehension lest a certain degree of pressure should overbear her repugnance to the doctors dinner table miss denhams look was fixed on her but whatever it might mean rosamunds endurance was at an end she was invited to dine she refused she was exceedingly glad to find herself on the high road again with a prospect of reaching steynham that night for it was important that she should not have to confess a visit to bevisham now when she had so little of favourable to tell mr everard romfrey of his chosen nephew whether she had acted quite wisely in not remaining to see nevil was an agitating question that had to be silenced by an appeal to her instincts of repulsion and a further appeal for justification of them to her imaginary sisterhood of gossips how could she sit and eat how pass an evening in that house in the society of that man her tuneful chorus cried how indeed besides it would have offended mr romfrey to hear that she had done so still she could not refuse to remember miss denhams marked intimations of there being a reason for nevils friend to seize the chance of an immediate interview with him and in her distress at the thought rosamund reluctantly but as if compelled by necessity ascribed the young ladys conduct to a strong sense of personal interests evidently she has no desire he should run the risk of angering a rich uncle this shameful suspicion was unavoidable there was no other opiate for rosamunds blame of herself after letting her instincts gain the ascendancy it will be found a common case that when we have yielded to our instincts and then have to soothe conscience we must slaughter somebody for a sacrificial offering to our sense of comfort chapter xiii a superfine conscience however much mr everard romfrey may have laughed at nevil beauchamp with his banana wreath he liked the fellow for having volunteered for that african coast service and the news of his promotion by his admiral to the post of commander through a death vacancy had given him an exalted satisfaction for as he could always point to the cause of failures he strongly appreciated success the circumstance had offered an occasion for the new commander to hit him hard upon a matter of fact beauchamp had sent word of his advance in rank but requested his uncle not to imagine him wearing an additional epaulette and he corrected the infallible gentlemans error which had of course been reported to him when he was dreaming of rene by mrs culling concerning a lieutenants shoulder decorations most gravely informing him of the anchor on the lieutenants pair of epaulettes and the anchor and star on a commanders and the crown on a captains with a well feigned solicitousness to save his uncle from blundering further this was done in the dry neat manner which mr romfrey could feel to be his own turned on him he began to conceive a vague respect for the fellow who had proved him wrong upon a matter of fact beauchamp came from africa rather worn by the climate and immediately obtained the command of the ariadne corvette which had been some time in commission in the mediterranean whither he departed without visiting steynham allowing rosamund to think him tenacious of his wrath as well as of love mr romfrey considered him to be insatiable for service beauchamp during his absence had shown himself awake to the affairs of his country once only in an urgent supplication he had forwarded for all his uncles influence to be used to get him appointed to the first vacancy in robert halls naval brigade then forming a part of our handful in insurgent india the fate of that chivalrous englishman that born sailor warrior that truest of heroes imperishable in the memory of those who knew him and in our annals young though he was when death took him had wrung from nevil beauchamp such a letter of tears as to make mr romfrey believe the naval crown of glory his highest ambition who on earth could have guessed him to be bothering his head about politics all the while or was the whole stupid business a freak of the moment it became necessary for mr romfrey to contemplate his eccentric nephew in the light of a mannikin once more consequently he called to mind and bade rosamund culling remember that he had foreseen and had predicted the mounting of nevil beauchamp on his political horse one day or another and perhaps the earlier the better and a donkey could have sworn that when he did mount he would come galloping in among the radical rough riders letters were pouring upon steynham from men and women of romfrey blood and relationship concerning the positive tone of radicalism in the commanders address everard laughed at them as a practical man his objection lay against the poor fools choice of the peccant borough of bevisham still in view of the needfulness of his learning wisdom and rapidly the disbursement of a lot of his money certain to be required by bevishams electors seemed to be the surest method for quickening his wits thus would he be acting as his own chirurgeon gaily practising phlebotomy on his person to cure him of his fever too much money was not the origin of the fever in nevils case but he had too small a sense of the value of what he possessed and the diminishing stock would be likely to cry out shrilly to this effect never complaining that nevil beauchamp had not come to him to take counsel with him the high minded old gentleman talked at the same time while indulging in so philosophical a picture of himself as was presented by a romfrey mildly accounting for events and smoothing them under the infliction of an offence he could not but feel that nevil had challenged him such was the reading of it and he waited for some justifiable excitement to fetch him out of the magnanimous mood rather in the image of an angler it must be owned nevil understands that i am not going to pay a farthing of his expenses in bevisham he said to mrs culling she replied blandly and with innocence i have not seen him sir he nodded at the next mention of nevil between them he asked where is it hes lying perdu maam i fancy in that town in bevisham at the liberal radical hotel i dare say some place i am not certain the rascal doctors house there shrapnels really i have not seen him have you heard from him i have had a letter a short one where did he date his letter from from bevisham from what house rosamund glanced about for a way of escaping the question there was none but the door she replied from dr shrapnels thats the anti game law agitator you do not imagine sir that nevil subscribes to every thing the horrid man agitates for you dont like the man maam i detest him ha so you have seen shrapnel only for a moment a moment or two i cannot endure him i am sure i have reason rosamund flushed exceedingly red the visit to dr shrapnels house was her secret and the worming of it out made her feel guilty and that feeling revived and heated her antipathy to the radical doctor what reason said mr romfrey freshening at her display of colour she would not expose nevil to the accusation of childishness by confessing her positive reason so she answered the man is a kind of man i was not there long i was glad to escape he she hesitated for in truth it was difficult to shape the charge against him and the effort to be reticent concerning nevil and communicative now that he had been spoken of as to the detested doctor reduced her to some confusion she was also fatally anxious to be in the extreme degree conscientious and corrected and modified her remarks most suspiciously did he insult you maam mr romfrey inquired she replied hastily oh no he may be a good man in his way he is one of those men who do not seem to think a woman may have opinions he does not scruple to outrage those we hold i am afraid he is an infidel his ideas of family duties and ties and his manner of expressing himself shocked me that is all he is absurd i dare say there is no harm in him except for those who are so unfortunate as to fall under his influenceand that i feel sure cannot be permanent he could not injure me personally he could not offend me i mean indeed i have nothing whatever to say against him as far as i did he fail to treat you as a lady maam rosamund was getting frightened by the significant pertinacity of her lord i am sure sir he meant no harm was the man uncivil to you maam came the emphatic interrogation she asked herself had dr shrapnel been uncivil toward her and so conscientious was she that she allowed the question to be debated in her mind for half a minute answering then no not uncivil i cannot exactly explain he certainly did not intend to be uncivil he is only an unpolished vexatious man enormously tall mr romfrey ejaculated ha humph his view of dr shrapnel was taken from that instant it was that this enormously big blustering agitator against the preservation of birds had behaved rudely toward the lady officially the chief of his household and might be considered in the light of an adversary one would like to meet the size of the man increased his aspect of villany which in return added largely to his giant size everard romfreys mental eye could perceive an attractiveness about the man little short of magnetic for he thought of him so much that he had to think of what was due to his pacifical disposition deeply believed in by him to spare himself the trouble of a visit to bevisham the young gentleman whom he regarded as the radical doctors dupe fell in for a share of his view of the doctor and mr romfrey became less fitted to observe nevil beauchamps doings with the olympian gravity he had originally assumed the extreme delicacy of rosamunds conscience was fretted by a remorseful doubt of her having conveyed a just impression of dr shrapnel somewhat as though the fine sleek coat of it were brushed the wrong way reflection warned her that her deliberative intensely sincere pause before she responded to mr romfreys last demand might have implied more than her words she consoled herself with the thought that it was the dainty susceptibility of her conscientiousness which caused these noble qualms and so deeply does a refined nature esteem the gift that her pride in it helped her to overlook her moral perturbation she was consoled moreover up to the verge of triumph in her realization of the image of a rivalling and excelling power presented by mr romfrey though it had frightened her at the time let not dr shrapnel come across him she hoped he would not ultimately she could say to herself perhaps i need not have been so annoyed with the horrid man it was on nevils account shrapnels contempt of the claims of nevils family upon him was actually a piece of impudence impudently expressed if she remembered correctly and shrapnel was a black malignant the foe of the nations constitution deserving of punishment if ever man was with his ridiculous metaphors and talk of organs and pianos orchestras and despotisms and flying to the sun how could nevil listen to the creature shrapnel must be a shameless hypocrite to mask his wickedness from one so clear sighted as nevil and no doubt he indulged in his impudence out of wanton pleasure in it his business was to catch young gentlemen of family and to turn them against their families plainly that was thinking the best of him no doubt he had his objects to gain he might have been as impudent as he liked to me i would have pardoned him rosamund exclaimed personally you see she was generous on the whole knowing everard romfrey as she did she wished that she had behaved albeit perfectly discreet in her behaviour and conscientiously just a shade or two differently but the evil was done chapter xiv the leading article and mr timothy turbot nevil declined to come to steynham clearly owing to a dread of hearing dr shrapnel abused as rosamund judged by the warmth of his written eulogies of the man and an ensuing allusion to game he said that he had not made up his mind as to the game laws rosamund mentioned the fact to mr romfrey so we may stick by our licences to shoot to morrow he rejoined of a letter that he also had received from nevil he did not speak she hinted at it and he stared he would have deemed it as vain a subject to discourse of india or continental affairs at a period when his house was full for the opening day of sport and the expectation of keeping up his renown for great bags on that day so entirely occupied his mind good shots were present who had contributed to the fame of steynham on other opening days birds were plentiful and promised not to be too wild he had the range of the steynham estate in his eye dotted with covers and after steynham holdesbury which had never yielded him the same high celebrity but both lay mapped out for action under the profound calculations of the strategist ready to show the skill of the field tactician he could not attend to nevil even the talk of the forthcoming elections hardly to be avoided at his table seemed a puerile distraction ware the foe of his partridges and pheasants be it man or vermin the name of shrapnel was frequently on the tongue of captain baskelett rosamund heard him in her room and his derisive shouts of laughter over it cecil was a fine shot quite as fond of the pastime as his uncle and always in favour with him while sport stalked the land he was in gallant spirits and rosamund brooding over nevils fortunes and sitting much alone as she did when there were guests in the house gave way to her previous apprehensions she touched on them to mr stukely culbrett her husbands old friend one of those happy men who enjoy perceptions without opinions and are not born to administer comfort to other than themselves as far as she could gather he fancied nevil beauchamp was in danger of something but he delivered his mind only upon circumstances and characters nevil risked his luck cecil knew his game everard romfrey was the staunchest of mankind stukely had nothing further to say regarding the situation she asked him what he thought and he smiled could a reasonable head venture to think anything in particular he repeated the amazed you dont say so of colonel halkett on hearing the name of the new liberal candidate for bevisham at the dinner table together with some of cecils waggish embroidery upon the theme rosamund exclaimed angrily oh if i had been there he would not have dared why not be there said stukely you have had your choice for a number of years she shook her head reddening but supposing that she had greater privileges than were hers now the idea flashed a taint of personal pique awakened by the fancied necessity for putting her devotedness to nevil to proof asked her if she would then be the official housekeeper to whom captain baskelett bowed low with affected respect and impertinent affability ironically praising her abroad as a wonder among women that could at one time have played the deuce in the family had she chosen to do so just as you like mr culbrett remarked it was his ironical habit of mind to believe that the wishes of men and womenwomen as well as menwere expressed by their utterances but speak of nevil to colonel halkett said rosamund earnestly carrying on what was in her heart persuade the colonel you do not think nevil foolishnot more than just a little impetuous i want that marriage to come off not on account of her wealth she is to inherit a welsh mine from her uncle you know besides being an only child recall what nevil was during the war miss halkett has not forgotten it i am sure and a good word for him from a man of the world would i am certain counteract captain baskelettsare they designs at any rate you can if you like help nevil with the colonel i am convinced they are doing him a mischief colonel halkett has bought an estateand what a misfortune that isclose to bevisham i fancy he is toryish will you not speak to him at my request i am so helpless i could cry fancy you have no handkerchief said mr culbrett and give up scheming pray one has only to begin to scheme to shorten life to half a dozen hops and jumps i could say to the colonel young beauchamps a political cub he ought to have a motherly wife yes yes you are right dont speak to him at all said rosamund feeling that there must be a conspiracy to rob her of her proud independence since not a soul could be won to spare her from taking some energetic step if she would be useful to him she loved colonel halkett was one of the guests at steynham who knew and respected her and he paid her a visit and alluded to nevils candidature apparently not thinking much the worse of him we cant allow him to succeed he said and looked for a smiling approval of such natural opposition which rosamund gave him readily after he had expressed the hope that nevil beauchamp would take advantage of his proximity to mount laurels during the contest to try the hospitality of the house he wont mind meeting his uncle the colonels eyes twinkled my daughter has engaged mr romfrey and captain baskelett to come to us when they have shot holdesbury and captain baskelett thought rosamund her jealousy whispering that the mention of his name close upon cecilia halketts might have a nuptial signification she was a witness from her windowa prisoners window her eager heart could have termed itof a remarkable ostentation of cordiality between the colonel and cecil in the presence of mr romfrey was it his humour to conspire to hand miss halkett to cecil and then to show nevil the prize he had forfeited by his folly the three were on the lawn a little before colonel halketts departure the colonels arm was linked with cecils while they conversed presently the latter received his afternoons letters and a newspaper he soon had the paper out at a square stretch and sprightly information for the other two was visible in his crowing throat mr romfrey raised the gun from his shoulder pad and grounded it colonel halkett wished to peruse the matter with his own eyes but cecil could not permit it he must read it aloud for them and he suited his action to his sentences had rosamund been accustomed to leading articles which are the composition of men of an imposing vocabulary she would have recognized and as good as read one in cecils gestures as he tilted his lofty stature forward and back marking his commas and semicolons with flapping of his elbows and all but doubling his body at his periods mr romfrey had enough of it half way down the column his head went sharply to left and right cecils peculiar foppish slicing down of his hand pictured him protesting that there was more and finer of the inimitable stuff to follow the end of the scene exhibited the paper on the turf and colonel halketts hand on cecils shoulder mr romfrey nodding some sort of acquiescence over the muzzle of his gun whether reflective or positive rosamund could not decide she sent out a footman for the paper and was presently communing with its eloquent large type quite unable to perceive where the comicality or the impropriety of it lay for it would have struck her that never were truer things of nevil beauchamp better said in the tone befitting them this perhaps was because she never heard fervid praises of him or of anybody delivered from the mouth and it is not common to hear englishmen phrasing great eulogies of one another still as a rule they do not object to have it performed in that region of our national eloquence the press by an irishman or a scotchman and what could there be to warrant captain baskeletts malicious derision and mr romfreys nodding assent to it in an article where all was truth the truth was mounted on an unusually high wind it was indeed a leading article of a banner like bravery and the unrolling of it was designed to stir emotions beauchamp was the theme nevil had it under his eyes earlier than cecil the paper was brought into his room with the beams of day damp from the presses of the bevisham gazette exactly opposite to him in the white hart hotel and a glance at the paragraphs gave him a lively ardour to spring to his feet what writing he was uplifted as the heroical commander beauchamp of the royal navy and commander beauchamp rn a gentleman of the highest connections he was that illustrious commander beauchamp of our matchless navy who proved on every field of the last glorious war of this country that the traditional valour of the noble and indomitable blood transmitted to his veins had lost none of its edge and weight since the battle axes of the lords de romfrey ever to the fore clove the skulls of our national enemy on the wide and fertile campaigns of france this was pageantry there was more of it then the serious afflatus of the article condescended as it were to blow a shrill and well known whistlethe study of the science of navigation made by commander beauchamp rn was cited for a jocose warranty of a seamans aptness to assist in steering the vessel of the state after thus heeling over to tip a familiar wink to the multitude the leader tone resumed its fit deportment commander beauchamp in responding to the invitation of the great and united liberal party of the borough of bevisham obeyed the inspirations of genius the dictates of humanity and what he rightly considered the paramount duty as it is the proudest ambition of the citizen of a free country but for an occasional drop and bump of the sailing gasbag upon catch words of enthusiasm which are the rhetoric of the merely windy and a collapse on a poetic line which too often signalizes the rhetoricians emptiness of his wind the article was eminent for flight sweep and dash and sailed along far more grandly than ordinary provincial organs for the promoting or seconding of public opinion that are as little to be compared with the mighty metropolitan as are the fife and bugle boys practising on their instruments round melancholy outskirts of garrison towns with the regimental marching full band under the presidency of its drum major no signature to the article was needed for bevisham to know who had returned to the town to pen it those long stretching sentences comparable to the very ship leviathan spanning two atlantic billows appertained to none but the renowned mr timothy turbot of the corn law campaigns reform agitations and all manifestly popular movements requiring the heaven endowed man of speech an interpreter of multitudes and a prompter like most men who have little to say he was an orator in print but that was a poor medium for himhis body without his fire mr timothys place was the platform a wise discernment or else a lucky accident for he came hurriedly from the soil of his native isle needing occupation set him on that side in politics which happened to be making an established current and strong headway oratory will not work against the stream or on languid tides driblets of movements that allowed the world to doubt whether they were so much movements as illusions of the optics did not suit his genius thus he was a liberal no radical fountain liberalism had the attraction for the orator of being the active force in politics between two passive opposing bodies the aspect of either of which it can assume for a menace to the other toryish as against radicals a trifle red in the eyes of the tory it can seem to lean back on the past it can seem to be amorous of the future it is actually the thing of the present and its urgencies therefore popular pouring forth the pure waters of moderation strong in their copiousness delicious and rapturous effects are to be produced in the flood of a liberal oration by a chance infusion of the fierier spirit a flavour of radicalism that is the thing to set an audience bounding and quirking whereas if you commence by tilling a triton pitcher full of the neat liquor upon them you have to resort to the natural element for the orators art of variation you are dilutedand thats bathos to quote mr timothy it was a fine piece of discernment in him let liberalism be your feast radicalism your spice and now and then off and on for a change for diversion for a new emotion just for half an hour or sonow and then the sunday coat of toryism will give you an air you have only to complain of the fit to release your shoulders in a trice mr timothy felt for his art as poets do for theirs and considered what was best adapted to speaking purely to speaking upon no creature did he look with such contempt as upon dr shrapnel whose loose disjunct audiences he was conscious he could giving the doctor any start he liked whirl away from him and have compact enchained at his first flourish yea though they were composed of the poor man with a stomach for the political distillery fit to drain relishingly every private bogside or mountain side tap in old ireland in its best daysthe illicit you understand further to quote mr timothys points of view the radical orator has but two notes and one is the drawling pathetic and the other is the ultra furious and the effect of the former we liken to the english working mans wifes hob set queasy brew of well meant villany that she calls by the innocent name of tea and the latter is to be blown asks to be blown and never should be blown without at least seeming to be blown with an accompaniment of a house on fire sir we must adapt ourselves to our times perhaps a spark or two does lurk about our house but we have vigilant watchmen in plenty and the house has been pretty fairly insured shrieking in it is an annoyance to the inmates nonsensical weeping is a sickly business the times are against radicalism to the full as much as great oratory is opposed to extremes these drag the orator too near to the matter so it is that one radical speech is amazingly like anotherthey all have the earth spots they smell too they smell of brimstone soaring is impossible among that faction but this they can do they can furnish the tory his opportunity to soar when hear you a thrilling tory speech that carries the country with it save when the incendiary radical has shrieked if there was envy in the soul of timothy it was addressed to the fine occasions offered to the tory speaker for vindicating our ancient principles and our sacred homes he admired the tone to be assumed for that purpose it was a good note then could the tory delivering at the right season the shakesperian this england and byronicthe inviolate island shake the frame as though smiting it with the tail of the gymnotus electricus ah and then could he thump out his horace the torys mentor and his cordial with other great ancient comic and satiric poets his old port of the classical cellarage reflecting veneration upon him who did but name them to an audience of good dispositions the tory possessed also an innate inimitably easy style of humour that had the long reach the jolly lordly indifference the comfortable masterfulness of the whip of a four in hand driver capable of flicking and stinging and of being ironically caressing timothy appreciated it for he had winced under it no professor of liberalism could venture on it unless it were in the remote district of a back parlour in the society of a cherishing friend or two and with a slice of lemon requiring to be refloated in the glass but gifts of this description were of a minor order liberalism gave the heading cry devoid of which parties are dogs without a scent orators mere pump handles the torys cry was but a whistle to his pack the radical howled to the moon like any chained hound and no wonder for these parties had no established current they were as hard bound waters the radical being dyked and dammed most soundly the tory resembling a placid lake of the plains fed by springs and no confluents for such good reasons mr timothy rejoiced in the happy circumstances which had expelled him from the shores of his native isle to find a refuge and a vocation in manchester at a period when an orator happened to be in request because dozens were wanted that centre of convulsions and source of streams possessed the statistical orator the reasoning orator and the inspired with others of quality and yet it had need of an ever ready spontaneous imperturbable speaker whose bubbling generalizations and ability to beat the drum humorous could swing halls of meeting from the grasp of an enemy and then ascend on incalescent adjectives to the popular idea of the sublime he was the artistic orator of corn law repealthe manchester flood before which time whigs were since which they have walked like spectral antediluvians or floated as dead canine bodies that are sucked away on the ebb of tides and flung back on the flow ignorant whether they be progressive or retrograde timothy turbot assisted in that vast effort it should have elevated him beyond the editorship of a country newspaper why it did not do so his antagonists pretended to know and his friends would smile to hear the report was that he worshipped the nymph whisky timothys article had plucked beauchamp out of bed beauchamps card in return did the same for him commander beauchamp i am heartily glad to make your acquaintance sir ive been absent at work on the big business we have in common i rejoice to say and am behind my fellow townsmen in this pleasure and lucky i slept here in my room above where i dont often sleep for the row of the machineryits like a steamer that wont go though its always starting ye mr timothy said in a single breath upon entering the back office of the gazette like unto those accomplished violinists who can hold on the bow to finger an incredible number of notes and may be imaged as representing slow paternal time that rolls his capering dot headed generation of mortals over the wheel hundreds to the minute youll excuse my not shaving sir to come down to your summons without an extra touch to the neck band beauchamp beheld a middle sized round man with loose lips and pendant indigo jowl whose eyes twinkled watery like pebbles under the shore wash and whose neck band needed an extra touch from fingers other than his own i am sorry to have disturbed you so early he replied not a bit commander beauchamp not a bit sir early or late and ay readywith the napiers ill wash ill wash i came to speak to you of this article of yours on me they tell me in the office that you are the writer pray dont commander me so muchits not customary and i object to it certainly certainly timothy acquiesced and for the future mr turbot please to be good enough not to allude in print to any of my performances here and there your intentions are complimentary but it happens that i dont like a public patting on the back no and thats true said timothy his appreciative and sympathetic agreement with these sharp strictures on the article brought beauchamp to a stop timothy waited for him then smoothing his prickly cheek remarked if id guessed your errand commander beauchamp id have called in the barber before i came down just to make myself decent for a first introduction beauchamp was not insensible to the slyness of the poke at him you see i come to the borough unknown to it and as quietly as possible and i want to be taken as a politician he continued for the sake of showing that he had sufficient to say to account for his hasty and peremptory summons of the writer of that article to his presence its excessively disagreeable to have ones family lugged into notice in a newspaperespecially if they are of different politics i feel it all would sir said timothy then why the deuce did you do it timothy drew a lading of air into his lungs politics commander beauchamp involves the doing of lots of disagreeable things to ourselves and our relations its positive im a soldier of the great campaign and who knows it better than i sir its climbing the greasy pole for the leg o mutton that makes the mothers heart ache for the jacket and the nether garments she mended neatly if she didnt make them mutton or no mutton theres grease for certain since its sure we cant be disconnected from the family the trick is to turn the misfortune to a profit and allow me the observation that an old family sir and a high and titled family is not to be despised for a background of a portrait in naval uniform with medal and clasps and some small smoke of powder clearing off over therethats if were to act sagaciously in introducing an unknown candidate to a borough that has a sneaking liking for the kind of person more honour to it im a political veteran sir i speak from experience we must employ our weapons every one of them and all off the grindstone very well said beauchamp now understand you are not in future to employ the weapons as you call them that i have objected to timothy gaped slightly whatever you will but no puffery beauchamp added can i by any means arrestpurchaseis it possible tell me to lay an embargostop to days issue of the gazette no morethan the bite of a mad dog timothy replied before he had considered upon the monstrous nature of the proposal beauchamp humphed and tossed his head the simile of the dog struck him with intense effect thered be a second edition said timothy and you might buy up that but therell be a third and you may buy up that but therell be a fourth and a fifth and so on ad infinitum with the advertisement of the sale of the foregoing creating a demand like a rageing thirst in a shipwreck in blighs boat in the tropics im afraid comcaptain beauchamp sir theres no stopping the press while the people have an appetite for itand a companys at the back of it pooh dont talk to me in that way all i complain of is the figure you have made of me said beauchamp fetching him smartly out of his nonsense and all i ask of you is not to be at it again who would suppose from reading an article like that that i am a candidate with a single political idea an article like that said timothy winking and a little surer of his man now that he suggested his possession of ideas an article like that is the best cloak you can put on a candidate with too many of em captain beauchamp ill tell you sir i came i heard of your candidature i had your sketch the pattern of ye before me and i was told that dr shrapnel fathered you politically there was my brief i had to persuade our constituents that you commander beauchamp of the royal navy and the great family of the earls of romfrey one of the heroes of the war and the recipient of a royal humane societys medal for saving life in bevisham waters were something more than the radical doctors political son and sir it was to this end aim and object that i wrote the article i am not ashamed to avow as mine and i do so sir because of the solitary merit it has of serving your political interests as the liberal candidate for bevisham by counteracting the unpopularity of dr shrapnels name on the one part and of reviving the credit due to your valour and high bearing on the field of battle in defence of your country on the other so that bevisham may apprehend in spite of party distinctions that it has the option and had better seize upon the honour of making a mp of a hero beauchamp interposed hastily thank you thank you for the best of intentions but let me tell you i am prepared to stand or fall with dr shrapnel and be hanged to all that humbug timothy rubbed his hands with an abstracted air of washing well commander well sir they say a candidates to be humoured in his infancy for he has to do all the humouring before hes many weeks old at it only theres the facthe soon finds out he has to pay for his first fling like the son of a family sowing his oats to reap his jews credit me sir i thought it prudent to counteract a bit of an apothecarys shop odour in the junior liberal candidates address i found the town sniffing they scented shrapnel in the composition every line of it was mine said beauchamp of course it was and the address was admirably worded sir i make bold to say it to your face but most indubitably it threatened powerful drugs for weak stomachs and it blew cold on votes which are sensitive plants like nothing else in botany if they are only to be got by abandoning principles and by anything but honesty in stating them they may go said beauchamp i repeat my dear sir i repeat the infant candidate delights in his honesty like the babe in its nakedness the beautiful virgin in her innocence so he does but he discovers its time for him to wear clothes in a contested election and whats that but to preserve the outlines pretty correctly whilst he doesnt shock and horrify the optics a dash of conventionalism makes the whole civilized world kin ye know thats the truth you must appear to be one of them for them to choose you after all theres no harm in a dyers hand and sir a candidate looking at his own when he has won the election ah well said beauchamp swinging on his heel and now ill take my leave of you and i apologize for bringing you down here so early please attend to what i have said its peremptory you will give me great pleasure by dining with me to night at the hotel opposite will you i dont know what kind of wine i shall be able to offer you perhaps you know the cellar and may help me in that timothy grasped his hand with pleasure commander beauchamp they have a bucellas over there thats old and a tolerable claret and a port to be inquired for under the breath in a mysteriously intimate tone of voice as one says i know of your treasure and the corner under ground where it lies avoid the champagne tis the banqueting wine ditto the sherry one can drink them one can drink them at a quarter to eight this evening then said nevil ill be there at the stroke of the clock sure as the date of a bill said timothy and its early to guess whether youll catch bevisham or you wont he reflected as he gazed at the young gentleman crossing the road but female bevishams with you if that counts for much timothy confessed that without the employment of any weapon save arrogance and a look of candour the commander had gone some way toward catching the feminine side of himself chapter xv cecilia halkett beauchamp walked down to the pier where he took a boat for hms isis to see jack wilmore whom he had not met since his return from his last cruise and first he tried the efficacy of a dive in salt water as a specific for irritation it gave the edge to a fine appetite that he continued to satisfy while wilmore talked of those famous dogs to which the navy has ever been going we want another panic beauchamp said lieutenant wilmore no one knows better than you what a naval man has to complain of so i hope youll get your election if only that we may reckon on a good look out for the interests of the service a regular board with a permanent lord high admiral and a regular vote of money to keep it up to the mark stick to that hardist has a vote in bevisham i think i can get one or two more why arent you a tory no whigs nor liberals look after us half so well as the tories its enough to break a mans heart to see the troops of dockyard workmen marching out as soon as ever a liberal government marches in then its one of our infernal panics again and patch here patch there every inch of it make believe ill prove to you from examples that the humbug of government causes exactly the same humbugging workmanship it seems as if it were a game of rascals all let them sink us but by heaven one cant help feeling for the country and i do say its the doing of those liberals skilled workmen mind you not to be netted again so easily america reaps the benefit of our folly that was a lucky run of yours up the niger the admiral was friendly but you deserved your luck for gods sake dont forget the state of our service when youre one of our cherubs up aloft beauchamp this ill say ive never heard a man talk about it as you used to in old midshipmite days whole watches throughdont you remember on the north american station and in the black sea and the mediterranean and that girl at malta i wonder what has become of her what a beauty she was i dare say she wasnt so fine a girl as the armenian you unearthed on the bosphorus but she had something about her a fellow cant forget that was a lovely creature coming down the hills over granada on her mule ay weve seen handsome women nevil beauchamp but you always were lucky invariably and i should bet on you for the election canvass for me jack said beauchamp smiling at his friends unconscious double skeining of subjects if i turn out as good a politician as you are a seaman i shall do pounce on hardists vote without losing a day i would go to him but ive missed the halketts twice theyre on the otley river at a place called mount laurels and i particularly want to see the colonel can you give me a boat there and come certainly said wilmore ive danced there with the lady the handsomest girl english style of her time and come come our english styles the best it wears best it looks best foreign women theyre capital to flirt with but a girl like cecilia halkettone cant call her a girl and it wont do to say goddess and queen and charmer are out of the question though shes both and angel into the bargain but by george what a woman to call wife you say and a man attached to a woman like that never can let himself look small no such luck for me only i swear if i stood between a good and a bad action the thought of that girl would keep me straight and ive only danced with her once not long after sketching this rough presentation of the lady with a masculine hand wilmore was able to point to her in person on the deck of her fathers yacht the esperanza standing out of otley river there was a gallant splendour in the vessel that threw a touch of glory on its mistress in the minds of the two young naval officers as they pulled for her in the ships gig wilmore sang out give way men the sailors bent to their oars and presently the schooners head was put to the wind she sees were giving chase wilmore said she cant be expecting me so it must be you no the colonel doesnt race her theyve only been back from italy six months i mean the schooner i remember she talked of you when i had her for a partner yes now i mean miss halkett blest if i think she talked of anything else she sees us ill tell you what she likes she likes yachting she likes italy she likes painting likes things old english awfully fond of heroes i told her a tale of one of our men saving life oh said she didnt your friend nevil beauchamp save a man from drowning off the guardship in exactly the same place and next day she sent me a cheque for three pounds for the fellow steady men i keep her letter the boat went smoothly alongside the schooner miss halkett had come to the side the oars swung fore and aft and beauchamp sprang on deck wilmore had to decline miss halketts invitation to him as well as his friend and returned in his boat he left the pair with a ruffling breeze and a sky all sail prepared it seemed to him to enjoy the most delicious you and i on salt water that a sailor could dream of and placidly envying devoid of jealousy there was just enough of fancy quickened in lieutenant wilmore to give him pictures of them without disturbance of his feelingsone of the conditions of the singular visitation we call happiness if he could have known it for a time his visionary eye followed them pretty correctly so long since they had parted last such changes in the interval and great animation in beauchamps gaze and a blush on miss halketts cheeks she said once captain beauchamp he retorted with a solemn formality they smiled and immediately took footing on their previous intimacy how good it was of you to come twice to mount laurels said she i have not missed you to day no address was on your card where are you staying in the neighbourhood at mr lespels im staying at a bevisham hotel said beauchamp you have not been to steynham yet papa comes home from steynham to night does he well the ariadne is only just paid off and i cant well go to steynham yet i beauchamp was astonished at the hesitation he found in himself to name it i have business in bevisham naval business she remarked no said he the sensitive prescience we have of a critical distaste of our proceedings is the world is aware keener than our intuition of contrary opinions and for the sake of preserving the sweet outward forms of friendliness beauchamp was anxious not to speak of the business in bevisham just then but she looked and he had hesitated so he said flatly i am one of the candidates for the borough indeed and i want the colonel to give me his vote the young lady breathed a melodious oh not condemnatory or reproachfula sound to fill a pause but she was beginning to reflect italy and our english channel are my two poles she said i am constantly swaying between them i have told papa we will not lay up the yacht while the weather holds fair except for the absence of deep colour and bright colour what can be more beautiful than these green waves and that dark forests edge and the garden of an island the yachting water here is an unrivalled lake and if i miss colour which i love i remind myself that we have temperate air here not a sun that sends you under cover we can have our fruits too you see one of the yachtsmen was handing her a basket of hot house grapes reclining beside crisp home made loaflets this is my luncheon will you share it nevil his christian name was pleasant to hear from her lips she held out a bunch to him grapes take one back to the south said he how do you bear compliments you have been in italy some years and it must be the south that has worked the miracle in my growth said cecilia smiling i have grown out of my circassian dress nevil you received it then i wrote you a letter of thanksand abuse for your not coming to steynham you may recognize these pearls the pearls were round her right wrist he looked at the blue veins theyre not pearls of price he said i do not wear them to fascinate the jewellers rejoined miss halkett so you are a candidate at an election you still have a tinge of africa do you know but you have not abandoned the navy not altogether oh no no i hope not i have heard of you but who has not we cannot spare officers like you papa was delighted to hear of your promotion parliament the exclamation was contemptuous its the highest we can aim at beauchamp observed meekly i think i recollect you used to talk politics when you were a midshipman she said you headed the aristocracy did you not the aristocracy wants a head said beauchamp parliament in my opinion is the best of occupations for idle men said she it shows that it is a little too full of them surely the country can go on very well without so much speech making it can go on very well for the rich miss halkett tapped with her foot i should expect a radical to talk in that way nevil take me for one i would not even imagine it say liberal then are you nother eyes opened on him largely and narrowed from surprise to reproach and then to painare you not one of us have you gone over to the enemy nevil i have taken my side cecilia but we on our side dont talk of an enemy most unfortunate we are tories you know nevil papa is a thorough tory he cannot vote for you indeed i have heard him say he is anxious to defeat the plots of an old republican in bevishamsome doctor there and i believe he went to london to look out for a second tory candidate to oppose to the liberals our present member is quite safe of course nevil this makes me unhappy do you not feel that it is playing traitor to ones class to join those men such was the tory way of thinking nevil beauchamp said the tories upheld their toryism in the place of patriotism but do we not owe the grandeur of the country to the tories she said with a lovely air of conviction papa has told me how false the whigs played the duke in the peninsula ruining his supplies writing him down declaring all the time he was fighting his first hard battles that his cause was hopelessthat resistance to napoleon was impossible the duke never never had loyal support but from the tory government the whigs papa says absolutely preached submission to napoleon the whigs i hear were the liberals of those days the two pitts were tories the greatness of england has been built up by the tories i do and will defend them it is the fashion to decry them now they have the honour and safety of the country at heart they do not play disgracefully at reductions of taxes as the liberals do they have given us all our heroes non fu mai gloria senza invidia they have done service enough to despise the envious mob they never condescend to supplicate brute force for aid to crush their opponents you feel in all they do that the instincts of gentlemen are active beauchamp bowed do i speak too warmly she asked papa and i have talked over it often and especially of late you will find him your delighted host and your inveterate opponent and you just the same you will have to pardon me i am a terrible foe i declare to you cecilia i would prefer having you against me to having you indifferent i wish i had not to think it right that you should be beaten and nowcan you throw off political nevil and be sailor nevil i distinguish between my old friend and my our dreadful antagonist not so dreadful except in the shock he gives us to find him in the opposite ranks i am grieved but we will finish our sail in peace i detest controversy i suppose nevil you would have no such things as yachts they are the enjoyments of the rich he reminded her that she wished to finish her sail in peace and he had to remind her of it more than once her scattered resources for argumentation sprang up from various suggestions such as the flight of yachts mention of the shooting season sight of a royal palace and adopted a continually heightened satirical form oddly intermixed with an undisguised affectionate friendliness apparently she thought it possible to worry him out of his adhesion to the wrong side in politics she certainly had no conception of the nature of his political views for one or two extreme propositions flung to him in jest he swallowed with every sign of a perfect facility as if the radical had come to regard stupendous questions as morsels barely sufficient for his daily sustenance cecilia reflected that he must be playing and as it was not a subject for play she tacitly reproved him by letting him be the last to speak of it he may not have been susceptible to the delicate chastisement probably was not for when he ceased it was to look on the beauty of her lowered eyelids rather with an idea that the weight of his argument lay on them it breathed from him both in the department of logic and of feeling in his plea for the poor man and his exposition of the poor mans rightful claims he evidently imagined that he had spoken overwhelmingly and to undeceive him in this respect for his own good cecilia calmly awaited the occasion when she might show the vanity of arguments in their effort to overcome convictions he stood up to take his leave of her on their return to the mouth of the otley river unexpectedly so that the occasion did not arrive but on his mentioning an engagement he had to give a dinner to a journalist and a tradesman of the town of bevisham by way of excuse for not complying with her gentle entreaty that he would go to mount laurels and wait to see the colonel that evening oh then your choice must be made irrevocably i am sure miss halkett said relying upon intonation and manner to convey a great deal more and not without a minor touch of resentment for his having dragged her into the discussion of politics which she considered as a slime wherein men hustled and tussled no doubt worthily enough and as became them not however to impose the strife upon the elect ladies of earth what gentleman ever did talk to a young lady upon the dreary topic seriously least of all should nevil beauchamp have done it that object of her high imagination belonged to the exquisite sphere of the feminine vision of the pure poetic and she was vexed by the discord he threw between her long cherished dream and her unanticipated realization of him if indeed it was he presenting himself to her in his own character and not trifling or not passing through a phase of young mans madness possibly he might be the victim of the latter and more pardonable state and so thinking she gave him her hand good bye nevil i may tell papa to expect you tomorrow do and tell him to prepare for a field day she smiled a sham fight that will not win you a vote i hope you will find your guests this evening agreeable companions beauchamp half shrugged involuntarily he obliterated the piece of treason toward them by saying that he hoped so as though the meeting them instead of slipping on to mount laurels with her were an enjoyable prospect he was dropped by the esperanzas boat near otley ferry to walk along the beach to bevisham and he kept eye on the elegant vessel as she glided swan like to her moorings off mount laurels park through dusky merchant craft colliers and trawlers loosely shaking her towering snow white sails unchallenged in her scornful supremacy an image of a refinement of beauty and of a beautiful servicelessness as the yacht so the mistress things of wealth owing their graces to wealth devoting them to wealthsplendid achievements of art both and dedicated to the gratification of the superior senses say that they were precious examples of an accomplished civilization and perhaps they did offer a visible ideal of grace for the rough world to aim at they might in the abstract address a bit of a monition to the uncultivated and encourage the soul to strive toward perfection in beauty and there is no contesting the value of beauty when the soul is taken into account but were they not in too great a profusion in proportion to their utility that was the question for nevil beauchamp the democratic spirit inhabiting him temporarily or permanently asked whether they were not increasing to numbers which were oppressive and further whether it was good for the country the race ay the species that they should be so distinctly removed from the thousands who fought the grand and the grisly old battle with nature for bread of life those grimy sails of the colliers and fishing smacks set them in a great sea would have beauty for eyes and soul beyond that of elegance and refinement and do but look on them thoughtfully the poor are everlastingly unrelievedly in the abysses of the great sea one cannot pursue to conclusions a line of meditation that is half built on the sensations as well as on the mind did beauchamp at all desire to have those idly lovely adornments of riches the yacht and the lady swept away oh dear no he admired them he was at home with them they were much to his taste standing on a point of the beach for a last look at them before he set his face to the town he prolonged the look in a manner to indicate that the place where business called him was not in comparison at all so pleasing and just as little enjoyable were his meditations opposed to predilections beauty plucked the heart from his breast but he had taken up arms he had drunk of the questioning cup that which denieth peace to us and which projects us upon the missionary search of the how the wherefore and the why not ever afterward he questioned his justification and yours for gratifying tastes in an ill regulated world of wrong doing suffering sin and bounties unrighteously dispensednot sufficiently dispersed he said by and by to pleasure battle to day from his point of observation and with the store of ideas and images his fiery yet reflective youth had gathered he presented himself as it were saddled to that hard riding force known as the logical impetus which spying its quarry over precipices across oceans and deserts and through systems and webs and into shops and cabinets of costliest china will come at it will not be refused let the distances and the breakages be what they may he went like the meteoric man with the mechanical legs in the song too quick for a cry of protestation and reached results amazing to his instincts his tastes and his training not less rapidly and naturally than tremendous ergo is shot forth from the clash of a syllogism chapter xvi a partial display of beauchamp in his colours beauchamp presented himself at mount laurels next day and formally asked colonel halkett for his vote in the presence of cecilia she took it for a playful glance at his new profession of politician he spoke half playfully was it possible to speak in earnest im of the opposite party said the colonel as conclusive a reply as could be but he at once fell upon the rotten navy of a liberal government how could a true sailor think of joining those liberals the question referred to the country not to a section of it beauchamp protested with impending emphasis tories and liberals were much the same in regard to the care of the navy nevil exclaimed cecilia he cited beneficial liberal bills recently passed which she accepted for a concession of the navy to the tories and she smiled in spite of her dislike of politics she had only to listen a few minutes to be drawn into the contest and thus it is that one hot politician makes many among women and men of a people that have the genius of strife or else in this case the young lady did unconsciously feel a deep interest in refuting and overcoming nevil beauchamp colonel halkett denied the benefits of those bills look said he at the scarecrow plight of the army under a liberal government this laid him open to the charge that he was for backing administrations instead of principles i do said the colonel i would rather have a good administration than all your talk of principles ones a fact but principles principles he languished for a phrase to describe the hazy things i have mine and you have yours its like a dispute between religions theres no settling it except by main force thats what principles lead you to principles may be hazy but heavy artillery is disposable in defence of them and beauchamp fired some reverberating guns for the eternal against the transitory with less of the gentlemanly fine taste the light and easy social semi irony than cecilia liked and would have expected from him however as to principles no doubt nevil was right and cecilia drew her father to another position are not we tories to have principles as well as the liberals nevil they may have what they call principles he admitted intent on pursuing his advantage over the colonel who said to shorten the controversy its a question of my vote and my liking i like a tory government and i dont like the liberals i like gentlemen i dont like a party that attacks everything and beats up the mob for power and repays it with sops and is dragging us down from all we were proud of but the country is growing the country wants expansion said beauchamp and if your gentlemen by birth are not up to the mark you must have leaders that are leaders who cut down expenditure to create a panic that doubles the outlay i know them a panic nevil cecilia threw stress on the memorable word he would hear no reminder in it the internal condition of the country was now the point for seriously minded englishmen my dear boy what have you seen of the country colonel halkett inquired every time i have landed colonel i have gone to the mining and the manufacturing districts the centres of industry wherever there was dissatisfaction i have attended meetings to see and hear for myself i have read the papers the papers well theyre the mirror of the country does one see everything in a mirror nevil said cecilia even in the smoothest he retorted softly i should be glad to see what you see and felled her with a blush for an example of the mirror offered by the press colonel halkett touched on mr timothy turbots article in eulogy of the great commander beauchamp did you like it he asked ah but if you meddle with politics you must submit to be held up on the prongs of a fork my boy soaped by your backers and shaved by the foe and theres a figure for a gentleman as your uncle romfrey says cecilia did not join this discussion though she had heard from her father that something grotesque had been written of nevil her foolishness in blushing vexed body and mind she was incensed by a silly compliment that struck at her feminine nature when her intellect stood in arms yet more hurt was she by the reflection that a too lively sensibility might have conjured up the idea of the compliment and again she wondered at herself for not resenting so rare a presumption as it implied and not disdaining so outworn a form of flattery she wondered at herself too for thinking of resentment and disdain in relation to the familiar commonplaces of licenced impertinence over all which hung a darkened image of her spirit of independence like a moon in eclipse where lay his weakness evidently in the belief that he had thought profoundly but what minor item of insufficiency or feebleness was discernible she discovered that he could be easily fretted by similes and metaphors they set him staggering and groping like an ancient knight of faery in a forest bewitched your specific for the country is then radicalism she said after listening to an attack on the tories for their want of a policy and indifference to the union of classes i would prescribe a course of it cecilia yes he turned to her the dr dulcamara of a single drug now you have a name for me tory arguments always come to epithets it should not be objectionable is it not honest to pretend to have only one cure for mortal maladies there can hardly be two panaceas can there be so you call me quack no nevil no she breathed a rich contralto note of denial but if the country is the patient and you will have it swallow your prescription theres nothing like a metaphor for an evasion said nevil blinking over it she drew him another analogy longer than was at all necessary so tedious that her father struck through it with the remark concerning that quackthats one in the background though i know of none said beauchamp well advised enough to forbear mention of the name of shrapnel cecilia petitioned that her stumbling ignorance which sought the road of wisdom might be heard out she had a reserve entanglement for her argumentative friend you were saying nevil that you were for principles rather than for individuals and you instanced mr cougham the senior liberal candidate of bevisham as one whom you would prefer to see in parliament instead of seymour austin though you confess to mr austins far superior merits as a politician and servant of his country but mr cougham supports liberalism while mr austin is a tory you are for the principle i am said he bowing she asked is not that equivalent to the doctrine of election by grace beauchamp interjected grace election cecilia was tender to his inability to follow her allusion thou art a liberalthen rise to membership she said accept my creed and thou art of the chosen yes nevil you cannot escape from it papa he preaches calvinism in politics we stick to men and good men the colonel flourished old english for me you might as well say old timber vessels when irons afloat colonel i suspect you have the worst of it there papa said cecilia taken by the unexpectedness and smartness of the comparison coming from wits that she had been undervaluing i shall not own im worsted until i surrender my vote the colonel rejoined i wont despair of it said beauchamp colonel halkett bade him come for it as often as he liked youll be beaten in bevisham i warn you tory reckonings are safest its an admitted fact and we know you cant win according to my judgement a man owes a duty to his class a man owes a duty to his class as long as he sees his class doing its duty to the country said beauchamp and he added rather prettily in contrast with the sententious commencement cecilia thought that the apathy of his class was proved when such as he deemed it an obligation on them to come forward and do what little they could the deduction of the proof was not clearly consequent but a meaning was expressed and in that form it brought him nearer to her abstract idea of nevil beauchamp than when he raged and was precise after his departure she talked of him with her father to be charitably satirical over him it seemed the critic in her ear had pounced on his repetition of certain words that betrayed a dialectical stiffness and hinted a narrow vocabulary his use of emphasis rather reminding her of his uncle everard was in a young man a little distressing the apathy of the country papa the apathy of the rich a state of universal apathy will you inform me papa what the tories are doing do we really give our consciences to the keeping of the parsons once a week and let them dogmatize for us to save us from exertion we must attach ourselves to principles nothing is permanent but principles poor nevil and still i am sure you have as i have the feeling that one must respect him i am quite convinced that he supposes he is doing his best to serve his country by trying for parliament fancying himself a radical i forgot to ask him whether he had visited his great aunt mrs beauchamp they say the dear old lady has influence with him i dont think hes been anywhere colonel halkett half laughed at the quaint fellow i wish the other great nephew of hers were in england for us to run him against nevil beauchamp hes touring the world im told hes orthodox and a tough debater we have to take what we can get my best wishes for your success and you and i will not talk of politics any more papa i hope nevil will come often for his own good he will meet his own set of people here and if he should dogmatize so much as to rouse our apathy to denounce his principles we will remember that we are british and can be sweet blooded in opposition perhaps he may change even tra le tre ore a le quattro electioneering should be a lesson from my recollection of blackburn tuckham he was a boisterous boy he writes uncommonly clever letters home to his aunt beauchamp she has handed them to me to read said the colonel i do like to see tolerably solid young fellows they give one some hope of the stability of the country they are not so interesting to study and not half so amusing said cecilia colonel halkett muttered his objections to the sort of amusement furnished by firebrands firebrand is too strong a word for poor nevil she remonstrated in that estimate of the character of nevil beauchamp cecilia soon had to confess that she had been deceived though not by him chapter xvii his friend and foe looking from her window very early on a sunday morning miss halkett saw beauchamp strolling across the grass of the park she dressed hurriedly and went out to greet him smiling and thanking him for his friendliness in coming he said he was delighted and appeared so but dashed the sweetness you know i cant canvass on sundays i suppose not she replied have you walked up from bevisham you must be tired nothing tires me said he with that they stepped on together mount laurels a fair broad house backed by a wood of beeches and firs lay open to view on the higher grassed knoll of a series of descending turfy mounds dotted with gorseclumps and faced south westerly along the run of the otley river to the gleaming broad water and its opposite border of forest beyond which the downs of the island threw long interlapping curves great ships passed on the line of the water to and fro and a little mist of masts of the fishing and coasting craft by otley village near the rivers mouth was like a web in air cecilia led him to her dusky wood of firs where she had raised a bower for a place of poetical contemplation and reading when the clear lapping salt river beneath her was at high tide she could hail the esperanza from that cover she could step from her drawing room window over the flower beds down the gravel walk to the hard and be on board her yacht within seven minutes out on her salt water lake within twenty closing her wings in a french harbour by nightfall of a summers day whenever she had the whim to fly abroad of these enviable privileges she boasted with some happy pride its the finest yachting station in england said beauchamp she expressed herself very glad that he should like it so much unfortunately she added i hope you will find it pleasanter to be here than canvassing i have no pleasure in canvassing said he i canvass poor men accustomed to be paid for their votes and who get nothing from me but what the baron would call a parsonical exhortation im in the thick of the most spiritless crew in the kingdom our southern men will not compare with the men of the north but still even among these fellows i see danger for the country if our commerce were to fail if distress came on them theres always danger in disunion thats what the rich wont see they see simply nothing out of their own circle and they wont take a thought of the overpowering contrast between their luxury and the way of living thats half starving of the poor they understand it when fever comes up from back alleys and cottages and then they join their efforts to sweep the poor out of the district the poor are to get to their work anyhow after a long mornings walk over the proscribed space for we must have poor you know the wife of a parson i canvassed yesterday said to me who is to work for us if you do away with the poor captain beauchamp cecilia quitted her bower and traversed the wood silently so you would blow up my poor mount laurels for a peace offering to the lower classes i should hope to put it on a stronger foundation cecilia by means of some convulsion by forestalling one that must be one of the new ironclads observed cecilia gazing at the black smoke pennon of a tower that slipped along the water line yes you were saying put us on a stronger its i think the hastings she broke down the other day on her trial trip said beauchamp watching the ships progress animatedly peppel commands hera capital officer i suppose we must have these costly big floating barracks i dont like to hear of everything being done for the defensive the defensive is perilous policy in war its true the english dont wake up to their work under half a year but no defending and looking to defences is bad for the fighting power and theres half a million gone on that ship half a million do you know how many poor taxpayers it takes to make up that sum cecilia a great many she slurred over them but we must have big ships and the best that are to be had powerful fast rams sea worthy and fit for running over shallows carrying one big gun swarms of harryers and worriers known to be kept ready for immediate service readiness for the offensive in case of wartheres the best defence against a declaration of war by a foreign state i like to hear you nevil said cecilia beaming papa thinks we have a miserable armyin numbers he says the wealthier we become the more difficult it is to recruit able bodied men on the volunteering system yet the wealthier we are the more an army is wanted both to defend our wealth and to preserve order i fancy he half inclines to compulsory enlistment do speak to him on that subject cecilia must have been innocent of a design to awaken the fire flash in nevils eyes she had no design but hostility was latent and hence perhaps the offending phrase he nodded and spoke coolly an army to preserve order so then an army to threaten civil war to crush revolutionists agitators you mean my dear good old coloneli have always loved himmust not have more troops at his command do you object to the drilling of the whole of the people does not the colonel cecilia i am sure he does in his heart and for different reasons i do he wont trust the working classes nor i the middle does dr shrapnel hate the middle class dr shrapnel cannot hate he and i are of opinion that as the middle class are the party in power they would not if they knew the use of arms move an inch farther in reform for they would no longer be in fear of the class below them but what horrible notions of your country have you nevil it is dreadful to hear oh do let us avoid politics for ever fear all concessions to the people have been won from fear i have not heard so i will read it to you in the history of england you paint us in a condition of revolution happily its not a condition unnatural to us the danger would be in not letting it be progressive and theres a little danger too at times in our slowness we change our blood or we perish dr shrapnel yes i have heard dr shrapnel say that and by the way ceciliawill you can youtake me for the witness to his character he is the most guileless of men and hes the most unguarded my good rosamund saw him she is easily prejudiced when she is a trifle jealous and you may hear from her that he rambles talks wildly it may seem so i maintain there is wisdom in him when conventional minds would think him at his wildest believe me he is the humanest the best of men tenderhearted as a child the most benevolent simple minded admirable old manthe man i am proudest to think of as an englishman and a man living in my time of all men existing i cant overpraise him he has a bad reputation only with the class that will not meet him and answer him must we invite him to our houses it would be difficult to get him to come if you did i mean meet him in debate and answer his arguments try the question by brains before mobs not before mobs i punish you by answering you seriously i am sensible of the flattery before mobs nevil ejaculated its the tories that mob together and cry down every man who appears to them to threaten their privileges can you guess what dr shrapnel compares them to indeed nevil i have not an idea i only wish your patriotism were large enough to embrace them he compares them to geese claiming possession of the whole common and hissing at every foot of ground they have to yield theyre always having to retire and always hissing retreat and menace thats the motto for them very well nevil i am a goose upon a common so saying cecilia swam forward like a swan on water to give the morning kiss to her papa by the open window of the breakfast room never did bird of michaelmas fling off water from her feathers more thoroughly than this fair young lady the false title she pretended to assume i hear youre of the dinner party at grancey lespels on wednesday the colonel said to beauchamp youll have to stand fire they will papa murmured cecilia will mr austin be there i particularly wish to meet mr austin said beauchamp listen to him if you do meet him she replied his look was rather grave lespels a whig he said the colonel answered lespel was a whig once a tory always a torybut court the people and youre on quicksands and thats where the whigs are what he is now i dont think he knows himself you wont get a vote cecilia watched her friend nevil recovering from his short fit of gloom he dismissed politics at breakfast and grew companionable with the charm of his earlier day he was willing to accompany her to church too you will hear a long sermon she warned him forty minutes colonel halkett smothered a yawn that was both retro and prospective it has been fifty papa it has been an hour my dear it was good discipline nevertheless the colonel affirmed and cecilia praised the rev mr brisk of urplesdon vicarage as one of our few remaining protestant clergymen then he ought to be supported said beauchamp in the dissensions of religious bodies it is wise to pat the weaker party on the backi quote stukely culbrett ive heard him sighed the colonel he calls the protestant clergy the social police of the english middle class those are the things he lets fly i have heard that man say that the church stands to show the passion of the human race for the drama he said it in my presence and theres a man who calls himself a tory you have rather too much of that playing at grudges and dislikes at steynham with squibs nicknames and jests at things thatwell that our stability is bound up in i hate squibs and i said beauchamp some shadow of a frown crossed him but stukely culbretts humour seemed to be a refuge protestant parsonnot clergy he corrected the colonel cant you hear mr culbrett cecilia the protestant parson is the policeman set to watch over the respectability of the middle class he has sharp eyes for the sins of the poor as for the rich they support his church they listen to his sermonto set an example discipline colonel you discipline the tradesman whos afraid of losing your custom and the labourer who might be deprived of his bread but the people its put down to the wickedness of human nature that the parson has not got hold of the people the parsons have lost them by senseless conservatism because they look to the tories for the support of their church and let the religion run down the gutters and how many thousands have you at work in the pulpit every sunday im told the dissenting ministers have some vitality colonel halkett shrugged with disgust at the mention of dissenters and those thirty or forty thousand colonel call the men that do the work they ought to be doing demagogues the parsonry are a power absolutely to be counted for waste as to progress cecilia perceived that her father was beginning to be fretted she said with a tact that effected its object i am one who hear mr culbrett without admiring his wit no and i see no good in this kind of steynham talk colonel halkett said rising were none of us perfect heaven save us from political parsons beauchamp was heard to utter humanity the colonel left the room with cecilia muttering the steynham tail to that word tomtity for the solace of an aside repartee she was on her way to dress for church he drew her into the library and there threw open a vast placard lying on the table it was printed in blue characters and red this is what i got by the post this morning i suppose nevil knows about it he wants tickling but i dont like this kind of thing its not fair war its as bad as using explosive bullets in my old game can he expect his adversaries to be tender with him cecilia simulated vehemence in an underbreath she glanced down the page french marquees caught her eye it was a page of verse and oh could it have issued from a tory committee the liberals are as bad and worse her father said she became more and more distressed it seems so very mean papa so base ungenerous is no word for it and how vulgar now i remember nevil said he wished to see mr austin seymour austin would not sanction it no but nevil might hold him responsible for it i suspect mr stukely culbrett whom he quotes and that smoking room lot at lespels i distinctly discountenance it so i shall tell them on wednesday night can you keep a secret and after all nevil beauchamp is very young papaof course i can keep a secret the colonel exacted no word of honour feeling quite sure of her he whispered the secret in six words and her cheeks glowed vermilion but they will meet on wednesday after this she said and her sight went dancing down the column of verse of which the following trotting couplet is a specimen o did you ever hot in love a little british middy see like orpheus asking what the deuce to do without eurydice the middy is jilted by his french marquees whom he did adore and in his wrath he recommends himself to the wealthy widow bevisham concerning whose choice of her suitors there is a doubt but the middy is encouraged to persevere up up my pretty middy take a draught of foaming sillery go in and win the uriddy with your radical artillery and if sillery will not do he is advised he being for superlatives to try the sparkling silliery of the radical vintage selected grapes this was but impudent nonsense but the reiterated apostrophe to my french marquees was considered by cecilia to be a brutal offence she was shocked that her party should have been guilty of it nevil certainly provoked and he required hard blows and his uncle everard might be right in telling her father that they were the best means of teaching him to come to his understanding still a foul and stupid squib did appear to her a debasing weapon to use i cannot congratulate you on your choice of a second candidate papa she said scornfully i dont much congratulate myself said the colonel heres a letter from mrs beauchamp informing me that her boy blackburn will be home in a month there would have been plenty of time for him however we must make up our minds to it those twoll be meeting on wednesday so keep your secret it will be out tomorrow week but nevil will be accusing mr austin austin wont be at lespels and he must bear it for the sake of peace is nevil ruined with his uncle papa not a bit i should imagine its romfreys fun and this disgraceful squib is a part of the fun that i know nothing about my dear im sorry but theres pitch and tar in politics as well as on shipboard i do not see that there should be said cecilia resolutely we cant hope to have what should be why not i would have it i would do my utmost to have it she flamed out your utmost her father was glancing at her foregone mimicry of beauchamps occasional strokes of emphasis do your utmost to have your bonnet on in time for us to walk to church i cant bear driving there cecilia went to her room with the curious reflection awakened by what her father had chanced to suggest to her mind that she likewise could be fervid positive uncompromisingwho knows radicalish perhaps when she looked eye to eye on an evil for a moment or so she espied within herself a gulf of possibilities wherein black night birds known as queries roused by shot of light do flap their wingsher utmost to have be what should be and why not but the intemperate feeling subsided while she was doing duty before her mirror and the visionary gulf closed immediately she had merely been very angry on nevil beauchamps behalf and had dimly seen that a woman can feel insurgent almost revolutionary for a personal cause tory though her instinct of safety and love of smoothness make her no reflection upon this casual piece of self or sex revelation troubled her head she did however think of her position as the friend of nevil in utter antagonism to him it beset her with contradictions that blew rough on her cherished serenity for she was of the order of ladies who by virtue of their pride and spirit their port and their beauty decree unto themselves the rank of princesses among women before our world has tried their claim to it she had lived hitherto in upper air high above the clouds of earth her ideal of a man was of one similarly disengaged and loftyloftier nevil she could honestly say was not her ideal he was only her old friend and she was opposed to him in his present adventure the striking at him to cure him of his mental errors and excesses was an obligation she could descend upon him calmly with the chastening rod pointing to the better way but the shielding of him was a different thing it dragged her down so low that in her condemnation of the tory squib she found herself asking herself whether haply nevil had flung off the yoke of the french lady with the foolish excuse for the question that if he had not he must be bitterly sensitive to the slightest public allusion to her had he and if not how desperately faithful he was or else how marvellously seductive she perhaps it was a lovers despair that had precipitated him into the mire of politics she conceived the impression that it must be so and throughout the day she had an inexplicable unsweet pleasure in inciting him to argumentation and combating him though she was compelled to admit that he had been colloquially charming antecedent to her naughty provocation and though she was indebted to him for his patient decorum under the weary wave of the reverend mr brisk now what does it matter what a woman thinks in politics but he deemed it of great moment politically he deemed that women have souls a certain fire of life for exercise on earth he appealed to reason in them he would not hear of convictions he quoted the bevisham doctor convictions are generally first impressions that are sealed with later prejudices and insisted there was wisdom in it nothing tired him as he had said and addressing woman or man no prospect of fatigue or of hopeless effort daunted him in the endeavour to correct an error of judgement in politicshis notion of an error the value he put upon speaking urging his views was really fanatical it appeared that he canvassed the borough from early morning till near midnight and nothing would persuade him that his chance was poor nothing that an entrenched tory like her father was not to be won even by an assault of all the reserve forces of radical pathos prognostication and statistics only conceive nevil beauchamp knocking at doors late at night the sturdy beggar of a vote or waylaying workmen as he confessed without shame that he had done on their way trooping to their midday meal penetrating malodoriferous rooms of dismal ten pound cottagers to exhort bedraggled mothers and babes and besotted husbands and exposed to rebuffs from impertinent tradesmen and lampooned and travestied shouting speeches to roaring men pushed from shoulder to shoulder of the mob cecilia dropped a curtain on her minds picture of him but the blinding curtain rekindled the thought that the line he had taken could not but be the desperation of a lover abandoned she feared it was she feared it was not nevil beauchamps foe persisted in fearing that it was not his friend feared that it was yet why for if it was then he could not be quite in earnest and might be cured nay but earnestness works out its own cure more surely than frenzy and it should be preferable to think him sound of heart sincere though mistaken cecilia could not decide upon what she dared wish for his healths good friend and foe were not further separable within her bosom than one tick from another of a clock they changed places and next his friend was fearing what his foe had feared they were inextricable why had he not sprung up on a radiant aquiline ambition whither one might have followed him with eyes and prayers for him if it was not possible to do so companionably at present in the shape of a canvassing candidate it was hardly honourable to let imagination dwell on him save compassionately when he rose to take his leave cecilia said must you go to itchincope on wednesday nevil colonel halkett added i dont think i would go to lespels if i were you i rather suspect seymour austin will be coming on wednesday and thatll detain me here and you might join us and lend him an ear for an evening i have particular reasons for going to lespels i hear he wavers toward a tory conspiracy of some sort said beauchamp the colonel held his tongue the untiring young candidate chose to walk down to bevisham at eleven oclock at night that he might be the readier to continue his canvass of the borough on monday morning early he was offered a bed or a conveyance and he declined both the dog cart he declined out of consideration for horse and groom which an owner of stables could not but approve colonel halkett broke into exclamations of pity for so good a young fellow so misguided the night was moonless and cecilia looking through the window said whimsically he has gone out into the darkness and is no light in it certainly none shone she however carried a lamp that revealed him footing on with a wonderful air of confidence and she was rather surprised to hear her father regret that nevil beauchamp should be losing his good looks already owing to that miserable business of his in bevisham she would have thought the contrary that he was looking as well as ever he dresses just as he used to dress she observed the individual style of a naval officer of breeding in which you see neatness trifling with disorder or disorder plucking at neatness like the breeze a trim vessel had been caught to perfection by nevil beauchamp according to cecilia it presented him to her mind in a cheerful and a very undemocratic aspect but in realizing it the thought like something flashing black crossed herhow attractive such a style must be to a frenchwoman he may look a little worn she acquiesced chapter xviii concerning the act of canvassing tories dread the restlessness of radicals and radicals are in awe of the organization of tories beauchamp thought anxiously of the high degree of confidence existing in the tory camp whose chief could afford to keep aloof while he slaved all day and half the night to thump ideas into heads like a cooper on a caskan impassioned cooper on an empty cask if such an image is presentable even so enviously sometimes the writer and the barrister men dependent on their active wits regard the man with a business fixed in an office managed by clerks that man seems by comparison celestially seated but he has his fits of trepidation for new tastes prevail and new habits are formed and the structure of his business will not allow him to adapt himself to them in a minute the secure and comfortable have to pay in occasional panics for the serenity they enjoy mr seymour austin candidly avowed to colonel halkett on his arrival at mount laurels that he was advised to take up his quarters in the neighbourhood of bevisham by a recent report of his committee describing the young radicals canvass as redoubtable cougham he did not fear he could make a sort of calculation of the votes for the liberal thumping on the old drum of reform but the number for him who appealed to feelings and quickened the romantic sentiments of the common people now huddled within our electoral penfold was not calculable tory and radical have an eye for one another which overlooks the liberal at all times except when he is as they imagine playing the game of either of them now we shall see the passions worked mr austin said deploring the extension of the franchise he asked whether beauchamp spoke well cecilia left it to her father to reply but the colonel appealed to her saying inclined to dragoon one isnt he she did not think that he speaks he speaks well in conversation i fancy he would be liked by the poor i should doubt his being a good public speaker he certainly has command of his temper that is one thing i cannot say whether it favours oratory he is indefatigable one may be sure he will not faint by the way he quite believes in himself but mr austin do you really regard him as a serious rival mr austin could not tell no one could tell the effect of an extended franchise the untried venture of it depressed him men have come suddenly on a borough before now and carried it he said not a borough like bevisham he shook his head a fluid borough im afraid colonel halkettt interposed but ferbrass is quite sure of his district cecilia wished to know who the man was of the mediaevally sounding name ferbrass is an old lawyer my dear he comes of five generations of lawyers and hes as old in the county as grancey lespel hitherto he has always been to be counted on for marching his district to the poll like a regiment thats our strengththe professions especially lawyers are not a great many lawyers liberals papa a great many barristers are my dear thereat the colonel and mr austin smiled together it was a new idea to cecilia that nevil beauchamp should be considered by a man of the world anything but a well meaning moderately ridiculous young candidate and the fact that one so experienced as seymour austin deemed him an adversary to be grappled with in earnest created a small revolution in her mind entirely altering her view of the probable pliability of his radicalism under pressure of time and circumstances many of his remarks that she had previously half smiled at came across her memory hard as metal she began to feel some terror of him and said to reassure herself captain beauchamp is not likely to be a champion with a very large following he is too much of a political mystic i think many young men are before they have written out a fair copy of their meaning said mr austin cecilia laughed to herself at the vision of the fiery nevil engaged in writing out a fair copy of his meaning how many erasures what foot notes the arrangement was for cecilia to proceed to itchincope alone for a couple of days and bring a party to mount laurels through bevisham by the yacht on thursday to meet mr seymour austin and mr everard romfrey an early day of the next week had been agreed on for the unmasking of the second tory candidate she promised that in case nevil beauchamp should have the hardihood to enter the enemys nest at itchincope on wednesday at the great dinner and ball there she would do her best to bring him back to mount laurels that he might meet his uncle everard who was expected there at least he may consent to come for an evening she said nothing will take him from that canvassing it seems to me it must be not merely distasteful mr austin replied its disagreeable but its the practice i would gladly be bound by a common undertaking to abstain captain beauchamp argues that it would be all to your advantage he says that a personal visit is the only chance for an unknown candidate to make the people acquainted with him its a very good opportunity for making him acquainted with them and i hope he may profit by it ah pah to beg the vote and wink the bribe colonel halkett subjoined abhorrently it well becomes the whiggish tribe to beg the vote and wink the bribe canvassing means intimidation or corruption or the mixture of the two called cajolery said mr austin and that was the principal art of the whigs thus did these gentlemen converse upon canvassing it is not possible to gather up in one volume of sound the rattle of the knocks at englishmens castle gates during election days so with the thunder of it unheard the majesty of the act of canvassing can be but barely appreciable and he therefore who would celebrate it must follow the candidate obsequiously from door to door where like a cross between a postman delivering a bill and a beggar craving an alms patiently he attempts the extraction of the vote as little boys pick periwinkles with a pin this is your duty which i most abjectly entreat you to do is pretty nearly the form of the supplication how if instead of the solicitation of the thousands by the unit the meritorious unit were besought by rushing thousandsas a mound of the plains that is circumvented by floods and to which the waters cry be thou our island let it be answered the questioner with no discourteous adjectives thou fool to come to such heights of popular discrimination and political ardour the people would have to be vivified to a pitch little short of eruptive it would be boreas blowing aetna inside them and we should have impulse at work in the country and immense importance attaching to a mans whether he will or he wontenough to womanize him we should be all but having parliament for a sample of our choicest rather than our likest and see you not a peril in that conceive for the fleeting instants permitted to such insufferable flights of fancy our picked men ruling so despotic an oligarchy as would be there is not a happy subject of contemplation it is not too much to say that a domination of the intellect in england would at once and entirely alter the face of the country we should be governed by the head with a vengeance all the rest of the country being base members indeed spartanshelots criticism now so helpful to us would wither to the root fun would die out of parliament and outside of it we could never laugh at our masters or command them and that good old fashioned shouldering of separate interests which if it stops progress like a block in the pit entrance to a theatre proves us equal before the law puts an end to the pretence of higher merit in the one or the other and renders a stout build the safest assurance for coming through ultimately would be transformed to a painful orderliness like a city procession under the conduct of the police and to classifications of things according to their public value decidedly no benefit to burly freedom none if there were no shouldering and hustling could tell whether actually the fittest survived as is now the case among survivors delighting in a broad chested fitness and consider the freezing isolation of a body of our quintessential elect seeing below them none to resemble them do you not hear in imagination the lands regrets for that amiable nobility whose pretensions were comically built on birth acres tailoring style and an air ah that these unchallengeable new lords could be exchanged for those old ones these with the traditions of how great people should look in our country these would pass among us like bergs of icea pure polar aristocracy inflicting the woes of wintriness upon us keep them from concentrating at present i believe it to be their honest opinion their wise opinion and the sole opinion common to a majority of them that it is more salutary besides more diverting to have the fools of the kingdom represented than not as professors of the sarcastic art they can easily take the dignity out of the fools representative at their pleasure showing him at antics while he supposes he is exhibiting an honourable and a decent series of movements generally too their archery can check him when he is for any of his measures and if it does not check there appears to be such a property in simple sneering that it consoles even when it fails to right the balance of power sarcasm we well know confers a title of aristocracy straightway and sharp on the sconce of the man who does but imagine that he is using it what then must be the elevation of these princes of the intellect in their own minds hardly worth bartering for worldly commanderships it is evident briefly then we have a system not planned but grown the outcome and image of our genius and all are dissatisfied with parts of it but as each would preserve his own the surest guarantee is obtained for the integrity of the whole by a happy adjustment of the energies of opposition whichyou have only to look to seegoes far beyond concord in the promotion of harmony this is our english system like our english pudding a fortuitous concourse of all the sweets in the grocers shop but an excellent thing for all that and let none threaten it canvassing appears to be mixed up in the system at least i hope i have shown that it will not do to reverse the process for fear of changes leading to a sovereignty of the austere and antipathetic intellect in our england that would be an inaccessible tyranny of a very small minority necessarily followed by tremendous convulsions chapter xix lord palmet and certain electors of bevisham meantime the candidates raised knockers rang bells bowed expounded their views praised their virtues begged for votes and greatly and strangely did the youngest of them enlarge his knowledge of his countrymen but he had an insatiable appetite and except in relation to mr cougham considerable tolerance with cougham he was like a young hound in the leash they had to run as twins but beauchamps conjunct would not run he would walk he imposed his experience on beauchamp with an assumption that it must necessarily be taken for the law of beauchamps reason in electoral and in political affairs and this was hard on beauchamp who had faith in his reason beauchamps early canvassing brought cougham down to bevisham earlier than usual in the days when he and seymour austin divided the borough and he inclined to administer correction to the radically disposed youngster yes i have gone all over that he said in speech sometimes in manner perpetually upon the intrusion of an idea by his junior cougham also cougham had passed through his radical phase as one does on the road to wisdom so the frog telleth tadpoles he too has wriggled most preposterous of tails and he has shoved a circular flat head into corners unadapted to its shape and that the undeveloped one should dutifully listen to experience and accept guidance is devoutly to be hoped alas beauchamp would not be taught that though they were yoked they stood at the opposite ends of the process of evolution the oddly coupled pair deplored among their respective friends the disastrous siamese twinship created by a haphazard improvident liberal camp look at us they saidbeauchamp is a young demagogue cougham is chrysalis tory such liberals are the ruin of liberalism but of such must it be composed when there is no new cry to loosen floods it was too late to think of an operation to divide them they held the heart of the cause between them were bound fast together and had to go on beauchamp with a furious tug of radicalism spoken or performed pulled cougham on his beam ends cougham to right himself defined his liberalism sharply from the politics of the pit pointed to france and her revolutions washed his hands of excesses and entirely overset beauchamp seeing that he stood in the liberal interest the junior could not abandon the liberal flag so he seized it and bore it ahead of the time there where radicals trip their phantom dances like shadows on a fog and waved it as the very flag of our perfectible race so great was the impetus that cougham had no choice but to step out with him brisklyvoluntarily as a man propelled by a hand on his coat collar a word saved him the word practical are we practical he inquired and shivered beauchamps galloping frame with a violent application of the stop abrupt for that question are we practical penetrates the bosom of an english audience and will surely elicit a response if not plaudits practical or not the good people affectingly wish to be thought practical it has been asked by them if were not practical what are webeauchamp talking to cougham apart would argue that the daring and the far sighted course was often the most practical cougham extended a deprecating hand yes i have gone over all that occasionally he was maddening the melancholy position of the senior and junior liberals was known abroad and matter of derision it happened that the gay and good humoured young lord palmet heir to the earldom of elsea walking up the high street of bevisham met beauchamp on tuesday morning as he sallied out of his hotel to canvass lord palmet was one of the numerous half friends of cecil baskelett and it may be a revelation of his character to you that he owned to liking beauchamp because of his having always been a favourite with the women he began chattering with beauchamps hand in his ive hit on you have i my dear fellow miss halkett was talking of you last night i slept at mount laurels went on purpose to have a peep im bound for itchincope theyve some grand procession in view there lespel wrote for my team i suspect hes for starting some new october races he talks of half a dozen drags he must have lots of women there i say what a splendid creature cissy halkett has shot up she topped the season this year and will next youre for the darkies beauchamp so am i when i dont see a blonde just as a fellow admires a girl when theres no married woman or widow in sight and i say it cant be true youve gone in for that crazy radicalism theres nothing to be gained by it you know the women hate it a married blonde of five and twentys the venus of them all mind you i dont forget that mrs wardour devereux is a thorough paced brunette but upon my honour id bet on cissy halkett at forty a dark eye in woman if you like but blue and auburn drive it into a corner lord palmet concluded by asking beauchamp what he was doing and whither going beauchamp proposed to him maliciously as one of our hereditary legislators to come and see something of canvassing lord palmet had no objection capital opportunity for a review of their women he remarked i map the places for pretty women in england some parts of norfolk and a spot or two in cumberland and wales and the island over there i know thoroughly those jutes have turned out some splendid fair women devonshires worth a tour my man davis is in charge of my team and he drives to itchincope from washwater station i am independent ill have an hour with you do you think much of the women here beauchamp had not noticed them palmet observed that he should not have noticed anything else but you are qualifying for the upper house beauchamp said in the tone of an encomium palmet accepted the statement though i shall never care to figure before peeresses he said i cant tell you why theres a heavy sprinkling of the old bird among them it isnt that theres too much plumage i think it must be that a cloud of millinery shoots me off a mile from a woman in my opinion witches are the only ones for wearing jewels without chilling the feminine atmosphere about them fellows think differently lord palmet waved a hand expressive of purely amiable tolerance for this question upon the most important topic of human affairs was deep and no judgement should be hasty in settling it im peculiar he resumed a rose and a string of pearls a woman who goes beyond thats in danger of petrifying herself and her fellow man two women in paris last winter set us on fire with pale thin gold ornamentsneck wrists ears ruche skirts all in a flutter and so were you but you felt witchcraft the magical orient vivian ducie called the blonde and the dark beauty young endor her name said beauchamp a marquise i forget her name the other was countess rastaglione you must have heard of her a towering witch an empress helen of troy though ducie would have it the brunette was queen of paris for french taste if you like countess rastaglione was a lady enamelled on the scroll of fame did you see them together said beauchamp they werent together palmet looked at him and laughed youre yourself again are you go to paris in january and cut out the frenchmen answer me palmet they werent in couples i fancy not it was luck to meet them so they couldnt have been did you dance with either of them unable to state accurately that he had palmet cried oh for dancing the frenchwoman beat the italian did you see her oftenmore than once my dear fellow i went everywhere to see her balls theatres promenades rides churches and you say she dressed up to the italian to challenge her rival her only one night simple accident everybody noticed it for they stood for night and dayboth hung with gold the brunette etruscan and the blonde asiatic and every frenchman present was epigramizing up and down the rooms like mad her husbands legitimist he wouldnt be at the tuileries beauchamp spoke half to himself what then what palmet stared and chuckled her husband must have taken the tuileries bait if we mean the same woman my dear old beauchamp have i seen her then shes a darling the rastaglione was nothing to her when you do light on a grand smoky pearl the milky ones may go and decorate plaster thats what i say of the loveliest brunettes it must be the same there cant be a couple of dark beauties in paris without a noise about them marquise i shall recollect her name presently heres one of the houses i stop at said beauchamp and drop that subject a scared servant girl brought out her wizened mistress to confront the candidate and to this representative of the sex he addressed his arts of persuasion requesting her to repeat his words to her husband the contrast between beauchamp palpably canvassing and the beauchamp who was the lover of the marquise of the forgotten name struck too powerfully on palmet for his gravity he retreated beauchamp found him sauntering on the pavement and would have dismissed him but for an agreeable diversion that occurred at that moment a suavely smiling unctuous old gentleman advanced to them bowing and presuming thus far he said under the supposition that he was accosting the junior liberal candidate for the borough he announced his name and his principles tomlinson progressive liberal a true distinction from some liberals i know said beauchamp mr tomlinson hoped so never he said did he leave it to the man of his choice at an election to knock at his door for the vote beauchamp looked as if he had swallowed a cordial votes falling into his lap are heavenly gifts to the candidate sick of the knocker and the bell mr tomlinson eulogized the manly candour of the junior liberal candidates address in which he professed to see ideas that distinguished it from the address of the sound but otherwise conventional liberal mr cougham he muttered of plumping for beauchamp dont plump beauchamp said and a candidate if he would be an honourable twin must say it cougham had cautioned him against the heresy of plumping they discoursed of the poor and their beverages of pothouses of the anti liquorites and of the duties of parsons and the value of a robust and right minded body of the poor to the country palmet found himself following them into a tolerably spacious house that he took to be the old gentlemans until some of the apparatus of an institute for literary and scientific instruction revealed itself to him and he heard mr tomlinson exalt the memory of one wingham for the blessing bequeathed by him to the town of bevisham for said mr tomlinson it is open to both sexes to all respectable classes from ten in the morning up to ten at night such a place affords us i would venture to say the advantages without the seductions of a club i rank it nextat a far remove but nextthe church lord palmet brought his eyes down from the busts of certain worthies ranged along the top of the book shelves to the cushioned chairs and murmured capital place for an appointment with a woman mr tomlinson gazed up at him mildly with a fallen countenance he turned sadly agape in silence to the busts the books and the range of scientific instruments and directed a gaze under his eyebrows at beauchamp does your friend canvass with you he inquired i want him to taste it beauchamp replied and immediately introduced the affable young lorda proceeding marked by some of the dexterity he had once been famous for as was shown by a subsequent observation of mr tomlinsons yes he said on the question of classes yes i fear we have classes in this country whose habitual levity sharp experience will have to correct i very much fear it but if you have classes that are not to face realities classes that look on them from the box seats of a theatre said beauchamp how can you expect perfect seriousness or any good service whatever gently sir gently no we can i feel confident expand within the limits of our most excellent and approved constitution i could wish that socially that is all socially and politically mean one thing in the end said beauchamp if you have a nation politically corrupt you wont have a good state of morals in it and the laws that keep society together bear upon the politics of a country true yes mr tomlinson hesitated assent he dissociated beauchamp from lord palmet but felt keenly that the latters presence desecrated winghams institute and he informed the candidate that he thought he would no longer detain him from his labours just the sort of place wanted in every provincial town palmet remarked by way of a parting compliment mr tomlinson bowed a civil acknowledgement of his having again spoken no further mention was made of the miraculous vote which had risen responsive to the candidates address of its own inspired motion so beauchamp said i beg you to bear in mind that i request you not to plump you may be right captain beauchamp good day sir palmet strode after beauchamp into the street why did you set me bowing to that old boy he asked why did you talk about women was the rejoinder oh aha palmet sang to himself youre a romfrey beauchamp a blow for a blow but i only said what would strike every fellow first off it is the place the very place pastry cooks shops wont stand comparison with it dont tell me youre the man not to see how much a woman prefers to be under the wing of science and literature in a good sized well warmed room with a book instead of making believe with a red face over a tart he received a smart lecture from beauchamp and began to think he had enough of canvassing but he was not suffered to escape for his instruction for his positive and extreme good beauchamp determined that the heir to an earldom should have a days lesson we will hope there was no intention to punish him for having frozen the genial current of mr tomlinsons vote and interest and it may be that he clung to one who had as he imagined seen rene accompanied by a mr oggler a tradesman of the town on the liberal committee dressed in a pea jacket and proudly nautical they applied for the vote and found it oftener than beauty palmet contrasted his repeated disappointments with the scoring of two three four and more in the candidates list and informed him that he would certainly get the election i think youre sure of it he said theres not a pretty woman to be seen not one one came up to them the sight of whom counselled lord palmet to reconsider his verdict she was addressed by beauchamp as miss denham and soon passed on palmet was guilty of staring at her and of lingering behind the others for a last look at her they were on the steps of a voters house calmly enduring a rebuff from him in person when palmet returned to them exclaiming effusively what luck you have beauchamp he stopped till the applicants descended the steps with the voice of the voter ringing contempt as well as refusal in their ears then continued you introduced me neck and heels to that undertakerly old tomlinson of winghams institute you might have given me a chance with that missmiss denham was it she has a bit of a style she has a head said beauchamp a girl like that may have what she likes i dont care what she hastheres woman in her you might take her for a younger sister of mrs wardour devereux whos the uncle she speaks of she ought not to be allowed to walk out by herself she can take care of herself said beauchamp palmet denied it no woman can upon my honour its a shame that she should be out alone what are her people ill runfrom you you knowand see her safe home theres such an infernal lot of fellows about and a girl simply bewitching and unprotected i ought to be after her beauchamp held him firmly to the task of canvassing then will you tell me where she lives palmet stipulated he reproached beauchamp for a notorious grand turk exclusiveness and greediness in regard to women as well as a disposition to run hard races for them out of a spirit of pure rivalry its no use contradicting its universally known of you reiterated palmet i could name a dozen women and dozens of fellows you deliberately set yourself to cut out for the honour of it whats that story they tell of you in one of the american cities or watering places north or south you would dance at a ball a dozen times with a girl engaged to a manwho drenched you with a tumbler at the hotel bar and off you all marched to the sands and exchanged shots from revolvers and both of you they say saw the body of a drowned sailor in the water in the moonlight heaving nearer and nearer and you stretched your man just as the body was flung up by a wave between you picturesque if you like dramatic certainly and i ran away with the bride next morning no roared palmet you didnt theres the cruelty of the whole affair beauchamp laughed an old messmate of mine lieutenant jack wilmore can give you a different version of the story i never have fought a duel and never will here we are at the shop of a tough voter mr oggler so it says in my note book shall we put lord palmet to speak to him first if his lordship will put his heart into what he says mr oggler bowed are you for giving the people recreation on a sunday my lord trap bat and ball cricket dancing military bands puppet shows theatres merry go rounds bosky dellsanything to make them happy said palmet oh dear then im afraid we cannot ask you to speak to this mr carpendike oggler shook his head does the fellow want the people to be miserable im afraid my lord he would rather see them miserable they introduced themselves to mr carpendike in his shop he was a flat chested sallow young shoemaker with a shelving forehead who seeing three gentlemen enter to him recognized at once with a practised resignation that they had not come to order shoe leather though he would fain have shod them being needy but it was not the design of providence that they should so come as he in his blindness would have had them admitting this he wished for nothing the battle with carpendike lasted three quarters of an hour during which he was chiefly and most effectively silent carpendike would not vote for a man that proposed to open museums on the sabbath day the striking simile of the thin end of the wedge was recurred to by him for a damning illustration captain beauchamp might be honest in putting his mind on most questions in his address when there was no demand upon him to do it but honesty was no antidote to impiety thus carpendike as to sunday museuming being an antidote to the pothouseno for the people knew the frequenting of the pothouse to be a vice it was a temptation of satan that often in overcoming them was the cause of their flying back to grace whereas museums and picture galleries were insidious attractions cloaked by the name of virtue whereby they were allured to abandon worship beauchamp flew at this young monster of unreason but the people are not worshipping they are idling and sotting and if you carry your despotism farther still and shut them out of every shop on sundays do you suppose you promote the spirit of worship if you dont revolt them you unman them and i warn you we cant afford to destroy what manhood remains to us in england look at the facts he flung the facts at carpendike with the natural exaggeration of them which eloquence produces rather as a rule to assure itself in passing of the overwhelming justice of the cause it pleads than to deceive the adversary brewers beer and publicans beer wife beatings the homes and the blood of the people were matters reviewed to the confusion of sabbatarians carpendike listened with a bent head upraised eyes and brows wrinkling far on to his poll a picture of a mind entrenched beyond the potentialities of mortal assault he signified that he had spoken indeed beauchamps reply was vain to one whose argument was that he considered the people nearer to holiness in the indulging of an evil propensity than in satisfying a harmless curiosity and getting a recreation the sabbath claimed them if they were disobedient sin ultimately might scourge them back to the fold but never if they were permitted to regard themselves as innocent in their backsliding and rebelliousness such language was quite new to beauchamp the parsons he had spoken to were of one voice in objecting to the pothouse he appealed to carpendikes humanity carpendike smote him with a text from scripture devilish cold in this shop muttered palmet two not flourishing little children of the emaciated puritan burst into the shop followed by their mother carrying a child in her arms she had a sad look upon traces of a past fairness vaguely like a snow landscape in the thaw palmet stooped to toss shillings with her young ones that he might avoid the womans face it cramped his heart dont you see mr carpendike said fat mr oggler its the happiness of the people we want thats what captain beauchamp works fortheir happiness thats the aim of life for all of us look at me im as happy as the day i pray every night and i go to church every sunday and i never know what it is to be unhappy the lord has blessed me with a good digestion healthy pious children and a prosperous shop thats a competencya modest one but i make it satisfy me because i know its the lords gift well now and i hate sabbath breakers i would punish them and im against the public houses on a sunday but aboard my little yacht say on a sunday morning in the channel i dont forget i owe it to the lord that he has been good enough to put me in the way of keeping a yacht no i read prayers to my crew and a chapter in the biblegenesis deuteronomy kings acts paul just as it comes alls good thats there then were free for the day man boy and me we cook our victuals and we must look to the yacht do you see but weve made our peace with the almighty we know that he dont mind the working of the vessel so long as weve remembered him he put us in that situation exactly there latitude and longitude do you see and work the vessel we must and a glass of grog and a pipe after dinner cant be any offence and i tell you honestly and sincerely im sure my conscience is good and i really and truly dont know what it is not to know happiness then you dont know god said carpendike like a voice from a cave or nature or the state of the world said beauchamp singularly impressed to find himself between two men of whomeach perforce of his tenuity and the evident leaning of his appetitesone was for the barren black view of existence the other for the fantastically bright as to the men personally he chose carpendike for all his obstinacy and sourness ogglers genial piety made him shrink with nausea but lord palmet paid mr oggler a memorable compliment by assuring him that he was altogether of his way of thinking about happiness the frank young nobleman did not withhold a reference to the two or three things essential to his happiness otherwise mr oggler might have been pleased and flattered before quitting the shop beauchamp warned carpendike that he should come again vote or no vote youre worth the trial texts as many as you like ill make your faith active if its alive at all you speak of the lord loving his own you make out the lord to be your own and use your religion like a drug so it appears to me that sunday tyranny of yours has to be defended remember that for i for one shall combat it and expose it good day beauchamp continued in the street tyrannies like this fellows have made the english the dullest and wretchedest people in europe palmet animadverted on carpendike the dog looks like a deadly fungus that has poisoned the woman id trust him with a post of danger though said beauchamp before the candidate had opened his mouth to the next elector he was beamed on mgilliper baker a floured brick face leaned on folded arms across his counter and said in scotch my vote and he that asks me for my vote is the man who when he was midshipman saved the life of a relation of mine from death by drowning my wifes first cousin johnny brownsonand held him up four to five minutes in the water and never left him till he was out of danger theres my hand on it i will and a score of householders in bevisham the same he dictated precious names and addresses to beauchamp and was curtly thanked for his pains such treatment of a favourable voter seemed odd to palmet oh a vote given for reasons of sentiment beauchamp interjected palmet reflected and said well perhaps thats how it is women dont care uncommonly for the men who love them though they like precious well to be loved opposition does it you have discovered my likeness to women said beauchamp eyeing him critically and then thinking with a sudden warmth that he had seen rene look here palmet youre too late for itchincope to day come and eat fish and meat with me at my hotel and come to a meeting after it you can run by rail to itchincope to breakfast in the morning and i may come with you youll hear one or two men speak well to night i suppose i shall have to be at this business myself some day sighed palmet any women on the platform oh but political women and the tories get the pick of the women no i dont think ill stay yes i will ill go through with it i like to be learning something you wouldnt think it of me beauchamp but i envy fellows at work you might make a speech for me palmet no man better my dear fellow if it were proposing a toast to the poor devils and asking them to drink it but a dry speech like leading them over the desert without a well to cheer themno oasis as we used to call a five pound note and a holidayi havent the heart for that is your miss denham a radical beauchamp asserted that he had not yet met a woman at all inclining in the direction of radicalism i dont call furies radicals there may be women who think as well as feel i dont know them lots of them beauchamp take my word for it i do know women they havent a shift nor a trick i dont know theyre as clear to me as glass ill wager your miss denham goes to the meetings now doesnt she of course she does and there couldnt be a gallanter way of spending an evening so ill try it nothing to repent of next morning thats to be said for politics beauchamp and i confess im rather jealous of you a thoroughly good looking girl who takes to a fellow for what hes doing in the world must have ideas of him precious different from the adoration of six feet three and a fine seat in the saddle i see that theres baskelett in the blues and if i were he i should detest my cuirass and helmet for if hes half as successful as he boastsits the uniform two notorious radicals peter molyneux and samuel killick were called on the first saw beauchamp and refused him the second declined to see him he was amazed and staggered but said little among the remainder of the electors of bevisham roused that day to a sense of their independence by the summons of the candidates only one man made himself conspicuous by premising that he had two important questions to ask and he trusted commander beauchamp to answer them unreservedly they were first what is a french marquees and second who was eurydicey beauchamp referred him to the tory camp whence the placard alluding to those ladies had issued both of thems ladies i guessed it said the elector did you guess that one of them is a mythological lady im not far wrong in guessing tothers not much better i reckon now sir may i ask you is there any tale concerning your morals no you may not ask you take a liberty then ill take the liberty to postpone talking about my vote look here mr commander if the upper classes want anything of me and come to me for it ill know what sort of an example theyre setting now thats me you pay attention to a stupid tory squib where theres smoke theres fire sir beauchamp glanced at his note book for the name of this man who was a ragman and dustman my private character has nothing whatever to do with my politics he said and had barely said it when he remembered having spoken somewhat differently upon the abstract consideration of the case to mr tomlinson youre quite welcome to examine my character for yourself only i dont consent to be catechized understand that you quite understand that mr tripehallow said oggler bolder in taking up the strange name than beauchamp had been i understand that but you understand theres never been a word against the morals of mr cougham heres the point do we mean to be a moral country very well then so let our representatives be i say and if i hear nothing against your morals mr commander i dont say you shant have my vote i mean to deliberate you young nobs capering over our headsi nail you down to morals politics secondary adew as the dying spirit remarked to weeping friends au revoirwould have been kinder said palmet mr tripehallow smiled roguishly to betoken comprehension beauchamp asked mr oggler whether that fellow was to be taken for a humourist or a five pound note man it may be both sir i know hes called morality joseph an all but acknowledged five pound note man was the last they visited he cut short the preliminaries of the interview by saying that he was a four oclock man ie the man who waited for the final bids to him upon the closing hour of the election day not one farthing said beauchamp having been warned beforehand of the signification of the phrase by his canvassing lieutenant then youre nowhere the honest fellow replied in the mystic tongue of prophecy palmet and beauchamp went to their fish and meat smoked a cigarette or two afterward conjured away the smell of tobacco from their persons as well as they could and betook themselves to the assembly room of the liberal party where the young lord had an opportunity of beholding mr cougham and of listening to him for an hour and forty minutes he heard mr timothy turbot likewise and miss denham was present lord palmet applauded when she smiled when she looked attentive he was deeply studious her expression of fatigue under the sonorous ring of statistics poured out from cougham was translated by palmet into yawns and sighs of a profoundly fraternal sympathy her face quickened on the rising of beauchamp to speak she kept eye on him all the while as palmet with the skill of an adept in disguising his petty larceny of the optics did on her twice or thrice she looked pained beauchamp was hesitating for the word once she looked startled and shut her eyes a hiss had sounded beauchamp sprang on it as if enlivened by hostility and dominated the factious note thereat she turned to a gentleman sitting beside her apparently they agreed that some incident had occurred characteristic of nevil beauchamp for whom however it was not a brilliant evening he was very well able to account for it and did so after he had walked a few steps with miss denham on her homeward way you heard cougham palmet hes my senior and im obliged to come second to him and how am i to have a chance when he has drenched the audience for close upon a couple of hours palmet mimicked the manner of cougham they cry for turbot naturally they want a relief beauchamp groaned palmet gave an imitation of timothy turbot he was an admirable mimic perfectly spontaneous without stressing any points and beauchamp was provoked to laugh his discontentment with the evening out of recollection but a grave matter troubled palmets head who was that fellow who walked off with miss denham a married man said beauchamp badly married mores the pity he has a wife in the madhouse his name is lydiard not her brother wheres her uncle she wont let him come to these meetings its her idea well intended but wrong i think shes afraid that dr shrapnel will alarm the moderate liberals and damage radical me palmet muttered between his teeth what queer things they let their women do he felt compelled to say odd for her to be walking home at night with a fellow like that it chimed too consonantly with a feeling of beauchamps to repress which he replied your ideas about women are simply barbarous palmet why shouldnt she her uncle places his confidence in the man and in her isnt that betterten times more likely to call out the sense of honour and loyalty than the distrust and the scandal going on in your class please to say yours too ive no class i say that the education for women is to teach them to rely on themselves ah well i dont object if im the man because you and your set are absolutely uncivilized in your views of women common sense beauchamp prey you eye them as prey and it comes of an idle aristocracy you have no faith in them and they repay you for your suspicion all the same beauchamp she ought not to be allowed to go about at night with that fellow rich and rare were the gems she wore but that was in erins isle and if we knew the whole history shed better have stopped at home shes marvellously pretty to my mind she looks a high bred wench odd it is beauchamp to see a ladys maid now and then catch the style of my lady no by jove ive known one or twoyou couldnt tell the difference not till you were intimate i know one would walk a minuet with a duchess of courseall the worse for her if you see that uncle of miss denhamsupon my honour i should advise him i mean counsel him not to trust her with any fellow but you beauchamp asked lord palmet how old he was palmet gave his age correcting the figures from six and twenty to one year more and never did a stroke of work in my life he said speaking genially out of an acute guess at the sentiments of the man he walked with it seemed a farcical state of things there was a kind of contrition in palmets voice and to put him at his ease as well as to stamp something in his own mind beauchamp said its common enough chapter xx a day at itchincope an election in bevisham was always an exciting period at itchincope the large and influential old estate of the lespels which at one time with but a ceremonious drive through the town sent you two good whig men to parliament to sit at reform banquets two unswerving party men blest subscribers to the right review and personally proud of its trenchancy mr grancey lespel was the survivor of them and well could he remember the happier day of his grandfather his father and his own hot youth he could be carried so far by affectionate regrets as to think of the tories of that day benignlywhen his champion review of the orange and blue livery waved a wondrous sharp knife and stuck and bled them proving to his party by trenchancy alone that the whig was the cause of providence then politics presented you a table whereat two parties feasted with no fear of the intrusion of a third and your backs were turned on the noisy lower world your ears were deaf to it apply we now the knocker to the door of venerable quotation and call the aged creature forth that he half choked by his eheu a sound between a sigh and bray may pronounce the familiar but respectable words the burial service of a time so happy mr grancey lespel would still have been sitting for bevisham or politely at this elective moment bowing to resume the seat had not those manchester jugglers caught up his cry appropriated his colours displaced and impersonated him acting beneficent whig on a scale approaching treason to the constitution leaning on the people in earnest instead of taking the popular shoulder for a temporary lift all in high party policy for the clever manuvre to oust the tory and sway the realm see the consequences for power for no other consideration those manufacturing rascals have raised radicalism from its primaeval mirefrom its petty backslum booksellers shop and public house back parlour effluvia of oratoryto issue dictates in england and we england formerly the oak are topsy turvy like onions our heels in the air the language of party is eloquent and famous for being grand at illustration but it is equally well known that much of it gives us humble ideas of the speaker probably because of the naughty temper party is prone to which while endowing it with vehemence lessens the stout circumferential view that should be taken at least historically indeed though we admit party to be the soundest method for conducting us party talk soon expends its attractiveness as would a summers afternoon given up to the contemplation of an encounter of rams heads let us be quit of mr grancey lespels lamentations the whig gentleman had some reason to complain he had been trained to expect no other attack than that of his hereditary adversary ram in front and a sham ramno honest animal but a ramming engine ratherhad attacked him in the rear like mr everard romfrey and other whigs he was profoundly chagrined by popular ingratitude not the same man his wife said of him it nipped him early he took to proverbs sure sign of the sere leaf in a mans mind his wife reproached the people for their behaviour to him bitterly the lady regarded politics as a business that helped hunting men a stage above sportsmen for numbers of the politicians she was acquainted with were hunting men yet something more by virtue of the variety they could introduce into a conversation ordinarily treating of sport and the qualities of wines her husband seemed to have lost in that parliamentary seat the talisman which gave him notions distinguishing him from country squires he had sunk and he no longer cared for the months in london nor for the speeches she read to him to re awaken his mind and make him look out of himself as he had done when he was a younger man and not a suspended whig her own favourite reading was of love adventures written in the french tongue she had once been in love and could be so sympathetic with that passion as to avow to cecilia halkett a tenderness for nevil beauchamp on account of his relations with the marquise de rouaillout and notwithstanding the demoniacal flame halo of the radical encircling him the allusion to beauchamp occurred a few hours after cecilias arrival at itchincope cecilia begged for the french ladys name to be repeated she had not heard it before and she tasted the strange bitter relish of realization when it struck her ear to confirm a story that she believed indeed but had not quite sensibly felt and it is not over yet they say mrs grancey lespel added while softly flipping some spots of the colour proper to radicals in morals on the fame of the french lady she possessed fully the grave judicial spirit of her countrywomen and could sit in judgement on the personages of tales which had entranced her to condemn the heroines it was impolitic in her sex to pity females as for the menpoor weak things as for nevil beauchamp in particular his case this penetrating lady said was clear he ought to be married could you make a sacrifice she asked cecilia playfully nevil beauchamp and i are old friends but we have agreed that we are deadly political enemies miss halkett replied it is not so bad for a beginning said mrs lespel if one were disposed to martyrdom the older woman nodded without that my dear mrs lespel wait till you have heard him he is at war with everything we venerate and build on the wife you would give him should be a creature rooted in nothingin sea water simply two or three conversations with him have made me uncomfortable ever since i can see nothing durable i dream of surprises outbreaks dreadful events at least it is perfectly true that i do not look with the same eyes on my country he seems to delight in destroying ones peaceful contemplation of life the truth is that he blows a perpetual gale and is all agitation cecilia concluded affecting with a smile a slight shiver yes one tires of that said mrs lespel i was determined i would have him here if we could get him to come grancey objected we shall have to manage captain beauchamp and the rest as well he is sure to come late to morrow and will leave early on thursday morning for his canvass our driving into bevisham is for friday or saturday i do not see that he need have any suspicions those verses you are so angry about cannot be traced to itchincope my dear they are a childish trifle when my husband stood first for bevisham the whole of his university life appeared in print what we have to do is to forewarn the gentlemen to be guarded and especially in what they say to my nephew lord palmet for that boy cannot keep a secret he is as open as a plate the smoking room at night cecilia suggested remembering her fathers words about itchincopes tobacco hall they have captain beauchamps address hung up there i have heard said mrs lespel there may be other thingsanother address though it is not yet placarded come with me for fifteen years i have never once put my head into that room and now ive a superstitious fear about it mrs lespel led the way to the deserted smoking room where the stale reek of tobacco assailed the ladies as does that dire place of customs the stranger visiting savage or too natural potentates in silence they tore down from the wall beauchamps electoral addressflanked all its length with satirical pen and pencil comments and sketches and they consigned to flames the vast sheet of animated verses relating to the french marquees a quarter size chalk drawing of a slippered pantaloon having a duck on his shoulder labelled to say quack quack and offering our nauseated dame britannia or else it was the widow bevisham a globe of a pill to swallow crossed with the consolatory and reassuring name of shrapnel they disposed of likewise and then they fled chased forth either by the brilliancy of the politically allusive epigrams profusely inscribed around them on the walls or by the atmosphere mrs lespel gave her orders for the walls to be scraped and said to cecilia a strange air to breathe was it not the less men and women know of one another the happier for them i knew my superstition was correct as a guide to me i do so much wish to respect men and all my experience tells me the turks know best how to preserve it for us two men in this house would give their wives for pipes if it came to the choice we might all go for a cellar of old wine after forty men have married their habits and wives are only an item in the list and not the most important with the assistance of mr stukely culbrett mrs lespel prepared the house and those of the company who were in the secret of affairs for the arrival of beauchamp the ladies were curious to see him the gentlemen not anticipating extreme amusement were calm for it is an axiom in the world of buckskins and billiard cues that one man is very like another and so true is it with them that they can in time teach it to the fair sex friends of cecil baskelett predominated and the absence of so sprightly a fellow was regretted seriously but he was shooting with his uncle at holdesbury and they did not expect him before thursday on wednesday morning lord palmet presented himself at a remarkably well attended breakfast table at itchincope he passed from mrs lespel to mrs wardour devsreux and miss halkett bowed to other ladies shook hands with two or three men and nodded over the heads of half a dozen accounting rather mysteriously for his delay in coming it was thought until he sat down before a plate of yorkshire pie and said the fact is ive been canvassing hard with beauchamp astonishment and laughter surrounded him and palmet looked from face to face equally astonished and desirous to laugh too ernest how could you do that said mrs lespel and her husband cried in stupefaction with beauchamp oh its because of the radicalism palmet murmured to himself i didnt mind that what sort of a day did you have mr culbrett asked him and several gentlemen fell upon him for an account of the day palmet grimaced over a mouthful of his pie bad quoth mr lespel i knew it i know bevisham the only chance there is for five thousand pounds in a sack with a hole in it bad for beauchamp dear me no palmet corrected the error he is carrying all before him and he tells them palmet mimicked beauchamp they shall not have one penny not a farthing i gave a couple of young ones a shilling apiece and he rowed me for bribery somehow i did wrong lord palmet described the various unearthly characters he had inspected in their dens carpendike tripehallow and the radicals peter molyneux and samuel killick and the ex member for the borough cougham posing to suit sign boards of liberal inns with a hand thrust in his waistcoat and his head well up the eyes running over the under lids after the traditional style of our aristocracy but perhaps more closely resembling an urchin on tiptoe peering above park palings coughams remark to beauchamp heard and repeated by palmet with the object of giving an example of the senior liberals phraseology i was necessitated to vacate my town mansion to my material discomfort and that of my wife whose equipage i have been compelled to take by your premature canvass of the borough captain beauchamp and now i hear on undeniable authority that no second opponent to us will be forthcomingthis produced the greatest effect on the company but do you tell me said mr lespel when the shouts of the gentlemen were subsiding do you tell me that young beauchamp is going ahead that he is they flock to him in the street he stands there then and jingles a money bag palmet resumed his mimicry of beauchamp not a stiver purity of election is the first condition of instruction to the people principles then theyve got a capital orator turbot an irishman i went to a meeting last night and heard him never heard anything finer in my life you may laugh he whipped me off my legs fellow spun me like a top and while he was orationing a donkey calls turbot aint you a flat fish and he swings round not for a fools hook and out they hustled the villain for a tory i never saw anything like it that repartee wouldnt have done with a dutchman or a torbay trawler said stukely culbrett but let us hear more is it fair miss halkett murmured anxiously to mrs lespel who returned a flitting shrug charming women follow beauchamp you know palmet proceeded as he conceived to confirm and heighten the tale of success theres a miss denham niece of a doctor a dr shotshrapnel a wonderfully good looking clever looking girl comes across him in half a dozen streets to ask how hes getting on and goes every night to his meetings with a man whos a writer and has a mad wife a man named lydiano thats a womanlydiard its rather a jumble but you should see her when beauchamps on his legs and speaking mr lydiard is in bevisham mrs wardour devereux remarked i know the girl growled mr lespel she comes with that rascally doctor and a bobtail of tea drinking men and women and their brats to northeden heathmy ground there they stand and sing hymns inquired mr culbrett i dont know what they sing and when it rains they take the liberty to step over my bank into my plantation some day i shall have them stepping into my house yes its mr lydiard im sure of the mans name palmet replied to mrs wardour devereux we met him in spain the year before last she observed to cecilia the we reminded palmet that her husband was present ah devereux i didnt see you he nodded obliquely down the table by the way whats the grand procession i hear my man davis has come all right and i caught sight of the top of your coach box in the stableyard as i came in what are we up to baskelett writes its to be for to morrow morning at tenthe start mr wardour devereux addressed the table generally he was a fair huge bush bearded man with a voice of unvarying bass a squire in his county and energetic in his pursuit of the pleasures of hunting driving travelling and tobacco old basks the captain of us very well but where do we drive the teams how many are we whats in hand cecilia threw a hurried glance at her hostess luckily some witling said fours in hand and so dryly that it passed for humour and gave mrs lespel time to interpose you are not to know till to morrow ernest palmet had traced the authorship of the sally to mr algy borolick and crowned him with praise for it he asked why not know till to morrow a word in a murmur from mr culbrett dont frighten the women satisfied him though why it should he could not have imagined mrs lespel quitted the breakfast table before the setting in of the dangerous five minutes of conversation over its ruins and spoke to her husband who contested the necessity for secresy but yielded to her judgement when it was backed by stukely culbrett soon after lord palmet found himself encountered by evasions and witticisms in spite of the absence of the ladies upon every attempt he made to get some light regarding the destination of the four in hands next day what are you going to do he said to mr devereux thinking him the likeliest one to grow confidential in private smoke resounded from the depths of that gentleman palmet recollected the ground of division between the beautiful brunette and her lordhis addiction to the pipe in perpetuity and deemed it sweeter to be with the lady she and miss halkett were walking in the garden miss halkett said to him how wrong of you to betray the secrets of your friend is he really making way beauchamp will head the poll to a certainty palmet replied still said miss halkett you should not forget that you are not in the house of a liberal did you canvass in the town or the suburbs everywhere i assure you miss halkett theres a feeling for beauchamptheyre in love with him he promises them everything i suppose not he and the odd thing is it isnt the radicals he catches he wont go against the game laws for them and he wont cut down army and navy so the radicals yell at him one confessed he had sold his vote for five pounds last election you shall have it for the same says he for youre all humbugs beauchamp took him by the throat and shook himmetaphorically you know but as for the tradesmen hes their hero bakers especially mr austin may be right then cecilia reflected aloud she went to mrs lespel to repeat what she had extracted from palmet after warning the latter not in common loyalty to converse about his canvass with beauchamp did you speak of mr lydiard as captain beauchamps friend mrs devereux inquired of him lydiard why he was the man who made off with that pretty miss denham said palmet i have the greatest trouble to remember them all but it was not a day wasted now i know politics shall we ride or walk you will let me have the happiness im so unlucky i rarely meet you you will bring captain beauchamp to me the moment he comes ill bring him bring him nevil beauchamp wont want bringing mrs devereux smiled with some pleasure grancey lespel followed at some distance by mr ferbrass the tory lawyer stepped quickly up to palmet and asked whether beauchamp had seen dollikins the brewer palmet could recollect the name of one tomlinson and also the calling at a brewery moreover beauchamp had uttered contempt of the brewers business and of the social rule to accept rich brewers for gentlemen the mans name might be dollikins and not tomlinson and if so it was dollikins who would not see beauchamp to preserve his political importance palmet said dollikins to be sure that was the man treats him as he does you mr lespel turned to ferbrass ive sent to dollikins to come to me this morning if hes not driving into the town ill have him before beauchamp sees him ive asked half a dozen of these country gentlemen tradesmen to lunch at my table to day then sir observed ferbrass if they are men to be persuaded they had better not see me true theyre my old supporters and mightnt like your tory face mr lespel assented mr ferbrass congratulated him on the heartiness of his espousal of the tory cause mr lespel winced a little and told him not to put his trust in that turned tory said palmet mr lespel declined to answer palmet said to mrs devereux he thinks im not worth speaking to upon politics now ill give him some beauchamp i learned lots yesterday then let it be in captain beauchamps manner said she softly palmet obeyed her commands with the liveliest exhibition of his peculiar faculty cecilia rejoining them seemed to hear nevil himself in his emphatic political mood because the whigs are defunct they had no root in the people whig is the name of a tribe that was you have tory liberal and radical there is no place for whig he is played out who has been putting that nonsense into your head mr lespel retorted go shooting go shooting shots were heard in the woods palmet pricked up his ears but he was taken out riding to act cavalier to mrs devereux and miss halkett cecilia corrected his enthusiasm with the situation no flatteries to day there are hours when women feel their insignificance and helplessness i begin to fear for mr austin and i find i can do nothing to aid him my hands are tied and yet i know i could win voters if only it were permissible for me to go and speak to them win them cried palmet imagining the alacrity of mens votes to be won by her he recommended a gallop for the chasing away of melancholy and as they were on the bevisham high road which was bordered by strips of turf and heath a few good stretches brought them on the fir heights commanding views of the town and broad water no i cannot enjoy it cecilia said to mrs devereux i dont mind the grey light cloud and water and halftones of colour are homely english and pleasant and that opal where the sun should be has a suggestiveness richer than sunlight im quite northern enough to understand it but with me it must be either peace or strife and that election down there destroys my chance of peace i never could mix reverie with excitement the battle must be over first and the dead buried can you mrs devereux answered excitement i am not sure that i know what it is an election does not excite me theres nevil beauchamp himself palmet sang out and the ladies discerned beauchamp under a fir tree down by the road not alone a man increasing in length like a telescope gradually reaching its end for observation and coming to the height of a landmark as if raised by ropes was rising from the ground beside him shall we trot on miss halkett cecilia said no now i see a third fellow said palmet its the other fellow the denham shrapnel radical meeting lydiards his name writes books we may as well ride on mrs devereux remarked and her horse fretted singularly beauchamp perceived them and lifted his hat palmet made demonstrations for the ladies still neither party moved nearer after some waiting cecilia proposed to turn back mrs devereux looked into her eyes ill take the lead she said and started forward pursued by palmet cecilia followed at a sullen canter before they came up to beauchamp the long shanked man had stalked away townward lydiard held beauchamp by the hand some last words after the manner of instructions passed between them and then lydiard also turned away i say beauchamp mrs devereux wants to hear who that man is palmet said drawing up that man is dr shrapnel said beauchamp convinced that cecilia had checked her horse at the sight of the doctor dr shrapnel palmet informed mrs devereux she looked at him to seek his wits and returning beauchamps admiring salutation with a little bow and smile said i fancied it was a gentleman we met in spain he writes books observed palmet to jog a slow intelligence pamphlets you mean i think he is not a pamphleteer mrs devereux said mr lydiard then of course how silly i am how can you pardon me beauchamp was contrite he could not explain that a long guess he had made at miss halketts reluctance to come up to him when dr shrapnel was with him had preoccupied his mind he sent off palmet the bearer of a pretext for bringing lydiard back and then said to cecilia you recognized dr shrapnel i thought it might be dr shrapnel she was candid enough to reply i could not well recognize him not knowing him here comes mr lydiard and let me assure you if i may take the liberty of introducing him he is no true radical he is a philosopherone of the flirts the butterflies of politics as dr shrapnel calls them beauchamp hummed over some improvized trifles to lydiard then introduced him cursorily and all walked in the direction of itchincope it was really the mr lydiard mrs devereux had met in spain so they were left in the rear to discuss their travels much conversation did not go on in front cecilia was very reserved by and by she said i am glad you have come into the country early to day he spoke rapturously of the fresh air and not too mildly of his pleasure in meeting her quite off her guard she began to hope he was getting to be one of them again until she heard him tell lord palmet that he had come early out of bevisham for the walk with dr shrapnel and to call on certain rich tradesmen living near itchincope he mentioned the name of dollikins dollikins palmet consulted a perturbed recollection among the entangled list of new names he had gathered recently from the study of politics dollikins rang in his head he shouted yes dollikins to be sure lespel has him to lunch to daycalls him a gentleman tradesman odd fish and told a fellow calledwhere is it nowa name like brass or copper copperstone brasspot told him hed do well to keep his tory cheek out of sight its the names of those fellows bother one so all the rests easy you are evidently in a state of confusion lord palmet said cecilia the tone of rebuke and admonishment was unperceived not about the facts he rejoined im for fair play all round no trickery i tell beauchamp all i know just as i told you this morning miss halkett what i dont like is lespel turning tory cecilia put a stop to his indiscretions by halting for mrs devereux and saying to beauchamp if your friend would return to bevisham by rail this is the nearest point to the station palmet best natured of men though generally prompted by some of his peculiar motives dismounted from his horse leaving him to beauchamp that he might conduct mr lydiard to the station and perhaps hear a word of miss denham at any rate be able to form a guess as to the secret of that art of his which had in the space of an hour restored a happy and luminous vivacity to the languid mrs wardour devereux chapter xxi the question as to the examination of the whigs and the fine blow struck by mr everard romfrey itchincope was famous for its hospitality yet beauchamp when in the presence of his hostess could see that he was both unexpected and unwelcome mrs lespel was unable to conceal it she looked meaningly at cecilia talked of the house being very full and her husband engaged till late in the afternoon and captain baskelett had arrived on a sudden she said and the luncheon table in the dining room could not possibly hold more we three will sit in the library anywhere said cecilia so they sat and lunched in the library where mrs devereux served unconsciously for an excellent ally to cecilia in chatting to beauchamp principally of the writings of mr lydiard had the blinds of the windows been drawn down and candles lighted beauchamp would have been well contented to remain with these two ladies and forget the outer world sweeter society could not have been offered him but glancing carelessly on to the lawn he exclaimed in some wonderment that the man he particularly wished to see was there it must be dollikins the brewer ive had him pointed out to me in bevisham and i never can light on him at his brewery no excuse for detaining the impetuous candidate struck cecilia she betook herself to mrs lespel to give and receive counsel in the emergency while beauchamp struck across the lawn to mr dollikins who had the squire of itchincope on the other side of him late in the afternoon a report reached the ladies of a furious contest going on over dollikins mr algy borolick was the first to give them intelligence of it and he declared that beauchamp had wrested dollikins from grancey lespel this was contradicted subsequently by mr stukely culbrett but theres heavy pulling between them he said it will do all the good in the world to grancey said mrs lespel she sat in her little blue room with gentlemen congregating at the open window presently grancey lespel rounded a projection of the house where the drawing room stood out the maddest folly ever talked he delivered himself in wrath the whigs dead you may as well say im dead it was beauchamp answering politically youre dead if you call yourself a whig you couldnt be a live one for the partys in pieces blown to the winds the country was once a chess board for whig and tory but that games at an end theres no doubt on earth that the whigs are dead but if theres no doubt about it how is it i have a doubt about it you know youre a tory you tried to get that man dollikins from me in the tory interest i mean to keep him out of radical clutches now thats the truth they came up to the group by the open window still conversing hotly indifferent to listeners you wont keep him from me i have him said beauchamp you delude yourself i have his promise his pledged word said grancey lespel the man himself told you his opinion of renegade whigs renegade renegade whig is an actionable phrase mr culbrett observed he was unnoticed if you dont like renegade take dead said beauchamp dead whig resurgent in the tory you are dead its the stupid conceit of your party thinks that dead my dear mr lespel ill say for the whigs they would not be seen touting for tories if they were not ghosts of whigs you are dead there is no doubt of it but grancey lespel repeated if theres no doubt about it how is it i have a doubt about it the whigs preached finality in reform it was their own funeral sermon nonsensical talk i dont dispute your liberty of action to go over to the tories but you have no right to attempt to take an honest liberal with you and that ive stopped aha beauchamp the mans mine come youll own he swore he wouldnt vote for a shrapnelite dont you rememberthats how the tories used to fight you they stuck an epithet to you and hooted to set the mob an example you hit them off to the life said beauchamp brightening with the fine ire of strife and affecting a sadder indignation you traded on the ignorance of a man prejudiced by lying reports of one of the noblest of human creatures shrapnel there ive had enough grancey lespel bounced away with both hands outspread on the level of his ears dead beauchamp sent the ghastly accusation after him grancey faced round and said bo which was applauded for a smart retort and let none of us be so exalted above the wit of daily life as to sneer at it mrs lespel remarked to mr culbrett do you not see how much he is refreshed by the interest he takes in this election he is ten years younger beauchamp bent to her saying mock dolefully im sorry to tell you that if ever he was a sincere whig he has years of remorse before him promise me captain beauchamp she answered promise you will give us no more politics to day if none provoke me none shall and as to bevisham said mr culbrett its the identical borough for a radical candidate for every voter there demands a division of his property and he should be the last to complain of an adoption of his principles clever rejoined beauchamp but i am under government and he swept a bow to mrs lespel as they were breaking up the group captain baskelett appeared ah nevil said he passed him saluted miss halkett through the window then cordially squeezed his cousins hand having a holiday out of bevisham the baron expects to meet you at mount laurels to morrow he particularly wishes me to ask you whether you think all is fair in war i dont said nevil not the canvass goes on swimmingly ask palmet palmet gives you two thirds of the borough the poor old tory tortoise is nowhere theyve been writing about you nevil they have and if theres a man of honour in the party i shall hold him responsible for it i allude to an article in the bevisham liberal paper a magnificent eulogy upon my honour i give you my word i have rarely read an article so eloquent and what is the conservative misdemeanour which the man of honour in the party is to pay for ill talk to you about it by and by said nevil he seemed to cecilia too trusting too simple considering his cousins undisguised tone of banter yet she could not put him on his guard she would have had mr culbrett do so she walked on the terrace with him near upon sunset and said the position captain beauchamp is in here is most unfair to him theres nothing unfair in the lions den said stukely culbrett adding now observe miss halkett he talks for effect he discovers that lespel is a torified whig but that does not make him a bit more alert its to say smart things he speaks but wont act as if he were among enemies hes getting too fond of his bow wow here he is and he knows the den and he chooses to act the innocent you see how ridiculous that trick of the ingenu or peculiarly heavenly messenger who pretends that he ought never to have any harm done to him though he carries the lighted match is the way of young radicals otherwise beauchamp would be a dear boy we shall see how he takes his thrashing you feel sure he will be beaten he has too strong a dose of fools honesty to succeedstands for the game laws with radicals for example hes loaded with scruples and crotchets and thinks more of them than of his winds and his tides no public man is to be made out of that his idea of the whigs being dead shows a head that cant read the country he means himself for mankind and is preparing to be the benefactor of a country parish but as a naval officer excellent cecilia was convinced that mr culbrett underestimated beauchamp nevertheless the confidence expressed in beauchamps defeat reassured and pleased her at midnight she was dancing with him in the midst of great matronly country vessels that raised a wind when they launched on the waltz and exacted an anxious pilotage on the part of gentlemen careful of their partners and why i cannot say but contrasts produce quaint ideas in excited spirits and a dancing politician appeared to her so absurd that at one moment she had to bite her lips not to laugh it will hardly be credited that the waltz with nevil was delightful to cecilia all the while and dancing with others a penance he danced with none other he led her to a three oclock morning supper one of those triumphant subversions of the laws and customs of earth which have the charm of a form of present deification for all young people and she while noting how the poor mans advocate dealt with costly pasties and sparkling wines was overjoyed at his hearty comrades manner with the gentlemen and a leadership in fun that he seemed to have established cecil baskelett acknowledged it and complimented him on it i give you my word nevil i never heard you in finer trim heres to our drive into bevisham to morrow do you drink it i beg i entreat oh certainly said nevil will you take a whip down there if youre all insured on my honour old nevil driving a four in hand is easier than governing the country ill accept your authority for what you know best said nevil the toast of the drive into bevisham was drunk cecilia left the supper table mortified and feeling disgraced by her participation in a secret that was being wantonly abused to humiliate nevil as she was made to think by her sensitiveness all the gentlemen were against him excepting perhaps that chattering pie lord palmet who did him more mischief than his enemies she could not sleep she walked out on the terrace with mrs wardour devereux in a dream hearing that lady breathe remarks hardly less than sentimental and an unwearied succession of shouts from the smoking room they are not going to bed to night said mrs devereux they are mystifying captain beauchamp said cecilia my husband tells me they are going to drive him into the town to morrow cecilia flushed she could scarcely get her breath is that their plot she murmured sleep was rejected by her bed itself the drive into bevisham had been fixed for nine am she wrote two lines on note paper in her room but found them overfervid and mysterious besides how were they to be conveyed to nevils chamber she walked in the passage for half an hour thinking it possible she might meet him not the most lady like of proceedings but her head was bewildered an arm chair in her room invited her to rest and thinkthe mask of a natural desire for sleep at eight in the morning she was awakened by her maid and at a touch exclaimed have they gone and her heart still throbbed after hearing that most of the gentlemen were in and about the stables cecilia was down stairs at a quarter to nine the breakfast room was empty of all but lord palmet and mr wardour devereux one selecting a cigar to light out of doors the other debating between two pipes she beckoned to palmet and commissioned him to inform beauchamp that she wished him to drive her down to bevisham in her pony carriage palmet brought back word from beauchamp that he had an appointment at ten oclock in the town i want to see him she said so palmet ran out with the order cecilia met beauchamp in the entrance hall you must not go she said bluntly i cant break an appointment said hefor the sake of my own pleasure was implied will you not listen to me nevil when i say you cannot go a coachmans trumpet blew i shall be late thats colonel millingtons team he starts first then wardour devereux then cecil and i mount beside him palmets at our heels but cant you even imagine a purpose for their driving into bevisham so pompously well men with drags havent commonly much purpose he said but on this occasion at an election time surely nevil you can guess at a reason a second trumpet blew very martially footmen came in search of captain beauchamp the alternative of breaking her pledged word to her father or of letting nevil be burlesqued in the sight of the town could no longer be dallied with cecilia said well nevil then you shall hear it hereupon captain baskeletts groom informed captain beauchamp that he was off yes nevil said to cecilia tell me on board the yacht nevil you will be driving into the town with the second tory candidate of the borough which who nevil asked your cousin cecil tell captain baskelett that i dont drive down till an hour later nevil said to the groom cecilia youre my friend i wish you were more i wish we didnt differ i shall hope to change youmake you come half way out of that citadel of yours this is my uncle everard i might have made sure thered be a blow from him and cecil of all men for a politician cecilia think of it cecil baskelett i beg seymour austins pardon for having suspected him now sounded captain baskeletts trumpet angry though he was beauchamp laughed isnt it exactly like the baron to spring a mine of this kind there was decidedly humour in the plot and it was a lusty quarterstaff blow into the bargain beauchamps head rang with it he could not conceal the stunning effect it had on him gratitude and tenderness toward cecilia for saving him at the cost of a partial breach of faith that he quite understood from the scandal of the public entry into bevisham on the tory coach box alternated with his interjections regarding his uncle everard at eleven cecilia sat in her pony carriage giving final directions to mrs devereux where to look out for the esperanza and the schooners boat then i drive down alone mrs devereux said the gentlemen were all off and every available maid with them on the coach boxes a brilliant sight that had been missed by nevil and cecilia why heres lydiard said nevil supposing that lydiard must be approaching him with tidings of the second tory candidate but lydiard knew nothing of it he was the bearer of a letter on foreign papermarked urgent in rosamunds handand similarly worded in the well known hand which had inscribed the original address of the letter to steynham beauchamp opened it and read chteau tourdestelle eure come i give you three daysno more rene the brevity was horrible did it spring from childish imperiousness or tragic peril beauchamp could imagine it to be this or that in moments of excited speculation we do not dwell on the possibility that there may be a mixture of motives i fear i must cross over to france this evening he said to cecilia she replied it is likely to be stormy to night the steamboat may not run if theres a doubt of it i shall find a french lugger you are tired from not sleeping last night no she answered and nodded to mrs devereux beside whom mr lydiard stood you will not drive down alone you see for a young lady threatened with a tempest in her heart as disturbing to her as the one gathering in the west for ships at sea miss halkett bore herself well chapter xxii the drive into bevisham beauchamp was requested by cecilia to hold the reins his fair companion in the pony carriage preferred to lean back musing and he had leisure to think over the blow dealt him by his uncle everard with so sure an aim so ringingly on the head and in the first place he made no attempt to disdain it because it was nothing but artful and heavy handed after the mediaeval pattern of old he himself had delighted in artfulness as well as boldness and the unmistakeable hit highly to prize generalship was in his blood though latterly the very forces propelling him to his political warfare had forbidden the use of it to him he saw the patient veteran laying his gun for a long shotto give as good as he had received and in realizing everard romfreys perfectly placid bearing under provocation such as he certainly would have maintained while preparing his reply to it the raw fighting humour of the plot touched the sense of justice in beauchamp enough to make him own that he had been the first to offend he could reflect also on the likelihood that other offended men of his uncles age and position would have sulked or stormed threatening the parthian shot of the vindictive testator if there was godlessness in turning to politics for a weapon to strike a domestic blow manfulness in some degree signalized it beauchamp could fancy his uncle crying out who set the example and he was not at that instant inclined to dwell on the occult virtues of the example he had set to be honest this elevation of a political puppet like cecil baskelett and the starting him out of the same family which turbot the journalist had magnified into bevisham with such pomp and flourish in opposition to the serious young champion of popular rights and the puritan style was ludicrously effective conscienceless of course but that was the way of the old school beauchamp broke the silence by thanking cecilia once more for saving him from the absurd exhibition of the radical candidate on the tory coach box and laughing at the grimmish slyness of his uncle everards conspiracy a something in it that was half smile half sneer not exactly malignant and by no means innocent something made up of the simplicity of a lighted match and its proximity to powder yet neither deadly in spite of a wicked twinkle nor at all pretending to be harmless in short a specimen of old english practical humour he laboured to express these or corresponding views of it with tolerably natural laughter and cecilia rallied her spirits at his pleasant manner of taking his blow i shall compliment the baron when i meet him tonight he said what can we compare him to she suggested the commander of the faithful the lord haroun who likewise had a turn for buffooneries to serve a purpose and could direct them loftily and sovereignty no everard romfreys a northerner from the feet up said beauchamp cecilia compliantly offered him a sketch of the scandinavian troll much nearer the mark he thought and exclaimed baron troll im afraid cecilia you have robbed him of the best part of his fun and you will owe it entirely to him if you should be represented in parliament by my cousin baskelett promise me nevil that you will when you meet captain baskelett not forget i did you some service and that i wish i shall be so glad if you do not resent certain things very objectionable we all think he released her from the embarrassing petition oh now i know my man you may be sure i wont waste a word on him the fact is he would not understand a word and would require moreand that i dont do when i fancied mr austin was the responsible person i meant to speak to him cecilia smiled gratefully the sweetness of a love speech would not have been sweeter to her than this proof of civilized chivalry in nevil they came to the fir heights overlooking bevisham here the breezy beginning of a south western autumnal gale tossed the ponies manes and made threads of cecilias shorter locks of beautiful auburn by the temples and the neck blustering the curls that streamed in a thick involution from the silken band gathering them off her uncovered clear swept ears beauchamp took an impression of her side face it seemed to offer him everything the world could offer of cultivated purity intelligent beauty and attractiveness and wilt thou said the winged minute peace a good repute in the mouths of men home and a trustworthy woman for mate an ideal english lady the rarest growth of our country and friends and fair esteem were offered last night he had waltzed with her and the manner of this tall graceful girl in submitting to the union of the measure and reserving her individual distinction had exquisitely flattered his taste giving him an auspicious image of her in partnership through the uses of life he looked ahead at the low dead blue cloud swinging from across channel what could be the riddle of renes letter it chained him completely at all events i shall not be away longer than three days he said paused eyed cecilias profile and added do we differ so much it may not be so much as we think said she but if we do then nevil there is a difference between us but if we keep our lips closed we should have to shut our eyes as well a lovely melting image of her stole over him all the warmer for her unwittingness in producing it and it awakened a tenderness toward the simple speaker cecilias delicate breeding saved her from running on figuratively she continued intellectual differences do not cause wounds except when very unintellectual sentiments are behind themmy conceit or your impatience nevil noi veggiam come quei che ha mala luce i can confess my sight to be imperfect but will you ever do so her musical voice in italian charmed his hearing what poet was that you quoted the wisest dante dr shrapnels favourite i must try to read him he reads dante cecilia threw a stress on the august name and it was manifest that she cared not for the answer contemptuous exclusiveness could not go farther he is a man of cultivation beauchamp said cursorily trying to avoid dissension but in vain i wish i were half as well instructed and the world half as charitable as heyou ask me if i shall admit my sight to be imperfect yes when you prove to me that priests and landlords are willing to do their duty by the people in preference to their churches and their property but will you ever shake off prejudice here was opposition sounding again cecilia mentally reproached dr shrapnel for it indeed nevil really must notmay i not ask you thismust not every one feel the evil spell of some associations and dante and dr shrapnel you dont know him cecilia i saw him yesterday you thought him too tall i thought of his character how angry i should be with you if you were not so beautiful i am immensely indebted to my unconscious advocate you are clad in steel you flash back you wont answer me out of the heart im convinced it is pure wilfulness that makes you oppose me i fancy you must be convinced because you cannot imagine women to have any share of public spirit nevil a grain of truth in that remark set nevil reflecting i want them to have it he remarked and glanced at a tory placard probably the puppets fresh printed address to the electors on one of the wayside fir trees bevisham looks well from here we might make a north western venice of it if we liked papa told you it would be money sunk in mud did i mention it to himthoroughly conservativeso he would leave the mud as it is they insist on our not venturing anythingthose tories exactly as though we had gained the best of human conditions instead of counting crops of rogues malefactors egoists noxious and lumbersome creatures that deaden the country your town down there is one of the ugliest and dirtiest in the kingdom it might be the fairest i have often thought that of bevisham nevil he drew a visionary sketch of quays embankments bridged islands public buildings magical emanations of patriotic architecture with a practical air an absence of that enthusiasm which struck her with suspicion when it was not applied to landscape or the arts and she accepted it and warmed and even allowed herself to appear hesitating when he returned to the similarity of the state of mud begirt bevisham and our great sluggish england was he not perhaps to be pitied in his bondage to the frenchwoman who could have no ideas in common with him the rare circumstance that she and nevil beauchamp had found a subject of agreement partially overcame the sentiment cecilia entertained for the foreign lady and having now one idea in common with him she conceived the possibility that there might be more there must be many for he loved england and she no less she clung however to the topic of bevisham preferring to dream of the many more rather than run risks undoubtedly the town was of an ignoble aspect and it was declining in prosperity and it was consequently over populated and undoubtedly so she was induced to coincide for the moment a government acting to any extent like a supervising head should aid and direct the energies of towns and ports and trades and not leave everything everywhere to chance schools for the people public morality should be the charge of government cecilia had surrendered the lead to him and was forced to subscribe to an equivalent of undoubtedly the tories just as little as the liberals had done these good offices party against party neither of them had a forethoughtful head for the land at large they waited for the press to spur a great imperial country to be but defensively armed and they accepted the so called volunteers with a nominal one months drill per annum as a guarantee of defence beauchamp startled her actually kindled her mind to an activity of wonder and regret with the statement of how much government acting with some degree of farsightedness might have won to pay the public debt and remit taxation by originally retaining the lines of railway and fastening on the valuable land adjoining stations hundreds of millions of pounds she dropped a sigh at the prodigious amount but inquired who has calculated it for though perfectly aware that this kind of conversation was a special compliment paid to her by her friend nevil and dimly perceiving that it implied something beyond a complimentin fact that it was his manner of probing her for sympathy as other men would have conducted the process preliminary to deadly flattery or to wooing her wits fenced her heart about the exercise of shrewdness was an instinct of self preservation she had nothing but her poor wits daily growing fainter to resist him with and he seemed to know it and therefore assailed them never trying at the heart that vast army of figures might be but a phantom army conjured out of the radical mists might it not she hinted and besides we cannot surely require a government to speculate in the future can we possibly not as governments go beauchamp said but what think you of a government of landowners decreeing the enclosure of millions of acres of common land amongst themselves taking the property of the people to add to their own say is not that plunder public property observe decreed to them by their own law making under the pretence that it was being reclaimed for cultivation when in reality it has been but an addition to their pleasure grounds a flat robbery of pasture from the poor mans cow and goose and his right of cutting furze for firing consider that beauchamps eyes flashed democratic in reciting this injury to the objects of his warm solicitudethe man the cow and the goose but so must he have looked when fronting englands enemies and his aspect of fervour subdued cecilia she confessed her inability to form an estimate of such conduct are they doing it still she asked we owe it to dr shrapnel foremost that there is now a watch over them to stop them but for him grancey lespel would have enclosed half of northeden heath as it is he has filched bits here and there and he will have to put back his palings however now let cecilia understand that we english calling ourselves free are under morally lawless rule government is what we require and our means of getting it must be through universal suffrage at present we have no government only shifting party ministries which are the tools of divers interests wealthy factions to the sacrifice of the commonwealth she listened like rosamund culling overborne by dr shrapnel inwardly praying that she might discover a man to reply to him a despotism nevil he hoped not declined the despot was english enough to stand against the best of men in that character but he cast it on tory whig and liberal otherwise the constitutionalists if we were to come upon the despot they see we are close on universal suffrage theyve been bidding each in turn for the people and that has brought them to it and now theyre alarmed and accuse one another of treason to the constitution and they dont accept the situation and theres a fear that to carry on their present system they will be thwarting the people or corrupting them and in that case we shall have our despot in some shape or other and we shall suffer nevil said cecilia i am out of my depth ill support you i can swim for two said he you are very self confident but i find i am not fit for battle at least not in the front ranks nerve me then will you try to comprehend once for all what the battle is i am afraid i am too indifferent i am too luxurious that reminds me you want to meet your uncle everard and if you will sleep at mount laurels to night the esperanza shall take you to france to morrow morning and can wait to bring you back as she spoke she perceived a flush mounting over nevils face soon it was communicated to hers the strange secret of the blood electrified them both and revealed the burning undercurrent running between them from the hearts of each the light that showed how near they were to one another was kindled at the barrier dividing them it remained as good as a secret unchallenged until they had separated and after midnight cecilia looked through her chamber windows at the driving moon of a hurricane scud and read clearly his honourable reluctance to be wafted over to his french love by her assistance and beauchamp on board the tossing steamboat perceived in her sympathetic reddening that she had divined him this auroral light eclipsed the other events of the day he drove into a town royally decorated and still humming with the ravishment of the tory entrance he sailed in the schooner to mount laurels in the society of captain baskelett and his friends who finding him tamer than they expected bantered him in the cheerfullest fashion he waited for his uncle everard several hours at mount laurels perused the junior torys address to the electors throughout which there was not an ideasafest of addresses to canvass upon perused likewise at captain baskeletts request a broad sheet of an article introducing the new candidate to bevisham with the battle axe romfreys to back him in high burlesque of timothy turbot upon beauchamp and cecil hoped his cousin would not object to his borrowing a romfrey or two for so pressing an occasion all very funny and no doubt the presence of mr everard romfrey would have heightened the fun from the fountain head but he happened to be delayed and beauchamp had to leave directions behind him in the town besides the discussion of a whole plan of conduct with dr shrapnel so he was under the necessity of departing without seeing his uncle really to his regret he left word to that effect taking leave of cecilia he talked of his return home within three or four days as a certainty she said canvassing should not be neglected now her hostility was confused by what she had done to save him from annoyance while his behaviour to his cousin cecil increased her respect for him she detected a pathetic meaning in his mention of the word home she mused on his having called her beautiful whither was she hurrying forgetful of her horror of his revolutionary ideas forgetful of the elevation of her own she thrilled secretly on hearing it stated by the jubilant young tories at mount laurels as a characteristic of beauchamp that he was clever in parrying political thrusts and slipping from the theme he who with her gave out unguardedly the thoughts deepest in him and the thoughtswere they not of generous origin where so true a helpmate for him as the one to whom his mind appealed it could not be so with the frenchwoman cecilia divined a generous nature by generosity and set herself to believe that in honour he had not yet dared to speak to her from the heart not being at heart quite free she was at the same time in her remains of pride cool enough to examine and rebuke the weakness she succumbed to in now clinging to him by that which yesterday she hardly less than loathed still deeply disliked chapter xxiii tourdestelle on the part of beauchamp his conversation with cecilia during the drive into bevisham opened out for the first time in his life a prospect of home he had felt the word in speaking it and it signified an end to the distractions produced by the sex allegiance to one beloved respected woman and also a basis of operations against the world for she was evidently conquerable and once matched with him would be the very woman to nerve and sustain him did she not listen to him he liked her resistance that element of the barbarous which went largely to form his emotional nature was overjoyed in wresting such a woman from the enemy and subduing her personally she was a prize she was a splendid prize cut out from under the guns of the fort he rendered all that was due to his eminently good cause for its part in so signal a success but individual satisfaction is not diminished by the thought that the individuals discernment selected the cause thus beneficent to him beauchamps meditations were diverted by the sight of the coast of france dashed in rain lines across a weed strewn sea the three days granted him by rene were over and it scarcely troubled him that he should be behind the time he detested mystery holding it to be a sign of pretentious feebleness often of imposture it might be frivolity punctilious obedience to the mysterious brevity of the summons and not to chafe at it appeared to him as much as could be expected of a struggling man this was the state of the case with him until he stood on french earth breathed french air and chanced to hear the tongue of france twittered by a lady on the quay the charm was instantaneous he reminded himself that rene unlike her countrywomen had no gift for writing letters they had never corresponded since the hour of her marriage they had met in sicily at syracuse in the presence of her father and her husband and so inanimate was she that the meeting seemed like the conclusion of their history her brother roland sent tidings of her by fits and sometimes a conventional message from tourdestelle latterly her husbands name had been cited as among the wildfires of parisian quays in journals more or less devoted to those unreclaimed spaces of the city well if she was unhappy was it not the fulfilment of his prophecy in venice renes brevity became luminous she needed him urgently and knowing him faithful to the death she because she knew him dispatched purely the words which said she needed him why those brief words were the poetry of noble confidence but what could her distress be the lover was able to read that come i give you three days addressed to him was not language of a woman free of her yoke excited to guess and guess beauchamp swept on to speculations of a madness that seized him bodily at last were you loved cecilia he thought little of politics in relation to rene or of home or of honour in the worlds eye or of labouring to pay the fee for his share of life this at least was one of the forms of love which precipitate men the sole thought in him was to be with her she was rene the girl of whom he had prophetically said that she must come to regrets and tears his vision of her was not at tourdestelle though he assumed her to be there awaiting him she was under the sea shadowing alps looking up to the red and gold rosed heights of a realm of morning that was hers inviolably and under which rene was eternally his the interval between then and now was but the space of an unquiet sea traversed in the night sad in the passage of it but featurelessand it had proved him right it was to nevil beauchamp as if the spirit of his old passion woke up again to glorious hopeful morning when he stood in renes france tourdestelle enjoyed the aristocratic privilege of being twelve miles from the nearest railway station alighting here on an evening of clear sky beauchamp found an english groom ready to dismount for him and bring on his portmanteau the man said that his mistress had been twice to the station and was now at the neighbouring chteau dianet thither beauchamp betook himself on horseback he was informed at the gates that madame la marquise had left for tourdestelle in the saddle only ten minutes previously the lodge keeper had been instructed to invite him to stay at chteau dianet in the event of his arriving late but it would be possible to overtake madame by a cut across the heights at a turn of the valley beauchamp pushed along the valley for this visible projection a towering mass of woodland in the midst of which a narrow roadway worn like the track of a torrent with heavy rain wound upward on his descent to the farther side he was to spy directly below in the flat for tourdestelle he crossed the wooded neck above the valley and began descending peering into gulfs of the twilight dusk some paces down he was aided by a brilliant half moon that divided the whole underlying country into sharp outlines of dark and fair and while endeavouring to distinguish the chteau of tourdestelle his eyes were attracted to an angle of the downward zigzag where a pair of horses emerged into broad light swiftly apparently the riders were disputing or one had overtaken the other in pursuit riding habit and plumed hat signalized the sex of one beauchamp sung out a gondoliers cry he fancied it was answered he was heard for the lady turned about and as he rode down still uncertain of her she came cantering up alone and there could be no uncertainty moonlight is friendless to eyes that would make sure of a face long unseen it was rene whose hand he clasped but the story of the years on her and whether she was in bloom or wan as the beams revealing her he could not see her tongue sounded to him as if it were loosened without a voice you have come that storm you are safe so phantom like a sound of speech alarmed him i lost no time but you i am well nothing hangs over you nothing why give me just three days pure impatience have you forgotten me their horses walked on with them they unlocked their hands you knew it was i said he who else could it be i heard venice she replied her previous cavalier was on his feet all but on his knees it appeared searching for something that eluded him under the road side bank he sprang at it and waved it leapt in the saddle and remarked as he drew up beside rene what one picks from the earth one may wear i presume especially when we can protest it is our property beauchamp saw him planting a white substance most carefully at the breast buttonhole of his coat it could hardly be a flower some drooping exotic of the conservatory perhaps resembled it rene pronounced his name m le comte henri dhenriel he bowed to beauchamp with an extreme sweep of the hat last night m beauchamp we put up vows for you to the marine god beseeching an exemption from that horrible mal de mer thanks to the storm i suppose i have won i must maintain madame that i won you wear your trophy said rene and her horse reared and darted ahead the gentleman on each side of her struck into a trot beauchamp glanced at m dhenriels breast decoration rene pressed the pace and threading dense covers of foliage they reached the level of the valley where for a couple of miles she led them stretching away merrily now in shadow now in moonlight between high land and meadow land and a line of poplars in the meadows winding with the river that fed the vale and shot forth gleams of silvery disquiet by rustic bridge and mill the strangeness of being beside her not having yet scanned her face marvelling at her voicethat was like and unlike the rene of old full of her but in another key a mellow note maturermade the ride magical to beauchamp planting the past in the present like a perceptible ghost rene slackened speed saying tourdestelle spans a branch of our little river this is our gate had it been daylight i would have taken you by another way and you would have seen the black tower burnt in the revolution an imposing monument i am assured however you will think it pretty beside the stream do you come with us m le comte his answer was inaudible to beauchamp he did not quit them the lamp at the lodge gates presented the young mans face in full view and beauchamp thought him supremely handsome he perceived it to be a ladys glove that m dhenriel wore at his breast rene walked her horse up the park drive alongside the bright running water it seemed that she was aware of the method of provoking or reproving m dhenriel he endured some minutes of total speechlessness at this pace and abruptly said adieu and turned back rene bounded like a vessel free of her load but why should we hurry said she and checked her course to the walk again i hope you like our normandy and my valley you used to love france nevil and normandy they tell me is cousin to the opposite coast of england in climate soil people it may be in manners too a beauchamp never can feel that he is a foreigner in normandy we claim you half french you have grander parks they say we can give you sunlight and it was really only the wish to see me said beauchamp only and really one does not live for everon earth and it becomes a question whether friends should be shadows to one another before death i wrote to you because i wished to see you i was impatient because i am rene you relieve me evidently you have forgotten my character nevil not a feature of it ah she breathed involuntarily would you have me forget it when i think by myself quite alone yes i would otherwise how can one hope that ones friend is friendship supposing him to read us as we areminutely accurately and it is in absence that we desire our friends to be friendship itself and and i am utterly astray i have not dealt in this language since i last thought of writing a diary and stared at the first line if i mistake not you are fond of the picturesque if moonlight and water will satisfy you look yonder the moon launched her fairy silver fleets on a double sweep of the little river round an island of reeds and two tall poplars i have wondered whether i should ever see you looking at that scene said rene he looked from it to her and asked if roland was well and her father then alluded to her husband but the unlettering elusive moon bright only in the extension of her beams would not tell him what story this face once heaven to him wore imprinted on it her smile upon a parted mouth struck him as two edged in replying i have good news to give you of them all roland is in garrison at rouen and will come when i telegraph my father is in touraine and greets you affectionately he hopes to come they are both perfectly happy my husband is travelling beauchamp was conscious of some bitter taste unaware of what it was though it led him to say undesigningly how very handsome that m dhenriel isif i have his name correctly rene answered he has the misfortune to be considered the handsomest young man in france he has an italian look his mother was provenale she put her horse in motion saying i agree with you that handsome men are rarities and by the way they do not set our world on fire quite as much as beautiful women do yours my friend acknowledge so much in our favour he assented indefinitely he could have wished himself away canvassing in bevisham he had only to imagine himself away from her to feel the flood of joy in being with her your husband is travelling it is his pleasure could she have intended to say that this was good news to give of him as well as of the happiness of her father and brother now look on tourdestelle said rene you will avow that for an active man to be condemned to seek repose in so dull a place after the fatigues of the season in paris it is considerably worse than for women so i am here to dispense the hospitalities the right wing of the chteau on your left is new the side abutting the river is inhabited by dame philiberte whom her husband imprisoned for attempting to take her pleasure in travel i hear upon authority that she dresses in white and wears a black crucifix she is many centuries old and still she lives to remind people that she married a rouaillout do you not think she should have come to me to welcome me she never has and possibly of ladies who are disembodied we may say that they know best for me i desire the interviewand i am a coward i need not state it she ceased presently continuing the other inhabitants are my sister agns dauffray wife of a general officer serving in africmy sister by marriage and my friend the baronne dorbec a relation by marriage m dorbec her son a guest and a sportsman m livret an erudite no young ladies i can bear much but not their presence girls are odious to me i knew one in venice they came within the rays of the lamp hanging above the unpretending entrance to the chteau renes broad grey longueville hat curved low with its black plume on the side farthest from him he was favoured by the gallant lift of the brim on the near side but she had overshadowed her eyes he wears a glove at his breast said beauchamp you speak of m dhenriel he wears a glove at his breast yes it is mine said rene she slipped from her horse and stood against his shoulder as if waiting to be questioned before she rang the bell of the chteau beauchamp alighted burning with his unutterable questions concerning that glove lift your hat let me beg you let me see you he said this was not what she had expected with one heave of her bosom and murmuring i made a vow i would obey you absolutely if you came she raised the hat above her brows and lightning would not have surprised him more for there had not been a single vibration of her voice to tell him of tears running nay the absence of the usual french formalities in her manner of addressing him had seemed to him to indicate her intention to put him at once on an easy friendly footing such as would be natural to her and not painful to him now she said you perceive monsieur that i have my sentimental fits like others but in truth i am not insensible to the picturesque or to gratitude and i thank you sincerely for coming considering that i wrote like a sphinxto evade writing comme une folle she swept to the bell standing in the arch of the entrance she stretched her whip out to a black mass of prostrate timber saying it fell in the storm at two oclock after midnight and you on the sea chapter xxiv his holiday a single day was to be the term of his holiday at tourdestelle but it stood forth as one of those perfect days which are rounded by an evening before and a morning after giving him two nights under the same roof with rene something of a resemblance to three days of her anticipation and wonder filling the first she the next the adieu the last every hour filled and the first day was not over yet he forced himself to calmness that he might not fritter it and walked up and down the room he was dressing in examining its foreign decorations and peering through the window to quiet his nerves he was in her own france with her the country borrowed hues from rene and lent some this chivalrous france framed and interlaced her image aided in idealizing her and was in turn transfigured not half so well would his native land have pleaded for the forgiveness of a british damsel who had wrecked a young mans immoderate first love that glorified self love requires the touch upon imagination of strangeness and an unaccustomed grace to subdue it and make it pardon an outrage to its temples and altars and its happy reading of the heavens the earth too earth foremost we ought perhaps to say it is an exacting heathen best understood by a glance at what will appease it beautiful however as everybody has proved and shall it be decried in a world where beauty is not overcommon though it would slaughter us for its angry satisfaction yet can be soothed by a tone of colour as it were by a novel inscription on a sweetmeat the peculiarity of beauchamp was that he knew the slenderness of the thread which was leading him and foresaw it twisting to a coil unless he should hold firm his work in life was much above the love of a woman in his estimation so he was not deluded by passion when he entered the chteau it is doubtful whether he would not hesitatingly have sacrificed one of the precious votes in bevisham for the pleasure of kissing her hand when they were on the steps she was his first love and only love married and long ago forgivenmarried that is to say she especially among women was interdicted to him by the lingering shadow of the reverential love gone by and if the anguish of the lovers worse than death survived in a shudder of memory at the thought of her not solely lost to him but possessed by another it did but quicken a hunger that was three parts curiosity to see how she who had suffered this bore the change how like or unlike she might be to the extinct rene what traces she kept of the face he had known her tears were startling but tears tell of a mood they do not tell the story of the years and it was that story he had such eagerness to read in one brief revelation an eagerness born only of the last few hours and broken by fears of a tarnished aspect these again being partly hopes of a coming disillusion that would restore him his independence and ask him only for pity the slavery of the love of a woman chained like rene was the most revolting of prospects to a man who cherished his freedom that he might work to the end of his time moreover it swung a thunder cloud across his holiday he recurred to the idea of the holiday repeatedly and the more he did so the thinner it waned he was exhausting the very air and spirit of it with a mind that ran incessantly forward and back and when he and the lady of so much speculation were again together an incapacity of observation seemed to have come over him in reality it was the inability to reflect on his observations her presence resembled those dark sunsets throwing the spell of colour across the world when there is no question with us of morning or of night but of that sole splendour only owing to their arrival late at the chteau covers were laid for them in the boudoir of madame la marquise where he had his hostess to himself and certainly the opportunity of studying her an english navy list solitary on a shelf and laid within it an extract of a paper announcing the return of the ariadne to port explained the mystery of her knowing that he was in england as well as the correctness of the superscription of her letter to him you see i follow you she said beauchamp asked if she read english now a little but the paper was dispatched to me by m vivian ducie of your embassy in paris he is in the valley the name of ducie recalled lord palmets description of the dark beauty of the fluttering pale gold ornaments she was now dressed without one decoration of gold or jewel with scarcely a wave in the silk a modesty of style eloquent of the pride of her form could those eyes fronting him under the lamp have recently shed tears they were the living eyes of a brilliant unembarrassed lady shields flinging light rather than well depths inviting it beauchamp tried to compare her with the rene of venice and found himself thinking of the glove she had surrendered to the handsomest young man in france the effort to recover the younger face gave him a dead creature with the eyelashes of rene the cast of her mouth and throat misty as a shape in a dream he could compare her with cecilia who never would have risked a glove never have betrayed a tear and was the statelier lady not without language but how much less vivid in feature and the gift of speech renes gift of speech counted unnumbered strings which she played on with a grace that clothed the skill and was her natural endowmentan art perfected by the education of the world who cannot talkbut who can discover the writers in a day when all are writing it is as rare an art as poetry and in the mouths of women as enrapturing richer than their voices in music this was the fascination beauchamp felt weaving round him would you that are separable from boys and mobs and the object malignly called the briton prefer the celestial singing of a woman to her excellently talking but not if it were given you to run in unison with her genius of the tongue following her verbal ingenuities and feminine silk flashes of meaning not if she led you to match her fine quick perceptions with more or less of the discreet concordance of the violoncello accompanying the viol it is not high flying which usually ends in heavy falling you quit the level of earth no more than two birds that chase from bush to bush to bill in air for mutual delight to make the concert heavenly language flowed from rene in affinity with the pleasure giving laws that make the curves we recognize as beauty in sublimer arts accept companionship for the dearest of the good things we pray to have and what equalled her who could be her rival her girls crown of irradiated alps began to tremble over her dimly as from moment to moment their intimacy warmed and beauchamp saw the young face vanishing out of this flower of womanhood he did not see it appearing or present but vanishing like the faint ray in the rosier nay the blot of her faithlessness underwent a transformation it affected him somewhat as the patch cunningly laid on near a liquid dimple in fair cheeks at once allures and evades a susceptible attention unused in his french of late he stumbled at times and she supplied the needed phrase taking no note of a blunder now men of sweet blood cannot be secretly accusing or criticizing a gracious lady domestic men are charged with thinking instantly of dark death when an ordinary illness befalls them and it may be so or not but it is positive that the gallant man of the world if he is in the sensitive condition and not yet established as the lord of her feels paralyzed in his masculine sense of leadership the moment his lady assumes the initiative and directs him he gives up at once and thus have many nimble witted dames from one clear start retained their advantage concerning that glove well the handsomest young man in france wore the glove of the loveliest woman the loveliest the very loveliest in the purity of her french stylethe woman to challenge england for a type of beauty to eclipse her it was possible to conceive her country wagering her against all women if rene had faults beauchamp thought of her as at sea breasting tempests while cecilia was a vessel lying safe in harbour untried however promising and if cecilia raised a steady light for him it was over the shores he had left behind while rene had really nothing to do with warning or rescuing or with imperilling she welcomed him simply to a holiday in her society he associated cecilia strangely with the political labours she would have had him relinquish and rene with a pleasant state of indolence that her lightest smile disturbed shun comparisons it is the tricksy heart which sets up that balance to jump into it on one side or the other comparisons come of a secret leaning that is sure to play rogue under its mien of honest dealer so beauchamp suffered himself to be unjust to graver england and lost the strength she would have given him to resist a bewitchment the case with him was that his apprenticeship was new he had been trotting in harness as a veritable cab horse of politicshe by blood a racer and his nature craved for diversions against his will against his moral sense and born tenacity of spirit not a word further of the glove but at night in his bed the glove was a principal actor in events of extraordinary magnitude and inconsequence he was out in the grounds with the early morning light coffee and sweet french bread were brought out to him and he was informed of the hours of reunion at the chteau whose mistress continued invisible she might be sleeping he strolled about within view of the windows wondering at her subservience to sleep tourdestelle lay in one of those norman valleys where the river is the mother of rich pasture and runs hidden between double ranks of sallows aspens and poplars that mark its winding line in the arms of trenched meadows the high land on either side is an unwatered flat up to the horizon little varied by dusty apple trees planted in the stubble here and there and brown mud walls of hamlets a church top a copse an avenue of dwarf limes leading to the three parts farm quarter residence of an enriched peasant striking new roots or decayed proprietor pinching not to be severed from ancient descending on the deep green valley in summer is like a change of climes the chteau stood square at a branch of the river tossing three light bridges of pretty woodwork to park and garden great bouquets of swelling blue and pink hydrangia nestled at his feet on shaven grass an open window showed a cloth of colour as in a reminiscence of italy beauchamp heard himself addressedyou are looking for my sister in law m beauchamp the speaker was madame dauffray to whom he had been introduced overnighta lady of the aquiline french outline not ungentle rene had spoken affectionately of her he remembered there was nothing to make him be on his guard and he stated that he was looking for madame de rouaillout and did not conceal surprise at the information that she was out on horseback she is a tireless person madame dauffray remarked you will not miss her long we all meet at twelve as you know i grudge an hour for i go to morrow said beauchamp the notification of so early a departure or else his bluntness astonished her she fell to praising renes goodness he kept her to it with lively interrogations in the manner of a guileless boy urging for eulogies of his dear absent friend was it duplicity in him or artlessness has she do you think increased in beauty madame dauffray inquired an insidious question to which he replied once i thought it would be impossible not so bad an answer for an englishman in a country where speaking is fencing the race being little famous for dialectical alertness but was it artful or simple they skirted the chteau and beauchamp had the history of dame philiberte recounted to him with a mixture of gallic irony innuendo openness touchingness ridicule and charity novel to his ears madame dauffray struck the note of intimacy earlier than is habitual she sounded him in this way once or twice carelessly perusing him and waiting for the interesting edition of the book of man to summarize its character by showing its pages or remaining shut it was done delicately like the tap of a finger nail on a vase he rang clear he had nothing to conceal and where he was reserved that is in speaking of the developed beauty and grace of rene he was transparent she read the sort of man he was she could also hazard a guess as to the mans present state she ventured to think him comparatively harmlessfor the hour for she was not the woman to be hoodwinked by mans dark nature because she inclined to think well of a particular man nor was she one to trust to any man subject to temptation the wisdom of the frenchwomans fortieth year forbade it a land where the war between the sexes is honestly acknowledged and is full of instruction abounds in precepts but it ill becomes the veteran to practise rigorously what she would prescribe to young women she may discriminate as thustrust no man still this man may be better than that man and it is bad policy to distrust a reasonably guileless member of the preying sex entirely and so to lose his good services hawks have their uses in destroying vermin and though we cannot rely upon the taming of hawks one tied by the leg in a garden preserves the fruit there is a necessity for your leaving us to morrow m beauchamp i regret to say it is imperative madame my husband will congratulate me on the pleasure i have and have long desired of making your acquaintance and he will grieve that he has not been so fortunate he is on service in africa my brother i need not say will deplore the mischance which has prevented him from welcoming you i have telegraphed to him he is at one of the baths in germany and will come assuredly if there is a prospect of finding you here none supposing my telegram not to fall short of him i may count on his being here within four days beauchamp begged her to convey the proper expressions of his regret to m le marquis and m de croisnel and roland your old comrade and brother in arms what will be their disappointment she said i intend to stop for an hour at rouen on my way back said beauchamp she asked if her belle soeur was aware of the short limitation of his visit he had not mentioned it to madame la marquise perhaps you may be moved by the grief of a friend rene may persuade you to stay i came imagining i could be of some use to madame la marquise she writes as if she were telegraphing perfectly true of her for that matter i saw the letter your looks betray a very natural jealousy but seeing it or not it would have been the same she and i have no secrets she was i may tell you strictly unable to write more words in the letter which brings me to inquire what impression m dhenriel made on you yesterday evening he is particularly handsome we women think so did you take him to be eccentric beauchamp gave a french jerk of the shoulders it confessed the incident of the glove to one who knew it as well as he but it masked the weight he was beginning to attach to that incident and madame dauffray was misled truly the englishman may be just such an ex lover uninflammable by virtue of his bloods native coldness endued with the frozen vanity called pride which does not seek to be revenged under wary espionage he might be a young womans friend though male friend of a half abandoned wife should write himself down morally saint mentally sage medically incurable if he would win our confidence this lady of sharp intelligence was the guardian of rene during the foolish husbands flights about paris and over europe and for a proof of her consummate astuteness rene had no secrets and had absolute liberty and hitherto no man could build a boast on her reputation the liberty she would have had at any cost as madame dauffray knew and an attempt to restrict it would have created secrets near upon the breakfast hour rene was perceived by them going toward the chteau at a walking pace they crossed one of the garden bridges to intercept her she started out of some deep meditation and raised her whip hand to beauchamps greeting i had forgotten to tell you monsieur that i should be out for some hours in the morning are you aware said madame dauffray that m beauchamp leaves us to morrow so soon it was uttered hardly with a tone of disappointment the marquise alighted crying hold to the stables caressed her horse and sent him off with a smack on the smoking flanks to meet the groom to morrow that is very soon but m beauchamp is engaged in an election and what have we to induce him to stay would it not be better to tell m beauchamp why he was invited to come rejoined madame dauffray the sombre light in renes eyes quickened through shadowy spheres of surprise and pain to resolution she cried you have my full consent and left them madame dauffray smiled at beauchamp to excuse the childishness of the little story she was about to relate she gave it in the essence without a commencement or an ending she had in fact but two or three hurried minutes before the breakfast bell would ring and the fan she opened and shut and at times shaded her head with was nearly as explicit as her tongue he understood that rene had staked her glove on his coming within a certain number of hours to the briefest wording of invitation possible owing to his detention by the storm m dhenriel had won the bet and now insisted on wearing the glove he is the privileged young madman our women make of a handsome youth said madame dauffray where am i thought beauchampin what land he would have phrased it of whirlwinds catching the wits and whipping the passions calmer than they but unable to command them and guessing that renes errand of the morning by which he had lost hours of her pertained to the glove he said quiveringly madame la marquise objects we replied madame dauffray contend that the glove was not loyally won the wager was upon your coming to the invitation not upon your conquering the elements as to his flaunting the glove for a favour i would ask you whom does he advertize by that gloves do not wear white which fact compromises none but the wearer he picked it up from the ground and does not restore it that is all you see a boy who catches at anything to placard himself there is a compatriot of yours a m ducie who assured us you must be with an uncle in your county of sussex of course we ran the risk of the letter missing you but the chance was worth a glove can you believe it m beauchamp it was i old woman as i am i who provoked the silly wager i have long desired to meet you and we have little society here we are desperate with loneliness half mad with our whims i said that if you were what i had heard of you you would come to us at a word they dared madame la marquise to say the same i wished to see the friend of frenchmen as m roland calls you not merely to see himto know him whether he is this perfect friend whose absolute devotion has impressed my dear sister renes mind she respects you that is a sentiment scarcely complimentary to the ideas of young men she places you above human creatures possibly you may not dislike to be worshipped it is not to be rejected when ones influence is powerful for good but you leave us to morrow i might stay beauchamp hesitated to name the number of hours he stood divided between a sense of the bubbling shallowness of the life about him and a thought grave as an eye dwelling on blood of sinister things below it i may stay another day or two he said if i can be of any earthly service madame dauffray bowed as to a friendly decision on his part saying it would be a thousand pities to disappoint m roland and it will be offering my brother an amicable chance i will send him word that you await him at least that you defer your departure as long as possible ah now you perceive m beauchamp now you have become aware of our purely infantile plan to bring you over to us how very ostensible a punishment it would be were you to remain so short a period having no designs he was neither dupe nor sceptic but he felt oddly entangled and the dream of his holiday had fled like mornings beams as a self deception will at a very gentle shaking chapter xxv the adventure of the boat madame dauffray passed rene whispering on her way to take her seat at the breakfast table rene did not condescend to whisper roland will be glad she said aloud her low eyelids challenged beauchamp for a look of indifference there was more for her to unbosom than madame dauffray had revealed but the comparative innocence of her position in this new light prompted her to meet him defiantly if he chose to feel injured he was attracted by a happy contrast of colour between her dress and complexion together with a cavalierly charm in the sullen brows she lifted and seeing the reverse of a look of indifference on his face after what he had heard of her frivolousness she had a fear that it existed are we not to have m dhenriel to day he amuses me the baronne dorbec remarked if he would learn that he was fashioned for that purpose exclaimed little m livret do not ask young men for too much head my friend he would cease to be amusing dhenriel should have been up in the fields at ten this morning said m dorbec as to his head i back him for a clever shot or a duelling sword said rene it is a quality count it for what we will your favourite madame la baronne is interdicted from presenting himself here so long as he persists in offending me she was requested to explain and with the fair ingenuousness which outshines innocence she touched on the story of the glove ah what a delicate what an exciting how subtle a question had m dhenriel the right to possess it and having that had he the right to wear it at his breast beauchamp was dragged into the discussion of the case rene waited curiously for his judgement pleading an apology for the stormy weather which had detained him and for his ignorance that so precious an article was at stake he held that by the terms of the wager the glove was lost the claim to wear it was a matter of taste matters of taste monsieur are not i think decided by weapons in your country said m dorbec we have no duelling said beauchamp the frenchman imagined the confession to be somewhat humbling and generously added but you have your volunteersa magnificent spectacle of patriotism and national readiness for defence a shrewd pang traversed beauchamps heart as he looked back on his country from the outside and the inside thinking what amount of patriotic readiness the character of the volunteering signified in the face of all that england has to maintain like a politic islander he allowed the patriotic spectacle to be imagined reflecting that it did a sort of service abroad and had only to be unmasked at home but you surrendered the glove marquise the baronne dorbec spoke judicially i flung it to the ground that made it neutral said rene hum he wears it with the dust on it certainly and for how long a time m livret wished to know does this amusing young man proclaim his intention of wearing the glove until he can see with us that his order of merit is utter kid said madame dauffray and as she had spoken more or less neatly satisfaction was left residing in the ear of the assembly and the glove was permitted to be swept away on a fresh tide of dialogue the admirable candour of rene in publicly alluding to m dhenriels foolishness restored a peep of his holiday to beauchamp madame dauffray took note of the effect it produced and quite excused her sister in law for intending to produce it but that speaking out the half truth that we may put on the mask of the whole is no new trick and believing as she did that rene was in danger with the handsome count henri the practice of such a kind of honesty on her part appeared alarming still it is imprudent to press for confidences when our friends heart is manifestly trifling with sincerity who knows but that some foregone reckless act or word may have superinduced the healthy shame which cannot speak which must disguise itself and is honesty in that form but roughly troubled would resolve to rank dishonesty so thought the patient lady wiser in that than in her perceptions rene made a boast of not persuading her guest to stay avowing that she would not willingly have him go praising him equably she listened to praise of him with animation she was dumb and statue like when count henris name was mentioned did not this betray liking for one subjection to the other indeed there was an asiatic splendour of animal beauty about m dhenriel that would be serpent with most women madame dauffray conceived why not with the deserted rene who adored beauty of shape and colour and was compassionate toward a rashness of character that her own unnatural solitariness and quick spirit made her emulous of meanwhile beauchamps day of adieu succeeded that of his holiday and no adieu was uttered the hours at tourdestelle had a singular turn for slipping interlinked and all as one they swam by brought evening brought morning never varied they might have varied with such a division as when flame lights up the night or a tempest shades the day had rene chosen she had that power over him she had no wish to use it perhaps she apprehended what it would cause her to forfeit she wished him to respect her felt that she was under the shadow of the glove slight though it was while it was nothing but a tale of a lady and a glove and her desire like his was that they should meet daily and dream on without a variation he noticed how seldom she led him beyond the grounds of the chteau they were to make excursions when her brother came she said roland de croisnels colonel con de grandchamp happened to be engaged in a duel which great business detained roland it supplied beauchamp with an excuse for staying that he was angry with himself for being pleased to have so he attacked the practice of duelling and next the shrug wherewith m livret and m dorbec sought at first to defend the foul custom or apologize for it or plead for it philosophically or altogether cast it off their shoulders for the literal interpretation of the shrug in argument is beyond human capacity it is the point of speech beyond our treasury of language he attacked the shrug as he thought very temperately but in controlling his native vehemence he grew perforce of repression and of incompetency to deliver himself copiously in french sarcastic in fine his contrast of the pretence of their noble country to head civilization and its encouragement of a custom so barbarous offended m dorbec and irritated m livret the latter delivered a brief essay on gallic blood the former maintained that frenchmen were the best judges of their own ways and deeds politeness reigned but politeness is compelled to throw off cloak and jacket when it steps into the arena to meet the encounter of a bull beauchamp drew on their word solidaire to assist him in declaring that no civilized nation could be thus independent imagining himself in the france of brave ideas he contrived to strike out sparks of legitimist ire around him and found himself breathing the atmosphere of the most primitive nursery of toryism again he encountered the shrug and he would have it a verbal matter m dorbec gravely recited the programme of the country party in france m livret carried the war across channel you english have retired from active life like the exhausted author to turn criticthe critic that sneers unless we copy you abjectly we are execrable and what is that sneer materially it is an acrid saliva withering where it drops in the way of fellowship it is a corpse emanation as to wit the sneer is the cloak of clumsiness it is the pharisees incense the hypocrites pity the post of exaltation of the fat citizen etc but said m livret the people using it should have a care that they keep powerful they make no friends he terminated with this warning to a nation not devoid of superior merit m dorbec said less and was less consoled by his outburst in the opinion of mr vivian ducie present at the discussion beauchamp provoked the lash for in the first place a beautiful womans apparent favourite should be particularly discreet in all that he says and next he should have known that the gallic shrug over matters political is volcanicit is the heaving of the mountain and like the proverbial russ leaps up tartarly at a scratch our newspapers also had been flea biting m livret and his countrymen of late and to conclude over in old england you may fly out against what you will and there is little beyond a motherly smile a nurses rebuke or a fools rudeness to answer you in quick blooded france you have whip for whip sneer sarcasm claw fang tussle in a trice and if you choose to comport yourself according to your insular notion of freedom you are bound to march out to the measured ground at an invitation to begin by saying that your principles are opposed to it naturally excites a malicious propensity to try your temper a further cause unknown to mr ducie of m livrets irritation was that beauchamp had vexed him on a subject peculiarly dear to him the celebrated chteau dianet was about to be visited by the guests at tourdestelle in common with some french philosophers and english matrons he cherished a sentimental sad enthusiasm for royal concubines and when dilating upon one among them the ruins of whose familys castle stood in the neighbourhood agrees who was really a kindly soul though not virtuousm livret had been traversed by beauchamp with questions as to the condition of the people the peasantry that were sweated in taxes to support these lovely frailties they came oddly from a man in the fire of youth and a little old gentleman somewhat seduced by the melting image of his theme might well blink at him to ask of what flesh are you then his historic harem was insulted personally too the fair creature picturesquely soiled intrepid in her amorousness and ultimately absolved by repentance a shuddering narrative of her sins under showers of salt drops cried to him to champion her excited by the supposed cold critical mind in beauchamp m livret painted and painted this lady tricked her in casuistical niceties scenes of pomp and boudoir pathos with many shifting sidelights and a risky word or two until rene cried out spare us the esprit gaulois m livret there was much to make him angry with this englishman the esprit gaulois is the sparkle of crystal common sense madame and may we never abandon it for a puritanism that hides its face to conceal its filthiness like a stagnant pond replied m livret flashing it seems then that there are two ways of being objectionable said rene ah madame la marquise your wit is french he breathed low keep your heart so both m livret and m dorbec had forgotten that when count henri dhenriel was received at tourdestelle the arrival of the englishman was pleasantly anticipated by them as an eclipse of the handsome boy but a foreign interloper is quickly dispossessed of all means of pleasing save that one of taking his departure and they now talked of count henris disgrace and banishment in a very warm spirit of sympathy not at all seeing why it should be made to depend upon the movements of this m beauchamp as it appeared to be madame dauffray heard some of their dialogue and hurried with a mouth full of comedy to rene who did not reproach them for silly beings as would be done elsewhere on the contrary she appreciated a scene of such absolute comedy recognizing it instantly as a situation plucked out of human nature she compared them to republicans that regretted the sovereign they had deposed for a pretender to start up and govern them who hurries them round to the legitimate king again said madame dauffray rene cast her chin up how my dear your husband what of him he is returning what brings him you should ask who my rene i was sure he would not hear of m beauchamps being here without an effort to return and do the honours of the chteau rene looked hard at her saying how thoughtful of you you must have made use of the telegraph wires to inform him that m beauchamp was with us more i made use of them to inform him that m beauchamp was expected and that was enough to bring him he pays m beauchamp a wonderful compliment such as he would pay to no other man my rene virtually it is the highest of compliments to you i say that to m beauchamps credit for raoul has met him and whatever his personal feeling may be must know your friend is a man of honour my friend is yes i have no reason to think otherwise rene replied her husbands persistent and exclusive jealousy of beauchamp was the singular point in the character of one who appeared to have no sentiment of the kind as regarded men that were much less than men of honour so then my sister agns she said you suggested the invitation of m beauchamp for the purpose of spurring my husband to return apparently he and i are surrounded by plotters am i so very guilty said madame dauffray if that mad boy half idiot half panther were by chance to insult m beauchamp you would feel so you have taken precautions to prevent their meeting and besides m beauchamp does not fight rene flushed crimson madame dauffray added i do not say that he is other than a perfectly brave and chivalrous gentleman oh cried rene do not say it if ever you should imagine it bid roland speak of him he is changed oppressed i did him a terrible wrong she checked herself but the chief thing to do is to keep m dhenriel away from him i suspect m dorbec of a design to make them clash and you my dear will explain why to flatter me believe me i thirst for flattery i have had none since m beauchamp came and you so acute must have seen the want of it in my face but you so skilful agns will manage these men do you know agns that the pride of a woman so incredibly clever as you have shown me you are should resent their intrigues and overthrow them as for me i thought i could command m dhenriel and i find he has neither reason in him nor obedience singular to say i knew him just as well a week back as i do now and then i liked him for his qualitiesor the absence of any but how shall we avoid him on the road to dianet he is aware that we are going take m beauchamp by boat said madame dauffray the river winds to within a five minutes walk of dianet we could go by boat rene said musingly i thought of the boat but does it not give the man a triumph that we should seem to try to elude him what matter still i do not like him to be the falcon and nevil beauchamp the little bird so it is because we began badly agns was it my fault mine tell me the legitimate king returns when in two days or three and his rebel subjects are to address himhow madame dauffray smote the point of a finger softly on her cheek will they be pardoned said rene it is for him to kneel my dearest legitimacy kneeling for forgiveness is a painful picture agns legitimacy jealous of a foreigner is an odd one however we are women born to our lot if we could rise en massebut we cannot embrace me madame dauffray embraced her without an idea that she assisted in performing the farewell of their confidential intimacy when rene trifled with count henri it was playing with fire and she knew it and once or twice she bemoaned to agns dauffray her abandoned state which condemned her for the sake of the sensation of living to have recourse to perilous pastimes but she was revolted as at a piece of treachery that agns should have suggested the invitation of nevil beauchamp with the secret design of winning home her husband to protect her this for one reason was because beauchamp gave her no notion of danger none therefore of requiring protection and the presence of her husband could not but be hateful to him an undeserved infliction to her it was intolerable that they should be brought into contact it seemed almost as hard that she should have to dismiss beauchamp to preclude their meeting she remembered nevertheless a certain desperation of mind scarce imaginable in the retrospect by which trembling fever smitten scorning herself she had been reduced to hope for nevil beauchamps coming as for a rescue the night of the storm had roused her heart since then his perfect friendliness had lulled his air of thoughtfulness had interested it and the fancy that he who neither reproached nor sentimentalized was to be infinitely compassionated stirred up remorse she could not tell her friend agns of these feelings while her feelings were angered against her friend so she talked lightly of the legitimate king and they embraced a situation of comedy quite as true as that presented by the humble admirers of the brilliant chatelaine beauchamp had the pleasure of rowing madame la marquise to the short shaded walk separating the river from chteau dianet whither m dorbec went on horseback and madame dauffray and m livret were driven the portrait of diane of dianet was praised for the beauty of the dame a soft fleshed acutely featured person a fresh of the toilette face of the configuration of head of the cat relieved by a delicately aquiline nose and it could only be the cat of fairy metamorphosis which should stand for that illustration brows and chin made an acceptable triangle and eyes and mouth could be what she pleased for mice or monarchs m livret did not gainsay the impeachment of her by a great french historian tender to women to frailties in particularyes she was cold perhaps grasping but dwell upon her in her character of woman conceive her existing to estimate the charm of her graciousness name the two countries which alone have produced the woman the ideal woman the woman of art whose beauty grace and wit offer her to our contemplation in an atmosphere above the ordinary conditions of the world these two countries are france and greece none other give you the perfect woman the woman who conquers time as she conquers men by virtue of the divinity in her blood and she as little as illustrious heroes is to be judged by the laws and standards of lesser creatures in fashioning her nature and art have worked together in her poetry walks the earth the question of good or bad is entirely to be put aside it is a rustics impertinencea bourgeois vulgarity she is preeminent voil tout has she grace and beauty then you are answered such possessions are an assurance that her influence in the aggregate must be for good thunder destructive to insects refreshes earth so she so sang the rhapsodist possibly a scholarly little french gentleman going down the grey slopes of sixty to second childishness recovers a second juvenility in these enthusiasms though what it is that inspires our matrons to take up with them is unimaginable m livrets ardour was a contrast to the young englishmans vacant gaze at diane and the symbols of her goddesship running along the walls the bed the cabinets everywhere that the chaste device could find frontage and a corner m dorbec remained outside the chteau inspecting the fish ponds when they rejoined him he complimented beauchamp semi ironically on his choice of the rivers quiet charms in preference to the dusty roads madame de rouaillout said come m dorbec what if you surrender your horse to m beauchamp and row me back he changed colour hesitated and declined he had an engagement to call on m dhenriel when did you see him said she he was confused it is not long since madame on the road coming along the road and our glove madame la marquise if i may trust my memory m dhenriel was not in official costume rene allowed herself to be reassured a ceremonious visit that m livret insisted on was paid to the chapel of diane where she had worshipped and laid her widowed ashes which said m livret the fiends of the revolution would not let rest he raised his voice to denounce them it was roland de croisnel that answered the revolution was our grandmother monsieur and i cannot hear her abused rene caught her brother by the hand he stepped out of the chapel with beauchamp to embrace him then kissed rene and remarking that she was pale fetched flooding colour to her cheeks he was hearty air to them after the sentimentalism they had been hearing beauchamp and he walked like loving comrades at school questioning answering chattering laughinga beautiful sight to rene and she looked at agns dauffray to ask her whether this englishman was not one of them in his frankness and freshness roland stopped to turn to rene i met dhenriel on my ride here he said with a sharp inquisitive expression of eye that passed immediately you rode here from tourdestelle then said rene has he been one of the company marquise did he ride by you without speaking roland thus roland described a spanish caballeros formallest salutation saying to beauchamp not the best sample of our young frenchmanwoman spoiled not that the better kind of article need be spoiled by themheaven forbid that friend nevil he spoke lower do you know you have something of the prophet in you i remember much has come true an old spoiler of women is worse than one spoiled by them ah well and madame culling and your seven feet high uncle and have you a fleet to satisfy nevil beauchamp yet you shall see a trial of our new field guns at rouen they were separated with difficulty rene wished her brother to come in the boat and he would have done so but for his objection to have his arab bestridden by a man unknown to him my love is a four foot and heres my love roland said going outside the gilt gate rails to the graceful little beast that acknowledged his ownership with an arch and swing of the neck round to him he mounted and called au revoir m le capitaine au revoir m le commandant cried beauchamp admiral and marshal each of us in good season said roland thanks to your promotion i had a letter from my sister advance a grade and i may get another beauchamp thought of the strange gulf now between him and the time when he pined to be a commodore and an admiral the gulf was bridged as he looked at rene petting rolands horse is there in the world so lovely a creature she said and appealed fondlingly to the beauty that brings out beauty and bidding it disdain rivalry rivalled it insomuch that in a moment of trance beauchamp with his bodily vision beheld her not there but on the lido of venice shining out of the years gone old love reviving may be love of a phantom after all we can if it must revive keep it to the limits of a ghostly love the ship in the arabian tale coming within the zone of the magnetic mountain flies all its bolts and bars and becomes sheer timbers but that is the carelessness of the ships captain and hitherto beauchamp could applaud himself for steering with prudence while renes attractions warned more than they beckoned she was magnetic to him as no other woman was then whither his course but homeward after they had taken leave of their host and hostess of chteau dianet walking across a meadow to a line of charmilles that led to the river side he said now i have seen roland i shall have to decide upon going wantonly won is deservedly lost said rene but do not disappoint my roland much because of his foolish sister is he not looking handsome and he is young to be a commandant for we have no interest at this court they kept him out of the last war my father expects to find you at tourdestelle and how account to him for your hurried flight save with the story of that which brought you to us the glove i shall beg for the fellow to it before i depart marquise you perceived my disposition to light headedness monsieur when i was a girl i said that ibut the past is dust shall i ever see you in england that country seems to frown on me but if i do not go there nor you come here except to imperious mysterious invitations which will not be repeated the future is dust as well as the past for me at least dust here dust thereif one could be like a silk worm and live lying on the leaf one feeds on it would be a sort of answer to the riddleliving out of the dust and in the present i find none in my religion no doubt madame de brz did why did you call diane so to m livret she looked at him smiling as they came out of the shadow of the clipped trees he was glancing about for the boat the boat is across the river rene said in a voice that made him seek her eyes for an explanation of the dead sound she was very pale you have perfect command of yourself for my sake she said he looked round standing up in the boat against the opposite bank and leaning with crossed legs on one of the sculls planted in the gravel of the river count henri dhenriels handsome figure presented itself to beauchamps gaze with a dryness that smacked of his uncle everard romfrey beauchamp said of the fantastical posture of the young man one can do that on fresh water rene did not comprehend the sailor sarcasm of the remark but she also commented on the statuesque appearance of count henri is the pose for photography or for sculpture neither of them showed a sign of surprise or of impatience m dhenriel could not maintain the attitude he uncrossed his legs deliberately drooped hat in hand and came paddling over apologized indolently and said i am not i believe trespassing on the grounds of tourdestelle madame la marquise you happen to be in my boat m le comte said rene permit me madame he had set one foot on shore with his back to beauchamp and reached a hand to assist her step into the boat beauchamp caught fast hold of the bows while rene laid a finger on count henris shoulder to steady herself the instant she had taken her seat count henri dashed the sculls blade at the bank to push off with her but the boat was fast his manuvre had been foreseen beauchamp swung on board like the last seaman of a launch and crouched as the boat rocked away to the stream and still count henri leaned on the scull not in a chosen attitude but for positive support he had thrown his force into the blow to push off triumphantly and leave his rival standing it occurred that the boats brief resistance and rocking away agitated his artificial equipoise and by the operation of inexorable laws the longer he leaned across an extending surface the more was he dependent so that when the measure of the water exceeded the length of his failing support on land there was no help for it he pitched in his grimace of chagrin at the sight of beauchamp securely established had scarcely yielded to the grimness of feature of the man who feels he must go as he took the plunge and these two emotions combined to make an extraordinary countenance he went like a gallant gentleman he threw up his heels to clear the boat dropping into about four feet of water and his first remark on rising was i trust madame i have not had the misfortune to splash you then he waded to the bank scrambled to his feet and drew out his moustachios to their curving ends rene nodded sharply to beauchamp to bid him row he with less of wisdom having seized the floating scull abandoned by count henri and got it ready for the stroke said a word of condolence to the dripping man count henris shoulders and neck expressed a kind of negative that like a wet dogs shake of the head ended in an involuntary whole length shudder dog like and deplorable to behold he must have been conscious of this miserable exhibition of himself he turned to beauchamp you are i am informed a sailor monsieur i compliment you on your naval tactics our next meeting will be on land au revoir monsieur madame la marquise i have the honour to salute you with these words he retreated row quickly i beg of you rene said to beauchamp her desire was to see roland and open her heart to her brother for now it had to be opened not a minute must be lost to prevent further mischief and who was guilty she her heart clamoured of her guilt to waken a cry of innocence a disdainful pity for the superb young savage just made ludicrous relieved him of blame implacable though he was he was nothing an accidenta fool but he might become a terrible instrument of punishment the thought of that possibility gave it an aspect of retribution under which her cry of innocence was insufferable in its feebleness it would have been different with her if beauchamp had taken advantage of her fever of anxiety suddenly appeased by the sight of him on the evening of his arrival at tourdestelle after the storm to attempt a renewal of their old broken love bonds then she would have seen only a conflict between two men neither of whom could claim a more secret right than the other to be called her lover and of whom both were on a common footing and partly despicable but nevil beauchamp had behaved as her perfect true friend in the character she had hoped for when she summoned him the sense of her guilt lay in the recognition that he had saved her from what from the consequences of delirium rather than from lovesurely delirium founded on delusion love had not existed she had said to count henri you speak to me of love i was beloved when i was a girl before my marriage and for years i have not seen or corresponded with the man who loved me and i have only to lift my finger now and he will come to me and not once will he speak to me of love those were the words originating the wager of the glove but what of her if nevil beauchamp had not come her heart jumped and she blushed ungovernably in his faceas if he were seeing her withdraw her foot from the rocks edge and had that instant rescued her but how came it she had been so helpless she could ask she could not answer thinking talking to her heart was useless the deceiver simply feigned utter condemnation to make partial comfort acceptable she burned to do some act of extreme self abasement that should bring an unwonted degree of wrath on her externally and so re entitle her to consideration in her own eyes she burned to be interrogated to have to weep to be scorned abused and forgiven that she might say she did not deserve pardon beauchamp was too english evidently too blind for the description of judge accuser she required one who would worry her without mercy untildisgraced by the excess of torture inflictedhe should reinstate her by as much as he had overcharged his accusation and a little more reasonably enough instinctively in fact she shunned the hollow of an english ear a surprise was in reserve for her beauchamp gave up rowing as he rested on the sculls his head was bent and turned toward the bank rene perceived an over swollen monster gourd that had strayed from a garden adjoining the river and hung sliding heavily down the bank on one greenish yellow cheek in prolonged contemplation of its image in the mirror below apparently this obese narcissus enchained his attention she tapped her foot are you tired of rowing monsieur it was exactly here said he that you told me you expected your husbands return she glanced at the gourd bit her lip and colouring said at what point of the river did i request you to congratulate me on it she would not have said that if she had known the thoughts at work within him he set the boat swaying from side to side and at once the hugeous reflection of that conceivably self enamoured bulk quavered and distended and was shattered in a thousand dancing fragments to re unite and recompose its maudlin air of imaged satisfaction she began to have a vague idea that he was indulging grotesque fancies very strangely the ridiculous thing in the shape of an over stretched likeness that she never would have seen had he indicated it directly became transfused from his mind to hers by his abstract half amused observation of the great dancing gourdthat capering antiquity lumbering volatility wandering self adored gross bald cupid elatest of nondescripts her senses imagined the impressions agitating beauchamps and exaggerated them beyond limit and when he amazed her with a straight look into her eyes and the words better let it be a youthand live than fall back to that she understood him immediately and together with her old fear of his impetuosity and downrightness came the vivid recollection like a bright finger pointing upon darkness of what foul destiny magnified by her present abhorrence of it he would have saved her from in the days of venice and touraine and unto what loathly example of the hideous grotesque she in spite of her lovers foresight on her behalf had become allied face to face as they sat she had no defence for her scarlet cheeks her eyes wavered we will land here the cottagers shall row the boat up she said somewhereanywhere said beauchamp but i must speak i will tell you now i do not think you to blamebarely not in my sight though no man living would have suffered as i should probably some days more and you would have been lost you looked for me trust your instinct now im with you as well as when im absent have you courage thats the question you have years to live can you live them in this placewith honour and alive really renes eyes grew wide she tried to frown and her brows merely twitched to speak and she was inarticulate his madness miraculous penetration and the super masculine charity in him unknown to the world of young men in their treatment of women excited awed and melted her he had seen the whole truth of her relations with m dhenrielthe wickedness of them in one light the innocence in another and without prompting a confession he forgave her could she believe it this was love and manly love she yearned to be on her feet to feel the possibility of an escape from him she pointed to a landing he sprang to the bank it could end in nothing else he said unless you beat cold to me and now i have your hand rene its the hand of a living woman you have no need to tell me that but faithful to her comrade i can swear it for herfaithful to a true alliance you are not married you are simply chained and you are terrorized what a perversion of you it is it wrecks you but with me am i not your lover you and i are one life what have we suffered for but to find this out and act on it do i not know that a woman lives and is not the rooted piece of vegetation hypocrites and tyrants expect her to be act on it i say own me break the chains come to me say nevil beauchamp or death and death for you but you are poisoned and thwart eddying as you live now worse shaming the rene i knew ahvenice but now we are both of us wiser and stronger we have gone through fire who foretold it this day and this misery and perversion that we can turn to joy if we willif you will no heart to dare is no heart to loveanswer that shall i see you cower away from me again not this time he swept on in a flood uttered mad things foolish things and things of an insight electrifying to her through the cottagers garden across a field and within the park gates of tourdestelle it continued unceasingly and deeply was she won by the rebellious note in all that he said deeply too by his disregard of the vulgar arts of wooers she detected none he did not speak so much to win as to help her to see with her own orbs nor was it roughly or chidingly though it was absolutely that he stripped her of the veil a wavering woman will keep to herself from her hearts lord if she can they arrived long after the boat at tourdestelle and beauchamp might believe he had prevailed with her but for her forlorn repetition of the question he had put to her idly and as a new idea instead of significantly with a recollection and a doubt have i courage nevil the grain of common sense in cowardice caused her to repeat it when her reason was bedimmed and passion assumed the right to show the way of right and wrong chapter xxvi mr blackburn tuckham some time after beauchamp had been seen renewing his canvass in bevisham a report reached mount laurels that he was lame of a leg the wits of the opposite camp revived the french marquees but it was generally acknowledged that he had come back without the lady she was invisible cecilia halkett rode home with her father on a dusky autumn evening and found the card of commander beauchamp awaiting her he might have stayed to see her she thought ladies are not customarily so very late in returning from a ride on chill evenings of autumn only a quarter of an hour was between his visit and her return the shortness of the interval made it appear the deeper gulf she noticed that her father particularly inquired of the man servant whether captain beauchamp limped it seemed a piece of kindly anxiety on his part the captain was mounted the man said cecilia was conscious of rumours being abroad relating to nevils expedition to france but he had enemies and was at war with them and she held herself indifferent to tattle this card bearing his name recently in his hand was much more insidious and precise she took it to her room to look at it nothing but his name and naval title was inscribed no pencilled line she had not expected to discover one the simple card was her dark light as a handkerchief a flower a knot of riband has been for men luridly illuminated by such small sparks to fling their beams on shadows and read the monstrous things for truths her purer virgin blood was not inflamed she read the signification of the card sadly as she did clearly what she could not so distinctly imagine was how he could reconcile the devotion to his country which he had taught her to put her faith in with his unhappy subjection to madame de rouaillout how could the nobler sentiment exist side by side with one that was lawless or was the wildness characteristic of his political views proof of a nature inclining to disown moral ties she feared so he did not speak of the clergy respectfully reading in the dark she was forced to rely on her social instincts and she distrusted her personal feelings as much as she could for she wished to know the truth of him anything pain and heartrending rather than the shutting of the eyes in an unworthy abandonment to mere emotion and fascination cecilias love could not be otherwise given to a man however near she might be drawn to lovethough she should suffer the pangs of love cruelly she placed his card in her writing desk she had his likeness there commander beauchamp encouraged the art of photography as those that make long voyages do in reciprocating what they petition their friends for mrs rosamund culling had a whole collection of photographs of him equal to a visual history of his growth in chapters from boyhood to midshipmanship and to manhood the specimen possessed by cecilia was one of a couple that beauchamp had forwarded to mrs grancey lespel on the day of his departure for france and was a present from that lady purchased like so many presents at a cost cecilia would have paid heavily in gold to have been spared namely a public blush she was allowed to make her choice and she chose the profile repeating a remark of mrs cullings that it suggested an arrow head in the upflight whereupon mr stukely culbrett had said then there is the man for he is undoubtedly a projectile nor were politically hostile punsters on an arrow head inactive but cecilia was thinking of the side face she less intently than beauchamp at hers had glanced at during the drive into bevisham at that moment she fancied madame de rouaillout might be doing likewise and oh that she had the portrait of the french lady as well next day her father tossed her a photograph of another gentleman coming out of a letter he had received from old mrs beauchamp he asked her opinion of it she said i think he would have suited bevisham better than captain baskelett of the original who presented himself at mount laurels in the course of the week she had nothing to say except that he was very like the photograph very unlike nevil beauchamp yes there im of your opinion her father observed the gentleman was mr blackburn tuckham and it was amusing to find an exuberant tory in one who was the reverse of the cavalier type nevil and he seemed to have been sorted to the wrong sides mr tuckham had a round head square flat forehead and ruddy face he stood as if his feet claimed the earth under them for his own with a certain shortness of leg that detracted from the majesty of his resemblance to our eighth harry but increased his air of solidity and he was authoritative in speaking let me set you right sir he said sometimes to colonel halkett and that was his modesty you are altogether wrong miss halkett heard herself informed which was his courtesy he examined some of her water colour drawings before sitting down to dinner approved of them but thought it necessary to lay a broad finger on them to show their defects on the question of politics i venture to state he remarked in anything but the tone of a venture that no educated man of ordinary sense who has visited our colonies will come back a liberal as for a man of sense and education being a radical he scouted the notion with a pooh sufficient to awaken a vessel in the doldrums he said carelessly of commander beauchamp that he might think himself one either the radical candidate for bevisham stood self deceived orthe other supposition mr tuckham would venture to state that no english gentleman exempt from an examination by order of the commissioners of lunacy could be sincerely a radical not a bit of it nonsense he replied to miss halketts hint at the existence of radical views that is those views are out of politics they are matters for the police dutch dykes are built to shut away the sea from cultivated land and of course its a part of the business of the dutch government to keep up the dykesand of ours to guard against the mob but that is only a political consideration after the mob has been allowed to undermine our defences they speak said miss halkett of educating the people to fit them they speak of commanding the winds and tides he cut her short with no clear analogy wait till we have a storm its a delusion amounting to dementedness to suppose that with the people inside our defences we can be taming them and tricking them as for sending them to school after giving them power its like asking a wild beast to sit down to dinner with ushe wants the whole table and us too the best education for the people is government theyre beginning to see that in lancashire at last i ran down to lancashire for a couple of days on my landing and im thankful to say lancashire is preparing to take a step back lancashire leads the country lancashire men see what this liberalism has done for the labour market captain beauchamp considers that the political change coming over the minds of the manufacturers is due to the large fortunes they have made said miss halkett maliciously associating a radical prophet with him he was unaffected by it and continued property is ballast as well as treasure i call property funded good sense i would give it every privilege if we are to speak of patriotism i say the possession of property guarantees it i maintain that the lead of men of property is in most cases sure to be the safe one i think so colonel halkett interposed and he spoke as a man of property mr tuckham grew fervent in his allusions to our wealth and our commerce having won the race and gained the prize shall we let it slip out of our grasp upon this topic his voice descended to tones of priestlike awe for are we not the envy of the world our wealth is countless fabulous it may well inspire veneration and we have won it with our hands thanks he implied it so to our religion we are rich in money and industry in those two things only and the corruption of an energetic industry is constantly threatened by the profusion of wealth giving it employment this being the case either your radicals do not know the first conditions of human nature or they do and if they do they are traitors and the liberals opening the gates to them are fools and some are knaves we perish as a great power if we cease to look sharp ahead hold firm together and make the utmost of what we possess the word for the performance of those duties is toryism a word with an older flavour than conservatism and mr tuckham preferred it by all means let workmen be free men but a man must earn his freedom daily or he will become a slave in some form or another and the way to earn it is by work and obedience to right direction in a country like ours open on all sides to the competition of intelligence and strength with a press that is the voice of all parties and of every interest in a country offering to your investments three and a half and more per cent secure as the firmament he perceived an amazed expression on miss halketts countenance and ay said he that means the certainty of food to millions of mouths and comforts if not luxuries to half the population a safe percentage on savings is the basis of civilization but he had bruised his eloquence for though you may start a sermon from stones to hit the stars he must be a practised orator who shall descend out of the abstract to take up a heavy lump of the concrete without unseating himself and he stammered and came to a flat ending in such a countrywell i venture to say we have a right to condemn in advance disturbers of the peace and they must show very good cause indeed for not being summarily heldto account for their conduct the allocution was not delivered in the presence of an audience other than sympathetic and miss halkett rightly guessed that it was intended to strike captain beauchamp by ricochet he puffed at the mention of beauchamps name he had read a reported speech or two of beauchamps and shook his head over a quotation of the stuff as though he would have sprung at him like a lion but for his enrolment as a constable not a whit the less did mr tuckham drink his claret relishingly and he told stories incidental to his travels now and then commended the fishing here the shooting there and in some few places the cookery with much bright emphasis when it could be praised it appeared to be an endearing recollection to him still as a man of progress he declared his belief that we english would ultimately turn out the best cooks having indubitably the best material our incomprehensible political pusillanimity was the one sad point about us we had been driven from surrender to surrender like geese upon a common i have heard it said miss halkett assisted him to dr shrapnels comparison mr tuckham laughed and half yawned and sighed dear me his laughter was catching and somehow more persuasive of the soundness of the mans heart and head than his remarks she would have been astonished to know that a gentleman so uncourtly if not uncouthjudged by the standard of the circle she moved inand so unskilled in pleasing the sight and hearing of ladies as to treat them like junior comrades had raised the vow within himself on seeing her you or no woman the colonel delighted in him both as a strong and able young fellow and a refreshingly aggressive recruit of his party who was for onslaught and invoked common sense instead of waving the flag of sentiment in retreat a very horse artillery man of tories regretting immensely that mr tuckham had not reached england earlier that he might have occupied the seat for bevisham about to be given to captain baskelett colonel halkett set up a contrast of blackburn tuckham and nevil beauchamp a singular instance of unfairness his daughter thought considering that the distinct contrast presented by the circumstances was that of mr tuckham and captain baskelett it seems to me papathat you are contrasting the idealist and the realist she said ah well we dont want the idealist in politics muttered the colonel latterly he also had taken to shaking his head over nevil cecilia dared not ask him why mr tuckham arrived at mount laurels on the eve of the nomination day in bevisham an article in the bevisham gazette calling upon all true liberals to demonstrate their unanimity by a multitudinous show of hands he ascribed to the writing of a child of erin and he was highly diverted by the liberals hiring of paddy to pen and spout for him a scotchman manages and paddy does the sermon for all their journals he said off hand adding and the english are the compositors i suppose you may take that for an instance of the national spirit of liberal newspapers ah sighed the colonel as at a case clearly demonstrated against them a drive down to bevisham to witness the ceremony of the nomination in the town hall sobered mr tuckhams disposition to generalize beauchamp had the show of hands and to say with captain baskelett that they were a dirty majority was beneath mr tuckhams verbal antagonism he fell into a studious reserve noting everything listening to everybody greatly to colonel halketts admiration of one by nature a talker and a thunderer the show of hands mr seymour austin declared to be the most delusive of electoral auspices and it proved so a little later than four oclock in the afternoon of the election day cecilia received a message from her father telling her that both of the liberals were headed beauchamp nowhere mrs grancey lespel was the next herald of beauchamps defeat she merely stated the fact that she had met the colonel and mr blackburn tuckham driving on the outskirts of the town and had promised to bring cecilia the final numbers of the poll without naming them she unrolled the greater business in her mind a man who in the middle of an election goes over to france to fight a duel can hardly expect to win he has all the morality of an english borough opposed to him she said and seeing the young lady stiffen oh the duel is positive she dropped her voice with the husband who else could it be and returns invalided that is evidence my nephew palmet has it from vivian ducie and he is acquainted with her tolerably intimately and the story is she was overtaken in her flight in the night and the duel followed at eight oclock in the morning but her brother insisted on fighting for captain beauchamp and i cannot tell you howbut his place in it i cant explainthere was a beau jeune homme and its quite possible that he should have been the person to stand up against the marquis at any rate he insulted captain beauchamp or thought your hero had insulted him and the duel was with one or the other it matters exceedingly little with whom if a duel was fought and you see we have quite established that i hope it is not true said cecilia my dear that is the christian thing to do said mrs lespel duelling is horrible though those romfreysand the beauchamps were just as bad or nearly colonel richard fought for a friends wife or sister but in these days duelling is incredible it was an inhuman practice always and it is now worseit is a breach of manners i would hope it is not true and you may mean that i have it from lord palmet but i know vivian ducie as well as i know my nephew and if he distinctly mentions an occurrence we may too surely rely on the truth of it he is not a man to spread mischief are you unaware that he met captain beauchamp at the chteau of the marquise the whole story was acted under his eyes he had only to take up his pen generally he favours me with his french gossip i suppose there were circumstances in this affair more suitable to palmet than to me he wrote a description of madame de rouaillout that set palmet strutting about for an hour i have no doubt she must be a very beautiful woman for a frenchwoman not regular features expressive capricious vivian ducie lays great stress on her eyes and eyebrows and i think her hair with a frenchwomans figure that is enough to make men crazy he says her husband deservesbut what will not young men write it is deeply to be regretted that englishmen abroadwomen the same i fearget the continental tone in morals but how captain beauchamp could expect to carry on an election and an intrigue together only a head like his can tell us grancey is in high indignation with him it does not concern the election you can imagine something that man dr shrapnel has done which he says captain beauchamp could have prevented quarrels of men i have instructed palmet to write to vivian ducie for a photograph of madame de rouaillout do you know one has a curiosity to see the face of the woman for whom a man ruins himself but i say again he ought to be married that there may be two victims cecilia said it smiling she was young in suffering and thought as the unseasoned and inexperienced do that a mask is a concealment marriedsettled to have him bound in honour said mrs lespel i had a conversation with him when he was at itchincope and his look and what i know of his father that gallant and handsome colonel richard beauchamp would give one a kind of confidence in him supposing always that he is not struck with one of those deadly passions that are like snakes like magic i positively believe in them i have seen them and if they end they end as if the man were burnt out and was ashes inside as you see mr stukely culbrett all cynicism you would not now suspect him of a passion it is true oh i know it that is what the men go to the women die vera winter died at twenty three caroline ormond was hardly older you know her story everybody knows it the most singular and convincing case was that of lord alfred burnley and lady susan gardiner wife of the general and there was an instance of two similarly afflicteda very rare case most rare they never could meet to part it was almost ludicrous it is now quite certain that they did not conspire to meet at last the absolute fatality became so well understood by the persons immediately interestedyou laugh do i laugh said cecilia we should all know the world my dear and you are a strong head the knowledge is only dangerous for fools and if romance is occasionally ridiculous as i own it can be humdrum i protest is everlastingly so by the by i should have told you that captain beauchamp was one hundred and ninety below captain baskelett when the state of the poll was handed to me the gentleman driving with your father compared the liberals to a parachute cut away from the balloon is he army or navy he is a barrister and some cousin of captain beauchamp i should not have taken him for a beauchamp said mrs lespel and resuming her worldly sagacity i should not like to be in opposition to that young man she seemed to have a fancy unexpressed regarding mr tuckham reminding herself that she might be behind time at itchincope where the guests would be numerous that evening and the song of triumph loud with captain baskelett to lead it she kissed the young lady she had unintentionally been torturing so long and drove away cecilia hoped it was not true her heart sank heavily under the belief that it was she imagined the world abusing nevil and casting him out as those electors of bevisham had just done and impulsively she pleaded for him and became drowned in criminal blushes that forced her to defend herself with a determination not to believe the dreadful story though she continued mitigating the wickedness of it as if by a singular inversion of the fact her clear good sense excused and it was her heart that condemned him she dwelt fondly on an image of the gallant and handsome colonel richard beauchamp conjured up in her mind from the fervour of mrs lespel when speaking of nevils father whose chivalry threw a light on the sons and whose errors condoned by time and with a certain brilliancy playing above them interceded strangely on behalf of nevil chapter xxvii a short sidelook at the election the brisk election day unlike that wearisome but instructive canvass of the englishman in his castle vicatim teaches little and its humours are those of a badly managed christmas pantomime without a columbineold tricks no graces nevertheless things hang together so that it cannot be passed over with a bare statement of the fact of the liberal radical defeat in bevisham the day was not without fruit in time to come for him whom his commiserating admirers of the non voting sex all round the borough called the poor dear commander beauchamps holiday out of england had incited dr shrapnel to break a positive restriction put upon him by jenny denham and actively pursue the canvass and the harangue in person by which conduct as jenny had foreseen many temperate electors were alienated from commander beauchamp though no doubt the radicals were made compact for they may be the skirmishing factionpoor scattered fragments none of them sufficiently downright for the other each outstripping each rudimentary emperors elementary prophets inspired physicians nostrum devouring patients whatsoever you will and still here and there a man shall arise to march them in close columns if they can but trust him in perfect subordination a model even for tories while they keep shoulder to shoulder and to behold such a disciplined body is intoxicating to the eye of a leader accustomed to count ahead upon vapourish abstractions and therefore predisposed to add a couple of noughts to every tangible figure in his grasp thus will a realized fifty become five hundred or five thousand to him the very sense of number is instinct with multiplication in his mind and those years far on in advance which he has been looking to with some fatigue to the optics will suddenly and rollickingly roll up to him at the shutting of his eyes in a temporary fit of gratification so by looking and by not looking he achieves his phantom victoryembraces his cloud dr shrapnel conceived that the day was to be a radical success and he a citizen aged and exercised in reverses so rounded by the habit of them indeed as to tumble and recover himself on the wind of the blow that struck him was it must be acknowledged staggered and cast down when he saw beauchamp drop knowing full well his regiment had polled to a man radicals poll early they would poll at cockcrow if they might they dance on the morning as for their chagrin at noon you will find descriptions of it in the poets inferno they are for lifting our clay soil on a lever of archimedes and are not great mathematicians they have perchance a foot of our earth and perpetually do they seem to be producing an effect perpetually does the whole land roll back on them you have not surely to be reminded that it hurts them the weight is immense dr shrapnel however speedily looked out again on his vast horizon though prostrate he regained his height of stature with no mans help success was but postponed for a generation or two is it so very distant gaze on it with the eye of our parent orb i shall not see it here you may he said to jenny denham and he fortified his outlook by saying to mr lydiard that the tories of our time walked or rather stuck in the track of the radicals of a generation back note then that radicals always marching to the triumph never taste it and for tories it is dead sea fruit ashes in their mouths those liberals those temporisers compromisers a concourse of atoms glorify themselves in the animal satisfaction of sucking the juice of the fruit for which they pay with their souls they have no true cohesion for they have no vital principle mr lydiard being a liberal bade the doctor not to forget the work of the liberals who touched on tory and radical with a pretty steady swing from side to side in the manner of the pendulum of a clock which is the clocks life remember that the liberals are the professors of the practicable in politics a suitable image for time servers dr shrapnel exclaimed intolerant of any mention of the liberals as a party especially in the hour of radical discomfiture when the fact that compromisers should exist exasperates men of a principle your liberals are the band of pyrrhus an army of bastards mercenaries professing the practicable for pay they know us the motive force the tories the resisting power and they feign to aid us in battering our enemy that they may stop the shock we fight they profit what are they stranded whigs crotchetty manufacturers dissentient religionists the half minded the hare hearted the i would and i would notshifty creatures with youths enthusiasm decaying in them and a purse beginning to jingle fearing lest we do too much for safety our enemy not enough for safety they a party let them take action and see we stand a thousand defeats they not one compromise begat them once let them leave sucking the teats of compromise yea once put on the air of men who fight and die for a cause they fly to pieces and whither the fragments chiefly my friend into the tory ranks seriously so i say you between future and past are for the presentbut with the hunted look behind of all godless livers in the present you liberals are tories with foresight radicals without faith you start in fear of toryism on an errand of radicalism and in fear of radicalism to toryism you draw back there is your pendulum swing lectures to this effect were delivered by dr shrapnel throughout the day for his private spiritual solace it may be supposed unto lydiard turbot beauchamp or whomsoever the man chancing to be near him and never did sir oracle wear so extraordinary a garb the favourite missiles of the day were flour bags dr shrapnels uncommon height and his outrageous long brown coat would have been sufficient to attract them without the reputation he had for desiring to subvert everything old english the first discharges gave him the appearance of a thawing snowman drenchings of water turned the flour to ribs of paste and in colour at least he looked legitimately the cooks own spitted hare escaped from her basting ladle elongated on two legs it ensued that whenever he was caught sight of as he walked unconcernedly about the young street professors of the decorative arts were seized with a frenzy to add their share to the whitening of him until he might have been taken for a miller that had gone bodily through his meal the popular cry proclaimed him a ghost and he walked like one impassive blanched and silent amid the uproar of mobs of jolly ruffians for each of whom it was a point of honour to have a shy at old shrapnel clad in this preparation of pie crust he called from time to time at beauchamps hotel and renewed his monologue upon that radical empire in the future which was for ever in the future for the pioneers of men yet not the less their empire do we live in our bodies quoth he replying to his fiery interrogation ay the tories the liberals they lived in their bodies not one syllable of personal consolation did he vouchsafe to beauchamp he did not imagine it could be required by a man who had bathed in the pure springs of radicalism and it should be remarked that beauchamp deceived him by imitating his air of happy abstraction or subordination of the faculties to a distant view comparable to a ships crew in difficulties receiving the report of the man at the masthead beauchamp deceived miss denham too and himself by saying as if he cherished the philosophy of defeat besides the resolution to fight on its only a skirmish lost and that counts for nothing in a battle without end it must be incessant but does incessant battling keep the intellect clear was her memorable answer he glanced at lydiard to indicate that it came of that gentlemans influence upon her mind it was impossible for him to think that women thought the idea of a pretty woman exercising her mind independently and moreover moving him to examine his own made him smile could a sweet faced girl the nearest to rene in grace of manner and in feature of all women known to him originate a sentence that would set him reflecting he was unable to forget it though he allowed her no credit for it on the other hand his admiration of her devotedness to dr shrapnel was unbounded there shone a strictly feminine quality according to the romantic visions of the sex entertained by commander beauchamp and by others who would be the objects of it but not alone the passive virtues were exhibited by jenny denham she proved that she had high courage no remonstrance could restrain dr shrapnel from going out to watch the struggle and she went with him as a matter of course on each occasion her dress bore witness to her running the gauntlet beside him it was not thrown at me purposely she said to quiet beauchamps wrath she saved the doctor from being rough mobbed once when they were surrounded she fastened his arm under hers and by simply moving on with an unswerving air of serenity obtained a passage for him so much did she make herself respected that the gallant rascals became emulous in dexterity to avoid powdering her by loudly execrating any but dead shots at the detested one and certain boys were maltreated for an ardour involving clumsiness a young genius of this horde conceiving in the spirit of the inventors of our improved modern ordnance that it was vain to cast missiles which left a thing standing hurled a stone wrapped in paper it missed its mark jenny said nothing about it the day closed with a comfortable fight or two in by quarters of the town probably to prove that an undaunted english spirit spite of fickle fortune survived in our muscles chapter xxviii touching a young ladys heart and her intellect mr tuckham found his way to dr shrapnels cottage to see his kinsman on the day after the election there was a dinner in honour of the members for bevisham at mount laurels in the evening and he was five minutes behind military time when he entered the restive drawing room and stood before the colonel no sooner had he stated that he had been under the roof of dr shrapnel than his unpunctuality was immediately overlooked in the burst of impatience evoked by the name that pestilent fellow colonel halkett ejaculated i understand he has had the impudence to serve a notice on grancey lespel about encroachments on common land some one described dr shrapnels appearance under the flour storm he deserves anything said the colonel consulting his mantelpiece clock captain baskelett observed i shall have my account to settle with dr shrapnel he spoke like a man having a right to be indignant but excepting that the doctor had bestowed nicknames upon him in a speech at a meeting no one could discover the grounds for it he nodded briefly a radical apple had struck him on the left cheekbone as he performed his triumphal drive through the town and a slight disfigurement remained to which his hand was applied sympathetically at intervals for the cheek bone was prominent in his countenance and did not well bear enlargement and when a fortunate gentleman desiring to be still more fortunate would display the winning amiability of his character distension of one cheek gives him an afflictingly false look of sweetness the bent of his mind nevertheless was to please miss halkett he would be smiling and intimately smiling aware that she had a kind of pitiful sentiment for nevil he smiled over nevilpoor nevil i give you my word miss halkett old nevil was off his head yesterday i daresay he meant to be civil i met him i called out to him good day cousin im afraid youre beaten and says he i fancy youve gained it uncle he didnt know where he was all abroad poor boy uncleto me miss halkett would have accepted the instance for a proof of nevils distraction had not mr seymour austin who sat beside her laughed and said to her i suppose uncle was a chance shot but its equal to a poetic epithet in the light it casts on the story then it seemed to her that nevil had been keenly quick and captain baskeletts impenetrability was a sign of his density her mood was to think nevil beauchamp only too quick too adventurous and restless one that wrecked brilliant gifts in a too general warfare a lover of hazards a hater of laws her eyes flew over captain baskelett as she imagined nevil addressing him as uncle and to put aside a spirit of mockery rising within her she hinted a wish to hear seymour austins opinion of mr tuckham he condensed it in an interrogative tone the other extreme the tory extreme of radical nevil beauchamp she assented mr tuckham was at that moment prophesying the torification of mankind not as the trembling venturesome idea which we cast on doubtful winds but as a ship is launched to ride the waters with huzzas for a thing accomplished mr austin raised his shoulders imperceptibly saying to miss halkett the turn will come to us as to othersand go nothing earthly can escape that revolution we have to meet it with a policy and let it pass with measures carried and our hands washed of some of our party sins i am i hope true to my party but the enthusiasm of party i do not share he is right however when he accuses the nation of cowardice for the last ten years one third of the liberals have been with us at heart and dared not speak and we dared not say what we wished we accepted a compact that satisfied us bothsatisfied us better than when we were opposed by whigsthat is the liberal reigned and we governed and i should add a very clever juggler was our common chief now we have the consequences of hollow peacemaking in a suffrage that bids fair to extend to the wearing of hats and boots for a qualification the moral of it seems to be that cowardice is even worse for nations than for individual men though the consequences come on us more slowly you spoke of party sins miss halkett said incredulously i shall think we are the redoubtable party when we admit the charge are you alluding to the landowners like the land itself they have rich veins in heavy matter for instance the increasing wealth of the country is largely recruiting our ranks and we shall be tempted to mistake numbers for strength and perhaps again be reading conservatism for a special thing of our owna fortification that would be a party sin conservatism is a principle of government the best because the safest for an old country and the guarantee that we do not lose the wisdom of past experience in our struggle with what is doubtful liberalism stakes too much on the chance of gain it is uncomfortably seated on half a dozen horses and it has to feed them too and on varieties of corn yes miss halkett said pausing and i know you would not talk down to me but the use of imagery makes me feel that i am addressed as a primitive intelligence thats the fault of my trying at condensation as the hieroglyphists put an animal for a paragraph i am incorrigible you see but the lecture in prose must be for by and by if you care to have it if you care to read it to me did a single hieroglyphic figure stand for so much i have never deciphered one you have been speaking to me too long in earnest mr austin i accept the admonition though it is wider than the truth have you ever consented to listen to politics before cecilia reddened faintly thinking of him who had taught her to listen and of her previous contempt of the subject a political exposition devoid of imagery was given to her next day on the sunny south western terrace of mount laurels when it was only by mentally translating it into imagery that she could advance a step beside her intellectual guide and she was ashamed of the volatility of her ideas she was constantly comparing mr austin and nevil beauchamp seeing that the senior and the junior both talked to her with the familiar recognition of her understanding which was a compliment without the gross corporeal phrase but now she made another discovery that should have been infinitely more of a compliment and it was bewildering if not repulsive to hercould it be credited mr austin was a firm believer in new and higher destinies for women he went farther than she could concede the right of human speculation to go he was in fact as radical there as nevil beauchamp politically and would not the latter innovator stare perchance frown conservatively at a prospect of woman taking counsel in council with men upon public affairs like the women in the germania mr austin if this time he talked in earnest deemed that englishwomen were on the road to win such a promotion and would win it ultimately he said soberly that he saw more certain indications of the reality of progress among women than any at present shown by men and he was professedly temperate he was but for opening avenues to the means of livelihood for them and leaving it to their strength to conquer the position they might wish to win his belief that they would do so was the revolutionary sign are there points of likeness between radicals and tories she inquired i suspect a cousinship in extremes he answered if one might be present at an argument said she we have only to meet to fly apart as wide as the poles mr austin rejoined but she had not spoken of a particular person to meet him and how then had she betrayed herself she fancied he looked unwontedly arch as he resumed the end of the argument would see us each entrenched in his party suppose me to be telling your radical friend such truisms as that we english have not grown in a day and were not originally made free and equal by decree that we have grown and must continue to grow by the aid and the development of our strength that ours is a fairly legible history and a fair example of the good and the bad in human growth that his landowner and his peasant have no clear case of right and wrong to divide them one being the descendant of strong men the other of weak ones and that the former may sink the latter may risethere is no artificial obstruction and if it is difficult to rise it is easy to sink your radical friend who would bring them to a level by proclamation could not adopt a surer method for destroying the manhood of a people he is for doctoring wooden men and i for not letting our stout english be cut down short as laplanders he would have them in a forcing house and i in open air as hitherto do you perceive a discussion and you apprehend the nature of it we have nerves that is why it is better for men of extremely opposite opinions not to meet i dare say radicalism has a function and so long as it respects the laws i am ready to encounter it where it cannot be avoided pardon my prosing recommend me some hard books to study through the winter said cecilia refreshed by a discourse that touched no emotions as by a febrifuge could nevil reply to it she fancied him replying with that wild head of hiswildest of natures she fancied also that her wish was like mr austins not to meet him she was enjoying a little rest it was not quite generous in mr austin to assume that her radical friend had been prompting her however she thanked him in her heart for the calm he had given her to be able to imagine nevil beauchamp intellectually erratic was a tonic satisfaction to the proud young lady ashamed of a bondage that the bracing and pointing of her critical powers helped her to forget she had always preferred the society of men of mr austins age how old was he her father would know and why was he unmarried a light frost had settled on the hair about his temples his forehead was lightly wrinkled but his mouth and smile and his eyes were lively as a young mans with more in them his age must be something less than fifty o for peace she sighed when he stepped into his carriage and stood up in it to wave adieu to her she thought his face and figure a perfect example of an english gentleman in his prime captain baskelett requested the favour of five minutes of conversation with miss halkett before he followed mr austin on his way to steynham she returned from that colloquy to her father and mr tuckham the colonel looked straight in her face with an elevation of the brows to these points of interrogation she answered with a placid fall of her eyelids he sounded a note of approbation in his throat all the company having departed mr tuckham for the first time spoke of his interview with his kinsman beauchamp yesterday evening he had slurred it as if he had nothing to relate except the finding of an old schoolfellow at dr shrapnels named lydiard a man of ability fool enough to have turned author on no income but that which had appeared to miss halkett a want of observancy became attributable to depth of character on its being clear that he had waited for the departure of the transient guests of the house to pour forth his impressions without holding up his kinsman to public scorn he considered shrapnel mad and beauchamp mad no such grotesque old monster as dr shrapnel had he seen in the course of his travels he had never listened to a madman running loose who was at all up to beauchamp at a loss for words to paint him he said beauchamp seems to have a head like a firework manufactory hes perfectly pyrocephalic for an example of dr shrapnels talk i happened said mr tuckham casually meaning no harm and not supposing i was throwing a lighted match on powder to mention the word providence i found myself immediately confronted by shrapnelovertopped i should say he is a lank giant of about seven feet in height the kind of show man that used to go about in caravans over the country and he began rocking over me like a poplar in a gale and cries out stay there away with that providence can you set a thought on providence not seeking to propitiate it and have you not there the damning proof that you are at the foot of an idolthe old idea about a special providence i suppose these fellows have nothing new but their trimmings and he went on with ay invisible and his arm chopping but an idol an idoli was to think of nought but laws he admitted there might be one above the laws to realize him is to fry the brains in their pan says he and struck his foreheada slap and off he walked down the garden with his hands at his coat tails i venture to say it may be taken for a proof of incipient insanity to care to hear such a fellow twice and beauchamp holds him up for a sage and a prophet he is a very dangerous dog said colonel halkett the best of it isand i take this for the strongest possible proof that beauchamp is madshrapnel stands for an advocate of morality against him ill speak of it mr tuckham nodded to the colonel who said speak out my daughter has been educated for a woman of the world well sir its nothing to offend a young ladys ears beauchamp is for socially enfranchising the sexthat is all quite enough not a whit politically love is to be the test and if a lady ceases to love her husband if she sets her fancy elsewhere shes bound to leave him the laws are tyrannical our objections are cowardly well this dr shrapnel harangued about society and men as well as women are to sacrifice their passions on that altar if he could burlesque himself it would be in coming out as a clericthe old pagan did he convince captain beauchamp the colonel asked manifestly for his daughter to hear the reply which was oh dear no were you able to gather from captain beauchamps remarks whether he is much disappointed by the result of the election said cecilia mr tuckham could tell her only that captain beauchamp was incensed against an elector named tomlinson for withdrawing a promised vote on account of lying rumours and elated by the conquest of a mr carpendike who was reckoned a tough one to drag by the neck the only sane people in the house are a miss denham and the cook i lunched there mr tuckham nodded approvingly lydiard must be mad what hes wasting his time there for i cant guess he says hes engaged there in writing a prefatory essay to a new publication of harry denhams poemswhoever that may be and why wasting it there i dont like it he ought to be earning his bread hell be sure to be borrowing money by and by weve got ten thousand too many fellows writing already and theyve seen a few inches of the world on the continent he can write but its all unproductivedead weight on the country these fellows with their writings he says beauchamps praise of miss denham is quite deserved he tells me that at great peril to herselfand she nearly had her arm broken by a stone he saved shrapnel from rough usage on the election day hum colonel halkett grunted significantly so i thought mr tuckham responded one doesnt want the man to be hurt but he ought to be put down in some way my belief is hes a fire worshipper i warrant i would extinguish him if he came before me hes an incendiary at any rate do you think said cecilia that captain beauchamp is now satisfied with his experience of politics dear me no said mr tuckham its the opening of a campaign hes off to the north after he has been to sussex and bucks hes to be at it all his life one thing he shows common sense in if i heard him once i heard him say half a dozen times that he must have moneyi must have money and so he must if hes to head the radicals he wants to start a newspaper is he likely to get money from his uncle romfrey not for his present plan of campaign colonel halkett enunciated the military word sarcastically lets hope he wont get money he says he must have it who is to stand and deliver then i dont know i only repeat what he says unless he has an eye on my aunt beauchamp and i doubt his luck there if he wants money for political campaigning money colonel halkett ejaculated that word too was in the heart of the heiress nevil must have money could he have said it ordinary men might say or think it inoffensively captain baskelett for instance but not nevil beauchamp captain baskelett as she had conveyed the information to her father for his comfort in the dumb domestic language familiar between them on these occasions had proposed to her unavailingly italian and english gentlemen were in the list of her rejected suitors and hitherto she had seen them come and go one might say from a watchtower in the skies none of them was the ideal she waited for what their feelings were their wishes their aims she had not reflected on they dotted the landscape beneath the unassailable heights busy after their fashion somewhat quaint much like the pigmy husbandmen in the fields were to the giants daughter who had more curiosity than cecilia but nevil beauchamp had compelled her to quit her lofty station pulled her low as the littlest of women that throb and flush at one mans footstep and being well able to read the nature and aspirations of captain baskelett it was with the knowledge of her having been proposed to as heiress of a great fortune that she chanced to hear of nevils resolve to have money if he did say it and was anything likelier was anything unlikelier his foreign love denied to him why now he devoted himself to money moneythe last consideration of a man so single mindedly generous as he but he must have money to pursue his contest but would he forfeit the truth in him for money for any purpose the debate on this question grew as incessant as the thought of him was it not to be supposed that the madness of the pursuit of his political chimaera might change his character she hoped he would not come to mount laurels thinking she should esteem him less if he did knowing that her defence of him on her own behalf against herself depended now on an esteem lodged perhaps in her wilfulness yet if he did not come what an arctic world he came on a november afternoon when the woods glowed and no sun the day was narrowed in mist from earth to heaven a moveless and possessing mist it left space overhead for one wreath of high cloud mixed with touches of washed red upon moist blue still as the mist insensibly passing into it wet webs crossed the grass chill in the feeble light the last flowers of the garden bowed to decay dead leaves red and brown and spotted yellow fell straight around the stems of trees lying thick the glow was universal and the chill cecilia sat sketching the scene at a window of her study on the level of the drawing room and he stood by outside till she saw him he greeted her through the glass then went round to the hall door giving her time to recover if only her heart had been less shaken their meeting was like the features of the day she set her brush to picture characteristic of a season rather than cheerless in tone though it breathed little cheer is there not a pleasure in contemplating that which is characteristic her unfinished sketch recalled him after he had gone he lived in it to startle her again and bid her heart gallop and her cheeks burn the question occurred to her may not one love not craving to be beloved such a love does not sap our pride but supports it increases rather than diminishes our noble self esteem to attain such a love the martyrs writhed up to the crown of saints for a while cecilia revelled in the thought that she could love in this most saint like manner how they fled the sordid ideas of him which accused him of the worlds one passion and were transferred to her own bosom in reproach that she should have imagined them existing in his he talked simply and sweetly of his defeat of time wasted away from the canvass of loss of money and he had little to spare he said the water colour drawing interested him he said he envied her that power of isolation and the eye for beauty in every season she opened a portfolio of mr tuckhams water colour drawings in every clime scenes of europe asia and the americas and he was to be excused for not caring to look through them his remark that they seemed hard and dogged was not so unjust she thought smiling to think of the critic criticized his wonderment that a young man like his lancastrian cousin should be an unmitigated tory was perhaps natural cecilia said yet i cannot discern in him a veneration for aristocracy thats not wanted for modern toryism said nevil one may venerate old families when they show the blood of the founder and are not dead wood i do and i believe the blood of the founder though the man may have been a savage and a robber had in his day finer elements in it than were common but let me say at a meeting that i respect true aristocracy i hear a growl and a hiss beginning why dont judge them hastily because the people have seen the aristocracy opposed to the cause that was weak and only submitting to it when it commanded them to resist at their peril clinging to traditions and not anywhere standing for humanity much more a herd than the people themselves ah well we wont talk of it now i say that is no aristocracy if it does not head the people in virtuemilitary political national i mean the qualities required by the times for leadership i wont bother you with my ideas now i love to see you paint brush in hand her brush trembled on the illumination of a scarlet maple in this country we were not originally made free and equal by decree nevil no said he and i cast no blame on our farthest ancestors it struck her that this might be an outline of a reply to mr austin so you have been thinking over it he asked not to conclusions she said trying to retain in her mind the evanescent suggestiveness of his previous remark and vexed to find herself upon nothing but a devious phosphorescent trail there her forehead betrayed the unwonted mental action he cried out for pardon what right have i to bother you i see it annoys you the truth is i came for peace i think of you when they talk of english homes she felt then that he was comparing her home with another a foreign home after he had gone she felt that there had been a comparison of two persons she remembered one of his observations few women seem to have courage when his look at her was for an instant one of scrutiny or calculation under a look like that we perceive that we are being weighed she had no clue to tell her what it signified glorious and solely glorious love that has risen above emotion quite independent of craving that is to be the bird of upper air poised on his wings it is a home in the sky cecilia took possession of it systematically not questioning whether it would last like one who is too enamoured of the habitation to object to be a tenant at will if it was cold it was in recompense immeasurably lofty a star girdled place and dwelling in it she could avow to herself the secret which was now working self deception and still preserve her pride unwounded her womanly pride she would have said in vindication of it but cecilia halketts pride went far beyond the merely womanly thus she was assisted to endure a journey down to wales where nevil would surely not be she passed a winter without seeing him she returned to mount laurels from london at easter and went on a visit to steynham and back to london having sight of him nowhere still firm in the thought that she loved ethereally to bless forgive direct encourage pray for him impersonally she read certain speeches delivered by nevil at assemblies of liberals or radicals which were reported in papers in the easy irony of the style of here and there a sentence here and there a summary salient quotations interspersed with running abstracts a style terrible to friends of the speaker so reported overwhelming if they differ in opinion yet her charity was a match for it she was obliged to have recourse to charity it should be observed her father drew her attention to the spectacle of r c s nevil beauchamp commander rn fighting those reporters with letters in the newspapers and the dry editorial comment flanked by three stars on the left he was shocked to see a gentleman writing such letters to the papers but one thing hangs on another said he but you seem angry with nevil papa said she i do hate a turbulent restless fellow my dear the colonel burst out papa he has really been unfairly reported cecilia laid three privately printed full reports of commander beauchamps speeches very carefully corrected by him before her father he suffered his eye to run down a page is it possible you read thisthis trashdangerous folly i call it cecilias reply in the interests of justice i do was meant to express her pure impartiality by a toleration of what is detested we expose ourselves to the keenness of an adverse mind does he write to you too said the colonel she answered oh no i am not a politician he seems to have expected you to read those tracts of his though yes i think he would convert me if he could said cecilia though youre not a politician he relies on the views he delivers in public rather than on writing to persuade that was my meaning papa very well said the colonel not caring to show his anxiety mr tuckham dined with them frequently in london this gentleman betrayed his accomplishments one by one he sketched and was no artist he planted and was no gardener he touched the piano neatly and was no musician he sang and he had no voice apparently he tried his hand at anything for the privilege of speaking decisively upon all things he accompanied the colonel and his daughter on a days expedition to mrs beauchamp on the upper thames and they agreed that he shone to great advantage in her society mrs beauchamp said she had seen her great nephew nevil but without a comment on his conduct or his person grave silence reflecting on it cecilia grew indignant at the thought that mr tuckham might have been acting a sinister part mrs beauchamp alluded to a newspaper article of her favourite great nephew blackburn written cecilia knew through her father to controvert some tremendous proposition of nevils that was writing mrs beauchamp said i am not in the habit of fearing a conflict so long as we have stout defenders i rather like it she said the colonel entertained mrs beauchamp while mr tuckham led miss halkett over the garden cecilia considered that his remarks upon nevil were insolent seriously miss halkett to take him at his best he is a very good fellow i dont doubt i am told so and a capital fellow among men a good friend and not a bad boon fellow and for that matter the smoking room is a better test than the drawing room all he wants is emphatically schoolschoolschool i have recommended the simple iteration of that one word in answer to him at his meetings and the printing of it as a foot note to his letters cecilias combative spirit precipitated her to say i hear the mob in it shouting captain beauchamp down ay said mr tuckham it would be setting the mob to shout wisely at last the mob is a wild beast then we should hear wisdom coming out of the mouth of the wild beast men have the phrase fair play fair play i say is not applicable to a man who deliberately goes about to stir the wild beast he is laughed at plucked hustled and robbed by those who deafen him with their plauditstheir roars did you see his advertisement of a great coat lost at some rapscallion gathering down in the north near my part of the country a great coat and a packet of letters he offers a reward of l but thats honest robbery compared with the bleeding hell get do you know mr seymour austin miss halkett asked him i met him once at your fathers table why i think you would like to listen to him yes my fault is not listening enough said mr tuckham he was capable of receiving correction her father told her he was indebted to mr tuckham past payment in coin for services rendered by him on a trying occasion among the miners in wales during the first spring month i dare say he can speak effectively to miners cecilia said outvying the contemptuous young man in superciliousness but with effort and not with satisfaction she left london in july two days before her father could be induced to return to mount laurels feverish and strangely subject to caprices now she chose the longer way round by sussex and alighted at the station near steynham to call on mrs culling whom she knew to be at the hall preparing it for mr romfreys occupation in imitation of her father she was rosamunds fast friend though she had never quite realized her position and did not thoroughly understand her would it not please her father to hear that she had chosen the tedious route for the purpose of visiting this lady whose champion he was so she went to steynham and for hours she heard talk of no one of nothing but her friend nevil cecilia was on her guard against rosamunds defence of his conduct in france the declaration that there had been no misbehaviour at all could not be accepted but the news of mr romfreys having installed nevil in holdesbury to manage that property and of his having mooted to her father the question of an alliance between her and nevil was wonderful rosamund could not say what answer her father had made hardly favourable cecilia supposed since he had not spoken of the circumstance to her but mr romfreys influence with him would certainly be powerful it was to be assumed also that nevil had been consulted by his uncle rosamund said full heartedly that this alliance had for years been her lifes desire and then she let the matter pass nor did she once loop at cecilia searchingly or seem to wish to probe her cecilia disagreed with rosamund on an insignificant point in relation to something mr romfrey and captain baskelett had done and as far as she could recollect subsequently there was a packet of letters or a pocket book containing letters of nevils which he had lost and which had been forwarded to mr romfrey for the pocket book was originally his and his address was printed inside but among these letters was one from dr shrapnel to nevil a letter so horrible that rosamund frowned at the reminiscence of it holding it to be too horrible for the quotation of a sentence she owned she had forgotten any three consecutive words her known dislike of captain baskelett however was insufficient to make her see that it was unjustifiable in him to run about london reading it with comments of the cruellest rosamunds greater detestation of dr shrapnel blinded her to the offence committed by the man she would otherwise have been very ready to scorn so small did the circumstance appear to cecilia notwithstanding her gentle opposition at the time she listened to it that she never thought of mentioning it to her father and only remembered it when captain baskelett with lord palmet in his company presented himself at mount laurels and proposed to the colonel to read to him a letter from that scoundrelly old shrapnel to nevil beauchamp upon women wives thrones republics british loyalty et cteraan et ctera that rolled a series of tremendous reverberations down the list of all things held precious by freeborn englishmen she would have prevented the reading but the colonel would have it read on said he mr romfrey saw no harm captain baskelett held up dr shrapnels letter to commander beauchamp at about half a yards distance on the level of his chin as a big chested singer in a concert room holds his music scroll chapter xxix the epistle of dr shrapnel to commander beauchamp before we give ear to the recital of dr shrapnels letter to his pupil in politics by the mouth of captain baskelett it is necessary to defend this gentleman as he would handsomely have defended himself from the charge that he entertained ultimate designs in regard to the really abominable scrawl which was like a childs drawing of ocean with here and there a sail capsized and excited his disgust almost as much as did the contents his great indignation he was prepared to read it and stood blown out for the task but it was temporarily too much for him my dear colonel look at it i entreat you he said handing the letter for exhibition after fixing his eye glass and dropping it in repulsion the common sentiment of mankind is offended by heterodoxy in mean attire for there we see the self convicted villainthe criminal caught in the act we try it and convict it by instinct without the ceremony of a jury and so thoroughly aware of our promptitude in this respect has our arch enemy become since his mediaeval disgraces that his particular advice to his followers is now to scrupulously copy the world in externals never to appear poorly clothed nor to impart deceptive communications in bad handwriting we can tell black from white and our sagacity has taught him a lesson colonel halkett glanced at the detestable penmanship lord palmet did the same and cried why its worse than mine cecilia had protested against the reading of the letter and she declined to look at the writing she was entreated adjured to look in captain baskeletts peculiarly pursuing fashion a nay but you shall that she had been subjected to previously and would have consented to run like a schoolgirl to escape from to resume the defence of him he was a man incapable of forming plots because his head would not hold them he was an impulsive man who could impale a character of either sex by narrating fables touching persons of whom he thought lightly and that being done he was devoid of malice unless by chance his feelings or his interests were so aggrieved that his original haphazard impulse was bent to embrace new circumstances and be the parent of a line of successive impulses in the main resembling an extremely far sighted plot whereat he gazed back with fondness all the while protesting sincerely his perfect innocence of anything of the kind circumstances will often interwind with the moods of simply irritated men in the present instance he could just perceive what might immediately come of his reading out of this atrocious epistle wherein nevil beauchamp was displayed the dangling puppet of a mountebank wire pulley infidel agitator leveller and scoundrel cognizant of mr romfreys overtures to colonel halkett he traced them to that scheming woman in the house at steynham and he was of opinion that it was a friendly and good thing to do to let the old colonel and cissy halkett know mr nevil through a bit of his correspondence this then was a matter of business and duty that furnished an excuse for his going out of his way to call at mount laurels on the old familiar footing so as not to alarm the heiress a warrior accustomed to wear the burnished breastplates between london and windsor has we know more need to withstand than to discharge the shafts of amorous passion he is indeed as an object of beauty notoriously compelled to be of the fair sex in his tactics and must practise the arts and whims of nymphs to preserve himself and no doubt it was the case with the famous captain baskelett in whose mind sweet ladies held the place that the pensive politician gives to the masses dreadful in their hatred almost as dreadful in their affection but an heiress is a distinct species among women he hungered for the heiress his elevation to parliament made him regard her as both the ornament and the prop of his position and it should be added that his pride all the habits of thought of a conqueror of women had been shocked by that stupefying rejection of him which cecilia had intimated to her father with the mere lowering of her eyelids conceive the highest bidder at an auction hearing the article announce that it will not have him captain baskelett talked of it everywhere for a month or sothe girl could not know her own mind for she suited him exactly and he requested the world to partake of his astonishment chronicles of the season in london informed him that he was not the only fellow to whom the gates were shut she could hardly be thinking of nevil however let the epistle be read now for the shrapnel shot he nodded finally to colonel halkett expanded his bosom or natural cuirass as before mentioned and was vocable above the common pitch my brave beauchampon with your mission and never a summing of results in hand nor thirst for prospects nor counting upon harvests for seed sown in faith day by day is the nightly harvest of the soul and with the soul we work with the soul we see captain baskelett intervened ahem i beg to observe that this delectable rubbish is underlined by old nevils pencil he promised to do a little roaring whenever it occurred and continued with ghastly false accentuation an intermittent sprightliness and depression of tone in the wrong places the soul et ctera here we are desires to realize our gains are akin to the passion of usury these are tricks of the usurer to grasp his gold in act and imagination have none of them work at the people at them remarkmoveless do they seem to you why so is the earth to the sowing husbandman and though we cannot forecast a reaping season we have in history durable testification that our seasons come in the souls of men yea as a planet that we have set in motion and faster and faster are we spinning it and firmer and firmer shall we set it to regularity of revolution that means lifeshrapnel roars you will have nevil in a minuterecognize that now we have bare life at best for the bulk of men the saurian lizards broad back soaking and roasting in primeval slime or say in the so called teachers of men as much of life as pricks the frog in march to stir and yawn and up on a flaccid leap that rolls him over some three inches nearer to the ditchwater besought by his instinct i ask you did you ever hear the flaccid frog but on we go professors prophets masters each hitherto has had his creed and system to offer good mayhap for the term and each has put it forth for the truth everlasting to drive the dagger to the heart of time and put the axe to human growththat one circle of wisdom issuing of the experience and needs of their day should act the despot over all other circles for everso where at first light shone to light the yawning frog to his wet ditch there with the necessitated revolution of mens minds in the course of ages darkness radiates thats old nevil upon my honour i havent a notion of what it all means and i dont believe the old rascal shrapnel has himself and pray be patient my dear colonel you will find him practical presently ill skip if you tell me to darkness radiates does it the creed that rose in heaven sets below and where we had an angel we have claw feet and fangs ask how that is the creed is much what it was when the followers diverged it from the founder but humanity is not where it was when that creed was food and guidance creeds will not die not fighting we cannot root them up out of us without blood he threatens bloodours my beauchamp is the belief that humanity advances beyond the limits of creeds is to be tied to none we reverence the master in his teachings we behold the limits of him in his creed and that is not his work we truly are his disciples who see how far it was in him to do service not they that made of his creed a strait jacket for humanity so in our prayers we dedicate the world to god not calling him great for a title noshowing him we know him great in a limitless world lord of a truth we tend to have not grasped i say prayer is good i counsel it to you again and again in joy in sickness of heart the infidel will not pray the creed slave prays to the image in his box ive had enough colonel halkett ejaculated we captain baskelett put out his hand for silence with an ineffable look of entreaty for here was shrapnels hypocrisy in full bloom we make prayer a part of us praying for no gifts no interventions through the faith in prayer opening the soul to the undiscerned and take this my beauchamp for the good in prayer that it makes us repose on the unknown with confidence makes us flexible to change makes us ready for revolutionfor life then he who has the fountain of prayer in him will not complain of hazards prayer is the recognition of laws the souls exercise and source of strength its thread of conjunction with them prayer for an object is the cajolery of an idol the resource of superstition there you misread it beauchamp we that fight the living world must have the universal for succour of the truth in it cast forth the soul in prayer you meet the effluence of the outer truth you join with the creative elements giving breath to you and that crust of habit which is the souls tomb and custom the souls tyrant and pride our volcano peak that sinks us in a crater and fear which plucks the feathers from the wings of the soul and sits it naked and shivering in a vault where the passing of a common hodmans foot above sounds like the king of terrors comingyou are free of them you live in the day and for the future by this exercise and discipline of the souls faith me it keeps young everlastingly like the fountain of i say i cannot sit and hear any more of it exclaimed the colonel chafing out of patience lord palmet said to miss halkett isnt it like what we used to remember of a sermon cecilia waited for her father to break away but captain baskelett had undertaken to skip and was murmuring in sing song some of the phrases that warned him off historybible of humanity permanencyenthusiasts dreamdespots aimclutch of dead mens fingers in live flesh man animal man angel man rooted man winged really all this is too bad ah here we are at them with outspeaking beauchamp here we are colonel and you will tell me whether you think it treasonable or not at them et ctera we have signed no convention to respect theirhe speaks of englishmen colonel halketttheir passive idolatries a people with whom a mute conformity is as good as worship but a word of dissent holds you up to execration and only for the freedom won in foregone days their hate would be active as we have them in their present stageold nevils markwe are not parties to the tacit agreement to fill our mouths and shut our eyes we speak because it is better they be roused to lapidate us than soused in their sty with none to let them hear they live like swine craving only not to be disturbed at the trough the religion of this vast english middle class ruling the land is comfort it is their central thought their idea of necessity their sole aim whatsoever ministers to comfort seems to belong to it pretends to support it they yield their passive worship to whatsoever alarms it they join to crush there you get at their point of unity they will pay for the security of comfort calling it national worship or national defence if too much money is not subtracted from the means of individual comfort if too much foresight is not demanded for the comfort of their brains have at them there speak moveless as you find them they are not yet all gross clay and i say again the true word spoken has its chance of somewhere alighting and striking root look not to that seeds perish in nature good men fail look to the truth in you and deliver it with no afterthought of hope for hope is dogged by dread we give our courage as hostage for the fulfilment of what we hope meditate on that transaction hope is for boys and girls to whom nature is kind for men to hope is to tremble let prayerthe souls overflow the hearts resignationsupplant it pardon colonel i forgot to roar but old nevil marks all down that page for encomium said captain baskelett oh here we are english loyalty is the subject now pray attend to this colonel shrapnel communicates to beauchamp that if ten beauchamps were spouting over the country without intermission he might condescend to hope so onto british loyalty we are so long as our sovereigns are well conducted persons and we cannot unseat themobserve he is eminently explicit the old traitorwe are to submit to the outward forms of respect but we are frankly to say we are republicans he has the impudence to swear that england is a republican country and calls our thoroughgoing loyaltyyours and mine coloneldisloyalty hark where kings lead it is to be supposed they are wanted service is the noble office on earth and where kings do service let them take the first honours of the state buthark at thisthe english middle class which has absorbed the upper and despises when it is not quaking before it the lower will have nothing above it but a ricketty ornament like that you see on a confectioners twelfth cake the man deserves hanging said colonel halkett further my dear colonel and nevil marks it pretty much throughout this loyalty smacks of a terrible perfidy pass the lords and squires they are old trees old foundations or joined to them whether old or new they naturally apprehend dislocation when a wind blows a river rises or a man speaksthat comes of age or aping age their hearts are in their holdings for the loyalty of the rest of the land it is the shopkeepers loyalty which is to be computed by the exact annual sum of his net profits it is now at high tide it will last with the prosperity of our commercethe insolent old vagabondlet commercial disasters come on us and what of the loyalty now paying its hundreds of thousands and howling down questioners in a day of bankruptcies how much would you bid for the loyalty of a class shivering under deprivation of luxuries with its god comfort beggared ay my beauchampthe most offensive thing to me is that my beauchamp but old nevil has evidently given himself up hand and foot to this ruffianay when you reflect that fear of the so called rabble ie the people the unmoneyed class which knows not comfort tastes not of luxuries is the main component of their noisy frigid loyalty and that the people are not with them but against and yet that the people might be won by visible forthright kingly service to a loyalty outdoing theirs as the sun the moon ay that the people verily thirst to love and reverence and that their love is the only love worth having because it is disinterested love and endures and takes heat in adversityreflect on it and wonder at the inversion of things so with a church it lives if it is at home with the poor in the arms of enriched shopkeepers it rots goes to decay in vestmentsvestments flakes of mummy wraps for it or else they use it for one of their political truncheonsto awe the ignorant masses i quote them so not much ahead of ancient egyptians in spirituality or in priestcraft they call it statesmanship o for a word for it let palsy and cunning go to form a word deadmanship i call itto quote my uncle the baron this is lunatic dribbleparsons and princes are happy with the homage of this huge passive fleshpot class it is enough for them why not the taxes are paid and the tithes whilst commercial prosperity lasts colonel halkett threw his arms aloft meanwhile note this the people are the power to come oppressed unprotected abandoned left to the ebb and flow of the tides of the market now taken on to work now cast off to starve committed to the shifting laws of demand and supply slaves of capitalthe whited name for old accursed mammon and of all the ranked and black uniformed host no pastor to come out of the association of shepherds and proclaim before heaven and man the primary claim of their cause they are i say the power worth the seduction of by another power not mighty in england now and likely in time to set up yet another power not existing in england now what if a passive comfortable clergy hand them over to men on the models of irish pastors who will succour console enfold champion them what if when they have learnt to use their majority sick of deceptions and the endless pulling of interests they raise one representative to force the current of action with an authority as little fictitious as their preponderance of numbers the despot and the priest there i see our danger beauchamp you and i and some dozen labour to tie and knot them to manliness we are few they are many and weak rome offers them real comfort in return for their mites in coin andpoor souls mites in conscience many of them a tyrant offers them to be directly their friend ask beauchamp why they should not have comfort for pay as well as the big round captain baskelett stopped and laid the letter out for colonel halkett to read an unmentionable word shamelessly marked by nevils pencilbelly class ask too whether the comfort they wish for is not approaching divine compared with the stagnant fleshliness of that fat shopkeepers comfort warn the people of this ay warn the clergy it is not only the poor that are caught by ranters endeavour to make those accommodating shepherds understand that they stand a chance of losing rich as well as poor it should awaken them the helpless poor and the uneasy rich are alike open to the seductions of romish priests and intoxicated ranters i say so it will be if that band of forty thousand go on slumbering and nodding they walk in a dream the flesh is a dream the soul only is life now for you colonel no extension of the armyno a thousand times no let india go then good for india that we hold india ay good but not at such a cost as an extra tax or compulsory service of our working man if india is to be held for the good of india throw open india to the civilized nations that they help us in a task that overstrains us at present india means utter perversion of the policy of england adrift india rather than england red coated we dissent beauchamp for by and by that is captain baskelett explained by and by shrapnel will have old nevil fast enough is there more of it said colonel halkett flapping his forehead for coolness the impudence of this dog in presuming to talk about indiaeh colonel only a paragraph or two more i skip a lot ah here we are captain baskelett read to himself and laughed in derision he calls our constitution a compact unsigned by the larger number involved in it whats this a band of dealers in fleshpottery do you detect a gleam of sense he underscores it then he comes to this captain baskelett requested colonel halkett to read for himself the stench of the trail of ego in our history the colonel perused it with an unsavoury expression of his features and jumped up oddly mr romfrey thought this rather clever said captain baskelett and read rapidly trace the course of ego for them first the king who conquers and can govern in his egoism he dubs him holy his family is of a selected blood he makes the crown hereditaryego son by son the shame of egoism increases valour abates hereditary crown no hereditary qualities the barons rise they in turn hold sway and for their orderego the traders overturn them each class rides the classes under it while it can it is egoego the fountain cry origin sole source of war then death to ego i say if those traders had ruled for other than ego power might have rested with them on broad basis enough to carry us forward for centuries the workmen have ever been too anxious to be ruled now comes on the workmans era numbers win in the end proof of small wisdom in the world anyhow with numbers there is rough natures wisdom and justice with numbers ego is inter dependent and dispersed it is universalized yet these may require correctives if so they will have it in a series of despots and revolutions that toss mix and bind the classes together despots revolutions panting alternations of the quickened heart of humanity marked by our friend nevil in notes of admiration mad as the writer groaned colonel halkett never in my life have i heard such stuff stay colonel heres shrapnel defending morality and society said captain baskelett colonel halkett vowed he was under no penal law to listen and would not but captain baskelett persuaded him yes here it is i give you my word apparently old nevil has been standing up for every mans right to run away with yes really i give you my word and here we have shrapnel insisting on respect for the marriage laws do hear this here it is in black and whitesociety is our one tangible gain our one roofing and flooring in a world of most uncertain structures built on morasses toward the laws that support it men hopeful of progress give their adhesion if it is martyrdom what then let the martyrdom be contumacy is animalism and attend to me says shrapnel the truer the love the readier for sacrifice a thousand times yes rebellion against society and advocacy of humanity run counter tell me society is the whited sepulchre that it is blotched hideous hollow and i say add not another disfigurement to it add to the purification of it and you if you answer what can only one i say that is the animals answer and applies also to politics where the question what can one put in the relapsing tone shows the country decaying in the individual society is the protection of the weaker therefore a shield of women who are our temple of civilization to be kept sacred and he that loves a woman will assuredly esteem and pity her sex and not drag her down for another example of their frailty fight this out within you but you are right colonel we have had sufficient i shall be getting a democratic orators twang or a crazy parsons if i go on much further he covers thirty two pages of letter paper the conclusion isjenny sends you her compliments respects and best wishes and hopes she may see you before she goes to her friend clara sherwin and the general sherwin why general sherwins a perfect gentleman colonel halkett interjected and lord palmet caught the other name jenny thats miss denham jenny denham an amazingly pretty girl beautiful thick brown hair real hazel eyes and walks like a yacht before the wind perhaps colonel jenny accounts for the defence of society said captain baskelett i have no doubt shrapnel has a scheme for jenny the old communist and socialist he folded up the letter a curious composition is it not miss halkett cecilia was thinking that he tempted her to be the apologist of even such a letter one likes to know the worst and whats possible said the colonel after captain baskelett had gone colonel halkett persisted in talking of the letter and would have impressed on his daughter that the person to whom the letter was addressed must be partly responsible for the contents of it cecilia put on the argumentative air of a court of equity to discuss the point with him then you defend that letter he cried oh no she did not defend the letter she thought it wicked and senseless but said she the superior strength of men to women seems to me to come from their examining all subjects shrinking from none at least i should not condemn nevil on account of his correspondence we shall see said her father sighing rather heavily i must have a talk with mr romfrey about that letter chapter xxx the baiting of dr shrapnel captain baskelett went down from mount laurels to bevisham to arrange for the giving of a dinner to certain of his chief supporters in the borough that they might know he was not obliged literally to sit in parliament in order to pay a close attention to their affairs he had not distinguished himself by a speech during the session but he had stored a political precept or two in his memory and as he told lord palmet he thought a dinner was due to his villains the way to manage your englishman palmet is to dine him as the dinner would decidedly be dull he insisted on having lord palmets company they crossed over to the yachting island where portions of the letter of commander beauchamps correspondent were read at the club under the verandah and the question put whether a man who held those opinions had a right to wear his uniform the letter was transmitted to steynham in time to be consigned to the pocket book before beauchamp arrived there on one of his rare visits mr romfrey handed him the pocketbook with the frank declaration that he had read shrapnels letter all is fair in war sir beauchamp quoted him ambiguously the thieves had amused mr romfrey by their scrupulous honesty in returning what was useless to them while reserving the coat but subsequently seeing the advertized reward they had written to claim it and according to rosamund culling he had been so tickled that he had deigned to reply to them very briefly but very comically speaking of the matter with her beauchamp said so greatly was he infatuated with the dangerous man that the reading of a letter of dr shrapnels could do nothing but good to any reflecting human creature he admitted that as the lost pocket book was addressed to mr romfrey it might have been by mistake that he had opened it and read the topmost letter lying open but he pressed rosamund to say whether that one only had been read only dr shrapnels letter rosamund affirmed the letter from normandy was untouched by him untouched by anybody unopened nevil you look incredulous not if i have your word maam he glanced somewhat contemptuously at his uncle everards anachronistic notions of what was fair in war to prove to him mr romfreys affectionate interest in his fortunes rosamund mentioned the overtures which had been made to colonel halkett for a nuptial alliance between the two houses and she said your uncle everard was completely won by your manly way of taking his opposition to you in bevisham he pays for captain baskelett but you and your fortunes are nearest his heart nevil beauchamp hung silent his first remark was yes i want money i must have money by degrees he seemed to warm to some sense of gratitude it was kind of the baron he said he has a great affection for you nevil though you know he spares no one who chooses to be antagonistic all that is over but do you not second him nevil you admire her you are not adverse beauchamp signified the horrid intermixture of yes and no frowned in pain of mind and walked up and down theres no living woman i admire so much she has refused the highest matches i hold her in every way incomparable she tries to understand your political ideas if she cannot quite sympathize with them nevil and consider how hard it is for a young english lady bred in refinement to understand such things yes beauchamp nodded yes well mores the pity for me ah nevil that fatal rene maam i acquit you of any suspicion of your having read her letter in this pocket book she wishes me to marry you would have seen it written here she wishes it fly clipped wing murmured rosamund and purposely sent a buzz into her ears to shut out his extravagant talk of renes friendly wishes how is it you women will not believe in the sincerity of a woman he exclaimed nevil i am not alluding to the damage done to your election to my candidature maam you mean those rumours those lies of the enemy tell me how i could suppose you were alluding to them you bring them forward now to justify your charge of fatal against her she has one fault she wants courage she has none other not one that is not excuseable we wont speak of france what did her father say colonel halkett i do not know he and his daughter come here next week and the colonel will expect to meet you here that does not look like so positive an objection to you to me personally no said beauchamp but mr romfrey has not told me that i am to meet them perhaps he has not thought it worth while it is not his way he has asked you to come you and miss halkett will be left to yourselves her father assured mr romfrey that he should not go beyond advising her his advice might not be exactly favourable to you at present but if you sued and she acceptedand she would i am convinced she would she was here with me talking of you a whole afternoon and i have eyesthen he would not oppose the match and then i should see you settled the husband of the handsomest wife and richest heiress in england a vision of cecilia swam before him gracious in stateliness two weeks back renes expression of a wish that he would marry had seemed to him an idle sentence in a letter breathing of her own intolerable situation the marquis had been struck down by illness what if she were to be soon suddenly free but rene could not be looking to freedom otherwise she never would have written the wish for him to marry she wrote perhaps hearing temptation whisper perhaps wishing to save herself and him by the aid of a tie that would bring his honour into play and fix his loyalty he remembered dr shrapnels written words rebellion against society and advocacy of humanity run counter they had a stronger effect on him than when he was ignorant of his uncle everards plan to match him with cecilia he took refuge from them in the image of that beautiful desolate rene born to be beloved now wasted worse than trodden under footperverted a life that looked to him for direction and resuscitation she was as good as dead in her marriage it was impossible for him ever to think of rene without the surprising thrill of his enchantment with her and tender pity that drew her closer to him by darkening her brightness still a man may love his wife a wife like cecilia was not to be imagined coldly let the knot once be tied it would not be regretted could not be hers was a character and hers a smile firmly assuring him of that he told mr romfrey that he should be glad to meet colonel halkett and cecilia business called him to holdesbury thence he betook himself to dr shrapnels cottage to say farewell to jenny denham previous to her departure for switzerland with her friend clara sherwin she had never seen a snow mountain and it was pleasant to him to observe in her eyes which he had known weighing and balancing intellectual questions more than he quite liked a childlike effort to conjure in imagination the glories of the alps she appeared very happy only a little anxious about leaving dr shrapnel with no one to take care of him for a whole month beauchamp promised he would run over to him from holdesbury only an hour by rail as often as he could he envied her the sight of the alps he said and tried to give her an idea of them from which he broke off to boast of a famous little jersey bull that he had won from a rival an american deeply in love with the bull cutting him out by telegraph by just five minutes the latter had examined the bull in the island and had passed on to paris not suspecting there would be haste to sell him beauchamp seeing the bull advertized took him on trust galloped to the nearest telegraph station forthwith and so obtained possession of him and the bull was now shipped on the voyage but for this precious bull however and other business he would have been able to spend almost the entire month with dr shrapnel he said regretfully miss denham on the contrary did not regret his active occupation the story of his rush from the breakfast table to the stables and gallop away to the station while the american quaker gentleman soberly paced down a street in paris on the same errand in invisible rivalry touched her risible fancy she was especially pleased to think of him living in harmony with his unclethat strange lofty powerful man who by plot or by violence punished opposition to his will but who must be kind at heart as well as forethoughtful of his nephews good the assurance of it being that when the conflict was at an end he had immediately installed him as manager of one of his estates to give his energy play and make him practically useful the day before she left home was passed by the three in botanizing some miles distant from bevisham over sand country marsh and meadow dr shrapnel deep in the science on one side of her and beauchamp requiring instruction in the names and properties of every plant and simple on the other it was a day of summer sweetness gentle laughter conversation and the happiest homeliness the politicians uttered barely a syllable of politics the dinner basket was emptied heartily to make way for herb and flower and at night the expedition homeward was crowned with stars along a road refreshed by mid day thunder showers and smelling of the rain in the dust past meadows keenly scenting gardens giving out their innermost balm and odour late at night they drank tea in jennys own garden they separated a little after two in the morning when the faded western light still lay warm on a bow of sky and on the level of the east it quickened jenny felt sure she should long for that yesterday when she was among foreign scenes even among high alpsthose mysterious eminences which seemed in her imagination to know of heaven and have the dawn of a new life for her beyond their peaks her last words when stepping into the railway carriage were to beauchamp will you take care of him she flung her arms round dr shrapnels neck and gazed at him under troubled eyelids which seemed to be passing in review every vision of possible harm that might come to him during her absence and so she continued gazing and at no one but dr shrapnel until the bend of the line cut him from her sight beauchamp was a very secondary person on that occasion and he was unused to being so in the society of womenunused to find himself entirely eclipsed by their interest in another he speculated on it wondering at her concentrated fervency for he had not supposed her to possess much warmth after she was fairly off on her journey dr shrapnel mentioned to beauchamp a case of a steynham poacher whom he had thought it his duty to supply with means of defence it was a common poaching case beauchamp was not surprised that mr romfrey and dr shrapnel should come to a collision the marvel was that it had never occurred before and beauchamp said at once oh my uncle mr romfrey would rather see them stand their ground than not he was disposed to think well of his uncle the jersey bull called him away to holdesbury captain baskelett heard of this poaching case at steynham where he had to appear in person when he was in want of cheques and the bevisham dinner furnished an excuse for demanding one he would have preferred a positive sum annually mr romfrey however though he wrote his cheques out like the lord he was by nature exacted the request for them a system that kept the gallant gentleman on his good behaviour probably at a lower cost than the regular stipend in handing the cheque to cecil baskelett mr romfrey spoke of a poacher of an old poaching family called the dicketts who wanted punishment and was to have it but mr romfreys local lawyer had informed him that the man shrapnel was as usual supplying the means of defence for his own part mr romfrey said he had no objection to one rascals backing another and shrapnel might hit his hardest only perhaps nevil might somehow get mixed up in it and nevil was going on quietly nowhe had in fact just done capitally in lassoing with a shot of the telegraph a splendid little jersey bull that a yankee was after and on the whole it was best to try to keep him quiet for he was mad about that man shrapnel shrapnel was his joss and if legal knocks came of this business nevil might be thinking of interfering or he and i may be getting to exchange a lot of shindy letters mr romfrey said tell him i take shrapnel just like any other man and dont want to hear apologies and i dont mix him up in it tell him if he likes to have an explanation from me ill give it him when he comes here you can run over to holdesbury the morning after your dinner captain baskelett said he would go he was pleased with his cheque at the time but hearing subsequently that nevil was coming to steynham to meet colonel halkett and his daughter he became displeased considering it a very silly commission the more he thought of it the more ridiculous and unworthy it appeared he asked himself and lord palmet also why he should have to go to nevil at holdesbury to tell him of circumstances that he would hear of two or three days later at steynham there was no sense in it the only conclusion for him was that the scheming woman culling had determined to bring down every man concerned in the bevisham election and particularly mr romfrey on his knees before nevil holdesbury had been placed at his disposal and the use of the house in london which latter would have been extremely serviceable to cecil as a place of dinners to the parliament of great britain in lieu of the speech making generally expected of members and not so effectively performed one would think the baron had grown afraid of old nevil he had spoken as if he were cecil railed unreservedly to lord palmet against that woman mistress culling as it pleased him to term her and who could be offended by his calling her so his fine wit revelled in bestowing titles that were at once batteries directed upon persons he hated and entrenchments for himself at four oclock on a sultry afternoon he sat at table with his bevisham supporters and pledged them correspondingly in english hotel champagne sherry and claret at seven he was rid of them but parched and heated as he deserved to be he owned for drinking the poison it would be a good subject for parliament if he could get it up he reflected and now said he to palmet we might be crossing over to the club if i hadnt to go about that stupid business to holdesbury to morrow morning we shall miss the race or at least the start the idea struck him ten to one old nevils with shrapnel and no idea could be more natural well call on shrapnel said palmet we shall see jenny denham he gives her out as his niece whatever she is shes a brimming little beauty i assure you bask you seldom see so pretty a girl wine which has directed mens footsteps upon more marvellous adventures took them to a chemists shop for a cooling effervescent draught and thence through the town to the address furnished to them by the chemist of dr shrapnel on the common bad wine which is responsible for the fate of half the dismal bodies hanging from trees weltering by rocks grovelling and bleaching round the bedabbled mouth of the poets cave of despair had rendered captain baskeletts temper extremely irascible so when he caught sight of dr shrapnel walling in his garden and perceived him of a giants height his eyes fastened on the writer of the abominable letter with an exultation peculiar to men having a devil inside them that kicks to be out the sun was low blazing among the thicker branches of the pollard forest trees and through sprays of hawthorn dr shrapnel stopped facing the visible master of men at the end of his walk before he turned his back to continue the exercise and some discourse he was holding aloud either to the heavens or bands of invisible men ahem dr shrapnel he was accosted twice the second time imperiously he saw two gentlemen outside the garden hedge i spoke sir said captain baskelett i hear you now sir said the doctor walking in a parallel line with them i desired to know sir if you are dr shrapnel i am they arrived at the garden gate you have a charming garden dr shrapnel said lord palmet very affably and loudly with a steady observation of the cottage windows dr shrapnel flung the gate open lord palmet raised his hat and entered crying loudly a very charming garden upon my word captain baskelett followed him bowing stiffly i am he said captain beauchamps cousin i am captain baskelett one of the members for the borough the doctor said ah i wish to see captain beauchamp sir he is absent i shall have him here shortly sir oh you will have him cecil paused admirable roses exclaimed lord palmet you have him i think said cecil if what we hear is correct i wish to know sir whether the case you are conducting against his uncle is one you have communicated to captain beauchamp i repeat i am here to inquire if he is privy to it you may hold family ties in contemptnow sir i request you abstain from provocations with me dr shrapnel had raised his head with something of the rush of a rocket from the stooping posture to listen and his frown of non intelligence might be interpreted as the coming on of the fury radicals are prone to by a gentleman who believed in their constant disposition to explode cecil made play with a pacifying hand we shall arrive at no understanding unless you are good enough to be perfectly calm i repeat my cousin captain beauchamp is more or less at variance with his family owing to these doctrines of yours and your extraordinary michael scott the wizard kind of spell you seem to have cast upon his common sense as a man of the world you have him as you say i do not dispute it i have no doubt you have him fast but here is a case demanding a certain respect for decency pray if i may ask you be still be quiet and hear me out if you can i am accustomed to explain myself to the comprehension of most men who are at large and i tell you candidly i am not to be deceived or diverted from my path by a show of ignorance what is your immediate object sir said dr shrapnel chagrined by the mystification within him and a fear that his patience was going exactly cecil nodded he was acute enough to see that he had established the happy commencement of fretfulness in the victim which is equivalent to a hook well struck in the mouth of your fish and with an anglers joy he prepared to play his man exactly i have stated it and you ask me but i really must decline to run over the whole ground again for you i am here to fulfil a duty to my family a highly disagreeable one to me i may fail like the lady who came here previous to the election for the result of which i am assured i ought to thank your eminently disinterested services i do you recollect a lady calling on you dr shrapnel consulted his memory i think i have a recollection of some lady calling oh you think you have a recollection of some lady calling do you mean a lady connected with captain beauchamp a lady connected with captain beauchamp you are not aware of the situation of the lady if i remember she was a kind of confidential housekeeper some one said to captain beauchamps uncle a kind of confidential housekeeper she is recognized in our family as a lady sir i can hardly expect better treatment at your hands than she met with but i do positively request you to keep your temper whilst i am explaining my business to you now sir what now a trifling breeze will set the tall tree bending and dr shrapnel did indeed appear to display the agitation of a full driving storm when he was but harassed and vexed will you mention your business concisely if you please he said precisely it is my endeavour i supposed i had done so to be frank i would advise you to summon a member of your household wife daughter housekeeper any one you like to whom you may appeal and i too whenever your recollections are at fault i am competent said the doctor but in justice to you urged cecil considerately dr shrapnel smoothed his chin hastily have you done believe me the instant i have an answer to my question i have done name your question very well sir now mark i will be plain with you there is no escape for you from this you destroy my cousins professional prospectsi request you to listenyou blast his career in the navy it was considered promising he was a gallant officer and a smart seaman very well you set him up as a politician to be knocked down to a dead certainty you set him against his class you embroil him with his family on all those points interposed dr shrapnel after dashing a hand to straighten his forelock but cecil vehemently entreated him to control his temper i say you embroil him with his family you cause him to be in everlasting altercation with his uncle mr romfrey materially to his personal detriment and the question of his family is one that every man of sense would apprehend on the spot for we you should know have sir an opinion of captain beauchamps talents and abilities forbidding us to think he could possibly be the total simpleton you make him appear unless to the seductions of your political instructions other seductions were added you apprehend me i am sure i dont cried the doctor descending from his height and swinging about forlornly oh yes you do you do indeed you cannot avoid it you quite apprehend me it is admitted that you take my meaning i insist on that i have nothing to say but what is complimentary of the young lady whoever she may turn out to be bewitching no doubt and to speak frankly dr shrapnel i and i am pretty certain every honest man would think with me i take it to be ten times more creditable to my cousin captain beauchamp that he should be under a ladys influence than under yours come sir i ask you you must confess that a gallant officer and great admirer of the sex does not look such a donkey if he is led in silken strings by a beautiful creature and markstop mark this dr shrapnel i say to the lady we can all excuse a good deal and at the same time you are to be congratulated on first rate diplomacy in employing so charming an agent i wish i really wish you did it generally i assure you only mark thisi do beg you to contain yourself for a minute if possiblei say my cousin captain beauchamp is fair game to hunt and there is no law to prevent the chase only you must not expect us to be quiet spectators of your sport and we have i say undoubtedly a right to lay the case before the lady and induce her to be a peace agent in the family if we can very well this garden is redolent of a ladys hand sighed palmet poetical in his dejection have you taken too much wine gentlemen said dr shrapnel cecil put this impertinence aside with a graceful sweep of his fingers you attempt to elude me sir not i you mention some lady exactly a young lady what is the name of the lady oh you ask the name of the lady and i too what is it i have heard two or three names then you have heard villanies denham jenny denham miss jenny denham said palmet rejoiced at the opportunity of trumpeting her name so that she should not fail to hear it i stake my reputation i have heard her called shrapnelmiss shrapnel said cecil the doctor glanced hastily from one to the other of his visitors the young lady is my ward i am her guardian he said cecil pursed his mouth i have heard her called your niece nieceward she is a lady by birth and education in manners accomplishments and character and she is under my protection cried dr shrapnel cecil bowed so you are for gentle birth i forgot you are for morality too and for praying exactly i recollect but now let me tell you entirely with the object of conciliation my particular desire is to see the young lady in your presence of course and endeavour to persuade her as i have very little doubt i shall do assuming that you give me fair play to exercise her influence on this occasion contrary to yours and save my cousin captain beauchamp from a fresh misunderstanding with his uncle mr romfrey now sir now there you will not see miss denham with my sanction ever said dr shrapnel oh then i perceive your policy mark sir my assumption was that the young lady would on hearing my representations exert herself to heal the breach between captain beauchamp and his family you stand in the way you treat me as you treated the lady who came here formerly to wrest your dupe from your clutches if i mistake not she saw the young lady you acknowledge to be your ward dr shrapnel flashed back i acknowledge mercy and justice is there no peace with the man you walk here to me i cant yet guess why from a town where i have enemies and every scandal flies touching me and mine and you he stopped short to master his anger he subdued it so far as to cloak it in an attempt to speak reasoningly as angry men sometimes deceive themselves in doing despite the good maxim for the wrathfulspeak not at all see said he i was never married my dear friend dies and leaves me his child to protect and rear and though she bears her fathers name she is most wrongly and foully made to share the blows levelled at her guardian ay have at me all of you as much as you will hold off from her were it true the cowardice would be not a whit the smaller why casting a stone like that were it the size of a pebble and the weight of a glance is to toss the whole cowardly world on an innocent young girl and why suspect evil you talk of that lady who paid me a visit here once and whom i treated becomingly i swear i never do otherwise she was a handsome woman and what was she the housekeeper of captain beauchamps uncle hear me if you please to go with the world i have as good a right to suppose the worst of an attractive lady in that situation as you regarding my ward better warrant for scandalizing i think to go with the world but now cecil checked him ejaculating thank you dr shrapnel i thank you most cordially with a shining smile stay sir no more i take my leave of you not another word no buts i recognize that conciliation is out of the question you are the natural protector of poachers and you will not grant me an interview with the young lady you call your ward that i may represent to her as a person we presume to have a chance of moving you how easilyi am determined you shall hear me dr shrapnelhow easily the position of captain beauchamp may become precarious with his uncle mr romfrey and let me addbut and but me till doomsday sirif you werei do hear you sir and you shall hear meif you were a younger man i say i would hold you answerable to me for your scandalous and disgraceful insinuations dr shrapnel was adroitly fenced and over shouted he shrugged stuttered swayed wagged a bulrush head flapped his elbows puffed like a swimmer in the breakers tried many times to expostulate and finding the effort useless for his adversary was copious and commanding relapsed eyeing him as an object far removed cecil rounded one of his perplexingly empty sentences and turned on his heel war then he said as you like retorted the doctor oh very good good evening cecil slightly lifted his hat with the short projection of the head of the stately peacock in its walk and passed out of the garden lord palmet deeply disappointed and mystified went after him leaving dr shrapnel to shorten his garden walk with enormous long strides im afraid you didnt manage the old boy palmet complained theyre people who have tea in their gardens we might have sat down with them and talked the best friends in the world and come again to morrow might have called her jenny in a week she didnt show her pretty nose at any of the windows his companion pooh poohed and said foh im afraid i permitted myself to lose my self command for a moment palmet sang out an amorous couplet to console himself captain baskelett respected the poetic art for its magical power over womans virtue but he disliked hearing verses and they were ill suited to palmet he abused his friend roundly telling him it was contemptible to be quoting verses he was irritable still he declared himself nevertheless much refreshed by his visit to dr shrapnel we shall have to sleep tonight in this unhallowed town but i neednt be off to holdesbury in the morning ive done my business i shall write to the baron to night and we can cross the water to morrow in time for operations the letter to mr romfrey was composed before midnight it was a long one and when he had finished it cecil remembered that the act of composition had been assisted by a cigar in his mouth and mr romfrey detested the smell of tobacco there was nothing to be done but to write the letter over again somewhat more briefly it ran thus thinking to kill two birds at a blow i went yesterday with palmet after the dinner at this place to shrapnels house where as i heard i stood a chance of catching friend nevil the young person living under the mans protection was absent and so was the poor dear commander perhaps attending on his bull shrapnel said he was expecting him i write to you to confess i thought myself a cleverer fellow than i am i talked to shrapnel and tried hard to reason with him i hope i can keep my temper under ordinary circumstances you will understand that it required remarkable restraint when i make you acquainted with the fact that a ladys name was introduced which as your representative in relation to her i was bound to defend from a gratuitous and scoundrelly aspersion shrapnels epistle to brave beauchamp is church hymnification in comparison with his conversation he is indubitably one of the greatest ruffians of his time i took the step with the best of intentions and all i can plead is that i am not a diplomatist of sixty his last word was that he is for war with us as far as we men are concerned it is of small importance i should think that the sort of society he would scandalize a lady in is not much to be feared i have given him his warning he tops me by about a head and loses his temper every two minutes i could have drawn him out deliciously if he had not rather disturbed mine by this time my equanimity is restored the only thing i apprehend is your displeasure with me for having gone to the man i have done no good and it prevents me from running over to holdesbury to see nevil for if shindy letters as you call them are bad shindy meetings are worse i should be telling him my opinion of shrapnel he would be firing out i should retort he would yell i should snap my fingers and he would go into convulsions i am convinced that a cattle breeder ought to keep himself particularly calm so unless i have further orders from you i refrain from going the dinner was enthusiastic i sat three hours among my commons they on me for that length of timefatiguing but a duty cecil subscribed his name with the warmest affection toward his uncle the brevity of the second letter had not brought him nearer to the truth in rescinding the picturesque accessories of his altercation with dr shrapnel but it veraciously expressed the sentiments he felt and that was the palpable truth for him he posted the letter next morning chapter xxxi showing a chivalrous gentleman set in motion about noon the day following on board the steam yacht of the countess of menai cecil was very much astonished to see mr romfrey descending into a boat hard by from grancey lespels hired cutter steam was up and the countess was off for a cruise in the channel as it was not a race day but seeing mr romfreys hand raised she spoke to cecil and immediately gave orders to wait for the boat this lady was a fervent admirer of the knightly gentleman and had reason to like him for he had once been her champion mr romfrey mounted the steps received her greeting and beckoned to cecil he carried a gold headed horsewhip under his arm lady menai would gladly have persuaded him to be one of her company for the days voyage but he said he had business in bevisham and moving aside with cecil put the question to him abruptly what were the words used by shrapnel the identical words captain baskelett asked he could have tripped out the words with the fluency of ancient historians relating what great kings ambassadors or generals may well have uttered on state occasions but if you want the identical words who is to remember them the day after they have been delivered he said well as for the identical words i really and i was tolerably excited sir and upon my honour the identical words are rather difficult to he glanced at the horsewhip and pricked by the sight of it to proceed thought it good to soften the matter if possible i dont quite recollect i wrote off to you rather hastily i think he saidbut palmet was there shrapnel spoke the words before lord palmet said mr romfrey austerely captain baskelett summoned palmet to come near and inquired of him what he had heard shrapnel say suggesting he spoke of a handsome woman for a housekeeper and all the world knew her character mr romfrey cleared his throat or knew she had no character cecil pursued in a fit of gratified spleen in scorn of the woman dont you recollect his accent in pronouncing housekeeper the menacing thunder sounded from mr romfrey he was patient in appearance and waited for cecils witness to corroborate the evidence it happened and here we are in one of the circles of small things producing great consequences which have inspired diminutive philosophers with ironical visions of history and the littleness of man it happened that lord palmet the humanest of young aristocrats well disposed toward the entire world especially to women also to men in any way related to pretty women had just lit a cigar and it was a cigar that he had been recommended to try the flavour of and though he having his wits about him was fully aware that shipboard is no good place for a trial of the delicacy of tobacco in the leaf he had begun puffing and sniffing in a critical spirit and scarcely knew for the moment what to decide as to this particular cigar he remembered however mr romfreys objection to tobacco imagining that he saw the expression of a profound distaste in that gentlemans more than usually serious face he hesitated between casting the cigar into the water and retaining it he decided upon the latter course and held the cigar behind his back bowing to mr romfrey at about a couple of yards distance and saying to cecil housekeeper yes i remember hearing housekeeper i think so housekeeper yes oh yes and handsome housekeepers were doubtful characters captain baskelett prompted him palmet laughed out a single ha that seemed to excuse him for lounging away to the forepart of the vessel where he tugged at his fine specimen of a cigar to rekindle it and discharged it with a wry grimace so delicate is the flavour of that weed and so adversely ever is it affected by a breeze and a moist atmosphere he could then return undivided in his mind to mr romfrey and cecil but the subject was not resumed in his presence the countess of menai steamed into bevisham to land mr romfrey there i can be out in the channel any day it is not every day that i see you she said in support of her proposal to take him over they sat together conversing apart from the rest of the company until they sighted bevisham when mr romfrey stood up and a little crowd of men came round him to enjoy his famous racy talk captain baskelett offered to land with him he declined companionship dropping her hand in his the countess asked him what he had to do in that town and he replied i have to demand an apology answering the direct look of his eyes she said oh i shall not speak of it in his younger days if the rumour was correct he had done the same on her account he stepped into the boat and presently they saw him mount the pier steps with the riding whip under his arm his head more than commonly bent a noticeable point in a man of his tall erect figure the ladies and some of the gentlemen thought he was looking particularly grave even sorrowful lady menai inquired of captain baskelett whether he knew the nature of his uncles business in bevisham the town he despised what could cecil say but no his uncle had not imparted it to him she was flattered in being the sole confidante and said no more the sprightly ingenuity of captain baskeletts mind would have informed him of the nature of his uncles expedition we may be sure had he put it to the trial for mr romfrey was as plain to read as a rudimentary sum in arithmetic and like the tracings of a pedigree map his preliminary steps to deeds were seen pointing on their issue in lines of straight descent but cecil could protest that he was not bound to know and considering that he was neither bound to know nor to speculate he determined to stand on his right so effectually did he accomplish the task that he was frequently surprised during the evening and the night by the effervescence of a secret exultation rising imp like within him that was he assured himself perfectly unaccountable chapter xxxii an effort to conquer cecilia in beauchamps fashion the day after mr romfreys landing in bevisham a full south wester stretched the canvas of yachts of all classes schooner cutter and yawl on the lively green water between the island and the forest shore cecilias noble schooner was sure to be out in such a ringing breeze for the pride of it as well as the pleasure she landed her father at the club steps and then bore away eastward to sight a cutter race the breeze beginning to stiffen looking back against sun and wind she saw herself pursued by a saucy little ton craft that had been in her track since she left the otley river before noon dipping and straining with every inch of sail set as mad a stern chase as ever was witnessed and who could the man at the tiller clad cap a pie in tarpaulin be she led him dancing away to prove his resoluteness and laugh at him she had the powerful wings and a glory in them coming of this pursuit her triumph was delicious until the occasional sparkle of the tarpaulin was lost the small boat appeared a motionless object far behind and all ahead of her exceedingly dull though the race hung there and the crowd of sail cecilias transient flutter of coquettry created by the animating air and her queenly flight was over she fled splendidly and she came back graciously but he refused her open hand as it were he made as if to stand across her tack and reconsidering it evidently scorned his advantage and challenged the stately vessel for a beat up against the wind it was as pretty as a court minuet but presently cecilia stood too far on one tack and returning to the centre of the channel found herself headed by seamanship he waved an ironical salute with his souwester her retort consisted in bringing her vessel to the wind and sending a boat for him she did it on the impulse had she consulted her wishes she would rather have seen him at his post where he seemed in his element facing the spray and cunningly calculating to get wind and tide in his favour partly with regret she saw him stripped of his tarpaulin jump into her boat as though she had once more to say farewell to sailor nevil beauchamp farewell the bright youth the hero the true servant of his country that feeling of hers changed when he was on board the stirring cordial day had put new breath in him should not the flag be dipped he said looking up at the peak where the white flag streamed can you really mistake compassion for defeat said she with a smile oh before the wind of course i hadnt a chance how could you be so presumptuous as to give chase and who has lent you that little cutter beauchamp had hired her for a month and he praised her sailing and pretended to say that the race was not always to the strong in a stiff breeze but in point of fact i was bent on trying how my boat swims and had no idea of overhauling you to day our salt water lake is as fine as the mediterranean omitting the islands and the mediterranean colour it is i have often told you how i love it i have landed papa at the club are you aware that we meet you at steynham the day after to morrow well we can ride on the downs the downs between three and four of a summers morning are as lovely as anything in the world they have the softest outlines imaginable and remind me of a friends upper lip when she deigns to smile is one to rise at that hour to behold the effect and let me remind you further nevil that the comparison of natures minor work beside her mighty is an error if you will be poetical she cited a well known instance of degradation in verse but a young man who happens to be intimately acquainted with a certain dark eye in woman will not so lightly be brought to consider that the comparison of tempestuous night to the flashing of those eyes of hers topples the scene headlong from grandeur and if beauchamp remembered rightly the scene was the alps at night he was prepared to contest cecilias judgement at that moment the breeze freshened and the canvas lifted from due south the yacht swung her sails to drive toward the west and cecilias face and hair came out golden in the sunlight speech was difficult admiration natural so he sat beside her admiring in silence she said a good word for the smartness of his little yacht this is my first trial of her said beauchamp i hired her chiefly to give dr shrapnel a taste of salt air ive no real right to be idling about his ward miss denham is travelling in switzerland the dear old man is alone and not quite so well as i should wish change of scene will do him good i shall land him on the french coast for a couple of days or take him down channel cecilia gazed abstractedly at a passing schooner he works too hard said beauchamp who does dr shrapnel some one else whom we have heard of works too hard and it would be happy for mankind if he did not cecilia named the schooner an american that had beaten our crack yachts beauchamp sprang up to spy at the american thats the corinne is she yankee craftiness on salt water always excited his respectful attention as a spectator and what is the name of your boat nevil the fool of an owner calls her the petrel its not that im superstitious but to give a boat a name of bad augury to sailors appears to me however ive argued it with him and i will have her called the curlew carrying dr shrapnel and me petrel would be thought the proper title for herisnt that your idea he laughed and she smiled and then he became overcast with his political face and said i hopei believeyou will alter your opinion of him can it be an opinion when its founded on nothing you know really nothing of him i have in my pocket what i believe would alter your mind about him entirely i do think so and i think so because i feel you would appreciate his deep sincerity and real nobleness is it a talisman that you have nevil no its a letter cecilias cheeks took fire i should so much like to read it to you said he do not please she replied with a dash of supplication in her voice not the whole of itan extract here and there i want you so much to understand him i am sure i should not let me try you pray do not merely to show you but nevil i do not wish to understand him but you have only to listen for a few minutes and i want you to know what good reason i have to reverence him as a teacher and a friend cecilia looked at beauchamp with wonder a confused recollection of the contents of the letter declaimed at mount laurels in captain baskeletts absurd sing song surged up in her mind revoltingly she signified a decided negative something of a shudder accompanied the expression of it but he as little as any member of the romfrey blood was framed to let the word no stand quietly opposed to him and the no that a woman utters it calls for wholesome tyranny those old those hoar old duellists yes and no have rarely been better matched than in beauchamp and cecilia for if he was obstinate in attack she had great resisting power twice to listen to that letter was beyond her endurance indeed it cast a shadow on him and disfigured him and when affecting to plead he said you must listen to it to please me for my sake cecilia she answered it is for your sake nevil i decline to why what do you know of it he exclaimed i know the kind of writing it would be how do you know it i have heard of some of dr shrapnels opinions you imagine him to be subversive intolerant immoral and the rest all that comes under your word revolutionary possibly but i must defend myself from hearing what i know will be certain to annoy me but he is the reverse of immoral and i intend to read you parts of the letter to prove to you that he is not the man you would blame but i and that if ever i am worthier worthier of you as i hope to become it will be owing to this admirable and good old man cecilia trembled she was touched to the quick yet it was not pleasant to her to be wooed obliquely through dr shrapnel she recognized the very letter crowned with many stamps thick with many pages in beauchamps hands when you are at steynham you will probably hear my uncle everards version of this letter he said the baron chooses to think everything fair in war and the letter came accidentally into his hands with the seal broken well he read it and cecilia you can fancy the sort of stuff he would make of it apart from that i want you particularly to know how much i am indebted to dr shrapnel wont you learn to like him a little wont you tolerate himi could almost say for my sake he and i are at variance on certain points but taking him altogether i am under deeper obligations to him than to any man on earth he has found where i bend and waver i recognize your chivalry nevil he has done his best to train me to be of some service wheres the chivalry in owning a debt he is one of our true warriors fearless and blameless i have had my heroes before you know how i loved robert hall his death is a gap in my life he is a light for fighting englishmenwho fight with the sword but the scale of the war the cause and the end in view raise dr shrapnel above the bravest i have ever had the luck to meet soldiers and sailors have their excitement to keep them up to the mark praise and rewards he is in his eight and sixtieth year and he has never received anything but obloquy for his pains half of the small fortune he has goes in charities and subscriptions will that touch you but i think little of that and so does he charity is a common duty the dedication of a mans life and whole mind to a cause theres heroism i wish i were eloquent i wish i could move you cecilia turned her face to him i listen to you with pleasure nevil but please do not read the letter yes a paragraph or two i must read she rose he was promptly by her side if i say i ask you for one sign that you care for me in some degree i have not for a moment ceased to be your friend nevil since i was a child but if you allow yourself to be so prejudiced against my best friend that you will not hear a word of his writing are you friendly feminine and obstinate said cecilia give me your eyes an instant i know you think me reckless and lawless now is not that true you doubt whether if a lady gave me her hand i should hold to it in perfect faith or perhaps not that but you do suspect i should be capable of every sophism under the sun to persuade a woman to break her faith if it suited me supposing some passion to be at work men who are open to passion have to be taught reflection before they distinguish between the woman they should sue for love because she would be their best mate and the woman who has thrown a spell on them now what i beg you to let me read you in this letter is a truth nobly stated that has gone into my blood and changed me it cannot fail too in changeing your opinion of dr shrapnel it makes me wretched that you should be divided from me in your ideas of him i you seeand i confess i think it my chief title to honourreverence him i regret that i am unable to utter the words of ruth said cecilia in a low voice she felt rather tremulously opposed only to the letter and the writer of it not at all to beauchamp except on account of his idolatry of the wicked revolutionist far from having a sense of opposition to beauchamp she pitied him for his infatuation and in her lofty mental serenity she warmed to him for the seeming boyishness of his constant and extravagant worship of the man though such an enthusiasm cast shadows on his intellect he was reading a sentence of the letter i hear nothing but the breeze nevil she said the breeze fluttered the letter sheets they threatened to fly cecilia stepped two paces away hark there is a military band playing on the pier said she i am so fond of hearing music a little off shore beauchamp consigned the letter to his pocket you are not offended nevil dear me no you havent a mind for tonics thats all healthy persons rarely have she remarked and asked him smiling softly whether he had a mind for music his insensibility to music was curious considering how impressionable he was to verse and to songs of birds he listened with an oppressed look as to something the particular secret of which had to be reached by a determined effort of sympathy for those whom it affected he liked it if she did and said he liked it reiterated that he liked it clearly trying hard to comprehend it as unmoved by the swell and sigh of the resonant brass as a man could be while her romantic spirit thrilled to it and was bountiful in glowing visions and in tenderness there hung her hand she would not have refused to yield it the hero of her childhood the friend of her womanhood and her hero still might have taken her with half a word beauchamp was thinking she can listen to that brass band and she shuts her ears to this letter the reading of it would have been a prelude to the opening of his heart to her at the same time that it vindicated his dear and honoured master as he called dr shrapnel to speak without the explanation of his previous reticence which this letter would afford seemed useless even the desire to speak was absent passion being absent i see papa he is getting into a boat with some one said cecilia and gave orders for the yacht to stand in toward the club steps do you know nevil the italian common people are not so subject to the charm of music as other races they have more of the gift and i think less of the feeling you do not hear much music in italy i remember in the year of revolution there was danger of a rising in some austrian city and a colonel of a regiment commanded his band to play the mob was put in good humour immediately its a soporific said beauchamp you would not rather have had them rise to be slaughtered would you have them waltzed into perpetual servility cecilia hummed and suggested if one can have them happy in any way then the day of destruction may almost be dated nevil your terrible view of life must be false i make it out worse to you than to any one else because i want our minds to be united give me a respite now and then with all my heart and forgive me for beating my drum i see what others dont see or else i feel it more i dont know but it appears to me our country needs rousing if its to live theres a division between poor and rich that you have no conception of and it cant safely be left unnoticed ive done he looked at her and saw tears on her under lids my dearest cecilia music makes me childish said she her father was approaching in the boat beside him sat the earl of lockrace latterly classed among the suitors of the lady of mount laurels a few minutes remained to beauchamp of his lost opportunity instead of seizing them with his usual promptitude he let them slip painfully mindful of his treatment of her last year after the drive into bevisham when she was england and rene holiday france this feeling he fervently translated into the reflection that the bride who would bring him beauty and wealth and her especial gift of tender womanliness was not yet so thoroughly mastered as to grant her husband his just prevalence with her or even indeed his complete independence of action without which life itself was not desireable colonel halkett stared at beauchamp as if he had risen from the deep have you been in that town this morning was one of his first questions to him when he stood on board i came through it said beauchamp and pointed to his little cutter labouring in the distance shes mine for a month i came from holdesbury to try her and then he stated how he had danced attendance on the schooner for a couple of hours before any notice was taken of him and cecilia with her graceful humour held up his presumption to scorn her father was eyeing beauchamp narrowly and appeared troubled did you see mr romfrey yesterday or this morning the colonel asked him mentioning that mr romfrey had been somewhere about the island yesterday at which beauchamp expressed astonishment for his uncle everard seldom visited a yachting station colonel halkett exchanged looks with cecilia hers were inquiring and he confirmed her side glance at beauchamp she raised her brows he nodded to signify that there was gravity in the case here the signalling stopped short she had to carry on a conversation with lord lockrace one of those men who betray the latent despot in an exhibition of discontentment unless they have all a ladys hundred eyes attentive to their discourse at last beauchamp quitted the vessel when he was out of hearing colonel halkett said to cecilia grancey lespel tells me that mr romfrey called on the man shrapnel yesterday evening at six oclock yes papa now come and see the fittings below the colonel addressed lord lockrace and murmured to his daughter and soundly horsewhipped him cecilia turned on the instant to gaze after nevil beauchamp she could have wept for pity her fathers emphasis on soundly declared an approval of the deed and she was chilled by a sickening abhorrence and dread of the cruel brute in men such as awakened by she knew not what had haunted her for a year of her girlhood and he deserved it the colonel pursued on emerging from the cabin at lord lockraces heels ive no doubt he richly deserved it the writer of that letter we heard captain baskelett read the other day deserves the very worst he gets baskelett bored the club the other night with a letter of a radical fellow said lord lockrace men who write that stuff should be strung up and whipped by the common hangman it was a private letter said cecilia public or private miss halkett her mind flew back to seymour austin for the sense of stedfastness when she heard such language as this which taken in conjunction with dr shrapnels seemed to uncloak our constitutional realm and show it boiling up with the frightful elements of primitive societies i suppose we are but half civilized she said if that said the earl colonel halkett protested that he never could quite make out what radicals were driving at the rents lord lockrace observed in the conclusive tone of brevity he did not stay very long the schooner was boarded subsequently by another nobleman an admiral of the fleet and ex minister of the whig government lord croyston who was a friend of mr romfreys and thought well of nevil beauchamp as a seaman and naval officer but shook an old head over him as a politician he came to beg a passage across the water to his marine lodge an accident having happened early in the morning to his yacht the lady violet he was able to communicate the latest version of the horsewhipping of dr shrapnel from which it appeared that after mr romfrey had handsomely flogged the man he flung his card on the prostrate body to let men know who was responsible for the act he expected that mr romfrey would be subjected to legal proceedings but if theres a pleasure worth paying for its the trouncing of a villain said he and he had been informed that dr shrapnel was a big one lord croystons favourite country residence was in the neighbourhood of old mrs beauchamp on the upper thames speaking of nevil beauchamp a second time he alluded to his relations with his great aunt said his prospects were bad that she had interdicted her house to him and was devoted to her other great nephew and so she should be said colonel halkett thats a young man whos an englishman without french gunpowder notions in his head he works for us down at the mine in wales a good part of the year and has tided us over a threatening strike there gratuitously i cant get him to accept anything i cant think why he does it hell have plenty said lord croyston levelling his telescope to sight the racing cutters cecilia fancied she descried nevils petrel dubbed curlew to eastward and had a faint gladness in the thought that his knowledge of his uncle everards deed of violence would be deferred for another two or three hours she tried to persuade her father to wait for nevil and invite him to dine at mount laurels and break the news to him gently colonel halkett argued that in speaking of the affair he should certainly not commiserate the man who had got his deserts and saying this he burst into a petty fury against the epistle of dr shrapnel which appeared to be growing more monstrous in proportion to his forgetfulness of the details as mountains gather vastness to the eye at a certain remove though he could not guess the reason for mr romfreys visit to bevisham he was he said quite prepared to maintain that mr romfrey had a perfect justification for his conduct cecilia hinted at barbarism the colonel hinted at high police duties that gentlemen were sometimes called on to perform for the protection of society in defiance of its laws she asked and he answered women must not be judging things out of their sphere with the familiar accent on women which proves their inferiority he was rarely guilty of it toward his daughter evidently he had resolved to back mr romfrey blindly that epistle of dr shrapnels merited condign punishment and had met with it he seemed to rejoice in saying and this was his abstract of the same an old charlatan who tells his dupe to pray every night of his life for the beheading of kings and princes and scattering of the clergy and disbanding the army that he and his rabble may fall upon the wealthy and show us numbers win and hell undertake to make them moral i wish we were not going to steynham said cecilia so do i well no i dont the colonel corrected himself no its an engagement i gave my consent so far we shall see whether nevil beauchamps a man of any sense her heart sank this was as much as to let her know that if nevil broke with his uncle the treaty of union between the two families which her father submitted to entertain out of consideration for mr romfrey would be at an end the wind had fallen entering her river cecilia gazed back at the smooth broad water and the band of golden beams flung across it from the evening sun over the forest no little cutter was visible she could not write to nevil to bid him come and concert with her in what spirit to encounter his uncle everard at steynham and guests would be at mount laurels next day lord lockrace lord croyston and the lespels she could not drive down to bevisham on the chance of seeing him nor was it to be acknowledged even to herself that she so greatly desired to see him and advise him why not because she was one of the artificial creatures called women with the accent who dare not be spontaneous and cannot act independently if they would continue to be admirable in the worlds eye and who for that object must remain fixed on shelves like other marketable wares avoiding motion to avoid shattering or tarnishing this is their fate only in degree less inhuman than that of hellenic and trojan princesses offered up to the gods or pretty slaves to the dealers their artificiality is at once their bane and their source of superior pride seymour austin might have reason for seeking to emancipate them she thought and blushed in thought that she could never be learning anything but from her own immediate sensations of course it was in her power to write to beauchamp just as it had been in his to speak to her but the fire was wanting in her blood and absent from his mood so they were kept apart her father knew as little as she what was the positive cause of mr romfreys chastisement of dr shrapnel cause enough i dont doubt he said and cited the mephitic letter cecilia was not given to suspicions or she would have had them kindled by a certain wilfulness in his incessant reference to the letter and exoneration if not approval of mr romfreys conduct how did that chivalrous gentleman justify himself for condescending to such an extreme as the use of personal violence was there a possibility of his justifying it to nevil she was most wretched in her reiteration of these inquiries for with a heart subdued she had still a mind whose habit of independent judgement was not to be constrained and while she felt that it was only by siding with nevil submissively and blindly in this lamentable case that she could hope for happiness she foresaw the likelihood of her not being able to do so as much as he would desire and demand this she took for the protest of her pure reason in reality grieved though she was on account of that dr shrapnel her captive heart resented the anticipated challenge to her to espouse his cause or languish chapter xxxiii the first encounter at steynham the judge pronouncing sentence of condemnation on the criminal is proverbially a sorrowfully minded man and still more would he be so had he to undertake the part of executioner as well this is equivalent to saying that the simple pleasures are no longer with us it must be a personal enemy now to give us any satisfaction in chastising and slaying perhaps by and by that will be savourless we degenerate there is nevertheless ever and let nature be praised for it a strong sustainment in the dutiful exertion of our physical energies and mr everard romfrey experienced it after he had fulfilled his double office on the person of dr shrapnel by carrying out his own decree his conscience approved him cheerlessly as it is the habit of that secret monitor to do when we have no particular advantage coming of the act we have performed but the righteous labour of his arm gave him high breathing and an appetite he foresaw that he and nevil would soon be having a wrestle over the matter hand and thigh but a gentleman in the right engaged with a fellow in the wrong has nothing to apprehend is in fact in the position of a game preserver with a poacher the nearest approach to gratification in that days work which mr romfrey knew was offered by the picture of nevils lamentable attitude above his dirty idol he conceived it in the mock mediaeval style of our caricaturistsshrapnel stretched at his length half a league in slashed yellows and blacks with his bauble beside him and prodigious pointed toes nevil in parti coloured tights on one leg raising his fists in imprecation to a nose in the firmament gentlemen of an unpractised imaginative capacity cannot vision for themselves exactly what they would being unable to exercise authority over the proportions and the hues of the objects they conceive which are very much at the mercy of their sportive caprices and the state of mind of mr romfrey is not to be judged by his ridiculous view of the pair in the abstract he could be sorry for shrapnel as he knew himself magnanimous he promised himself to be forbearing with nevil moreover the month of september was drawing nigh he had plenty to think of the entire land signifying all but all of those who occupy the situation of thinkers in it may be said to have been exhaling the same thought in connection with september our england holds possession of a considerable portion of the globe and it keeps the world in awe to see her bestowing so considerable a portion of her intelligence upon her recreations to prosecute them with her whole heart is an ingenious exhibition of her power mr romfrey was of those who said to his countrymen go yachting go cricketing go boat racing go shooting go horseracing nine months of the year while the other europeans go marching and drilling those occupations he considered good for us and our much talking writing and thinking about them characteristic and therefore good and he was not one of those who do penance for that sweating indolence in the fits of desperate panic beauchamps argument that the rich idler begets the idling vagabond the rich wagerer the brutal swindler the general thirst for a mad round of recreation a generally increasing disposition to avoid serious work and the unbraced moral tone of the country an indifference to national responsibility an argument doubtless extracted from shrapnel talk tall as the very demagogue when he stood upright mr romfrey laughed at scornfully affirming that our manufactures could take care of themselves as for invasion we are circled by the sea providence has done that for us and may be relied on to do more in an emergencythe children of wealth and the children of the sun alike believe that providence is for them and it would seem that the former can do without it less than the latter though the former are less inclined to give it personification this year however the array of armaments on the continent made mr romfrey anxious about our navy almost his first topic in welcoming colonel halkett and cecilia to steynham was the rottenness of navy administration for if providence is to do anything for us it must have a sea worthy fleet for the operation how loudly would his contemptuous laughter have repudiated the charge that he trusted to supernatural agency for assistance in case of need but so it was and he owned to believing in english luck partly of course he meant that steady fire of combat which his countrymen have got heated to of old till fortune blessed them nevil is not here the colonel asked no i suspect hes gruelling and plastering a doctor of his acquaintance mr romfrey said with his nasal laugh composed of scorn and resignation yes yes ive heard said colonel halkett hastily he would have liked to be informed of dr shrapnels particular offence he mentioned the execrable letter mr romfrey complacently interjected drug vomit and after an interval gallows that man has done nevil beauchamp a world of mischief romfrey well hope for a cure colonel did the man come across you he did mr romfrey was mute on the subject colonel halkett abstained from pushing his inquiries cecilia could only tell her father when they were alone in the drawing room a few minutes before dinner that mrs culling was entirely ignorant of any cause to which nevils absence might be attributed mr romfrey had good cause the colonel said emphatically he repeated it next day without being a bit wiser of the cause cecilias happiness or hope was too sensitive to allow of a beloved fathers deceiving her in his opposition to it she saw clearly now that he had fastened on this miserable incident expecting an imbroglio that would divide nevil and his uncle and be an excuse for dividing her and nevil o for the passionate will to make head against what appeared as a fate in this matter she had it not mr and mrs wardour devereux sir john and lady baskelett and the countess of welshpool another sister of mr romfreys arrived at steynham for a day and a night lady baskelett and lady welshpool came to see their brother not to countenance his household and mr wardour devereux could not stay longer than a certain number of hours under a roof where tobacco was in evil odour from her friend louise his wife cecilia learnt that mr lydiard had been summoned to dr shrapnels bedside as mrs devereux knew by a letter she had received from mr lydiard who was no political devotee of that man she assured cecilia but had an extraordinary admiration for the miss denham living with him this was kindly intended to imply that beauchamp was released from his attendance on dr shrapnel and also that it was not he whom the miss denham attracted she is in switzerland said cecilia she is better there said mrs devereux mr stukely culbrett succeeded to these visitors he heard of the case of dr shrapnel from colonel halkett and of beauchamps missing of his chance with the heiress from mr romfrey rosamund culling was in great perplexity about beauchamps prolonged absence for he had engaged to come he had written to her to say he would be sure to come and she feared he was ill she would have persuaded mr culbrett to go down to bevisham to see him she declared that she could even persuade herself to call on dr shrapnel a second time in spite of her horror of the man her anger at the thought of his keeping nevil away from good fortune and happiness caused her to speak in resentment and loathing of the man he behaved badly when you saw him did he said stukely badly is no word he is detestable rosamund replied you think he ought to be whipped she feigned an extremity of vindictiveness and twisted her brows in comic apology for the unfeminine sentiment as she said i really do the feminine gentleness of her character was known to stukely so she could afford to exaggerate the expression of her anger and she did not modify it forgetful that a woman is the representative of the sex with cynical men and escapes from contempt at the cost of her sisterhood looking out of an upper window in the afternoon she beheld nevil beauchamp in a group with his uncle everard the colonel and cecilia and mr culbrett nevil was on his feet the others were seated under the great tulip tree on the lawn a little observation of them warned her that something was wrong there was a vacant chair nevil took it in his hand at times stamped it to the ground walked away and sharply back fronting his uncle speaking vehemently she perceived and vainly as she judged by the cast of his uncles figure mr romfreys head was bent and wagged slightly as he screwed his brows up and shot his eyes queerly at the agitated young man colonel halketts arms crossed his chest cecilias eyelids drooped their lashes mr culbrett was balancing on the hind legs of his chair no one appeared to be speaking but nevil it became evident that nevil was putting a series of questions to his uncle mechanical nods were given him in reply presently mr romfrey rose thundering out a word or two without a gesture colonel halkett rose nevil flung his hand out straight to the house mr romfrey seemed to consent the colonel shook his head nevil insisted a footman carrying a tea tray to miss halkett received some commission and swiftly disappeared making rosamund wonder whether sugar milk or cream had been omitted she met him on the first landing and heard that mr romfrey requested her to step out on the lawn expecting to hear of a piece of misconduct on the part of the household servants she hurried forth and found that she had to traverse the whole space of the lawn up to the tuliptree colonel halkett and mr romfrey had resumed their seats the colonel stood up and bowed to her mr romfrey said one question to you maam and you shall not be detained did not that man shrapnel grossly insult you on the day you called on him to see captain beauchamp about a couple of months before the election look at me when you speak maam said beauchamp rosamund looked at him the whiteness of his face paralyzed her tongue a dreadful levelling of his eyes penetrated and chilled her instead of thinking of her answer she thought of what could possibly have happened did he insult you at all maam said beauchamp mr romfrey reminded him that he was not a cross examining criminal barrister they waited for her to speak she hesitated coloured betrayed confusion her senses telling her of a catastrophe her conscience accusing her as the origin of it did dr shrapnel to your belief intentionally hurt your feelings or your dignity said beauchamp and made the answer easier not intentionally surely not i certainly do not accuse him can you tell me you feel that he wounded you in the smallest degree and if so how i ask you this because he is anxious if he lives to apologize to you for any offence that he may have been guilty of he was ignorant of it i have his word for that and his commands to me to bear it to you i may tell you i have never known him injure the most feeble thinganything alive or wish to beauchamps voice choked rosamund saw tears leap out of the stern face of her dearest now in wrath with her is he ill she faltered he is you own to a strong dislike of him do you not but not to desire any harm to him not a whipping mr culbrett murmured everard romfrey overheard it he had allowed mrs culling to be sent for that she might with a bare affirmative silence nevil when his conduct was becoming intolerable before the guests of the house that will do maam he dismissed her beauchamp would not let her depart i must have your distinct reply and in mr romfreys presencesay that if you accused him you were mistaken or that they were mistaken who supposed you had accused him i must have the answer before you go sir will you learn manners mr romfrey said to him with a rattle of the throat beauchamp turned his face from her colonel halkett offered her his arm to lead her away what is it oh what is it she whispered scarcely able to walk but declining the colonels arm you ought not to have been dragged out here said he any one might have known there would be no convincing of captain beauchamp that old rascal in bevisham has been having a beating thats all and a very beautiful day it isa little too hot though before we leave you must give me a lesson or two in gardening dr shrapnelmr romfrey said rosamund half audibly under the oppression of the more she saw than what she said the colonel talked of her renown in landscape gardening he added casually they met the other day by accident by chance i suppose shrapnel defends one of your steynham poaching vermin mr romfrey struck himfor that oh never rosamund exclaimed i suppose he had a long account to settle she fetched her breath painfully i shall never be forgiven and i say that a gentleman has no business with idols the colonel fumed as he spoke those letters of shrapnel to nevil beauchamp are a scandal on the name of englishman you have read that shocking one colonel halkett captain baskelett read it out to us he oh then she stoppedthen the author of this mischief is clear to me her divining hatred of cecil would have said but her humble position did not warrant such speech a consideration of the lowliness necessitating this restraint at a moment when loudly to denounce anothers infamy with triumphant insight would have solaced and supported her kept rosamund dumb she could not bear to think of her part in the mischief she was not bound to think of it knowing actually nothing of the occurrence still she felt that she was on her trial she detected herself running in and out of her nature to fortify it against accusations rather than cleanse it for inspection it was narrowing in her own sight the prospect of her having to submit to a further interrogatory shut it up entrenched in the declaration that dr shrapnel had so far outraged her sentiments as to be said to have offended her not insulted perhaps but certainly offended and this was a generous distinction it was generous and having recognized the generosity she was unable to go beyond it she was presently making the distinction to miss halkett the colonel had left her at the door of the house miss halkett sought admission to her private room on an errand of condolence for she had sympathized with her very much in the semi indignity nevil had forced her to undergo and very little indeed had she been able to sympathize with nevil who had been guilty of the serious fault of allowing himself to appear moved by his own commonplace utterances or in other words the theme being hostile to his audience he had betrayed emotion over it without first evoking the spirit of pathos as for me rosamund replied to some comforting remarks of miss halketts i do not understand why i should be mixed up in dr shrapnels misfortunes i really am quite unable to recollect his words to me or his behaviour i have only a positive impression that i left his house where i had gone to see captain beauchamp in utter disgust so repelled by his language that i could hardly trust myself to speak of the man to mr romfrey when he questioned me i did not volunteer it i am ready to say that i believe dr shrapnel did not intend to be insulting i cannot say that he was not offensive you know miss halkett i would willingly gladly have saved him from anything like punishment you are too gentle to have thought of it said cecilia but i shall never be forgiven by captain beauchamp i see in his eyes that he accuses me and despises me he will not be so unjust mrs culling rosamund begged that she might hear what nevil had first said on his arrival cecilia related that they had seen him walking swiftly across the park and that mr romfrey had hailed him and held his hand out and that captain beauchamp had overlooked it saying he feared mr romfreys work was complete he had taken her fathers hand and hers and his touch was like ice his worship of that dr shrapnel is extraordinary quoth rosamund and how did mr romfrey behave to him my father thinks very forbearingly rosamund sighed and made a semblance of wringing her hands it seems to me that i anticipated ever since i heard of the man or at least ever since i saw him and heard him he would be the evil genius of us all if i dare include myself but i am not permitted to escape and miss halkett can you tell me how it was that my namethat i became involved i cannot imagine the circumstances which would bring me forward in this unhappy affair cecilia replied the occasion was that captain beauchamp so scornfully contrasted the sort of injury done by dr shrapnels defence of a poacher on his uncles estate with the severe chastisement inflicted by mr romfrey in revenge for it he would not leave the subject i see himsee his eyes cried rosamund her bosom heaving and sinking deep as her conscience quavered within her at last mr romfrey mentioned me he stood up and said you had been personally insulted by dr shrapnel rosamund meditated in a distressing doubt of her conscientious truthfulness captain beauchamp will be coming to me and how can i answer him heaven knows i would have shielded the poor man if possiblepoor wretch wicked though he is one has only to hear of him suffering but what can i answer i do recollect now that mr romfrey compelled me from question to question to confess that the man had vexed me insulted i never said at the worst i said vexed i would not have said insulted or even offended because mr romfrey ah we know him what i did say i forget i have no guide to what i said but my present feelings and they are pity for the unfortunate man much more than dislikewell i must go through the scene with nevil rosamund concluded her outcry of ostensible exculpation she asked in a cooler moment how it was that captain beauchamp had so far forgotten himself as to burst out on his uncle before the guests of the house it appeared that he had wished his uncle to withdraw with him and mr romfrey had bidden him postpone private communications rosamund gathered from one or two words of cecilias that mr romfrey until finally stung by nevil had indulged in his best humoured banter chapter xxxiv the face of rene shortly before the ringing of the dinner bell rosamund knocked at beauchamps dressing room door the bearer of a telegram from bevisham he read it in one swift run of the eyes and said come in maam i have something for you madame de rouaillout sends you this rosamund saw her name written in a french hand on the back of the card you stay with us nevil to night and to morrow perhaps the danger seems to be over has dr shrapnel been in danger he has if its quite over now i declare to you nevil listen to me maam im in the dark about this murderous businessan old man defenceless harmless as a childbut i know this that you are somewhere in it nevil do you not guess at some one else he yes he but cecil baskelett led no blind man to dr shrapnels gate nevil as i live i knew nothing of it no but you set fire to the train you hated the old man and you taught mr romfrey to think that you had been insulted i see it all now you must have the courage to tell him of your error theres no other course for you i mean to take mr romfrey to dr shrapnel to save the honour of our family as far as it can be saved what nevil exclaimed rosamund gaping it seems little enough maam but he must go i will have the apology spoken and man to man but you would never tell your uncle that he laughed in his uncles manner but nevil my dearest forgive me i think of youwhy are the halketts here it is not entirely with colonel halketts consent it is your uncles influence with him that gives you your chance do you not care to avail yourself of it ever since he heard dr shrapnels letter to you colonel halkett has i am sure been tempted to confound you with him in his mind ah nevil but recollect that it is only mr romfrey who can help to give you your cecilia there is no dispensing with him postpone your attempt to humiliatei mean that is oh nevil whatever you intend to do to overcome your uncle trust to time be friends with him be a little worldly for her sake to ensure her happiness beauchamp obtained the information that his cousin cecil had read out the letter of dr shrapnel at mount laurels the bell rang do you imagine i should sit at my uncles table if i did not intend to force him to repair the wrong he has done to himself and to us he said oh nevil do you not see captain baskelett at work here what amends can cecil baskelett make my uncle is a man of honour it is in his power there i leave you to speak to him you will do it to night after we break up in the drawing room rosamund groaned an apology to dr shrapnel from mr romfrey it is an impossibility nevil utter so you say to sit idle but do as i tell you he went downstairs he had barely reproached her she wondered at that and then remembered his alien sad half smile in quitting the room rosamund would not present herself at her lords dinner table when there were any guests at steynham she prepared to receive miss halkett in the drawing room as the guests of the house this evening chanced to be her friends madame de rouaillouts present to her was a photograph of m de croisnel his daughter and son in a group rosamund could not bear to look at the face of rene and she put it out of sight but she had looked she was reduced to look again roland stood beside his fathers chair rene sat at his feet clasping his right hand m de croisnels fallen eyelids and unshorn white chin told the story of the family reunion he was dying his two children were nursing him to the end decidedly cecilia was a more beautiful woman than rene but on which does the eye linger longestwhich draws the heart a radiant landscape where the tall ripe wheat flashes between shadow and shine in the stately march of summer or the peep into dewy woodland on to dark water dark eyed rene was not beauty but attraction she touched the double chords within us which are we know not whether harmony or discord but a divine discord if an uncertified harmony memorable beyond plain sweetness or majesty there are touches of bliss in anguish that superhumanize bliss touches of mystery in simplicity of the eternal in the variable these two chords of poignant antiphony she struck throughout the range of the hearts of men and strangely intervolved them in vibrating unison only to look at her face without hearing her voice without the charm of her speech was to feel it on cecilias entering the drawing room sofa while the gentlemen drank claret rosamund handed her the card of the photographic artist of tours mentioning no names i should say the portrait is correct a want of spirituality rosamund said critically using one of the insular commonplaces after that manner of fastening upon what there is not in a piece of art or nature cecilias avidity to see and study the face preserved her at a higher mark she knew the person instantly had no occasion to ask who this was she sat over the portrait blushing burningly and that is a brother she said that is her brother roland and very like her except in complexion said rosamund cecilia murmured of a general resemblance in the features rene enchained her though but a sun shadow the vividness of this french face came out surprisingly air was in the nostrils and speech flew from the tremulous mouth the eyes were they quivering with internal light or were they set to seem so in the sensitive strange curves of the eyelids whose awakened lashes appeared to tremble on some borderland between lustreful significance and the mists she caught at the nerves like certain aoristic combinations in music like tones of a stringed instrument swept by the wind enticing unseizable yet she sat there at her fathers feet gazing out into the world indifferent to spectators indifferent even to the common sentiment of gracefulness her left hand clasped his right and she supported herself on the floor with the other hand leaning away from him to the destruction of conventional symmetry in the picture none but a woman of consummate breeding dared have done as she did it was not southern suppleness that saved her from the charge of harsh audacity but something of the kind of genius in her mood which has hurried the greater poets of sound and speech to impose their naturalness upon accepted laws or show the laws to have been our meagre limitations the writer in this country will however be made safest and the excellent body of self appointed thongmen who walk up and down our ranks flapping their leathern straps to terrorize us from experiments in imagery will best be satisfied by the statement that she was indescribable a term that exacts no labour of mind from him or from them for it flows off the pen as readily as it fills a vacuum that posture of rene displeased cecilia and fascinated her in an exhibition of paintings she would have passed by it in pure displeasure but here was nevils first love the woman who loved him and she was french after a continued study of her cecilias growing jealousy betrayed itself in a conscious rivalry of race coming to the admission that englishwomen cannot fling themselves about on the floor without agonizing the graces possibly too they cannot look singularly without risks in the direction of slyness and brazen archness or talk animatedly without dipping in slang conventional situations preserve them and interchange dignity with them still life befits them pre eminently that judicial seat from which in briefest speech they deliver their judgements upon their foreign sisters jealousy it was that plucked cecilia from her majestic place and caused her to envy in rene things she would otherwise have disapproved at last she had seen the french ladys likeness the effect of it was a horrid trouble in cecilias cool blood abasement a sense of eclipse hardly any sense of deserving worthiness what am i but an heiress nevil had once called her beautiful his praise had given her beauty but what is beauty when it is outshone ask the owners of gems you think them rich they are pining then too this rene who looked electrical in repose might really love nevil with a love that sent her heart out to him in his enterprises justifying and adoring him piercing to the hero in his very thoughts would she not see that his championship of the unfortunate man dr shrapnel was heroic cecilia surrendered the card to rosamund and it was out of sight when beauchamp stepped in the drawing room his cheeks were flushed he had been one against three for the better part of an hour are you going to show me the downs to morrow morning cecilia said to him and he replied you will have to be up early whats that asked the colonel at beauchamps heels he was volunteering to join the party of two for the early mornings ride to the downs mr romfrey pressed his shoulder saying theres no third horse can do it in my stables colonel halkett turned to him i had your promise to come over the kennels with me and see how i treat a cry of mad dog which is ninety nine times out of a hundred mad fool man mr romfrey added by that the colonel knew he meant to stand by nevil still and offer him his chance of winning cecilia having pledged his word not to interfere colonel halkett submitted and muttered ah the kennels considering however what he had been witnessing of nevils behaviour to his uncle the colonel was amazed at mr romfreys magnanimity in not cutting him off and disowning him why the downs he said why the deuce colonel a question quite as reasonable and mr romfrey laughed under his breath to relieve an uncertainty in cecilias face that might soon have become confusion he described the downs fronting the paleness of earliest dawn and then their arch and curve and dip against the pearly grey of the half glow and then among their hollows lo the illumination of the east all around and up and away and a gallop for miles along the turfy thymy rolling billows land to left sea to right below you its the nearest hit to wings we can make cecilia he surprised her with her christian name which kindled in her the secret of something he expected from that ride on the downs compare you the alps with them if you could jump on the back of an eagle you might the alps have height but the downs have swiftness those long stretching lines of the downs are greyhounds in full career to look at them is to set the blood racing speed is on the downs glorious motion odorous air of sea and herb exquisite as in the isles of greece and the continental travelling ninnies leave england for healthrun off and forth from the downs to the steamboat the railway the steaming hotel the tourists shivering mountain top in search of sensations there on the downs the finest and liveliest are at their bidding ready to fly through them like hosts of angels he spoke somewhat in that strain either to relieve cecilia or prepare the road for nevil not in his ordinary style on the contrary with a swing of enthusiasm that seemed to spring of ancient heartfelt fervours and indeed soon afterward he was telling her that there on those downs in full view of steynham he and his wife had first joined hands beauchamp sat silent mr romfrey despatched orders to the stables and rosamund to the kitchen cecilia was rather dismayed by the formal preparations for the ride she declined the early cup of coffee mr romfrey begged her to take it who knows the hour when youll be back he said beauchamp said nothing the room grew insufferable to cecilia she would have liked to be wafted to her chamber in a veil so shamefully unveiled did she seem to be but the french lady would have been happy in her place her father kissed her as fathers do when they hand the bride into the travelling carriage his good night my darling was in the voice of a soldier on duty for a concluding sign that her dim apprehensions pointed correctly mr romfrey kissed her on the forehead she could not understand how it had come to pass that she found herself suddenly on this incline precipitated whither she would fain be going only less hurriedly less openly and with her secret merely peeping like a dove in the breast chapter xxxv the ride in the wrong direction that pure opaque of the line of downs ran luminously edged against the pearly morning sky with its dark landward face crepusculine yet clear in every combe every dotting copse and furze bush every wavy fall and the ripple crease and rill like descent of the turf beauty of darkness was there as well as beauty of light above beauchamp and cecilia rode forth before the sun was over the line while the west and north west sides of the rolling downs were stamped with such firmness of dusky feature as you see on the indentations of a shield of tarnished silver the mounting of the sun behind threw an obscurer gloom and gradually a black mask overcame them until the rays shot among their folds and windings and shadows rich as the black pansy steady as on a dialplate rounded with the hour mr everard romfrey embraced this view from steynham windows and loved it the lengths of gigantic greyhound backs coursing along the south were his vision of delight no image of repose for him but of the life in swiftness he had known them when the great bird of the downs was not a mere tradition and though he owned conscientiously to never having beheld the bird a certain mystery of holiness hung about the region where the bird had been in his time there too with a timely word he had gained a wealthy and good wife he had now sent nevil to do the same this astute gentleman had caught at the idea of a ride of the young couple to the downs with his customary alacrity of perception as being the very best arrangement for hurrying them to the point at steynham nevil was sure to be howling all day over his tumbled joss shrapnel once away in the heart of the downs and cecilia beside him it was a matter of calculation that two or three hours of the sharpening air would screw his human nature to the pitch in fact unless each of them was reluctant they could hardly return unbetrothed cecilias consent was foreshadowed by her submission in going mr romfrey had noticed her fright at the suggestive formalities he cast round the expedition and felt sure of her taking nevil for a man who could smell the perfume of a ripe affirmative on the sweetest of lips he was pretty well sure of him likewise and then a truce to all that radical rageing and hot pokering of the country and lie in peace old shrapnel and get on your legs when you can and offend no more especially be mindful not to let fly one word against a woman with cecilia for wife and a year of marriage devoted to a son and heir nevil might be expected to resume his duties as a naval officer and win an honourable name for the inheritance of the young one he kissed there was benevolence in these previsions of mr romfrey proving how good it is for us to bow to despotic authority if only we will bring ourselves unquestioningly to accept the previous deeds of the directing hand colonel halkett gave up his daughter for lost when she did not appear at the breakfast table for yet more decidedly lost when the luncheon saw her empty place and as time drew on toward the dinner hour he began to think her lost beyond hope embarked for good and all with the madbrain some little hope of a dissension between the pair arising from the natural antagonism of her strong sense to nevils extravagance had buoyed him until it was evident that they must have alighted at an inn to eat which signified that they had overleaped the world and its hurdles and were as dreamy a leash of lovers as ever made a dreamland of hard earth the downs looked like dreamland through the long afternoon they shone as in a veil of silksoftly fair softly dark no spot of harshness was on them save where a quarry south westward gaped at the evening sun red light struck into that round chalk maw and the green slopes and channels and half circle hollows were brought a mile stride nigher steynham by the level beams the poor old colonel fell to a more frequent repetition of the well with which he had been unconsciously expressing his perplexed mind in the kennels and through the covers during the day none of the gentlemen went to dress mr culbrett was indoors conversing with rosamund culling whats come to them the colonel asked of mr romfrey who said shrugging something wrong with one of the horses it had happened to him on one occasion to set foot in the hole of a baked hedgehog that had furnished a repast not without succulence to some shepherd of the downs such a case might have recurred it was more likely to cause an upset at a walk than at a gallop or perhaps a shoe had been cast and young people break no bones at a walking fall ten to one if they do at their top speed horses manage to kill their seniors for them the young are exempt from accident colonel halkett nodded and sighed i daresay theyre safe its that man shrapnels letterthat letter romfrey a private letter i know but ive not heard nevil disown the opinions expressed in it i submit its no use resisting i treat my daughter as a woman capable of judging for herself i repeat i submit i havent a word against nevil except on the score of his politics i like him all i have to say is i dont approve of a republican and a sceptic for my son in law i yield to you and my daughter if she i think she does colonel marriagell cure the fellow nevil will slough his craze off old coat cissy will drive him in strings my wife i hear him mr romfrey laughed quietly its all my country now the dogll be uxorious he wants fixing nothing worse how he goes on about shrapnel i shouldnt think much of him if he didnt youre one in a thousand romfrey i object to seeing a man worshipped its nevils green sickness and shrapnels the god of it i trust to heaven youre right it seems to me young fellows ought to be out of it earlier they generally are mr romfrey named some of the processes by which they are relieved of brain flightiness adding philosophically this way or that his quick ear caught a sound of hoofs cantering down the avenue on the northern front of the house he consulted his watch ten minutes to eight say a quarter past for dinner theyre here colonel mr romfrey met nevil returning from the stables cecilia had disappeared had a good day said mr romfrey beauchamp replied ill tell you of it after dinner and passed by him mr romfrey edged round to colonel halkett conjecturing in his mind they have not hit it as he remarked breakfast and luncheon have been omitted in this days fare which appeared to the colonel a confirmation of his worst fears or rather the extinction of his last spark of hope he knocked at his daughters door in going upstairs to dress cecilia presented herself and kissed him well said he by and by papa she answered i have a headache beg mr romfrey to excuse me no news for me she had no news mrs culling was with her the colonel stepped on mystified to his room when the door had closed cecilia turned to rosamund and burst into tears rosamund felt that it must be something grave indeed for the proud young lady so to betray a troubled spirit he is illdr shrapnel is very ill cecilia responded to one or two subdued inquiries in as clear a voice as she could command where have you heard of him rosamund asked we have been there bevisham to bevisham rosamund was considering the opinion mr romfrey would form of the matter from the point of view of his horses it was nevils wish said cecilia yes and you went with him rosamund encouraged her to proceed gladdened at hearing her speak of nevil by that name you have not been on the downs at all cecilia mentioned a junction railway station they had ridden to and thence boxing the horses by train to bevisham rosamund understood that some haunting anxiety had fretted nevil during the night in the morning he could not withstand it and he begged cecilia to change their destination apparently with a vehemence of entreaty that had been irresistible or else it was utter affection for him had reduced her to undertake the distasteful journey she admitted that she was not the most sympathetic companion nevil could have had on the way either going or coming she had not entered dr shrapnels cottage remaining on horseback she had seen the poor man reclining in his garden chair mr lydiard was with him and also his ward miss denham who had been summoned by telegraph by one of the servants from switzerland and cecilia had heard nevil speak of his uncle to her and too humbly she hinted nor had the expression of miss denhams countenance in listening to him pleased her but it was true that a heavily burdened heart cannot be expected to look pleasing on the way home cecilia had been compelled in some degree to defend mr romfrey blushing through her tears at the remembrance of a past emotion that had been mixed with foresight she confessed to rosamund she thought it now too late to prevent a rupture between nevil and his uncle had some one whom nevil trusted and cared for taken counsel with him and advised him before uncle and nephew met to discuss this most unhappy matter then there might have been hope as it was the fate of dr shrapnel had gained entire possession of nevil every retort of his uncles in reference to it rose up in him he used language of contempt neighbouring abhorrence he stipulated for one sole thing to win back his esteem for his uncle and that was the apology to dr shrapnel and to night cecilia concluded he will request mr romfrey to accompany him to bevisham to morrow morning to make the apology in person he will not accept the slightest evasion he thinks dr shrapnel may die and the honour of the familywhat is it he says of it cecilia raised her eyes to the ceiling while rosamund blinked in impatience and grief just apprehending the alien state of the young ladys mind in her absence of recollection as well as her bondage in the effort to recollect accurately have you not eaten any food to day miss halkett she said for it might be the want of food which had broken her and changed her manner cecilia replied that she had ridden for an hour to mount laurels alone mr romfrey must not hear of that said rosamund cecilia consented to lie down on her bed she declined the dainties rosamund pressed on her she was feverish with a deep and unconcealed affliction and behaved as if her pride had gone but if her pride had gone she would have eased her heart by sobbing outright a similar division harassed her as when her friend nevil was the candidate for bevisham she condemned his extreme wrath with his uncle yet was attracted and enchained by the fire of passionate attachment which aroused it and she was conscious that she had but shown obedience to his wishes throughout the day not sympathy with his feelings under cover of a patient desire to please she had nursed irritation and jealousy the degradation of the sense of jealousy increasing the irritation having consented to the ride to dr shrapnel should she not to be consistent have dismounted there o half heart a whole one though it be an erring like that of the french lady does at least live and has a history and makes music but the faint and uncertain is jarred in action jarred in memory ever behind the day and in the shadow of it cecilia reviewed herself jealous disappointed vexed ashamed she had been all day a graceless companion a bad actress and at the days close she was loving nevil the better for what had dissatisfied distressed and wounded her she was loving him in emulation of his devotedness to another person and that other was a revolutionary common peoples doctor an infidel a traitor to his countrys dearest interests but nevil loved him and it had become impossible for her not to covet the love or to think of the old offender without the halo cast by nevils attachment being upon him so intensely was she moved by her intertwisting reflections that in an access of bodily fever she stood up and moved before the glass to behold the image of the woman who could be the victim of these childish emotions and no wonderful contrast struck her eyes she appeared to herself as poor and small as they how could she aspire to a man like nevil beauchamp if he had made her happy by wooing her she would not have adored him as she did now he likes my hair she said smoothing it out and then pressing her temples like one insane two minutes afterward she was telling rosamund her head ached less this terrible dr shrapnel rosamund exclaimed but reported that no loud voices were raised in the dining room colonel halkett came to see his daughter full of anxiety and curiosity affairs had been peaceful below for he was ignorant of the expedition to bevisham on hearing of it he frowned questioned cecilia as to whether she had set foot on that mans grounds then said ah well we leave to morrow i must go i have business at home i cant delay it i sanctioned no calling there nothing of the kind from steynham to bevisham goodness its rank madness im not astonished youre sick and ill he waited till he was assured cecilia had no special matter to relate and recommending her to drink the tea mrs culling had made for her and then go to bed and sleep he went down to the drawing room charged with the worst form of hostility toward nevil the partly diplomatic cecilia smiled at her fathers mention of sleep she was in the contest of the two men however inanimately she might be lying overhead and the assurance in her mind that neither of them would give ground so similar were they in their tenacity of will dissimilar in all else dragged her this way and that till she swayed lifeless between them one may be as a weed of the sea while ones fate is being decided to love is to be on the sea out of sight of land to love a man like nevil beauchamp is to be on the sea in tempest still to persist in loving would be noble and but for this humiliation of utter helplessness an enviable power her thoughts ran thus in shame and yearning and regret dimly discerning where her heart failed in the strength which was nevils though it was a full heart faithful and not void of courage but he never brooded he never blushed from insufficiencythe faintness of a desire the callow passion that cannot fly and feed itself he never tottered he walked straight to his mark she set up his image and renes and cowered under the heroical shapes till she felt almost extinct with her weak limbs and head worthlessly paining the little infantile i within her ceased to wail dwindled beyond sensation rosamund waiting on her in the place of her maid saw two big drops come through her closed eyelids and thought that if it could be granted to nevil to look for a moment on this fair and proud young ladys loveliness in abandonment it would tame melt and save him the gods presiding over custom do not permit such renovating sights to men chapter xxxvi pursuit of the apology of mr romfrey to dr shrapnel the contest which was an alternation of hard hitting and close wrestling had recommenced when colonel halkett stepped into the drawing room colonel i find theyve been galloping to bevisham and back said mr romfrey ive heard of it the colonel replied not perceiving a sign of dissatisfaction on his friends face he continued to that man shrapnel cecilia did not dismount said beauchamp you took her to that mans gate it was not with my sanction you know my ideas of the man if you were to see him now colonel i dont think you would speak harshly of him were not obliged to go and look on men who have had their measure dealt them barbarously said beauchamp mr romfrey in the most placid manner took a chair windy talk that he said colonel halkett seated himself stukely culbrett turned a sheet of manuscript he was reading beauchamp began a caged lions walk on the rug under the mantelpiece i shall not spare you from hearing what i think of it sir weve had what you think of it twice over said mr romfrey i suppose it was the first time for information the second time for emphasis and the rest counts to keep it alive in your recollection this is what you have to take to heart sir that dr shrapnel is now seriously ill im sorry for it and ill pay the doctors bill you make it hard for me to treat you with respect fire away those radical friends of yours have to learn a lesson and its worth a purse to teach them that a lady however feeble she may seem to them is exactly of the strength of the best man of her acquaintance thats well said came from colonel halkett beauchamp stared at him amazed by the commendation of empty language you acted in error barbarously but in error he addressed his uncle and you have got a fine topic for mouthing mr romfrey rejoined you mean to sit still under dr shrapnels forgiveness hes taken to copy the christian religion has he you know you were deluded when you struck him not a whit yes you know it now mrs culling drag in no woman nevil beauchamp she has confessed to you that dr shrapnel neither insulted her nor meant to ruffle her she has done no such nonsense if she has notbut i trust her to have done it you play the trumpeter you terrorize her into opening her lips wider nothing else ill have the truth from her and no mincing and from cecil baskelett and palmet give cecil a second licking if you can and have him off to shrapnel you cried beauchamp at this juncture stukely culbrett closed the manuscript in his hands and holding it out to beauchamp said heres your letter nevil its tolerably hard to decipher its mild enough its middling good pulpit i like it what have you got there colonel halkett asked him a letter of his friend dr shrapnel on the country read a bit colonel i that letter mild do you call it the colonel started back his chair in declining to touch the letter try it said stukely its the letter they have been making the noise about it ought to be printed theres a hit or two at the middle class that i should like to see in print its really not bad pulpit and i suspect that what you object to colonel is only the dust of a well thumped cushion shrapnel thumps with his fist he doesnt say much thats new if the parsons were men theyd be saying it every sunday if they did colonel i should hear you saying amen wait till they do say it thats a long stretch theyre turn cocks of one water companyto wash the greasy citizens youre keeping nevil on the gape said mr romfrey with a whimsical shrewd cast of the eye at beauchamp who stood alert not to be foiled arrow like in look and readiness to repeat his home shot mr romfrey wanted to hear more of that unintelligible you of beauchamps but stukely culbrett intended that the latter should be foiled and he continued his diversion from the angry subject well drop the sacerdotals he said theyre behind a veil for us and so are we for them im with you colonel i wouldnt have them persecuted they sting fearfully when whipped no one listens to them now except the class that goes to sleep under them to set an example to the class that cant understand them shrapnel is like the breeze shaking the turf grass outside the church doors a trifle fresher he knocks nothing down he cant ejaculated the colonel he sermonizes to shake thats all i know the kind of man thank heaven its not a common species in england common enough to be classed beauchamp struck through the conversation of the pair can i see you alone to night sir or to morrow morning you may catch me where you can was mr romfreys answer wheres that its for your sake and mine not for dr shrapnels i have to speak to you and must you have done your worst with him you cant undo it you have to think of your honour as a gentleman i intend to treat you with respect but wolf is the title now whether i say it or not shrapnels a rather long legged sheep he asks for nothing from you he would have got nothing at a cry of peccavi he was innocent perfectly blameless he would not lie to save himself you mistook that forbut you were an engine shot along a line of rails he does you the justice to say you acted in error and youre his parrot he pardons you ha t other cheek you went on that brutes errand in ignorance will you keep to the character now you know the truth hesitation about it doubles the infamy an old man the best of men the kindest and truest the most unselfish he tops me by half a head and hes my junior beauchamp suffered himself to give out a groan of sick derision ah and it was no joke holding him tight said mr romfrey id as lief snap an ash the fellow he leaned round to colonel halkett must be a fellow of a fine constitution and he took his punishment like a man ive known worse and far worse gentlemen by birth theres the choice of taking it upright or fighting like a rabbit with a weasel in his hole leave him to think it over hell come right i think no harm of him ive no animus a man must have his lesson at some time of life i did what i had to do look here nevil stukely culbrett checked beauchamp in season i beg to inquire what dr shrapnel means by the people we have in our country the nobles and the squires and after them as i understand it the people thats to say the middle class and the working classfat and lean im quite with shrapnel when he lashes the fleshpots they want it and they dont get it from their organ the press i fancy you and i agree about their organ the dismallest organ that ever ground a hackneyed set of songs and hymns to madden the thoroughfares the press of our country interjected colonel halkett in moaning parenthesis its the week day parson of the middle class colonel they have their thinking done for them as the chinese have their dancing but nevil your dr shrapnel seems to treat the traders as identical with the aristocracy in opposition to his people the traders are the cursed middlemen bad friends of the people and infernally treacherous to the nobles till money hoists them its they who pull down the country they hold up the nobles to the hatred of the democracy and the democracy to scare the nobles ones when they want to swallow a privilege and the others when they want to ring fence their gains how is it shrapnel doesnt expose the trick he must see through it i like that letter of his people is one of your radical big words that burst at a query he cant mean quince and bottom and starveling christopher sly jack cade caliban and poor old hodge no no nevil our clowns are the stupidest in europe they cant cook their meals they cant spell they can scarcely speak they havent a jig in their legs and i believe theyre losing their grin theyre nasty when their bloods up shakespeares cade tells you what he thought of radicalizing the people and as for your mother ill make her a duke thats one of their songs the word people in england is a dyspeptic agitators dream when he falls nodding over the red chapter of french history who won the great liberties for england my book says the nobles and who made the great stand laterthe squires what have the middlemen done but bid for the people they despise and fear dishonour us abroad and make a hash of us at home shrapnel sees that only he has got the word people in his mouth the people of england my dear fellow want heading since the traders obtained power we have been a country on all fours of course shrapnel sees it i say so but talk to him and teach him where to look for the rescue colonel halkett said to stukely if you have had a clear idea in what you have just spoken my heads no place for it stukelys unusually lengthy observations had somewhat heated him and he protested with earnestness it was pure tory my dear colonel but the habitually and professedly cynical should not deliver themselves at length for as soon as they miss their customary incision of speech they are apt to aim to recover it in loquacity and thus it may be that the survey of their ideas becomes disordered mr culbrett endangered his reputation for epigram in a good cause it shall be said these interruptions were torture to beauchamp nevertheless the end was gained he sank into a chair silent mr romfrey wished to have it out with his nephew of whose comic appearance as a man full of thunder and occasionally rattling yet all the while trying to be decorous and politic he was getting tired he foresaw that a tussle between them in private would possibly be too hot for his temper admirably under control though it was why not drag cecil to shrapnel he said for a provocation beauchamp would not be goaded colonel halkett remarked that he would have to leave steynham the next day his host remonstrated with him the colonel said early he had very particular business at home he was positive and declined every inducement to stay mr romfrey glanced at nevil thinking you poor fool and then he determined to let the fellow have five minutes alone with him this occurred at midnight in that half armoury half library which was his private room rosamund heard their voices below she cried out to herself that it was her doing and blamed her beloved and her master and dr shrapnel in the breath of her self recrimination the demagogue the over punctilious gentleman the faint lover surely it must be reason wanting in the three for each of them in turn to lead the other by an excess of some sort of the quality constituting their mens natures to wreck a calm life and stand in contention had shrapnel been commonly reasonable he would have apologized to mr romfrey or had mr romfrey he would not have resorted to force to punish the supposed offender or had nevil he would have held his peace until he had gained his bride as it was the folly of the three knocked at her heart uniting to bring the heavy accusation against one poor woman quite in the old way the who is she of the mocking spaniard at mention of a social catastrophe rosamund had a great deal of the pride of her sex and she resented any slur on it she felt almost superciliously toward mr romfrey and nevil for their not taking hands to denounce the plotter cecil baskelett they seemed a pair of victims to him nearly as much so as the wretched man shrapnel it was their senselessness which made her guilty and simply because she had uttered two or three exclamations of dislike of a revolutionary and infidel she was compelled to groan under her present oppression is there anything to be hoped of men rosamund thought bitterly of nevils idea of their progress heaven help them but the unhappy creatures have ceased to look to a heaven for help we see the consequence of it in this shrapnel complication three men and one struck down the other defeated in his benevolent intentions the third sacrificing fortune and happiness all three owing their mischance to one or other of the vague ideas disturbing mens heads where shall we look for mother witor say common sucklings instinct not to men thought rosamund she was listening to the voices of mr romfrey and beauchamp in a fever ordinarily the lord of steynham was not out of his bed later than twelve oclock at night his door opened at half past one not a syllable was exchanged by the couple in the hall they had fought it out mr romfrey came upstairs alone and on the closing of his chamber door she slipped down to beauchamp and had a dreadful hour with him that subdued her disposition to sit in judgement upon men the unavailing attempt to move his uncle had wrought him to the state in which passionate thoughts pass into speech like heat to flame rosamund strained her mental sight to gain a conception of his prodigious horror of the treatment of dr shrapnel that she might think him sane and to retain a vestige of comfort in her bosom she tried to moderate and make light of as much as she could conceive between the two efforts she had no sense but that of helplessness once more she was reduced to promise that she would speak the whole truth to mr romfrey even to the fact that she had experienced a common womans jealousy of dr shrapnels influence and had alluded to him jealously spitefully and falsely there was no mercy in beauchamp he was for action at any cost with all the forces he could gather and without delays he talked of cecilia as his uncles bride to him rosamund could hardly trust her ears when he informed her he had told his uncle of his determination to compel him to accomplish the act of penitence was it prudent to say it nevil she asked but as in his politics he disdained prudence a monstrous crime had been committed involving the honour of the family no subtlety of insinuation no suggestion could wean him from the fixed idea that the apology to dr shrapnel must be spoken by his uncle in person if one could only imagine mr romfrey doing it rosamund groaned he shall and you will help him said beauchamp if you loved a woman half as much as you do that man if i knew a woman as good as wise as noble as he you are losing her you expect me to go through ceremonies of courtship at a time like this if she cares for me she will feel with me simple compassionbut let miss halkett be im afraid i overtasked her in taking her to bevisham she remained outside the garden maam she is unsullied by contact with a single shrub of dr shrapnels territory do not be so bitterly ironical nevil you have not seen her as i have rosamund essayed a tender sketch of the fair young lady and fancied that she drew forth a sigh she would have coloured the sketch but he commanded her to hurry off to bed and think of her mornings work a commission of which we feel we can accurately forecast the unsuccessful end is not likely to be undertaken with an ardour that might perhaps astound the presageing mind with unexpected issues rosamund fulfilled hers in the style of one who has learnt a lesson and exactly as she had anticipated mr romfrey accused her of coming to him from a conversation with that fellow nevil overnight he shrugged and left the house for his mornings walk across the fields colonel halkett and cecilia beheld him from the breakfast room returning with beauchamp who had waylaid him and was hammering his part in the now endless altercation it could be descried at any distance and how fine was mr romfreys bearingtruly noble by contrast as of a grave big dog worried by a small barking dog there is to an unsympathetic observer an intense vexatiousness in the exhibition of such pertinacity to a soldier accustomed at a glance to estimate powers of attack and defence this repeated puny assailing of a fortress that required years of siege was in addition ridiculous mr romfrey appeared impregnable and beauchamp mad hes foaming again said the colonel and was only ultra pictorial before breakfast was a further slur on beauchamp mr romfrey was elevated by the extraordinary comicality of the notion of the proposed apology to heights of humour beyond laughter whence we see the unbounded capacity of the general man for folly and rather commiserate than deride him he was quite untroubled it demanded a steady view of the other side of the case to suppose of one whose control of his temper was perfect that he could be in the wrong he at least did not think so and colonel halkett relied on his common sense beauchamps brows were smouldering heavily except when he had to talk he looked paleish and worn and said he had been up early cecilia guessed that he had not been to bed it was dexterously contrived by her host in spite of the colonels manifest anxiety to keep them asunder that she should have some minutes with beauchamp out in the gardens mr romfrey led them out and then led the colonel away to offer him a choice of pups of rare breed nevil said cecilia you will not think it presumption in me to give you advice her counsel to him was that he should leave steynham immediately and trust to time for his uncle to reconsider his conduct beauchamp urged the counter argument of the stain on the family honour she hinted at expediency he frankly repudiated it the downs faced them where the heavenly vast might have been of yesterday wandered thinner than a shadow of to day weaving a story without beginning crisis or conclusion flowerless and fruitless but with something of infinite in it sweeter to brood on than the future of her life to cecilia if meanwhile dr shrapnel should die and repentance comes too late said beauchamp she had no clear answer to that save the hope of its being an unfounded apprehension as far as it is in my power nevil i will avoid injustice to him in my thoughts he gazed at her thankfully well said he thats like sighting the cliffs but i dont feel home round me while the colonel is so strangely prepossessed for a high spirited gentleman like your father to approve or at least accept an act so barbarous is incomprehensible speak to him cecilia will you let him know your ideas she assented he said instantly persuade him to speak to my uncle everard she was tempted to smile i must do only what i think wise if i am to be of service nevil true but paint that scene to him an old man utterly defenceless making no defence a cruel error the colonel cant or he doesnt clearly get it inside him otherwise im certain it would revolt him just as i am certain my uncle everard is at this moment a stone blind man if he has done a thing he cant question it wont examine it the thing becomes a part of him as much as his hand or his head hes a man of the twelfth century your father might be helped to understand him first yes she said not very warmly though sadly tell the colonel how it must have been brought about for cecil baskelett called on dr shrapnel two days before mr romfrey stood at his gate the name of cecil caused her to draw in her shoulders in a half shudder it may indeed be captain baskelett who set this cruel thing in motion then point that out to your father said he perceiving a chance of winning her to his views through a concrete object of her dislike and cooling toward the woman who betrayed a vulgar characteristic of her sex who was merely woman unable sternly to recognize the doing of a foul wrong because of her antipathy until another antipathy enlightened her he wanted in fact a ready made heroine and did not give her credit for the absence of fire in her blood as well as for the unexercised imagination which excludes young women from the power to realize unwonted circumstances we men walking about the world have perhaps no more imagination of matters not domestic than they but what we have is quick with experience we see the thing we hear of women come to it how they can cecilia was recommended to weave a narrative for her father and ultimately induce him if she could to give a gentlemans opinion of the case to mr romfrey her sensitive ear caught a change of tone in the directions she received your father will say so and so answer him with this and that beauchamp supplied her with phrases she was to renew and renew the attack hammer as he did yesterday she had followed him to day she was to march beside himhardly as an equal patience was the word she would have uttered in her detection of the one frailty in his nature which this hurrying of her off her feet opened her eyes to with unusual perspicacity still she leaned to him sufficiently to admit that he had grounds for a deep disturbance of his feelings he said i go to dr shrapnels cottage and dont know how to hold up my head before miss denham she confided him to me when she left for switzerland there was that to be thought of certainly colonel halkett came round a box bush and discovered them pacing together in a fashion to satisfy his paternal scrutiny ive been calling you several times my dear he complained we start in seven minutes bustle and bonnet at once nevil im sorry for this business good bye be a good boy nevil he murmured kindheartedly and shook beauchamps hand with the cordiality of an extreme relief in leaving him behind the colonel and mr romfrey and beauchamp were standing on the hall steps when rosamund beckoned the latter and whispered a request for that letter of dr shrapnels it is for miss halkett nevil he plucked the famous epistle from his bulging pocketbook and added a couple of others in the same handwriting tell her a first readingits difficult to read at first he said and burned to read it to cecilia himself to read it to her with his comments and explanations appeared imperative it struck him in a flash that cecilias counsel to him to quit steynham for awhile was good and if he went to bevisham he would be assured of dr shrapnels condition notes and telegrams from the cottage were too much tempered to console and deceive him send my portmanteau and bag after me to bevisham he said to rosamund and announced to the woefully astonished colonel that he would have the pleasure of journeying in his company as far as the town are you ready no packing said the colonel its better to have your impediments in the rear of you and march said mr romfrey colonel halkett declined to wait for anybody he shouted for his daughter the ladys maid appeared and then cecilia with rosamund we cant entertain you nevil were away to the island im sorry said the colonel and observing cecilias face in full crimson he looked at her as if he had lost a battle by the turn of events at the final moment mr romfrey handed cecilia into the carriage he exchanged a friendly squeeze with the colonel and offered his hand to his nephew beauchamp passed him with a nod and good bye sir have ready at holdesbury for the middle of the month said mr romfrey unruffled and bowed to cecilia if you think of bringing my cousin baskelett give me warning sir cried beauchamp give me warning if you want the house for shrapnel replied his uncle and remarked to rosamund as the carriage wheeled round the mounded laurels to the avenue he maynt be quite cracked the fellow seems to have a turn for catching his opportunity by the tail he had better hold fast for its his last chapter xxxvii cecilia conquered the carriage rolled out of the avenue and through the park for some time parallel with the wavy downs once away from steynham colonel halkett breathed freely as if he had dropped a load he was free of his bond to mr romfrey and so great was the sense of relief in him that he resolved to do battle against his daughter supposing her still lively blush to be the sign of the enemys flag run up on a surrendered citadel his authority was now to be thought of his paternal sanction was in his own keeping beautiful as she looked it was hardly credible that a fellow in possession of his reason could have let slip his chance of such a prize but whether he had or had not the colonel felt that he occupied a position enabling him either to out manuvre or if need were interpose forcibly and punish him for his half heartedness cecilia looked the loveliest of women to beauchamps eyes with her blush and the letters of dr shrapnel in her custody at her express desire certain terms in the letters here and there unsweet to ladies began to trouble his mind by the way colonel he said you had a letter of dr shrapnels read to you by captain baskelett iniquitous rubbish with his comments on it i dare say you thought it so i wont speak of his right to make it public he wanted to produce his impressions of it and me and that is a matter between him and me dr shrapnel makes use of strong words now and then but i undertake to produce a totally different impression on you by reading the letter myselfsparing you he turned to cecilia a word or two common enough to men who write in black earnest and have humour he cited his old favourite the black and bright lecturer on heroes you have read him i know cecilia well dr shrapnel is another who writes in his own style not the leading article style or modern pulpit stuff he writes to rouse he does that to my temper said the colonel perhaps here and there he might offend cecilias taste beauchamp pursued for her behoof everything depends on the mouthpiece i should not like the letter to be read without my being byexcept by men any just minded man may read it seymour austin for example every line is a text to the mind of the writer let me call on you to morrow to morrow colonel halkett put on a thoughtful air to morrow were off to the island for a couple of days and theres lord croystons garden party and the yacht ball come this evening dine with us no reading of letters please i cant stand it nevil the invitation was necessarily declined by a gentleman who could not expect to be followed by supplies of clothes and linen for evening wear that day ah we shall see you some day or other said the colonel cecilia was less alive to beauchamps endeavour to prepare her for the harsh words in the letter than to her fathers insincerity she would have asked her friend to come in the morning next day but for the dread of deepening her blush do you intend to start so early in the morning papa she ventured to say and he replied as early as possible i dont know what news i shall have in bevisham or i would engage to run over to the island said beauchamp with a flattering persistency or singular obtuseness you will dance he subsequently observed to cecilia out of the heart of some reverie he had been her admiring partner on the night before the drive from itchincope into bevisham and perhaps thought of her graceful dancing at the yacht ball and the contrast it would present to his watch beside a sick manstruck down by one of his own family she could have answered not if you wish me not to while smiling at the quaint sorrowfulness of his tone dance quoth colonel halkett whose present temper discerned a healthy antagonism to misanthropic radicals in the performance all young people dance have you given over dancing not entirely colonel cecilia danced with mr tuckham at the yacht ball and was vividly mindful of every slight incident leading to and succeeding her lovers abrupt you will dance which had all passed by her dream like up to that hour his attempt to forewarn her of the phrases she would deem objectionable in dr shrapnels letter his mild acceptation of her fathers hostility his adieu to her and his melancholy departure on foot from the station as she drove away to mount laurels and gaiety why do i dance she asked herself it was not in the spirit of happiness her heart was not with dr shrapnel but very near him and heavy as a chamber of the sick she was afraid of her fathers favourite imagining from the colonels unconcealed opposition to beauchamp that he had designs in the interests of mr tuckham but the hearty gentleman scattered her secret terrors by his bluffness and openness he asked her to remember that she had recommended him to listen to seymour austin and he had done so he said undoubtedly he was much improved much less overbearing he won her confidence by praising and loving her father and when she alluded to the wonderful services he had rendered on the welsh estate he said simply that her fathers thanks repaid him he recalled his former downrightness only in speaking of the case of dr shrapnel upon which both with the colonel and with her he was unreservedly condemnatory of mr romfrey colonel halketts defence of the true knight and guardian of the reputation of ladies fell to pieces in the presence of mr tuckham he had seen dr shrapnel on a visit to mr lydiard whom he described as hanging about bevisham philandering as a married man should not though in truth he might soon expect to be released by the death of his crazy wife the doctor he said had been severely shaken by the monstrous assault made on him and had been most unrighteously handled the doctor was an inoffensive man in his private life detestable and dangerous though his teachings were outside politics mr tuckham went altogether with beauchamp he promised also that old mrs beauchamp should be accurately informed of the state of matters between captain beauchamp and mr romfrey he left mount laurels to go back in attendance on the venerable lady without once afflicting cecilia with a shiver of well founded apprehension and she was grateful to him almost to friendly affection in the vanishing of her unjust suspicion until her father hinted that there was the man of his heart then she closed all avenues to her own a period of maidenly distress not previously unknown to her ensued proposals of marriage were addressed to her by two untitled gentlemen and by the earl of lockrace three within a fortnight the recognition of the young heiresss beauty at the yacht ball was accountable for the bursting out of these fires her father would not have deplored her acceptance of the title of countess of lockrace in the matter of rejections however her will was paramount and he was on her side against relatives when the subject was debated among them he called her attention to the fact impressively telling her that she should not hear a syllable from him to persuade her to marry the emphasis of which struck the unspoken warning on her intelligence bring no man to me of whom i do not approve worthier of you as i hope to become beauchamp had said cecilia lit on that part of dr shrapnels letter where fight this out within you distinctly alluded to the unholy love could she think ill of the man who thus advised him she shared beauchamps painful feeling for him in a sudden tremour of her frame as it were through his touch to the rest of the letter her judgement stood opposed save when a sentence here and there reminded her of captain baskeletts insolent sing song declamation of it and that would have turned sacred writing to absurdity beauchamp had mentioned seymour austin as one to whom he would willingly grant a perusal of the letter mr austin came to mount laurels about the close of the yachting season shortly after colonel halkett had spent his customary days of september shooting at steynham beauchamps folly was the colonels theme for the fellow had dragged lord palmet there and driven his uncle out of patience mr romfreys monumental patience had been exhausted by him the colonel boiled over with accounts of beauchamps behaviour toward his uncle and palmet and baskelett and mrs culling how he flew at and worried everybody who seemed to him to have had a hand in the proper chastisement of that man shrapnel that pestiferous letter of shrapnels was animadverted on of course and i should like you to have heard it austin the colonel said just for you to have a notion of the kind of universal blow up those men are scheming and would hoist us with if they could get a little more blasting powder than they mill in their lunatic heads now cecilia wished for mr austins opinion of dr shrapnel and as the delicate state of her inclinations made her conscious that to give him the letter covertly would be to betray them to him who had once not knowing it moved her to think of a possible great change in her life she mustered courage to say captain beauchamp at my request lent me the letter to read i have it and others written by dr shrapnel her father hummed to himself and immediately begged seymour austin not to waste his time on the stuff though he had no idea that a perusal of it could awaken other than the gravest reprehension in so rational a tory gentleman mr austin read the letter through he asked to see the other letters mentioned by cecilia and read them calmly without a frown or an interjection she sat sketching her father devouring newspaper columns its the writing of a man who means well mr austin delivered his opinion why the mans an infidel colonel halkett exclaimed there are numbers they have the grace not to confess then its as well to know what the worlds made of colonel the clergy shut their eyes theres no treating a disease without reading it and if we are to acknowledge a vice as dr shrapnel would say of the so called middle class it is the smirking over what they think or their not caring to think at all too many time servers rot the state i can understand the effect of such writing on a mind like captain beauchamps it would do no harm to our young men to have those letters read publicly and lectured onby competent persons half the thinking world may think pretty much the same on some points as dr shrapnel they are too wise or too indolent to say it and of the other half about a dozen members would be competent to reply to him he is the earnest man and flies at politics as uneasy young brains fly to literature fancying they can write because they can write with a pen he perceives a bad adjustment of things which is correct he is honest and takes his honesty for a virtue and that entitles him to believe in himself and that belief causes him to see in all opposition to him the wrong he has perceived in existing circumstances and so in a dream of power he invokes the people and as they do not stir he takes to prophecy this is the round of the politics of impatience the study of politics should be guided by some light of statesmanship otherwise it comes to this wild preaching these men are theory tailors not politicians they are the men who make the strait waistcoat for humanity they would fix us to first principles like tethered sheep or hobbled horses i should enjoy replying to him if i had time the whole letter is composed of variations upon one idea still i must say the man interests me i should like to talk to him mr austin paid no heed to the colonels dear me dear me of amazement he said of the style of the letters that it was the puffing of a giant a strong wind rather than speech and begged cecilia to note that men who labour to force their dreams on mankind and turn vapour into fact usually adopt such a style hearing that this private letter had been deliberately read through by mr romfrey and handed by him to captain baskelett who had read it out in various places mr austin said a strange couple he appeared perplexed by his old friends approval of them there we decidedly differ said he when the case of dr shrapnel was related by the colonel with a refusal to condemn mr romfrey he pronounced mr romfreys charges against dr shrapnel taken in conjunction with his conduct to be baseless childish and wanton the colonel would not see the case in that light but cecilia did it was a justification of beauchamp and how could she ever have been blind to itscarcely blind she remembered but sensitively blinking her eyelids to distract her sight in contemplating it and to preserve her repose as to beauchamps demand of the apology mr austin considered that it might be an instance of his want of knowledge of men yet could not be called silly and to call it insane was the rhetoric of an adversary i do call it insane said the colonel he separated himself from his daughter by a sharp division had beauchamp appeared at mount laurels cecilia would have been ready to support and encourage him boldly backed by mr austin she saw some good in dr shrapnels writing much in beauchamps devotedness he shone clear to her reason at last partly because her father in his opposition to him did not but was on the contrary unreasonable cased in mail mentally clouded she sat with mr austin and her father trying repeatedly in obedience to beauchamps commands to bring the latter to a just contemplation of the unhappy case behaviour on her part which rendered the colonel inveterate beauchamp at this moment was occupied in doing secretarys work for dr shrapnel so cecilia learnt from mr lydiard who came to pay his respects to mrs wardour devereux at mount laurels the pursuit of the apology was continued in letters to his uncle and occasional interviews with him which were by no means instigated by the doctor mr lydiard informed the ladies he described beauchamp as acting in the spirit of a man who has sworn an oath to abandon every pleasure in life that he may as far as it lies in his power indemnify his friend for the wrong done to him such men are too terrible for me said mrs devereux cecilia thought the reverse not for me but she felt a strain upon her nature and she was miserable in her alienation from her father kissing him one night she laid her head on his breast and begged his forgiveness he embraced her tenderly wait only wait you will see i am right he said and prudently said no more and did not ask her to speak she was glad that she had sought the reconciliation from her hearts natural warmth on hearing some time later that m de croisnel was dead and that beauchamp meditated starting for france to console his rene her continual agitations made her doubtful of her human feelings she clung to that instance of her filial stedfastness the day before cecilia and her father left mount laurels for their season in wales mr tuckham and beauchamp came together to the house and were closeted an hour with her father cecilia sat in the drawing room thinking that she did indeed wait and had great patience beauchamp entered the room alone he looked worn and thin of a leaden colour like the cloud that bears the bolt news had reached him of the death of lord avonley in the hunting field and he was going on to steynham to persuade his uncle to accompany him to bevisham and wash the guilt of his wrong doing off him before applying for the title you would advise me not to go he said i must i should be dishonoured myself if i let a chance pass i run the risk of being a beggar im all but one now cecilia faltered do you see a chance hardly more than an excuse for trying it he replied she gave him back dr shrapnels letters i have read them was all she said for he might have just returned from france with the breath of rene about him and her pride would not suffer her to melt him in rivalry by saying what she had been led to think of the letters hearing nothing from her he silently put them in his pocket the struggle with his uncle seemed to be souring him or deadening him they were not alone for long mr tuckham presented himself to take his leave of her old mrs beauchamp was dying and he had only come to mount laurels on special business beauchamp was just as anxious to hurry away her father found her sitting in the solitude of a drawing room at midday pale faced with unoccupied fingers not even a book in her lap he walked up and down the room until cecilia to say something said mr tuckham could not stay no said her father he could not he has to be back as quick as he can to cut his legacy in halves cecilia looked perplexed ill speak plainly said the colonel he sees that nevil has ruined himself with his uncle the old lady wont allow nevil to visit her in her condition it would be an excitement beyond her strength to bear she sent blackburn to bring nevil here and give him the option of stating before me whether those reports about his misconduct in france were true or not he demurred at first however he says they are not true he would have run away with the frenchwoman and he would have fought the duel but he did neither her brother ran ahead of him and fought for him so he declares and she wouldnt run so the reports are false we shall know what blackburn makes of the story when we hear of the legacy i have been obliged to write word to mrs beauchamp that i believe nevil to have made a true statement of the facts but i distinctly say and so i told blackburn i dont think money will do nevil beauchamp a farthings worth of good blackburn follows his own counsel he induced the old lady to send him so i suppose he intends to let her share the money between them i thought better of him i thought him a wiser man gratitude to mr tuckham on beauchamps behalf caused cecilia to praise him in the tone of compliments the difficulty of seriously admiring two gentlemen at once is a feminine dilemma with the maidenly among women he has disappointed me said colonel halkett would you have had him allow a falsehood to enrich him and ruin nevil papa my dear child im sick to death of romantic fellows i took blackburn for one of our solid young men why should he share his aunts fortune you mean why should nevil have money well i do mean that besides the story was not false as far as his intentions went he confessed it and i ought to have put it in a postscript if nevil wants money let him learn to behave himself like a gentleman at steynham he has not failed ill say then behave himself simply he considers it a point of honour to get his uncle everard to go down on his knees to shrapnel but he has no moral sense where i should like to see it none he confessed it what were his words papa i dont remember words he runs over to france whenever it suits him to carry on there the colonel ended in a hum and buzz has he been to france lately asked cecilia her breath hung for the answer sedately though she sat the womans father is dead i hear colonel halkett remarked but he has not been there how can i tell hes anywhere wherever his passions whisk him no i say yes and if he has money we shall see him going sky high and scattering it in sparks not merely spending i mean living immorally infidelizing republicanizing scandalizing his class and his country oh no exclaimed cecilia rising and moving to the window to feast her eyes on driving clouds in a strange exaltation of mind secretly sure now that her idea of nevils having gone over to france was groundless and feeling that she had been unworthy of him who strove to be worthier of her as he hoped to become colonel halkett scoffed at her oh no and called it womans logic she could not restrain herself have you forgotten mr austin papa it is nevils perfect truthfulness that makes him appear worse to you than men who are timeservers too many time servers rot the state mr austin said nevil is not one of them i am not able to judge or speculate whether he has a great brain or is likely to distinguish himself out of his profession i would rather he did not abandon it but mr austin said to me in talking of him that notion of austins of screwing womens minds up to the pitch of mens interjected the colonel with a despairing flap of his arm he said papa that honestly active men in a country who decline to practise hypocrisy show that the blood runs and are a sign of health you misunderstood him my dear i think i thoroughly understood him he did not call them wise he said they might be dangerous if they were not met in debate but he said and i presume to think truly that the reason why they are decried is that it is too great a trouble for a lazy world to meet them and he said the reason why the honest factions agitate is because they encounter sneers until they appear in force if they were met earlier and fairlyi am only quoting himthey would not i think he said or would hardly or would not generally fall into professional agitation austins a speculative tory i know and thats his weakness observed the colonel but im certain you misunderstood him he never would have called us a lazy people not in matters of business in matters of thought my dear cecilia youve got hold of a language a way of speaking who set you thinking on these things that i owe to nevil beauchamp colonel halkett indulged in a turn or two up and down the room he threw open a window sniffed the moist air and went to his daughter to speak to her resolutely between a radical and a tory i dont know where your head has been whirled to my dear your heart seems to be gone more sorrow for us and for nevil beauchamp to be pretending to love you while carrying on with this frenchwoman he has never said that he loved me the splendour of her beauty in humility flashed on her father and he cried out you are too good for any man on earth we wont talk in the dark my darling you tell me he has never as they say made love to you never papa well that proves the french story at any rate hes a man of honour but you love him the french story is untrue papa cecilia stood in a blush like the burning cloud of the sunset tell me frankly im your father your old dada your friend my dear girl do you think the man cares for you loves you she replied i know papa the french story is untrue but when i tell you silly woman he confessed it to me out of his own mouth it is not true now its not going on you mean how do you know i know has he been swearing it he has not spoken of it to me here i am in a womans web cried the colonel is it your instinct tells you its not true or what what you have not denied that you love the man i know he is not immoral there you shoot again havent you a yes or a no for your father cecilia cast her arms round his neck and sobbed she could not bring it to her lips to say she would have shunned the hearing that her defence of beauchamp which was a shadowed avowal of the state of her heart was based on his desire to read to her the conclusion of dr shrapnels letter touching a passion to be overcome necessarily therefore a passion that was vanquished and the fullest and bravest explanation of his shifting treatment of her nor would she condescend to urge that her lover would have said he loved her when they were at steynham but for the misery and despair of a soul too noble to be diverted from his grief and sense of duty and as she believed unwilling to speak to win her while his material fortune was in jeopardy the colonel cherished her on his breast with one hand regularly patting her shoulder a form of consolation that cures the disposition to sob as quickly as would the drip of water cecilia looked up into his eyes and said we will not be parted papa ever the colonel said absently no and surprised at himself added no certainly not how can we be parted you wont run away from me no you know too well i cant resist you i appeal to your judgement and i must accept what you decide but he is immoral i repeat that he has no roots we shall discover it before its too late i hope cecilia gazed away breathing through tremulous dilating nostrils one night after dinner at steynham pursued the colonel nevil was rattling against the press with stukely culbrett to prime him and he said editors of papers were growing to be like priests and as timid as priests and arrogant and for one thing it was because they supposed themselves to be guardians of the national morality i forget exactly what the matter was but he sneered at priests and morality a smile wove round cecilias lips and in her towering superiority to one who talked nonsense she slipped out of maiden shame and said attack nevil for his political heresies and his wrath with the press for not printing him the rest concerns his honour where he is quite safe and all are who trust him if you find out youre wrong she shook her head but if you find out youre wrong about him her father reiterated piteously you wont tear me to strips to have him in spite of it no papa not i i will not well thats something for me to hold fast to said colonel halkett sighing chapter xxxviii lord avonley mr everard romfrey was now by consent lord avonley mounted on his direct heirship and riding hard at the earldom his elevation occurred at a period of life that would have been a season of decay with most men but the prolonged and lusty autumn of the veteran took new fires from a tangible object to live for his brother cravens death had slightly stupefied and it had grieved him it seemed to him peculiarly pathetic for as he never calculated on the happening of mortal accidents to men of sound constitution the circumstance imparted a curious shake to his own solidity it was like the quaking of earth which tries the balance of the strongest if he had not been raised to so splendid a survey of the actual world he might have been led to think of the imaginary where perchance a man may meet his old dogs and a few other favourites in a dim perpetual twilight thither at all events craven had gone and goodnight to him the earl was a rapidly lapsing invalid there could be no doubt that everard was to be the head of his house outwardly he was the same tolerant gentleman who put aside the poor fools of the world to walk undisturbed by them in the paths he had chosen in this aspect he knew himself nor was the change so great within him as to make him cognizant of a change it was only a secret turn in the bent of the mind imperceptible as the touch of the cunning artists brush on a finished portrait which will alter the expression without discomposing a feature so that you cannot say it is another face yet it is not the former one his habits were invariable as were his meditations he thought less of romfrey castle than of his dogs and his devices for trapping vermin his interest in birds and beasts and herbs what ninnies call nature in books to quote him was undiminished imagination he had none to clap wings to his head and be off with it he betrayed as little as he felt that the coming earl of romfrey was different from the cadet of the family a novel sharpness in the stop that with which he crushed beauchamps affectedly gentle and unusually roundabout opening of the vexed shrapnel question rang like a shot in the room at steynham and breathed a different spirit from his customary easy pugnacity that welcomed and lured on an adversary to wild outhitting some sorrowful preoccupation is however to be expected in the man who has lost a brother and some degree of irritability at the intrusion of past disputes he chose to repeat a similar brief forbidding of the subject before they started together for the scene of the accident and romfrey castle no notice was taken of beauchamps remark that he consented to go though his duty lay elsewhere beauchamp had not the faculty of reading inside men or he would have apprehended that his uncle was engaged in silently heaping aggravations to shoot forth one fine day a thundering and astonishing counterstroke he should have known his uncle everard better in this respect he seemed to have no memory but who has much that has given up his brains for a lodging to a single idea it is at once a devouring dragon and an intractable steamforce it is a tyrant that has eaten up a senate and a prophet with a message inspired of solitariness and gigantic size it claims divine origin the world can have no peace for it cecilia had not pleased him none had he did not bear in mind that the sight of dr shrapnel sick and weak which constantly reanimated his feelings of pity and of wrath was not given to the others of whom he demanded a corresponding energy of just indignation and sympathy the sense that he was left unaided to the task of bending his tough uncle combined with his appreciation of the righteousness of the task to embitter him and set him on a pedestal from which he descended at every sign of an opportunity for striking and to which he retired continually baffled and wrathful in isolation then ensued the dreadful division in his conception of his powers for he who alone saw the just and right thing to do was incapable of compelling it to be done lay on to his uncle as he would that wrestler shook him off and here was one man whom he could not move how move a nation there came on him a thirst for the haranguing of crowds they agree with you or they disagree exciting you to activity in either case they do not interpose cold tory exclusiveness and inaccessibility you have them in the rough you have nature in them and all that is hopeful in nature you drive at over and through them for their good you plough them you sow them too some of them perceive that it is for their good and what if they be a minority ghastly as a minority is in an election in a lifelong struggle it is refreshing and encouraging the young world and its triumph is with the minority oh to be speaking condemned to silence beside his uncle beauchamp chafed for a loosed tongue and an audience tossing like the well whipped ocean or open as the smooth sea surface to the marks of the breeze let them be hostile or amicable he wanted an audience as hotly as the humped richard a horse at romfrey castle he fell upon an audience that became transformed into a swarm of chatterers advisers and reprovers the instant his lips were parted the ladies of the family declared his pursuit of the apology to be worse and vainer than his politics the gentlemen said the same but they were not so outspoken to him personally and indulged in asides with quotations of some of his uncle everards recent observations concerning him as for example politically hes a mad harlequin jumping his tights and spangles when nobody asks him to jump and in private life hes a mad dentist poking his tongs at my sound tooth a highly ludicrous image of the persistent fellow and a reminder of situations in molire as it was acted by cecil baskelett and lord welshpool beauchamp had to a certain extent restored himself to favour with his uncle everard by offering a fair suggestion on the fatal field to account for the accident after the latter had taken measurements and examined the place in perplexity his elucidation of the puzzle was referred to by lord avonley at romfrey and finally accepted as possible and this from a wiseacre who went quacking about the county expecting to upset the order of things in england such a mixing of sense and nonsense in a fellows noddle was never before met with lord avonley said cecil took the hint he had been unworried by beauchamp dr shrapnel had not been mentioned and it delighted cecil to let it be known that he thought old nevil had some good notions particularly as to the duties of the aristocracythat first war cry of his when a midshipman news of another fatal accident in the hunting field confirmed cecils higher opinion of his cousin on the day of cravens funeral they heard at romfrey that mr wardour devereux had been killed by a fall from his horse two english gentlemen despatched by the same agency within a fortnight he smoked lord avonley said of the second departure to allay some perturbation in the bosoms of the ladies who had ceased to ride by accounting for this particular mishap in the most reassuring fashion cecils immediate reflection was that the unfortunate smoker had left a rich widow far behind in the race for miss halkett and uncertain of a settled advantage in his other rivalry with beauchamp he fixed his mind on the widow and as beauchamp did not stand in his way but on the contrary might help himfor she like the generality of women admired nevil beauchamp in spite of her feminine good sense and conservatismcecil began to regard the man he felt less opposed to with some recognition of his merits the two nephews accompanied lord avonley to london and slept at his town house they breakfasted together the next morning on friendly terms half an hour afterward there was an explosion uncle and nephews were scattered fragments and if cecil was the first to return to cohesion with his lord and chief it was he protested energetically common policy in a man in his position to do so all that he looked for being a decent pension and a share in the use of the town house old nevil he related began cross examining him and entangling him with the cunning of the deuce in my lords presence and having got him to make an admission old nevil flung it at the baron and even crossed him and stood before him when he was walking out of the room a furious wrangle took place nevil and the baron gave it to one another unmercifully the end of it was that all three flew apart for cecil confessed to having a temper and in contempt of him for the admission wrung out of him lord avonley had pricked it my lord went down to steynham beauchamp to holdesbury and captain baskelett to his quarters whence in a few days he repaired penitently to my lordthe most placable of men when a full submission was offered to him beauchamp did nothing of the kind he wrote a letter to steynham in the form of an ultimatum this egregious letter was handed to rosamund for a proof of her darlings lunacy she in conversation with stukely culbrett unhesitatingly accused cecil of plotting his cousins ruin mr culbrett thought it possible that cecil had been a little more than humorous in the part he had played in the dispute and spoke to him then it came out that lord avonley had also delivered an ultimatum to beauchamp time enough had gone by for cecil to forget his ruffling and relish the barons grandly comic spirit in appropriating that big word apology and demanding it from beauchamp on behalf of the lady ruling his household what could be funnier than the knocking of beauchamps blunderbuss out of his hands and pointing the muzzle at him cecil dramatized the fun to amuse mr culbrett apparently beauchamp had been staggered on hearing himself asked for the definite article he claimed he had made a point of speaking of the apology lord avonley did likewise and each professed to exact it for a deeply aggrieved person each put it on the ground that it involved the others rightful ownership of the title of gentleman an apology to the amiable and virtuous mistress culling says old nevil an apology what forfor unbecoming and insolent behaviour says my lord i am that ladys friend stukely warned captain baskelett dont let us have a third apology in the field perfectly true you are her friend and you know what a friend of mine she is rejoined cecil i could swear that lady flings the whole affair at me i give you my word old nevil and i were on a capital footing before he and the baron broke up i praised him for tickling the aristocracy i backed him heartily i do now ill do it in parliament i know a case of a noble lord a general in the army and he received an intimation that he might as well attend the prussian cavalry manuvres last autumn on the lower rhine or in silesiano matter where he couldnt go he was engaged to shoot birds i give you my word now there i see old nevils right its as well we should know something about the prussian and austrian cavalry and if our aristocracy wont go abroad to study cavalry who is to no class in the kingdom understands horses as they do my opinion is theyre asleep nevil should have stuck to that instead of trying to galvanize the country and turning against his class but fancy old nevil asked for the apology it petrified him ive told her nothing but the truth says nevil telling the truth to women is an impertinence says my lord nevil swore hed have a revolution in the country before he apologized mr culbrett smiled at the absurdity of the change of positions between beauchamp and his uncle everard which reminded him somewhat of the old story of the highwayman innkeeper and the market farmer who had been thoughtful enough to recharge his pistols after quitting the inn at midnight a practical tu quoque is astonishingly laughable and backed by a high figure and manner it had the flavour of triumphant repartee lord avonley did not speak of it as a retort upon nevil though he reiterated the word apology amusingly he put it as due to the lady governing his household and his ultimatum was that the apology should be delivered in terms to satisfy him within three months of the date of the demand for it otherwise blank but the shadowy index pointed to the destitution of nevil beauchamp no stroke of retributive misfortune could have been severer to rosamund than to be thrust forward as the object of humiliation for the man she loved she saw at a glance how much more likely it was remote as the possibility appeared that her lord would perform the act of penitence than her beloved nevil and she had no occasion to ask herself why lord avonley had done wrong and nevil had not it was inconceivable that nevil should apologize to her it was horrible to picture the act in her mind she was a very rational woman quite a woman of the world yet such was her situation between these two men that the childish tale of a close and consecutive punishment for sins down to our little naughtinesses and naturalnesses enslaved her intelligence and amazed her with the example made of her as it were to prove the tale true of our being surely hauled back like domestic animals learning the habits of good society to the rueful contemplation of certain of our deeds however wildly we appeal to nature to stand up for them but is it so with all of us no thought rosamund sinking dejectedly from a recognition of the heavenliness of the justice which lashed her and nevil and did not scourge cecil baskelett that fine eye for celestially directed consequences is ever haunted by shadows of unfaith likely to obscure it completely when chastisement is not seen to fall on the person whose wickedness is evident to us it has been established that we do not wax diviner by dragging down the gods to our level rosamund knew lord avonley too well to harass him with further petitions and explanations equally vain was it to attempt to persuade beauchamp he made use of the house in london where he met his uncle occasionally and he called at steynham for money that he could have obtained upon the one condition which was no sooner mentioned than fiery words flew in the room and the two separated the leaden look in beauchamp noticed by cecilia halkett in their latest interview was deepening and was of itself a displeasure to lord avonley who liked flourishing faces and said that fellows getting the look of a sweating smith presumptively in the act of heating his poker at the furnace to stir the country it now became an offence to him that beauchamp should continue doing this in the speeches and lectures he was reported to be delivering he stamped his foot at the sight of his nephews name in the daily journals a novel sentiment of social indignation was expressed by his crying out at the next request for money money to prime you to turn the country into a rat hole not a square inch of pennsylvanian paper bonds what right have you to be lecturing and orationing youve no knowledge all youve got is your instincts and that you show in your readiness to exhibit them like a monkey you ought to be turned inside out on your own stage youve lumped your brains on a point or two about land and commonland and the suffrage and you pound away upon them as if you had the key of the difficulty its the scotchmans metaphysics you know nothing clear and your working classes know nothing at all and you blow them with wind like an over stuffed cow what youre driving at is to get hob nail boots to dance on our heads stukely says you should be off over to ireland there youd swim in your element and have speechifying from instinct and howling and pummelling too enough to last you out ill hand you money for that expedition youre one above the number wanted here youve a look of bad powder fit only to flash in the pan i saved you from the post of public donkey by keeping you out of parliament youre braying and kicking your worst for it still at these meetings of yours a naval officer preaching about republicanism and parcelling out the land beauchamp replied quietly the lectures i read are dr shrapnels when i speak i have his knowledge to back my deficiencies he is too ill to work and i consider it my duty to do as much of his work as i can undertake ha youre the old infidels amen clerk it would rather astonish orthodox congregations to see clerks in our churches getting into the pulpit to read the sermon for sick clergymen said lord avonley his countenance furrowed ill pay that bill he added pay down half a million thundered beauchamp and dropping his voice or go to him you remind me his uncle observed i recommend you to ring that bell and have mrs culling here if she comes she will hear what i think of her then out of the house very well sir you decline to supply me with money i do i must have it i dare say moneys a chain cable for holding men to their senses i ask you my lord how i am to carry on holdesbury give it up i shall have to said beauchamp striving to be prudent there isnt a doubt of it said his uncle upon a series of nods diminishing in their depth until his head assumed a droll interrogative fixity with an air of what next chapter xxxix between beauchamp and cecilia beauchamp quitted the house without answering as to what next and without seeing rosamund in the matter of money as of his physical health he wanted to do too much at once he had spent largely of both in his efforts to repair the injury done to dr shrapnel he was overworked anxious restless craving for a holiday somewhere in france possibly he was all but leaping on board the boat at times and unwilling to leave his dear old friend who clung to him he stayed keeping his impulses below the tide mark which leads to action but where they do not yield peace of spirit the tone of renes letters filled him with misgivings she wrote word that she had seen m dhenriel for the first time since his return from italy and he was much changed and inclined to thank roland for the lesson he had received from him at the swords point and next she urged beauchamp to marry so that he and she might meet as if she felt a necessity for it i shall love your wife teach her to think amiably of me she said and her letter contained womanly sympathy for him in his battle with his uncle beauchamp thought of his experiences of cecilias comparative coldness he replied that there was no prospect of his marrying he wished there were one of meeting he forbore from writing too fervently but he alluded to happy days in normandy and proposed to renew them if she would say she had need of him he entreated her to deal with him frankly he reminded her that she must constantly look to him as she had vowed she would when in any kind of trouble and he declared to her that he was unchanged he meant of an unchanged disposition to shield and serve her but the review of her situation and his knowledge of her quick blood wrought him to some jealous lovers throbs which led him to impress his unchangeableness upon her to bind her to that standard she declined his visit not now not yet and for that he presumed to chide her half sincerely as far as he knew he stood against everybody save his old friend and rene and she certainly would have refreshed his heart for a day in writing however he had an ominous vision of the morrow to the day and both for her sake and his own he was not unrejoiced to hear that she was engaged day and night in nursing her husband pursuing his vision of the morrow of an unreproachful day with rene the madness of taking her to himself should she surrender at last to a third persuasion struck him sharply now that he and his uncle were foot to foot in downright conflict and money was the question he had not much remaining of his inheritanceabout fifteen hundred pounds he would have to vacate holdesbury and his uncles town house in a month let his passion be never so desperate for a beggared man to think of running away with a wife or of marrying one the folly is as big as the worldly offence no justification is to be imagined nay and there is no justification for the breach of a moral law beauchamp owned it and felt that renes resistance to him in normandy placed her above him he remembered a saying of his moralist we who interpret things heavenly by things earthly must not hope to juggle with them for our pleasures and can look to no absolution of evil acts the school was a hard one it denied him holidays it cut him off from dreams it ran him in heavy harness on a rough highroad allowing no turnings to right or left no wayside croppings with the simple permission to him that he should daily get thoroughly tired and what was it jenny denham had said on the election day does incessant battling keep the intellect clear his mind was clear enough to put the case that either he beheld a tremendous magnification of things or else that other men did not attach common importance to them and he decided that the latter was the fact an incessant struggle of one man with the world which position usually ranks his relatives against him does not conduce to soundness of judgement he may nevertheless be right in considering that he is right in the main the world in motion is not so wise that it can pretend to silence the outcry of an ordinarily generous heart eventhe very infant of antagonism to its methods and establishments it is not so difficult to be right against the world when the heart is really active but the world is our book of humanity and before insisting that his handwriting shall occupy the next blank page of it the noble rebel is bound for the sake of his aim to ask himself how much of a giant he is lest he fall like a blot on the page instead of inscribing intelligible characters there moreover his relatives are present to assure him that he did not jump out of jupiters head or come of the doctor they hang on him like an ill conditioned prickly garment and if he complains of the irritation they cause him they one and all denounce his irritable skin fretted by his relatives he cannot be much of a giant beauchamp looked from dr shrapnel in his invalids chair to his uncle everard breathing robustly and mixed his uncles errors with those of the world which honoured and upheld him his remainder of equability departed his impatience increased his appetite for work at dr shrapnels writing desk was voracious he was ready for any labour the transcribing of papers writing from dictation whatsoever was of service to lord avonleys victim and he was not like the spartan boy with the wolf at his vitals he betrayed it in the hue his uncle everard detested in a visible nervousness and indulgence in fits of scorn sharp epigrams and notes of irony provoked his laughter more than fun he seemed to acquiesce in some of the current contemporary despair of our immoveable england though he winced at a satire on his country and attempted to show that the dull dominant class of moneymakers was the ruin of her wherever he stood to represent dr shrapnel as against mr grancey lespel on account of the itchincope encroachments he left a sting that spread the rumour of his having become not only a black torch of radicalismour modern provincial estateholders and their wives bestow that reputation lightlybut a gentleman with the polish scratched off him in parts and he though individually he did not understand how there was to be game in the land if game preserving was abolished signed his name r c s nevil beauchamp for dr shrapnel in the communications directed to solicitors of the persecutors of poachers his behaviour to grancey lespel was eclipsed by his treatment of captain baskelett cecil had ample reason to suppose his cousin to be friendly with him he himself had forgotten dr shrapnel and all other dissensions in a supremely christian spirit he paid his cousin the compliment to think that he had done likewise at romfrey and in london he had spoken to nevil of his designs upon the widow nevil said nothing against it and it was under mrs wardour devereuxs eyes and before a man named lydiard that never calling to him to put him on his guard nevil fell foul of him with every capital charge that can be brought against a gentleman and did so abuse worry and disgrace him as to reduce him to quit the house to avoid the scandal of a resort to a gentlemans last appeal in vindication of his character mrs devereux spoke of the terrible scene to cecilia and lydiard to miss denham the injured person communicated it to lord avonley who told colonel halkett emphatically that his nephew cecil deserved well of him in having kept command of his temper out of consideration for the family there was a general murmur of the family over this incident the widow was rich and it ranked among the unwritten crimes against blood for one offshoot of a great house wantonly to thwart another in the wooing of her by humbling him in her presence doing his utmost to expose him as a schemer a culprit and a poltroon could it be that beauchamp had reserved his wrath with his cousin to avenge dr shrapnel upon him signally miss denham feared her guardian was the cause lydiard was indefinitely of her opinion the idea struck cecilia halkett and as an example of beauchamps tenacity of purpose and sureness of aim it fascinated her but mrs wardour devereux did not appear to share it she objected to beauchamps intemperateness and unsparingness as if she was for conveying a sisterly warning to cecilia and that being off her mind she added smiling a little and colouring a little we learn only from men what men are how the scene commenced and whether it was provoked she failed to recollect she described beauchamp as very self contained in manner throughout his tongue was the scorpion cecilia fancied he must have resembled his uncle everard cecilia was conquered but unclaimed while supporting and approving him in her heart she was dreading to receive some new problem of his conduct and still while she blamed him for not seeking an interview with her she liked him for this instance of delicacy in the present state of his relations with lord avonley a problem of her own conduct disturbed the young ladys clear conception of herself and this was a ruffling of unfaithfulness in her love of beauchamp that was betrayed to her by her forgetfulness of him whenever she chanced to be with seymour austin in mr austins company she recovered her forfeited repose her poetry of life her image of the independent cecilia throned above our dust of battle gazing on broad heaven she carried the feeling so far that blackburn tuckhams enthusiasm for mr austin gave him grace in her sight and praise of her fathers favourite from mr austins mouth made him welcome to her the image of that grave capable head dusty grey about the temples and the darkly sanguine face of the tried man which was that of a seasoned warrior and inspired full trust in him with his vivid look his personal distinction his plain devotion to the countrys business and the domestic solitude he lived in admired esteemed loved perhaps but unpartnered was often her refuge and haven from tempestuous beauchamp she could see in vision the pride of seymour austins mate it flushed her reflectively conquered but not claimed cecilia was like the frozen earth insensibly moving round to sunshine in nature with one white flower in her breast as innocent a sign of strong sweet blood as a woman may wear she ascribed to that fair mate of seymour austins many lofty charms of womanhood above all stateliness her especial dream of an attainable superlative beauty in women and supposing that lady to be accused of the fickle breaking of another love who walked beside him matched with his calm heart and one with him in counsel would the accusation be repeated by them that beheld her husband might it not rather be said that she had not deviated but had only stepped higher she chose no youth no glistener no idler it was her soul striving upward to air like a seed in the earth that raised her to him and she could say to the man once enchaining her friend by the good you taught me i was led to this cecilias reveries fled like columns of mist before the gale when tidings reached her of a positive rupture between lord avonley and nevil beauchamp and of the mandate to him to quit possession of holdesbury and the london house within a certain number of days because of his refusal to utter an apology to mrs culling angrily on his behalf she prepared to humble herself to him louise wardour devereux brought them to a meeting at which cecilia with her heart in her hand was icy mr lydiard prompted by mrs devereux gave him better reasons for her singular coldness than cecilia could give to herself and some time afterward beauchamp went to mount laurels where colonel halkett mounted guard over his daughter and behaved to her thinking cruelly now you have ruined yourself theres nothing ahead for you but to go to the admiralty and apply for a ship he said sugaring the unkindness with the remark that the country would be the gainer he let fly a side shot at london men calling themselves military men who sought to repair their fortunes by chasing wealthy widows and complimented beauchamp youre not one of that sort cecilia looked at beauchamp stedfastly speak said the look but he though not blind was keenly wounded money i must have he said half to the colonel half to himself colonel halkett shrugged cecilia waited for a directness in beauchamps eyes her father was too wary to leave them cecilias intuition told her that by leading to a discussion of politics and adopting beauchamps views she could kindle him why did she refrain it was that the conquered young lady was a captive not an ally to touch the subject in cold blood voluntarily to launch on those vexed waters as if his cause were her hearts as much as her heart was the mans she felt to be impossible he at the same time felt that the heiress endowing him with money to speed the good cause should be his match in ardour for it otherwise he was but a common adventurer winning and despoiling an heiress they met in london beauchamp had not vacated either holdesbury or the town house he was defying his uncle everard and cecilia thought with him that it was a wise temerity she thought with him passively altogether on this occasion she had not to wait for directness in his eyes she had to parry it they were at a dinner party at lady elseas generally the last place for seeing lord palmet but he was present and arranged things neatly for them telling beauchamp that he acted under mrs wardour devereuxs orders never was an opportunity more propitious for a desperate lover had it been rene next him no petty worldly scruples of honour would have held him back and if cecilia had spoken feelingly of dr shrapnel or had she simulated a thoughtful interest in his pursuits his hesitations would have vanished as it was he dared to look what he did not permit himself to speak she was nobly lovely and the palpable envy of men around cried fool at his delays beggar and heiress he said in his heart to vitalize the three parts fiction of the point of honour which cecilias beauty was fast submerging when she was leaving he named a day for calling to see her colonel halkett stood by and she answered come beauchamp kept the appointment cecilia was absent he was unaware that her father had taken her to old mrs beauchamps death bed her absence after she had said come appeared a confirmation of her glacial manner when they met at the house of mrs wardour devereux and he charged her with waywardness a wound of the same kind that we are inflicting is about the severest we can feel beauchamp received intelligence of his venerable great aunts death from blackburn tuckham and after the funeral he was informed that eighty thousand pounds had been bequeathed to him a goodly sum of money for a gentleman recently beggared yet as the political enthusiast could not help reckoning apart from a fervent sentiment of gratitude toward his benefactress scarcely enough to do much more than start and push for three or more years a commanding daily newspaper devoted to radical interests and to be entitled the dawn true he might now conscientiously approach the heiress take her hand with an open countenance and retain it could he do so quite conscientiously the point of honour had been centred in his condition of beggary something still was in his way a quick spring of his blood for air motion excitement holiday freedom sent his thoughts travelling whither they always shot away when his redoubtable natural temper broke loose in the case of any other woman than cecilia halkett he would not have been obstructed by the minor consideration as to whether he was wholly heart free to ask her in marriage that instant for there was no hindrance and she was beautiful she was exceedingly beautiful and she was an unequalled heiress she would be able with her wealth to float his newspaper the dawn so desired of dr shrapnelthe best restorative that could be applied to him every temptation came supplicating him to take the step which indeed he wished for one feeling opposed he really respected cecilia it is not too much to say that he worshipped her with the devout worship rendered to the ideal englishwoman by the heart of the nation for him she was purity charity the keeper of the keys of whatsoever is held precious by men she was a midway saint a light between day and darkness in whom the spirit in the flesh shone like the growing star amid thin sanguine colour the sweeter the brighter the more translucent the longer known and if the image will allow it the nearer down to him the holier she seemed how offer himself when he was not perfectly certain that he was worthy of her some jugglery was played by the adept male heart in these later hesitations up to the extent of his knowledge of himself the man was fairly sincere passion would have sped him to cecilia but passion is not invariably love and we know what it can be the glance he cast over the water at normandy was withdrawn he went to bevisham to consult with dr shrapnel about the starting of a weekly journal instead of a daily and a name for ita serious question for though it is oftener weekly than daily that the dawn is visible in england titles must not invite the public jest and the glorious project of the daily dawn was prudently abandoned for by and by he thought himself rich enough to put a radical champion weekly in the field and this matter excepting the title was arranged in bevisham thence he proceeded to holdesbury where he heard that the house grounds and farm were let to a tenant preparing to enter indifferent to the blow he kept an engagement to deliver a speech at the great manufacturing town of gunningham and then went to london visiting his uncles town house for recent letters not one was from rene she had not written for six weeks not once for his thrice a letter from cecil baskelett informed him that my lord had placed the town house at his disposal returning to dress for dinner on a thick and murky evening of february beauchamp encountered his cousin on the steps he said to cecil i sleep here to night i leave the house to you tomorrow cecil struck out his underjaw to reply oh good you sleep here to night you are a fortunate man i congratulate you i shall not disturb you i have just entered on my occupation of the house i have my key allow me to recommend you to go straight to the drawing room and i may inform you that the earl of romfrey is at the point of death my lord is at the castle cecil accompanied his descent of the steps with the humming of an opera melody beauchamp tripped into the hall passage a young maid servant held the door open and she accosted him if you please there is a lady up stairs in the drawing room she speaks foreign english sir beauchamp asked if the lady was alone and not waiting for the answer though he listened while writing and heard that she was heavily veiled he tore a strip from his notebook and carefully traced half a dozen telegraphic words to mrs culling at steynham his rarely failing promptness which was like an inspiration to conceive and execute measures for averting peril set him on the thought of possibly counteracting his cousin cecils malignant tongue by means of a message to rosamund summoning her by telegraph to come to town by the next train that night he despatched the old woman keeping the house as trustier than the young one to the nearest office and went up to the drawing room with a quick thumping heart that was nevertheless as little apprehensive of an especial trial and danger as if he had done nothing at all to obviate it indeed he forgot that he had done anything when he turned the handle of the drawing room door chapter xl a trial of him a low burning lamp and fire cast a narrow ring on the shadows of the dusky london room one of the window blinds was drawn up beauchamp discerned a shape at that window and the fear seized him that it might be madame dauffray with evil news of rene but it was renes name he called she rose from her chair saying i she was trembling beauchamp asked her whisperingly if she had come alone alone without even a maid she murmured he pulled down the blind of the window exposing them to the square and led her into the light to see her face the dimness of light annoyed him and the miserable reception of her this english weather and the gloomy house and how long had she been waiting for him and what was the mystery rene in england seemed magical yet it was nothing stranger than an old dream realized he wound up the lamp holding her still with one hand she was woefully pale scarcely able to bear the increase of light it is i who come to you she was half audible this time said he you have been suffering no her tone was brief not reassuring you came straight to me without a deviation that i know of from tourdestelle you have not forgotten tourdestelle nevil the memory of it quickened his rapture in reading her features it was his first love his enchantress who was here and how conjectures shot through him like lightnings in the dark irrationally at a moment when reason stood in awe he fancied it must be that her husband was dead he forced himself to think it and could have smiled at the hurry of her coming one without even a maid and deeper down in him the devouring question burned which dreaded the answer but of old in normandy she had pledged herself to join him with no delay when free if ever free so now she was free one side of him glowed in illumination the other was black as winter night but light subdues darkness and in a situation like beauchamps the blood is livelier than the prophetic mind why did you tell me to marry what did that mean said he did you wish me to be the one in chains and you have come quite aloneyou will give me an account of everything presentlyyou are here in england and what a welcome for you you are cold i am warmly clad said rene suffering her hand to be drawn to his breast at her arms length not bending with it alive to his own indirectness he was conscious at once of the slight sign of reservation and said tell me and swerved sheer away from his question how is madame dauffray agns i left her at tourdestelle said rene and roland he never writes to me neither he nor i write much he is at the military camp of instruction in the north he will run over to us do not expect it why not rene sighed we shall have to live longer than i look for she stopped why do you ask me why not he is fond of us both and sorry for us but have you forgotten roland that morning on the adriatic beauchamp pressed her hand the stroke of then and now rang in his breast like a bell instead of a bounding heart something had stunned his heart he had no clear central feeling he tried to gather it from her touch from his joy in beholding her and sitting with her alone from the grace of her figure the wild sweetness of her eyes and the beloved foreign lips bewitching him with their exquisite french and perfection of speech his nature was too prompt in responding to such a call on it for resolute warmth if i had been firmer then or you one year older he said that girl in venice had no courage said rene she raised her head and looked about the room her instinct of love sounded her lover through and felt the deficiency or the contrariety in him as surely as musical ears are pained by a discord that they require no touchstone to detect passion has the sensitiveness of fever and is as cruelly chilled by a tepid air yes a london house after venice and normandy said beauchamp following her look sicily do not omit syracuse you were in your naval uniform normandy was our third meeting said rene this is the fourth i should have reckoned that why superstitiously we cannot be entirely wise when we have staked our fate sailors are credulous you know them women are like them when they embark three chances who can boast of so many and expect one more will you take me to my hotel nevil the fiction of her being free could not be sustained take you and leave you i am absolutely at your command but leave you you are alone and you have told me nothing what was there to tell the desperate act was apparent and told all renes dark eyelashes lifted on him and dropped then things are as i left them in normandy said he she replied almost he quivered at the solitary word for his conscience was on edge it ran the shrewdest irony through him inexplicably almost that is with this poor difference of one person now finding herself worthless subtracted from the list no other it should be little to them as it is little to you or reversing it the substance of the word became magnified and intensified by its humble slightness things are the same but for the jewel of the province a lustre of france lured hither to her eclipsemeanings various indistinguishable thrilling and piercing sad as the half tones humming round the note of a strung wire which is a blunt single note to the common ear beauchamp sprang to his feet and bent above her you have come to me for the love of me to give yourself to me and for ever for good till death speak my beloved rene her eyes were raised to his you see me here it is for you to speak i do theres nothing i ask for nowif the step cant be retrieved the step retrieved my friend there is no step backward in life i am thinking of you rene yes i know she answered hurriedly if we discover that the step is a wrong one he pursued why is there no step backward i am talking of women said rene why not for women honourable women i mean said rene beauchamp inclined to forget his position in finding matter to contest yet it is beyond contest that there is no step backward in life she spoke well better than he and she won his deference by it not only she spoke better she was truer distincter braver and a man ever on the look out for superior qualities and ready to bow to them could not refuse her homage with that a saving sense of power quitted him you wrote to me that you were unchanged nevil i am so then i came his rejoinder was the dumb one commonly eloquent and satisfactory rene shut her eyes with a painful rigour of endurance she opened them to look at him steadily the desperate act of her flight demanded immediate recognition from him in simple language and a practical seconding of it there was the test i cannot stay in this house nevil take me away she named her hotel in her french english and the sound of it penetrated him with remorseful pity it was for him and of his doing that she was in an alien land and an outcast this house is wretched for you said he and you must be hungry let me i cannot eat i will ask you she paused drawing on her energies and keeping down the throbs of her heart this do you love me i love you with all my heart and soul as in normandy yes in venice as from the first rene that i can swear oaths are foolish i meant to ask youmy friend there is no question in my mind of any other woman i see you love me i am so used to consider myself the vain and cowardly creature and you the boldest and faithfullest of men that i could not abandon the habit if i would i started confiding in you sure that i should come to land but i have to ask you to me you are truth i have no claim on my lover for anything but the answer to thisam i a burden to you his brows flew up in furrows he drew a heavy breath for never had he loved her more admiringly and never on such equal terms she was his mate in love and daring at least a sorrowful comparison struck him of a little boat sailing out to a vessel in deep seas and left to founder without knotting his mind to acknowledge or deny the burden for he could do neither he stood silent staring at her not so much in weakness as in positive mental division no would be false and yes not less false and if the step was irretrievable to say yes would be to plunge a dagger in her bosom but no was a vain deceit involving a double wreck assuredly a man standing against the world in a good cause with a runaway wife on his hands carries a burden however precious it be to him a smile of her lips parted in an anguish of expectancy went to death over renes face she looked at him tenderly the truth she murmured to herself and her eyelids fell i am ready to bear anything said beauchamp i weigh what you ask me that is all you a burden to me but when you ask me you make me turn round and inquire how we stand before the world the world does not stone men said rene cant i make you feel that i am not thinking of myself beauchamp stamped in his extreme perplexity he was gagged he could not possibly talk to her who had cast the die of his later notions of morality and the worlds dues fees and claims on us no friend i am not complaining rene put out her hand to him with compassionate irony feigning to have heard excuses what right have i to complain i have not the sensation i could not expect you to be everlastingly the sentinel of love three times i rejected you now that i have lost my fatheroh poor father i trifled with my lover i tricked him that my father might live in peace he is dead i wished you to marry one of your own countrywomen nevil you said it was impossible and i with my snake at my heart and a husband grateful for nursing and whimpering to me for his youth like a beggar on the road i thought i owed you this debt of body and soul to prove to you i have some courage and for myself to reward myself for my long captivity and misery with one year of life and adieu to roland my brother adieu to friends adieu to france italy was our home i dreamed of one year in italy i fancied it might be two more than that was unimaginable prisoners of long date do not hope they do not calculate air light they say to breathe freely and drop down they are reduced to the instincts of the beasts i thought i might give you happiness pay part of my debt to you are you remembering count henri that paints what i was i could fly to that for a taste of life a dance to death and again you ask why if i loved you then not turn to you in preference no you have answered it yourself nevilon that day in the boat when generosity in a man so surprised me it seemed a miracle to me and it was in its divination how i thank my dear brother roland for saving me the sight of you condemned to fight against your conscience he taught poor m dhenriel his lesson you nevil were my teacher and see how it hangs there was mercy for me in not having drawn down my fathers anger on my hearts beloved he loved you he pitied us he reproached himself in his last days he was taught to suspect our story perhaps from roland perhaps i breathed it without speaking he called heavens blessings on you he spoke of you with tears clutching my hand he made me feel he would have cried out if i were leaving her with nevil beauchamp and beauchamp i heard him murmuring once take down froissart he named a chapter it was curious if he uttered my name rene yours nevil soon followed that was noticed by roland hope for us he could not have had as little as i but we were his two his children i buried himi thought he would know our innocence and now pardon our love i read your letters from my name at the beginning to yours at the end and from yours back to mine and between the lines for any doubtful spot and oh rash but i would not retrace the step for my own sake i am certain of your love for me though she paused yes i am certain of it and if i am a burden to you about as much as the air which i cant do without since i began to breathe it said beauchamp more clear mindedly now that he supposed he was addressing a mind and with a peril to himself that escaped his vigilance there was a secret intoxication for him already in the half certainty that the step could not be retraced the idea that he might reason with her made her seductive to the heart and head of him i am passably rich nevil she said i do not care for money except that it gives wings roland inherits the chteau in touraine i have one in burgundy and rentes and shares my notary informs me i have money said he his heart began beating violently he lost sight of his intention of reasoning good god if you were free she faltered at tourdestelle yes and i am unchanged beauchamp cried out your life there was horrible and mines intolerable he stretched his arms cramped like the yawning of a wretch in fetters that which he would and would not became so intervolved that he deemed it reasonable to instance their common misery as a ground for their union against the world and what has that world done for us that a joy so immeasurable should be rejected on its behalf and what have we succeeded in doing that the childish effort to move it should be continued at such a cost for years down to one year back and lessyesterday it could be saidall human blessedness appeared to him in the person of rene given him under any condition whatsoever she was not less adorable now in her decision and a courage that he especially prized in women she was a sweeter to him than when he was with her in france too sweet to be looked at and refused but we must live in england he cried abruptly out of his inner mind oh not england italy italy rene exclaimed italy or greece anywhere where we have sunlight mountains and valleys are my dream promise it nevil i will obey you but this is my wish take me through venice that i may look at myself and wonder we can live at sea in a yacht anywhere with you but in england this country frowns on me i can hardly fetch my breath here i am suffocated the people all walk in lines in england not here nevil they are good people i am sure and it is your country but their faces chill me their voices grate i should never understand them they would be to me like their fogs eternally and i to them o me it would be like hearing sentence in the dampness of the shroud perpetually again i say i do not doubt that they are very good they claim to be they judge others they may know how to make themselves happy in their climate it is common to most creatures to do so or to imagine it nevil not england truly the mad commander and his french marquise of the bevisham election ballad would make a pretty figure in england his friends of his own class would be mouthing it the story would be a dogging shadow of his public life and quite as bad a reflection on his party he heard the yelping tongues of the cynics he saw the consternation and grief of his old bevisham hero his leader and his teacher florence he said musing on the prospect of exile and idleness theres a kind of society to be had in florence rene asked him if he cared so much for society he replied that women must have it just as men must have exercise old women nevil intriguers tattlers young women rene she signified no he shook the head of superior knowledge paternally her instinct of comedy set a dimple faintly working in her cheek not if they love nevil at least said he a man does not like to see the woman he loves banished by society and browbeaten putting me aside do you care for it nevil personally not a jot i am convinced of that said rene she spoke suspiciously sweetly appearing perfect candour the change in him was perceptible to her the nature of the change was unfathomable she tried her wits at the riddle but though she could be an actress before him with little difficulty the torment of her situation roused the fever within her at a bare effort to think acutely scarlet suffused her face her brain whirled remember dearest i have but offered myself you have your choice i can pass on yes i know well i speak to nevil beauchamp you have drilled me to trust you and your word as a soldier trusts to his officeronce a faint hearted soldier i need not remind you fronting the enemy now in hard truth but i want your whole heart to decide give me no silly compassion would it have been better to me to have written to you if i had written i should have clipped my glorious impulse brought myself down to earth with my own arrow i did not write for i believed in you so firm had been her faith in him that her visions of him on the passage to england had resolved all to one flash of blood warm welcome awaiting her and it says much for her natural generosity that the savage delicacy of a woman placed as she now was did not take a mortal hurt from the apparent voidness of this home of his bosom the passionate gladness of the lover was wanting the chivalrous valiancy of manful joy rene shivered at the cloud thickening over her new light of intrepid defiant life think it not improbable that i have weighed everything i surrender in quitting france she said remorse wrestled with beauchamp and flung him at her feet rene remarked on the lateness of the hour he promised to conduct her to her hotel immediately and to morrow said rene simply but breathlessly to morrow let it be italy but first i telegraph to roland and tourdestelle i cant run and hide the step may be retrieved or no you are right the step cannot but the next to it may be stoppedthat was the meaning i had ill try its cutting my hand off tearing my heart out but i will o that you were free you left your husband at tourdestelle i presume he is there at present he was in paris when i left beauchamp spoke hoarsely and incoherently in contrast with her composure you will misunderstand me for a day or two rene i say if you were free i should have my first love mine for ever dont fear me i have no right even to press your fingers he may throw you into my arms now you are the same as if you were in your own home and you must accept me for your guide by all i hope for in life ill see you through it and keep the dogs from barking if i can thousands are ready to give tongue and if they can get me in the character of a law breakeri hear them are you imagining nevil that there is a possibility of my returning to him to your place in the world you have not had to endure tyranny i should have had a certain respect for a tyrant nevil at least i should have had an occupation in mocking him and conspiring against him tyranny there would have been some amusement to me in that it was neglect if i could still charge it on neglect nevil neglect is very endurable he rewards me for nursing him he rewards me with a little persecution wives should be flattered by it it comes late what cried beauchamp oppressed and impatient rene sank her voice something in the run of the unaccented french son amour mon ami drove the significance of the bitterness of the life she had left behind her burningly through him this was to have fled from a dragon was the lovers thought he perceived the motive of her flight and it was a vindication of it that appealed to him irresistibly the proposal for her return grew hideous and this ever multiplying horror and sting of the love of a married woman came on him with a fresh throbbing shock more venom he felt for himself now and now he was full of feeling for her impossible that she should return tourdestelle shone to him like a gaping chasm of fire and becoming entirely selfish he impressed his total abnegation of self upon rene so that she could have worshipped him a lover that was like a starry frost froze her veins bewildered her intelligence she yearned for meridian warmth for repose in a directing hand and let it be hard as one that grasps a sword what matter unhesitatingness was the warrior virtue of her desire and for herself the worst might happen if only she were borne along let her life be torn and streaming like the flag of battle it must be forward to the end that was a quality of godless young heroism not unexhausted in beauchamps blood reanimated by him she awakened his imagination of the vagrant splendours of existence and the rebel delights which have their own laws and nature for an applauding mother radiant alps rose in his eyes and the morning born in the night suns that from mountain and valley over sea and desert called on all earth to witness their death the magnificence of the contempt of humanity posed before him superbly satanesque grand as thunder among the crags and it was not a sensual cry that summoned him from his pedlar labours pack on back along the level road to live and breathe deep gloriously mated rene kindled his romantic spirit and could strike the feeling into him that to be proud of his possession of her was to conquer the fretful vanity to possess she was not a woman of wiles and lures once or twice she consulted her watch but as she professed to have no hunger beauchamps entreaty to her to stay prevailed and the subtle form of compliment to his knightly manliness in her remaining with him gave him a new sense of pleasure that hung round her companionable conversation deepening the meaning of the words or sometimes contrasting the sweet surface commonplace with the undercurrent of strangeness in their hearts and the reality of a tragic position her musical volubility flowed to entrance and divert him as it did suddenly beauchamp glanced upward rene turned from a startled contemplation of his frown and beheld mrs rosamund culling in the room chapter xli a lame victory the intruder was not a person that had power to divide them yet she came between their hearts with a touch of steel i am here in obedience to your commands in your telegram of this evening rosamund replied to beauchamps hard stare at her she courteously spoke french and acquitted herself demurely of a bow to the lady present rene withdrew her serious eyes from beauchamp she rose and acknowledged the bow it is my first visit to england madame i could have desired madame la marquise more agreeable weather for you my friends in england will dispel the bad weather for me madame rene smiled softly i have been studying my french english phrase book that i may learn how dialogues are conducted in your country to lead to certain ceremonies when old friends meet and without my book i am at fault i am longing to be embraced by you if it will not be offending your rules rosamund succumbed to the seductive woman whose gentle tooth bit through her tutored simplicity of manner and natural graciousness administering its reproof and eluding a retort or an excuse she gave the embrace in doing so she fell upon her conscious awkwardness for an expression of reserve that should be as good as irony for irony though where madame de rouaillouts irony lay or whether it was irony at all our excellent english dame could not have stated after the feeling of indignant prudery responding to it so guiltily had subsided beauchamp asked her if she had brought servants with her and it gratified her to see that he was no actor fitted to carry a scene through in virtues name and vices mask with this actress she replied i have brought a man and a maid servant the establishment will be in town the day after tomorrow in time for my lords return from the castle you can have them up to morrow morning i could rosamund admitted the possibility her idolatry of him was tried on hearing him press the hospitality of the house upon madame de rouaillout and observing the ladys transparent feint of a reluctant yielding for the voluble frenchwoman scarcely found a word to utter she protested languidly that she preferred the independence of her hotel and fluttered a singular look at him as if overcome by his vehement determination to have her in the house undoubtedly she had a taking face and style his infatuation nevertheless appeared to rosamund utter dementedness considering this womans position and cecilia halketts beauty and wealth and that the house was no longer at his disposal he was really distracted to judge by his forehead or else he was over acting his part the absence of a cook in the house rosamund remarked must prevent her from seconding captain beauchamps invitation he turned on her witheringly the telegraph will do that youre in london cooks can be had by dozens madame de rouaillout is alone here she has come to see a little of england and you will do the honours of the house m le marquis is not in london said rosamund disregarding the dumb imprecation she saw on beauchamps features no madame my husband is not in london rene rejoined collectedly see to the necessary comforts of the house instantly said beauchamp and telling rene without listening to her that he had to issue orders he led rosamund who was out of breath at the effrontery of the pair toward the door are you blind maam have you gone foolish what should i have sent for you for but to protect her i see your mind and off with the prude pray madame will have my room clear away every sign of me there i sleep out i can find a bed anywhere and bolt and chain the house door to night against cecil baskelett he informs me that he has taken possession rosamunds countenance had become less austere captain baskelett she exclaimed leaning to beauchamps views on the side of her animosity to cecil he has been promised by his uncle the use of a set of rooms during the year when the mistress of the house is not in occupation i stipulated expressly that he was to see you and suit himself to your convenience and to let me hear that you and he had agreed to an arrangement before he entered the house he has no right to be here and i shall have no hesitation in locking him out beauchamp bade her go and not be away more than five minutes and then he would drive to the hotel for the luggage she scanned him for a look of ingenuousness that might be trusted and laughed in her heart at her credulity for expecting it of a man in such a case she saw rene sitting stonily too proudly self respecting to put on a mask of flippant ease these lovers might be accomplices in deceiving her they were not happy ones and that appeared to her to be some assurance that she did well in obeying him beauchamp closed the door on her he walked back to rene with a thoughtful air that was consciously acted his only thought beingnow she knows me rene looked up at him once her eyes were unaccusing unquestioning with the violation of the secresy of her flight she had lost her initiative and her intrepidity the world of human eyes glared on her through the windows of the two she had been exposed to paralyzing her brain and caging her spirit of revolt that keen wakefulness of her self defensive social instinct helped her to an understanding of her lovers plan to preserve her reputation or rather to give her a corner of retreat in shielding the worthless thingtwice detested as her cloak of slavery coming from him she comprehended no more she was a house of nerves crowding in against her soul like fiery thorns and had no space within her torture for a sensation of gratitude or suspicion but feeling herself hurried along at lightning speed to some dreadful shock her witless imagination apprehended it in his voice not what he might say only the sound she feared to hear him speak as the shrinking ear fears a thunder at the cavity yet suspense was worse than the downward driving silence the pang struck her when he uttered some words about mrs culling and protection and roland she thanked him so have common executioners been thanked by queenly ladies baring their necks to the axe he called up the pain he suffered to vindicate him and it was really an agony of a man torn to pieces i have done the best this dogged and stupid piece of speech was pitiable to hear from nevil beauchamp you think so said she and her glass like voice rang a tremour in its mildness that swelled through him on the plain submissive note which was more assent than question i am sure of it i believe it i see it at least i hope so we are chiefly led by hope said rene at least if not beauchamp cried and its not too late i have no righti do what i can i am at your mercy judge me later if i am ever to know what happiness is it will be with you its not too late either way there is rolandmy brother as much as if you were my wife he begged her to let him have rolands exact address she named the regiment the corps darme the postal town and the department roland will come at a signal he pursued we are not bound to consult others rene formed the french word of we on her tongue he talked of roland and roland his affection for him as a brother and as a friend and rolands love of them both it is true said rene we owe him this he represents your father all that you say is true my friend thus you have come on a visit to madame your old friend hereoh your hand what have i done rene motioned her hand as if it were free to be taken and smiled faintly to make light of it but did not give it if you had been widowed he broke down to the lover again that man is attached to the remnant of his life i could not wish him dispossessed of it said rene parted who parts us its for a night tomorrow she breathed to morrow to his hearing it craved an answer he had none to talk like a lover or like a man of honour was to lie falsehood hemmed him in to the narrowest ring that ever statue stood on if he meant to be stone that woman will be returning he muttered frowning at the vacant door i could lay out my whole life before your eyes and show you i am unchanged in my love of you since the night when roland and i walked on the piazzetta do not remind me let those days lie black a sympathetic vision of her maidens tears on the night of wonderful moonlight when as it seemed to her now san giorgio stood like a dark prophet of her present abasement and chastisement sprang tears of a different character and weak as she was with her souls fever and for want of food she was piteously shaken she said with some calmness it is useless to look back i have no reproaches but for myself explain nothing to me things that are not comprehended by one like me are riddles i must put aside i know where i am i scarcely know more here is madame the door had not opened and it did not open immediately beauchamp had time to say believe in me even that was false to his own hearing and in a struggle with the painful impression of insincerity which was denied and scorned by his impulse to fling his arms round her and have her his for ever he found himself deferentially accepting her brief directions concerning her boxes at the hotel with rosamund culling to witness she gave him her hand he bowed over the fingers until to morrow madame adieu said rene chapter xlii the two passions the foggy february night refreshed his head and the business of fetching the luggage from the hotela commission that necessitated the delivery of his card and some very commanding languagekept his mind in order subsequently he drove to his cousin baskeletts club where he left a short note to say the house was engaged for the night and perhaps a week further concise but sufficient and he stated a hope to his cousin that he would not be inconvenienced this was courteous he had taken a bed at renes hotel after wresting her boxes from the vanquished hotel proprietor and lay there hearing the clear sound of every little sentence of hers during the absence of rosamund her adieu and the strange do you think so and i know where i am i scarcely know more her eyes and their darker lashes and the fitful little sensitive dimples of a smile without joy came with her voice but hardened to an aspect unlike her not a word could he recover of what she had spoken before rosamunds intervention he fancied she must have related details of her journey especially there must have been mention he thought of her drive to the station from tourdestelle and this flashed on him the scene of his ride to the chteau and the meeting her on the road and the white light on the branching river and all that was rene in the spirit of the place she had abandoned for him believing in him she had proved that she believed in him what in the name of sanity had been the meaning of his language and what was it between them that arrested him and caused him to mumble absurdly of doing best when in fact he was her bondman rejoiced to be so by his pledged word and when she for some reason that he was sure she had stated though he could recollect no more than the formless hideousness of it was debarred from returning to tourdestelle he tossed in his bed as over a furnace in the extremity of perplexity of one accustomed to think himself ever demonstrably in the right and now with his whole nature in insurrection against that legitimate claim it led him to accuse her of a want of passionate warmth in her not having supplicated and upbraided himnot behaving theatrically in fine as the ranting pen has made us expect of emergent ladies that they will naturally do concerning himself he thought commendingly a tear would have overcome him she had not wept the kaleidoscope was shaken in his fragmentary mind and she appeared thrice adorable for this noble composure he brutish conscience and reason had resolved to a dead weight in him like an inanimate force governing his acts despite the man while he was with rene now his wishes and waverings conjured up a semblance of a conscience and much reason to assure him that he had done foolishly as well as unkindly most unkindly that he was even the ghastly spectacle of a creature attempting to be more than he can be are we never to embrace our inclinations are the laws regulating an old dry man like his teacher and guide to be the same for the young and vigorous is a good gift to be refused and this was his first love the brilliant rene many hued as a tropic bird his lady of shining grace with her sole fault of want of courage devotedly amended his pupil he might say of whom he had foretold that she must come to such a pass at the same time prefixing his fidelity and he was handing her over knowingly to one kind of wretchednessson amour mon ami shot through him lighting up the gulfs of a mind in wreckand one kind of happiness could certainly be promised her all these and innumerable other handsome pleadings of the simulacra of the powers he had set up to rule were crushed at daybreak by the realities in a sense of weight that pushed him mechanically on he telegraphed to roland and mentally gave chase to the message to recall it the slumberer roused in darkness by the relentless insane seeming bell which hales him to duty melts at the charms of sleep and feels that logic is with him in his preference of his pillow but the tireless revolving world outside natures pitiless antagonist has hung one of its balances about him and his actions are directed by the state of the scales wherein duty weighs deep and desireability swings like a pendant doll so he throws on his harness astounded till his blood quickens with work at the round of sacrifices demanded of nature which is indeed curious considering what we are taught here and there as to the infallibility of our august mother well the world of humanity had done this for beauchamp his afflicted historian is compelled to fling his net among prosaic similitudes for an illustration of one thus degradedly in its grip if he had been off with his love like the rover why then the muse would have loosened her lap like may showering flower buds and we might have knocked great nature up from her sleep to embellish his desperate proceedings with hurricanes to be danced over to say nothing of imitative spheres dashing out into hurly burly after his example conscious rectitude too after the pattern of the well behaved aeneas quitting the fair bosom of carthage in obedience to the gods for an example to his roman progeny might have stiffened his backbone and put a crown upon his brows it happened with him that his original training rather imposed the idea that he was a figure to be derided the approval of him by the prudent was a disgust and by the pious tasteless he had not any consolation in reverting to dr shrapnels heavy puritanism on the contrary such a general proposition as that of the sage of bevisham could not for a moment stand against the pathetic special case of rene and as far as beauchamps active mind went he was for demanding that society should take a new position in morality considerably broader and adapted to very special cases nevertheless he was hardly grieved in missing rene at rosamunds breakfast table rosamund informed him that madame de rouaillouts door was locked her particular news for him was of a disgraceful alarum raised by captain baskelett in the night to obtain admission and of an interview she had with him in the early morning when he subjected her to great insolence beauchamps attention was drawn to her repetition of the phrase mistress of the house however she did him justice in regard to rene and thoroughly entered into the fiction of renes visit to her as her guest he passed over everything else to stop the mouth of a scandal monger he drove full speed to cecils club where he heard that the captain had breakfasted and had just departed for romfrey castle he followed to the station the train had started so mischief was rolling in that direction late at night rosamund was allowed to enter the chill unlighted chamber where the unhappy lady had been lying for hours in the gloom of a london winters daylight and gaslight madame de rouaillout is indisposed with headache was her report to beauchamp the conventional phraseology appeased him though he saw his grief behind it presently he asked if rene had taken food no you know what a headache is rosamund replied it is true that we do not care to eat when we are in pain he asked if she looked ill she will not have lights in the room said rosamund piecemeal he gained the picture of rene in an image of the death within which welcomed a death without rosamund was impatient with him for speaking of medical aid these men she remarked very honestly oh no doctors are not needed has she mentioned me not once why do you swing your watch chain maam cried beauchamp bounding off his chair he reproached her with either pretending to indifference or feeling it and then insisted on his privilege of going up stairsaccompanied by her of course and then it was to be only to the door then an answer to a message was to satisfy him any message would trouble her what message would you send rosamund asked him the weighty and the trivial contended no fitting message could be thought of you are unused to real sufferingthat is for womenand want to be doing instead of enduring said rosamund she was beginning to put faith in the innocence of these two mortally sick lovers beauchamps outcries against himself gave her the shadows of their story he stood in tearsa thing to see to believe of nevil beauchamp and plainly he did not know it or else he would have taken her advice to him to leave the house at an hour that was long past midnight her method for inducing him to go was based on her intimate knowledge of him she made as if to soothe and kiss him compassionately in the morning there was a flying word from roland on his way to england rosamund tempered her report of rene by saying of her that she was very quiet he turned to the window look what a climate ours is beauchamp abused the persistent fog dull cold no sky a horrible air to breathe this is what she has come to has she spoken of me yet no is she dead silent she answers if i speak to her i believe maam said beauchamp that we are the coldest hearted people in europe rosamund did not defend us or the fog consequently nothing was left for him to abuse but himself in that she tried to moderate him and drew forth a torrent of self vituperation after which he sank into the speechless misery he had been evading until sophistical fancy another evolution of his nature persuaded him that roland seeing rene would for loves sake be friendly to them i should have told you nevil by the way that the earl is dead said rosamund her brother will be here to day he cant be later than the evening said beauchamp get her to eat maam you must command her to eat this terrible starvation you ate nothing yourself nevil all day yesterday he surveyed the table you have your cook in town i see heres a breakfast to feed twenty hungry families in spitalfields where does the mass of meat go one excess feeds another youre overdone with servants gluttony laziness and pilfering come of your host of unmanageable footmen and maids you stuff them and wonder theyre idle and immoral ifi suppose i must call him the earl now or colonel halkett or any one of the army of rich men hear of an increase of the income tax or some poor wretch hints at a sliding scale of taxation they yell as if they were thumb screwed but five shillings in the pound goes to the kitchen as a matter of courseto puff those pompous idiots and the parsons who should be preaching against this sheer waste of food and perversion of the strength of the nation as a public sin are maundering about schism theres another idle army then we have artists authors lawyers doctorsthe honourable professions all hanging upon wealth all ageing the rich and all bearing upon labour its incubus on incubus in point of fact the riders too heavy for the horse in england he began to nibble at bread rosamund pushed over to him a plate of the celebrated steynham pie of her own invention such as no house in the county of sussex could produce or imitate what would you have the parsons do she said take the rich by the throat and show them in the kitchen mirror that theyre swine running down to the sea with a devil in them she had set him off again but she had enticed him to eating pooh it has all been said before stones are easier to move than your english may i be forgiven for saying it an invasion is what they want to bring them to their senses im sick of the work why should i be deniedam i to kill the woman i love that i may go on hammering at them their idea of liberty is an evasion of public duty dr shrapnels rightits a money logged island men like the earl of romfrey who have never done work in their days except to kill bears and birds i say theyre stifled by wealth and he at least would have made an admiral of mark or a general not of much value but useful in case of need but he like a pretty woman was under no obligation to contribute more than an ornamental person to the common good as to that we count him by tens of thousands now and his footmen and maids by hundreds of thousands the rich love the nation through their possessions otherwise they have no country if they loved the country they would care for the people their hearts are eaten up by property i am bidden to hold my tongue because i have no knowledge when men who have this knowledge will go down to the people speak to them consult and argue with them and come into suitable relations with themi dont say of lords and retainers but of knowers and doers leaders and followersout of consideration for public safety if not for the common good i shall hang back gladly though i wont hear misstatements my fault is that i am too moderate i should respect myself more if i deserved their hatred this flood of luxury which is as dr shrapnel says the bodys drunkenness and the souls death cries for execration im too moderate but i shall quit the country ive no place here rosamund ahemed france nevil i should hardly think that france would please you in the present state of things over there half cynically with great satisfaction she had watched him fretting at the savoury morsels of her pie with a fork like a sparrow beak during the monologue that would have been so dreary to her but for her appreciation of the wholesome effect of the letting off of steam and her admiration of the fire of his eyes after finishing his plate he had less the look of a ship driving on to reefsome of his images of the country he called for claret and water sighing as he munched bread in vast portions evidently conceiving that to eat unbuttered bread was to abstain from luxury he praised passingly the quality of the bread it came from steynham and so did the milk and cream the butter chicken and eggs he was good enough not to object to the expenditure upon the transmission of the accustomed dainties altogether the gradual act of nibbling had conduced to his eating remarkably wellroyally rosamunds more than half cynical ideas of men and her custom of wringing unanimous verdicts from a jury of temporary impressions inclined her to imagine him a lover that had not to be so very much condoled with and a politician less alarming in practice than in theorysomewhat a gentleman of domestic tirades on politics as it is observed of your generous young radical of birth and fortune that he will become on the old high road to a round conservatism he pitched one of the morning papers to the floor in disorderly sheets muttering so theyre at me is dr shrapnel better she asked i hold to a good appetite as a sign of a mans recovery beauchamp was confronting the fog at the window he swung round dr shrapnel is better he has a particularly clever young female cook ah then yes then naturally he would naturally hasten to recover to partake of the viands maam rosamund murmured of her gladness that he should be able to enjoy them oddly enough he is not an eater of meat said beauchamp a vegetarian i beg you not to mention the fact to my lord you see you yourself can scarcely pardon it he does not exclude flesh from his table blackburn tuckham dined there once you are a thorough revolutionist dr shrapnel he observed the doctor does not exclude wine but he does not drink it poor tuckham went away entirely opposed to a radical he could not even meet as a boon fellow i begged him not to mention the circumstances as i have begged you he pledged me his word to that effect solemnly he correctly felt that if the truth were known there would be further cause for the reprobation of the man who had been his host and that poor girl nevil miss denham she contracted the habit of eating meat at school and drinking wine in paris and continues it occasionally now run upstairs insist on food inform madame de rouaillout that her brother m le comte de croisnel will soon be here and should not find her ill talk to her as you women can talk keep the blinds down in her room light a dozen wax candles tell her i have no thought but of her its a lie of no woman but of her that you may say but that you cant say you can say i am devotedha what stuff ive only to open my mouthsay nothing of me let her think the worstunless it comes to a question of her life then be a merciful good woman he squeezed her fingers communicating his muscular tremble to her sensitive womans frame and electrically convincing her that he was a lover she went up stairs in ten minutes she descended and found him pacing up and down the hall madame de rouaillout is much the same she said he nodded looked up the stairs and about for his hat and gloves drew on the gloves fixed the buttons blinked at his watch and settled his hat as he was accustomed to wear it all very methodically and talking rapidly but except for certain precise directions which were not needed by so careful a housekeeper and nurse as rosamund was known to be she could not catch a word of meaning he had some appointment it seemed perhaps he was off for a doctora fresh instance of his masculine incapacity to understand patient endurance after opening the housedoor and returning to the foot of the stairs listening and sighing he disappeared it struck her that he was trying to be two men at once the litter of newspaper sheets in the morning room brought his exclamation to her mind theyre at me her eyes ran down the columns and were seized by the print of his name in large type a leading article was devoted to commanders beauchamps recent speech delivered in the great manufacturing town of gunningham at a meeting under the presidency of the mayor and his replies to particular questions addressed to him one being what right did he conceive himself to have to wear the sovereigns uniform in professing republican opinions rosamund winced for her darling during her first perusal of the article it was of the sarcastically caressing kind masterly in ease of style as the flourish of the executioner well may be with poor bare back hung up to a leisurely administration of the scourge an allusion to jack on shore almost persuaded her that his uncle everard had inspired the writer of the article beauchamps reply to the question of his loyalty was not quoted he was however complimented on his frankness at the same time he was assured that his error lay in a too great proneness to make distinctions and that there was no distinction between sovereign and country in a loyal and contented land which could thank him for gallant services in war while taking him for the solitary example to be cited at the present period of the evils of a comparatively long peace doubtless the tedium of such a state to a man of the temperament of the gallant commander etc the termination of the article was indulgent rosamund recurred to the final paragraph for comfort and though she loved beauchamp the test of her representative feminine sentiment regarding his political career when personal feeling on his behalf had subsided was that the writer of the article must have received an intimation to deal both smartly and forbearingly with the offender and from whom but her lord her notions of the conduct of the press were primitive in a summary of the article beauchamp was treated as naughty boy formerly brave boy and likely by and by to be good boy her secret heart would have spoken similarly with more emphasis on the flattering terms a telegram arrived from her lord she was bidden to have the house clear for him by noon of the next day how could that be done but to write blankly to inform the earl of romfrey that he was excluded from his own house was another impossibility hateful man she apostrophized captain baskelett and sat down supporting her chin in a prolonged meditation the card of a french lady bearing the name of madame dauffray was handed to her beauchamp had gone off to his friend lydiard to fortify himself in his resolve to reply to that newspaper article by eliciting counsel to the contrary phrase by phrase he fought through the first half of his composition of the reply against lydiard yielding to him on a point or two of literary judgement only the more vehemently to maintain his ideas of discretion which were that he would not take shelter behind a single subterfuge that he would try this question nakedly though he should stand alone that he would stake his position on it and establish his right to speak his opinions and as for unseasonable times he protested it was the cry of a gorged middle class frightened of further action and making snug with compromise would it be a seasonable time when there was uproar then it would be a time to be silent on such themes they could be discussed calmly now and without danger and whether he was hunted or not he cared nothing he declined to consider the peculiar nature of englishmen they must hear truth or perish knowing the difficulty once afflicting beauchamp in the art of speaking on politics tersely lydiard was rather astonished at his well delivered cannonade and he fancied that his modesty had been displaced by the new acquirement not knowing the nervous fever of his friends condition for which the rattle of speech was balm and contention a native element and the assumption of truth a necessity beauchamp hugged his politics like some who show their love of the pleasures of life by taking to them angrily it was all he had he had given up all for it he forced lydiard to lay down his pen and walk back to the square with him and went on arguing interjecting sneering thumping the old country raising and oversetting her treating her alternately like a disrespected grandmother and like a woman anciently beloved as a dead lump and as a garden of seeds reviewing prominent political men laughing at the dwarf giants finally casting anchor on a mechanics institute that he had recently heard of where working men met weekly for the purpose of reading the british poets thats the best thing ive heard of late he said shaking lydiards hand on the door steps ah youre commander beauchamp i think i know you ive seen you on a platform cried a fresh faced man in decent clothes halting on his way along the pavement and if you were in your uniform you damned republican dog id strip you with my own hands for the disloyal scoundrel you are with your pimping republicanism and capsizing everything in a country like old england its the cat o nine tails you want and the bosen to lay on and id do it myself and mind me when next i catch sight of you in blue and gold lace ill compel you to show cause why you wear it and prove your case or else ill make a cupid of you and no joke about it i dont pay money for a nincompoop to outrage my feelings of respect and loyalty when hes in my pay d ye hear youre in my pay and you do your duty or ill kick ye out of it its no empty threat you look out for your next public speech if its anywhere within forty mile of london get along with a scowl and a very ugly yah worthy of cannibal jaws the man passed off beauchamp kept eye on him what class does a fellow like that come of hes a harmless enthusiast said lydiard he has been reading the article and has got excited over it i wish i had the fellows address beauchamp looked wistfully at lydiard but he did not stimulate the generous offer to obtain it for him perhaps it was as well to forget the fellow you see the effect of those articles he said you see what i mean by unseasonable times lydiard retorted he didnt talk like a tradesman beauchamp mused he may be one for all that its better to class him as an enthusiast an enthusiast beauchamp stamped for what for the existing order of things for his beef and ale for the titles he is accustomed to read in the papers you dont study your countrymen id study that fellow if i had the chance you would probably find him one of the emptiest with a rather worse temper than most of them beauchamp shook lydiards hand saying the widow theres no woman like her well now youre freewhy not i think i put one man out of the field too early besides repeat that and you may have to say too late when shall you go down to bevisham when i cant tell when ive gone through fire there never was a home for me like the cottage and the old man and the dear good girlthe best of girls if you hadnt a little spoilt her with your philosophy of the two sides of the case ive not given her the brains shes always doubtful of doing doubtful of action she has no will so she is fatalistic and an argument between us ends in her submitting as if she must submit to me because im overbearing instead of accepting the fact she feels your influence shes against the publication of the dawnfor the present its an unseasonable time i argue with her i dont get hold of her mind a bit but at last she says very well she has your head and you have her heart lydiard could have rejoined they said good bye neither of them aware of the others task of endurance as they were parting beauchamp perceived his old comrade jack wilmore walking past jack he called wilmore glanced round how do you do beauchamp where are you off to jack down to the admiralty im rather in a hurry i have an appointment cant you stop just a minute im afraid i cant good morning it was incredible but this old friend the simplest heart alive retreated without a touch of his hand and with a sorely wounded air that newspaper article appears to have been generally read beauchamp said to lydiard who answered the article did not put the idea of you into mens minds but gave tongue to it you may take it for an instance of the sagacity of the press you wouldnt take that man and me to have been messmates for years old jack wilmore dont go lydiard lydiard declared that he was bound to go he was engaged to read italian for an hour with mrs wardour devereux then go by all means beauchamp dismissed him he felt as if he had held a review of his friends and enemies on the door step and found them of one colour if it was an accident befalling him in a london square during a space of a quarter of an hour what of the sentiments of universal england lady barbaras elopement with lord alfred last year did not rouse much execration hardly worse than gossip and compassion beauchamp drank a great deal of bitterness from his reflections they who provoke huge battles and gain but lame victories over themselves insensibly harden to the habit of distilling sour thoughts from their mischances and from most occurrences so does the world they combat win on them for says dr shrapnel the world and nature which are opposed in relation to our vital interests each agrees to demand of us a perfect victory on pain otherwise of proving it a stage performance and the victory over the world as over nature is over self and this victory lies in yielding perpetual service to the world and none to nature for the world has to be wrought out nature to be subdued the interior of the house was like a change of elements to beauchamp he had never before said to himself i have done my best and i am beaten outside of it his native pugnacity had been stimulated but here within the walls where rene lay silently breathing barely breathing it might be dying he was overcome and left it to circumstance to carry him to a conclusion he went up stairs to the drawing room where he beheld madame dauffray in conversation with rosamund i was assured by madame la comtesse that i should see you to day the french lady said as she swam to meet him it is a real pleasure and pressing his hand she continued but i fear you will be disappointed of seeing my sister she would rashly try your climate at its worst period believe me i do not join in decrying it except on her account i could have forewarned her of an english winter and early spring you know her impetuosity suddenly she decided on accepting the invitation of madame la comtesse and though i have no fears of her health she is at present a victim of the inclement weather you have seen her madame said beauchamp so well had the clever lady played the dupe that he forgot there was a part for him to play even the acquiescence of rosamund in the title of countess bewildered him madame dauffray has been sitting for an hour with madame de rouaillout said rosamund he spoke of rolands coming ah said madame dauffray and turned to rosamund you have determined to surprise us then you will have a gathering of the whole family in your hospitable house madame la comtesse if m la marquis will do it that honour madame my brother is in london madame dauffray said to beauchamp the shattering blow was merited by one who could not rejoice that he had acted rightly chapter xliii the earl of romfrey and the countess an extraordinary telegraphic message followed by a still more extraordinary letter the next morning from rosamund culling all but interdicted the immediate occupation of his house in town to everard now earl of romfrey she begged him briefly not to come until after the funeral and proposed to give him good reasons for her request at their meeting i repeat i pledge myself to satisfy you on this point she wrote her tone was that of one of your heroic women of history refusing to surrender a fortress everards wrath was ever of a complexion that could suffer postponements without his having to fear an abatement of it he had no business to transact in london and he had much at the castle so he yielded himself up to his new sensations which are not commonly the portion of gentlemen of his years he anticipated that nevil would at least come down to the funeral but there was no appearance of him nor a word to excuse his absence cecil was his only supporter they walked together between the double ranks of bare polls of the tenantry and peasantry resembling in a fashion old froissart engravings the earl used to dote on in his boyhood representing bodies of manacled citizens whose humbled heads looked like nuts to be cracked outside the gates of captured french towns awaiting the disposition of their conqueror with his banner above him and prancing knights around that was a glory of the past he had no successor the thought was chilling the solitariness of childlessness to an aged man chief of a most ancient and martial house and proud of his blood gave him the statues outlook on a desert and made him feel that he was no more than a whirl of the dust settling to the dust he listened to the parson curiously and consentingly we are ashes ten centuries had come to an end in him to prove the formula correct the chronicle of the house would state that the last earl of romfrey left no heir cecil was a fine figure walking beside him measured by feet he might be a worthy holder of great lands but so heartily did the earl despise this nephew that he never thought of trying strength with the fellow and hardly cared to know what his value was beyond his immediate uses as an instrument to strike with beauchamp of romfrey had been his dream not baskelett and it increased his disgust of beauchamp that baskelett should step forward as the man no doubt cecil would hunt the county famously he would preserve game with the sleepless eye of a general of the jesuits these things were to be considered two days after the funeral lord romfrey proceeded to london he was met at the station by rosamund and informed that his house was not yet vacated by the french family and where have you arranged for me to go maam he asked her complacently she named an hotel where she had taken rooms for him he nodded and was driven to the hotel saying little on the road as she expected he was heavily armed against her and nevil youre the slave of the fellow maam you are so infatuated that you second his amours in my house i must wait for a clearance it seems he cast a comical glance of disapprobation on the fittings of the hotel apartment abhorring gilt they leave us the day after to morrow said rosamund out of breath with nervousness at the commencement of the fray and skipping over the opening ground of a bold statement of facts madame de rouaillout has been unwell she is not yet recovered she has just risen her sister in law has nursed her her husband seems much broken in health he is perfect on the points of courtesy that is lucky maam her brother nevils comrade in the war was there also who came first my lord you have only heard captain baskeletts version of the story she has been my guest since the first day of her landing in england there cannot possibly be an imputation on her maam if her husband manages to be satisfied what on earth have i to do with it i am thinking of nevil my lord youre never thinking of any one else maam he sleeps here at this hotel he left the house to madame de rouaillout i bear witness to that you two seem to have made your preparations to stand a criminal trial it is pure truth my lord do you take me to be anxious about the fellows virtue she is a lady who would please you a scandal in my house does not please me the only approach to a scandal was made by captain baskelett a poor devil locked out of his bed on a winters night hullabaloos with pretty good reason i suppose he felt the contrast my lord this lady did me the honour to come to me on a visit i have not previously presumed to entertain a friend she probably formed no estimate of my exact position the earl with a gesture implied rosamunds privilege to act the hostess to friends you invited her he said that is i had told her i hoped she would come to england she expected you to be at the house in town on her arrival it was her impulse to come she came alone she may have desired to be away from her own people for a time there may have been domestic differences these cases are delicate this case appears to have been so delicate that you had to lock out a fourth party it is indelicate and base of captain baskelett to complain and to hint nevil had to submit to the same and captain baskelett took his revenge on the housedoor and the bells the house was visited by the police next morning do you suspect him to have known you were inside the house that night she could not say so but hatred of cecil urged her past the bounds of habitual reticence to put it to her lord whether he imagining the worst would have behaved like cecil to this he did not reply but remarked i am sorry he annoyed you maam it is not the annoyance to me it is the shocking the unmanly insolence to a lady and a foreign lady thats a matter between him and nevil i uphold him then my lord i am silent silent she remained but lord romfrey was also silent and silence being a weapon of offence only when it is practised by one out of two she had to reflect whether in speaking no further she had finished her business captain baskelett stays at the castle she asked he likes his quarters there nevil could not go down to romfrey my lord he was obliged to wait and see and help me to entertain her brother and her husband why maam but i have no objection to his making the marquis a happy husband he has done what few men would have done that she may be a self respecting wife the parsons in that fellow lord romfrey exclaimed now i have the story she came to him he declined the gift and you were turned into the curtain for them if he had only been off with her he would have done the country good service here hes a failure and a nuisance hes a common cock shy for the journals im tired of hearing of him hes a stench in our nostrils hes tired of the woman he loves her maam youre hoodwinked if he refused to have her theres a something he loves better i dont believe weve bred a downright lackadaisical donkey in our family i know him hes not a fellow for abstract morality i know him its bargain against bargain with him ill do him that justice i hear he has ordered the removal of the jersey bull from holdesbury and the beast is mine lord romfrey concluded in a lower key nevil has taken him ha pull and pull then he contends that he is bound by a promise to give an american gentleman the refusal of the bull and you must sign an engagement to keep the animal no longer than two years i sign no engagement i stick to the bull consent to see nevil to night my lord when he has apologized to you i may maam surely he did more in requesting me to render him a service theres not a creature living that fellow wouldnt get to serve him if he knew the trick we should all of us be marching on london at shrapnels heels the political mania is just as incurable as hydrophobia and hes bitten thats clear bitten perhaps but not mad as you have always contended the true case is incurable but it is very rare and is this one its uncommonly like a true case though i havent seen him foam at the mouth and shun wateras his mob does rosamund restrained some tears betraying the effort to hide the moisture i am no match for you my lord i try to plead on his behalfi do worse than if i were dumb this i most earnestly say he is the nevil beauchamp who fought for his country and did not abandon her cause though he stood therewe had it from colonel halketta skeleton and he is the nevil whoi am poorly paying my debt to himdefended me from the aspersions of his cousin boys lord romfrey ejaculated it is the same dispute between them as men have you forgotten my proposal to shield you from liars and scandalmongers could i ever forget it rosamund appeared to come shining out of a cloud princeliest and truest gentleman i thought you then and i know you to be my dear lord i fancied i had lived the scandal down i was under the delusion that i had grown to be past backbiting and that no man could stand before me to insult and vilify me but for a woman in any so called doubtful position it seems that the coward will not be wanting to strike her in quitting your service i am able to affirm that only once during the whole term of it have i consciously overstepped the line of my duties it was for nevil and captain baskelett undertook to defend your reputation in consequence has the rascal been questioning your conduct the earl frowned oh no not questioning he does not question he accuses he never doubted and what he went shouting as a boy is plain matter of fact to him now he is devoted to you it was for your sake that he desired me to keep my name from being mixed up in a scandal he foresaw the occurrence of in your house he permitted himself to sneer at you he has the art of sneering on this occasion he wished to be direct and personal what sort of hints were they lord romfrey strode away from her chair that the answer might be easy to her for she was red and evidently suffering from shame as well as indignation the hints we call distinct said rosamund in words in hard words then you wont meet cecil such a question and the tone of indifference in which it came surprised and revolted her so that the unreflecting reply leapt out i would rather meet a devil of how tremblingly vehemently and hastily she had said it she was unaware to her lord it was an outcry of nature astutely touched by him to put her to proof he continued his long leisurely strides nodding over his feet rosamund stood up she looked a very noble figure in her broad black furred robe i have one serious confession to make sir whats that said he i would avoid it for it cannot lead to particular harm but i have an enemy who may poison your ear in my absence and first i resign my position i have forfeited it time goes forward maam and you go round speak to the point do you mean that you toss up the reins of my household i do you trace it to nevil immediately i do the fellow wants to upset the country and he begins with me you are wrong my lord what i have done places me at captain baskeletts mercy it is too loathsome to think of worse than the whip worse than your displeasure it might never be known but the thought that it might gives me courage you have said that to protect a woman everything is permissible it is your creed my lord and because the world i have heard you say is unjust and implacable to women in some cases i think so too in reality i followed your instructions i mean your example cheap chivalry on my part but it pained me not a little i beg to urge that in my defence well maam you have tied the knot tight enough perhaps now youll cut it said the earl rosamund gasped softly m le marquis is a gentleman who after a life of dissipation has been reminded by bad health that he has a young and beautiful wife he dug his pit to fall into ithes jealous she shook her head to indicate the immeasurable senile jealousy is anxious to be deceived he could hardly be deceived so far as to imagine that madame la marquise would visit me such as i am as my guest knowingly or not his very clever sister a good woman and a friend to husband and wifea frenchwoman of the purest typegave me the title she insisted on it and i presumed to guess that she deemed it necessary for the sake of peace in that home lord romfrey appeared merely inquisitive his eyebrows were lifted in permanence his eyes were mild she continued they leave england in a few hours they are not likely to return i permitted him to address me with the title of countess of romfrey said the earl rosamund bowed his mouth contracted she did not expect thunder to issue from it but she did fear to hear a sarcasm or that she would have to endure a deadly silence and she was gathering her own lips in imitation of his to nerve herself for some stroke to come when he laughed in his peculiar close mouthed manner im afraid youve dished yourself you cannot forgive me my lord he indulged in more of his laughter and abruptly summoning gravity bade her talk to him of affairs he himself talked of the condition of the castle and with a certain off hand contempt of the ladies of the family and cecils father sir john what are they to me said he and he complained of having been called last earl of romfrey the line ends undegenerate said rosamund fervidly though she knew not where she stood ends quoth the earl i must see stukely he added briskly and stooped to her i beg you to drive me to my club countess oh sir once a countess always a countess but once an impostor my lord not always well hope he enjoyed this little variation in the language of comedy letting it drop to say be here to morrow early dont chase that family away from the house do as you will but not a word of nevil to me hes a bad mess in any mans porringer its time for me to claim exemption of him from mine she dared not let her thoughts flow for to think was to triumph and possibly to be deluded they came in copious volumes when lord romfrey alighting at his club called to the coachman drive the countess home they were not thoughts of triumph absolutely in her cooler mind she felt that it was a bad finish of a gallant battle few women had risen against a tattling and pelting world so stedfastly and would it not have been better to keep her own ground which she had won with tears and some natural strength and therewith her liberty which she prized the hateful cecil a reminder of whom set her cheeks burning and turned her heart to serpent had forced her to it so she honestly conceived owing to the circumstance of her honestly disliking the pomps of life and not desiring to occupy any position of brilliancy she thought assuredly of her hoard of animosity toward the scandalmongers and of the quiet glance she would cast behind on them and below that thought came as a fruit not as a reflection but if ever two offending young gentlemen nephews of a long suffering uncle were circumvented undermined and struck to earth with one blow here was the instance this was accomplished by lord romfreys resolution to make the lady he had learnt to esteem his countess and more it fixed to him for life one whom he could not bear to think of losing and still more it might be but what more was unwritten on his tablets rosamund failed to recollect that everard romfrey never took a step without seeing a combination of objects to be gained by it chapter xliv the nephews of the earl and another exhibition of the two passions in beauchamp it was now the season when london is as a lighted tower to her provinces and among other gentlemen hurried thither by attraction captain baskelett arrived although not a personage in the house of commons he was a vote and if he never committed himself to the perils of a speech he made himself heard his was the part of chorus which he performed with a fairly close imitation of the original cries of periods before parliaments were instituted thus representing a stage in the human development besides the borough of bevisham he arrived in the best of moods for the emission of high pitched vowel sounds otherwise in the worst of tempers his uncle had notified an addition of his income to him at romfrey together with commands that he should quit the castle instantly and there did that woman mistress culling do the honours to nevil beauchamps french party he assured lord palmet of his positive knowledge of the fact incredible as the sanction of such immoral proceedings by the earl of romfrey must appear to that young nobleman additions to income are of course acceptable but in the form of a palpable stipulation for silence they neither awaken gratitude nor effect their purpose quite the contrary they prick the moral mind to sit in judgement on the donor it means she fears me cecil confidently thought and said of the intriguing woman who managed his patron the town house was open to him lord romfrey was at steynham cecil could not suppose that he was falling into a pit in entering it he happened to be the favourite of the old housekeeper who liked him for his haughtiness which was to her thinking the sign of real english nobility and perhaps it is the popular sign and a tonic to the people she raised lamentations over the shame of the locking of the door against him that awful night declaring she had almost mustered courage to go down to him herself in spite of mrs cullings orders the old woman lowered her voice to tell him that her official superior had permitted the french gentleman and ladies to call her countess this she knew for a certainty though she knew nothing of french but the french lady who came second brought a maid who knew english a little and she said the very wordsthe countess and said also that her party took mrs culling for the countess of romfrey what was more my lords coachman caught it up and he called her countess and he had a quarrel about it with the footman kendall and the day after a dreadful affair between them in the mews home drives madam and kendall is to go up to her and down the poor man comes and not a word to be got out of him but as if he had seen a ghost she have such power cecils admirer concluded i wager i match her cecil said to himself pulling at his wristbands and letting his lower teeth shine out the means of matching her were not so palpable as the resolution first he took men into his confidence then he touched lightly on the story to ladies with the question what ought i to do in consideration for the earl of romfrey he ought not to pass it over he suggested the ladies of the family urged him to go to steynham and boldly confront the woman he was not prepared for that better it seemed to him to blow the rumour and make it the topic of the season until lord romfrey should hear of it cecil had the ear of the town for a month he was in the act of slicing the air with his right hand in his accustomed style one evening at lady elseas to protest how vast was the dishonour done to the family by mistress culling when stukely culbrett stopped him saying the lady you speak of is the countess of romfrey i was present at the marriage cecil received the shock in the attitude of those martial figures we see wielding two wooden swords in provincial gardens to tell the disposition of the wind abruptly abandoned by it they stand transfixed one sword aloft the other at their heels the resemblance extended to his astonished countenance his big chest heaved like many another wounded giant before him he experienced the insufficiency of interjections to solace pain for them however the rocks were handy to fling the trees to uproot heavens concave resounded companionably to their bellowings relief of so concrete a kind is not to be obtained in crowded london assemblies you are jestingyou are a jester he contrived to say it was a private marriage and i was a witness replied stukely lord romfrey has made an honest woman of her has he a peeress you mean cecil bowed exactly i am corrected i mean a peeress he got out of the room with as high an air as he could command feeling as if a bar of iron had flattened his head next day it was intimated to him by one of the steynham servants that apartments were ready for him at the residence of the late earl lord romfreys house was about to be occupied by the countess of romfrey cecil had to quit and he chose to be enamoured of that dignity of sulking so seductive to the wounded spirit of man rosamund countess of romfrey had worse to endure from beauchamp he indeed came to the house and he went through the formalities of congratulation but his opinion of her step was unconcealed that she had taken it for the title he distressed her by reviving the case of dr shrapnel as though it were a matter of yesterday telling her she had married a man with a stain on him she should have exacted the apology as a nuptial present ay and she would have done it if she had cared for the earls honour or her own so little did he understand men so tenacious was he of his ideas she had almost forgotten the case of dr shrapnel and to see it shooting up again in the new path of her life was really irritating rosamund did not defend herself i am very glad you have come nevil she said your uncle holds to the ceremony i may be of real use to you now i wish to be you have only to prove it said he if you can turn his mind to marriage you can send him to bevisham my chief thought is to serve you i know it is i know it is he rejoined with some fervour you have served me and made me miserable for life and rightly never mind alls well while the hands to the axe beauchamp smoothed his forehead roughly trying hard to inspire himself with the tonic draughts of sentiments cast in the form of proverbs lord romfrey saw her you say he did nevil and admired her well if i suffer let me think of her for courage and nobleness i shall never find her equal have you changed your ideas of frenchwomen now not a word you say not a look to show her disdain of me whenever my name was mentioned she could scarcely feel disdain she was guilty of a sad error through trusting in me will nothing teach you where the fault lies you women have no mercy for women she went through the parade to romfrey castle and back and she must have been perishing at heart that you english call acting in history you have a respect for such acting up to the scaffold good bye to her theres a story ended one thing you must promise youre a peeress maam the storys out everybody has heard of it that babbler has done his worst if you have a becoming appreciation of your title you will promise me honestlyno give me your word as a woman i can esteemthat you will not run about excusing me whatever you hear said or suggested say nothing yourself i insist on your keeping silence press my hand nevil how foolish its my will it is unreasonable you give your enemies licence i know whats in your head take my hand and let me have your word for it but if persons you like very much nevil should hear promise you are a woman not to break your word if i decline your hand ill kiss it oh my darling rosamund flung her arms round him and strained him an instant to her bosom what have i but you in the world my comfort was the hope that i might serve you yes by slaying one woman as an offering to another it would be impossible for you to speak the truth dont you see it would be a lie against her and making a figure of me that a man would rather drop to the ground than have shown of him i was to blame and only i madame de rouaillout was as utterly deceived by me as ever a trusting woman by a brute i look at myself and hardly believe its the same man i wrote to her that i was unchangedand i was entirely changed another creature anything lord romfrey may please to call me but nevil i repeat if miss halkett should hear she knows by this time at present she is ignorant of it and what is miss halkett to me more than you imagined in that struggle you underwent i think nevil oh if only to save her from captain baskelett he gained your uncles consent when they were at the castle to support him in proposing for her he is persistent women have been snared without loving she is a great heiress reflect on his use of her wealth you respect her if you have no warmer feeling let me assure you that the husband of cecilia if he is of romfrey blood has the fairest chance of the estates that man will employ every weapon he will soon be here bowing to me to turn me to his purposes cecilia can see through baskelett said beauchamp single mindedly selfish men may be seen through and through and still be dangerous nevil the supposition is that we know the worst of them he carries a story to poison her mind she could resist it if you and she were in full confidence together if she did not love you she could resist it she does and for some strange reason beyond my capacity to fathom you have not come to an understanding sanction my speaking to her just to put her on her guard privately not to injure that poor lady but to explain shall she not know the truth i need say but very little indeed all i can say is that finding the marquise in london one evening you telegraphed for me to attend on her and i joined you you shake your head but surely it is due to miss halkett she should be protected from what will certainly wound her deeply her father is afraid of you on the score of your theories i foresee it he will hear the scandal he will imagine you as bad in morals as in politics and you have lost your friend in lord romfreythough he shall not be your enemy colonel halkett and cecilia called on us at steynham she was looking beautiful a trifle melancholy the talk was of yourthati do not like it but you hold those opinionsthe republicanism she had read your published letters she spoke to me of your sincerity colonel halkett of course was vexed it is the same with all your friends she however by her tone led me to think that she sees you as you are more than in what you do they are now in wales they will be in town after easter then you must expect that her feeling for you will be tried unless but you will you will let me speak to her nevil my position allows me certain liberties i was previously debarred from you have not been so very tender to your cecilia that you can afford to give her fresh reasons for sorrowful perplexity and why should you stand to be blackened by scandalmongers when a few words of mine will prove that instead of weak you have been strong instead of libertine blameless i am not using fine phrases i would not i would be as thoughtful of you as if you were present and for her sake i repeat the truth should be told to her i have a lock of her hair cecilias where said beauchamp it is at steynham rosamund primmed her lips at the success of her probing touch but she was unaware of the chief reason for his doting on those fair locks and how they coloured his imagination since the day of the drive into bevisham now leave me my dear nevil she said lord romfrey will soon be here and it is as well for the moment that you should not meet him if it can be avoided beauchamp left her like a man out argued and overcome he had no wish to meet his uncle whose behaviour in contracting a misalliance and casting a shadow on the family in a manner so perfectly objectless and senseless appeared to him to call for the reverse of compliments cecilias lock of hair lying at steynham hung in his mind he saw the smooth flat curl lying secret like a smile the graceful head it had fallen from was dimmer in his mental eye he went so far in this charmed meditation as to feel envy of the possessor of the severed lock passingly he wondered with the wonder of reproach that the possessor should deem it enough to possess the lock and resign it to a drawer or a desk and as when life rolls back on us after the long ebb of illness little whispers and diminutive images of the old joys and prizes of life arrest and fill our hearts or as to men who have been beaten down by storms the opening of a daisy is dearer than the blazing orient which bids it open so the visionary lock of cecilias hair became cecilias self to beauchamp yielding him as much of her as he could bear to think of for his heart was shattered why had she given it to his warmest friend for the asking probably this question was the first ripple of the breeze from other emotions beginning to flow fast he walked out of london to be alone and to think and from the palings of a road on a south western run of high land he gazed at the great citya place conquerable yet with the proper appliances for subjugating it the starting of his daily newspaper the dawn say as a commencement it began to seem a possible enterprise it soon seemed a proximate one if cecilia he left the exclamation a blank but not an empty dash in the brain rather like the shroud of night on a vast and gloriously imagined land nay the prospect was partly visible as the unknown country becomes by degrees to the travellers optics on the dark hill tops it is much of course to be domestically well mated but to be fortified and armed by ones wife with a weapon to fight the world is rare good fortune a rapturous and an infinite satisfaction he could now support of his own resources a weekly paper a paper published weekly however is a poor thing out of the tide behind the date mainly a literary periodical no foremost combatant in politics no champion in the arena hardly better than a commentator on the events of the six past days an echo not a voice it sits on a saturday bench and pretends to sum up who listens the verdict knocks dust out of a cushion it has no steady continuous pressure of influence it is the organ of sleepers of all the bigger instruments of money it is the feeblest beauchamp thought his constant faith in the good effects of utterance naturally inclined him to value six occasions per week above one and in the fight he was for waging it was necessary that he should enter the ring and hit blow for blow sans intermission a statement that he could call false must be challenged hot the next morning the covert toryism the fits of flunkeyism the cowardice of the relapsing middle class which is now england before mankind because it fills the sails of the press must be exposed it supports the press in its own interests affecting to speak for the people it belies the people and this press declaring itself independent can hardly walk for fear of treading on an interest here an interest there it cannot have a conscience it is a bad guide a false guardian its abject claim to be our national and popular interpretereven that is hollow and a mockery it is powerful only while subservient an engine of money appealing to the sensitiveness of money it has no connection with the mind of the nation and that it is not of but apart from the people may be seen when great crises come can it stop a war the people would and with thunder had they the medium but in strong gales the power of the press collapses it wheezes like a pricked pigskin of a piper at its best beauchamp regarded our lordly press as a curiously diapered curtain and delusive mask behind which the country struggles vainly to show an honest feature and as a trumpet that deafened and terrorized the people a mere engine of leaguers banded to keep a smooth face upon affairs quite soullessly he meanwhile having to be dumb but a journal that should be actually independent of circulation and advertisements a popular journal in the true sense very lungs to the people for them to breathe freely through at last and be heard out of it with well paid men of mark to head and aid themthe establishment of such a journal seemed to him brave work of a life though one should die early the money launching it would be coin washed pure of its iniquity of selfish reproduction by service to mankind this dawn of his conception stood over him like a rosier aurora for the country he beheld it in imagination as a new light rising above hugeous london you turn the sheets of the dawn and it is the manhood of the land addressing you no longer that alternately puling and insolent cry of the coffers the health wealth comfort contentment of the greater number are there to be striven for in contempt of compromise and unseasonable times beauchamps illuminated dream of the power of his dawn to vitalize old england liberated him singularly from his wearing regrets and heart sickness surely cecilia who judged him sincere might be bent to join hands with him for so good a work she would bring riches to her husband sufficient he required the ablest men of the country to write for him and it was just that they should be largely paid they at least in their present public apathy would demand it to fight the brewers distillers publicans the shopkeepers the parsons the landlords the law limpets and also the indifferents the logs the cravens and the fools high talent was needed and an ardour stimulated by rates of pay outdoing the offers of the lucre journals a large annual outlay would therefore be needed possibly for as long as a quarter of a century cecilia and her husband would have to live modestly but her inheritance would be immense colonel halkett had never spent a tenth of his income in time he might be taught to perceive in the dawn the one greatly beneficent enterprise of his day he might through his daughters eyes and the growing success of the journal benevolent and gallant old man patriotic as he was and kind at heart he might learn to see in the dawn a broader channel of philanthropy and chivalry than any we have yet had a notion of in englanda school of popular education into the bargain beauchamp reverted to the shining curl it could not have been clearer to vision if it had lain under his eyes ay that first wild life of his was dead he had slain it now for the second and sober life who can say the countess of romfrey suggested itcecilia may have prompted him in his unknown heart to the sacrifice of a lawless love though he took it for simply barren iron duty brooding on her he began to fancy the victory over himself less and less a lame one for it waxed less and less difficult in his contemplation of it he was looking forward instead of back who cut off the lock probably cecilia herself and thinking at the moment that he would see it perhaps beg for it the lustrous little ring of hair wound round his heart smiled both on its emotions and its aims bound them in one but proportionately as he grew tender to cecilia his consideration for rene increased that became a law to him pity nourished it and glimpses of self contempt and something like worship of her high heartedness he wrote to the countess forbidding her sharply and absolutely to attempt a vindication of him by explanations to any persons whomsoever and stating that he would have no falsehoods told he desired her to keep to the original tale of the visit of the french family to her as guests of the countess of romfrey contradictory indeed rosamund shook her head over him for a wilful character that is guilty of issuing contradictory commands to friends who would be friends in spite of him appears to be expressly angling for the cynical spirit so surely does it rise and snap at such provocation he was even more emphatic when they next met he would not listen to a remonstrance and though of course her love of him granted him the liberty to speak to her in what tone he pleased there were sensations proper to her new rank which his intemperateness wounded and tempted to revolt when he vexed her with unreason she had a glimpse of the face he might wear to his enemies he was quite as resolute too about that slight matter of the jersey bull he had the bull in bevisham and would not give him up without the sign manual of lord romfrey to an agreement to resign him over to the american quaker gentleman after a certain term moreover not once had he by exclamation or innuendo during the period of his recent grief for the loss of his first love complained of his uncle everards refusal in the old days to aid him in suing for rene rosamund had expected that he would she thought it unloverlike in him not to stir the past and to bow to intolerable facts this idea of him coming in conjunction with his present behaviour convinced her that there existed a contradiction in his nature whence it ensued that she lost her warmth as an advocate designing to intercede for him with cecilia and warmth being gone the power of the scandal seemed to her unassailable how she could ever have presumed to combat it was an astonishment to her cecilia might be indulgent she might have faith in nevil little else could be hoped for the occupations duties and ceremonies of her new position contributed to the lassitude into which rosamund sank and she soon had a communication to make to her lord the nature of which was more startling to herself even tragic the bondwoman is a free woman compared with the wife lord romfreys friends noticed a glow of hearty health in the splendid old man and a prouder animation of eye and stature and it was agreed that matrimony suited him well luckily for cecil he did not sulk very long a spectator of the earls first introduction to the house of peers he called on his uncle the following day and rosamund accepted his homage in her husbands presence he vowed that my lord was the noblest figure in the whole assembly that it had been to him the most moving sight he had ever witnessed that nevil should have been there to see it and experience what he had felt it would have done old nevil incalculable good and as far as his grief at the idea and some reticence would let him venture he sighed to think of the last earl of romfrey having been seen by him taking the seat of his fathers lord romfrey shouted ha like a checked peal of laughter and glanced at his wife chapter xlv a little plot against cecilia some days before easter week seymour austin went to mount laurels for rest at an express invitation from colonel halkett the working barrister who is also a working member of parliament is occasionally reminded that this mortal machine cannot adapt itself in perpetuity to the long hours of labour by night in the house of commons as well as by day in the courts which would seem to have been arranged by a compliant country for the purpose of aiding his particular and most honourable ambition to climb while continuing to fill his purse mr austin broke down early in the year he attributed it to a cold other representative gentlemen were on their backs of whom he could admit that the protracted nightwork had done them harm with the reservation that their constitutions were originally unsound but the house cannot get on without lawyers and lawyers must practise their profession and if they manage both to practise all day and sit half the night others should be able to do the simple late sitting and we english are an energetic people we must toil or be beaten and besides night brings counsel men are cooler and wiser by night any amount of work can be performed by careful feeders it is the stomach that kills the englishman brains are never the worse for activity they subsist on it these arguments and citations good and absurd of a man more at home in his harness than out of it were addressed to the colonel to stop his remonstrances and idle talk about burning the candle at both ends to that illustration mr austin replied that he did not burn it in the middle but you dont want money austin no but since ive had the habit of making it i have taken to like it but youre not ambitious very little but i should be sorry to be out of the tideway i call it a system of slaughter said the colonel and mr austin said the world goes in that waylove and slaughter not suicide though colonel halkett muttered no thats only incidental the casual word love led colonel halkett to speak to cecilia of an old love affair of seymour austins in discussing the state of his health with her the lady was the daughter of a famous admiral handsome and latterly of light fame mr austin had nothing to regret in her having married a man richer than himself i wish he had married a good woman said the colonel he looks unwell papa he thinks youre looking unwell my dear he thinks that of me cecilia prepared a radiant face for mr austin she forgot to keep it kindled and he suspected her to be a victim of one of the forms of youthful melancholy and laid stress on the benefit to health of a change of scene we have just returned from wales she said he remarked that it was hardly a change to be within shot of our newspapers the colour left her cheeks she fancied her father had betrayed her to the last man who should know her secret beauchamp and the newspapers were rolled together in her mind by the fever of apprehension wasting her ever since his declaration of republicanism and defence of it and an allusion to one must imply the other she feared feared but far from quailingly she had come to think that she could read the man she loved and detect a reasonableness in his extravagance her father had discovered the impolicy of attacking beauchamp in her hearing the fever by which cecilia was possessed on her lovers behalf often overcame discretion set her judgement in a whirl was like a delirium how it had happened she knew not she knew only her wretched state a frenzy seized her whenever his name was uttered to excuse account for all but glorify him publicly and the immodesty of her conduct was perceptible to her while she thus made her heart bare she exposed herself once of late at itchincope and had tried to school her tongue before she went there she felt that she should inevitably be seen through by seymour austin if he took the worlds view of beauchamp and this to her was like a descent on the rapids to an end one shuts eyes from he noticed her perturbation and spoke of it to her father yes im very miserable about her the colonel confessed girls dont see they cant guess they have no idea of the right kind of man for them a man like blackburn tuckham now a man a father could leave his girl to with confidence he works for me like a slave i cant guess why he doesnt look as if he were attracted theres a man but no harum scarum fellows take their fancy is she that kind of young lady said mr austin no one would have thought so she pretends to have opinions upon politics now its of no use to talk of it but beauchamp was fully indicated mr austin proposed to cecilia that they should spend easter week in rome her face lighted and clouded i should like it she said negatively whats the objection none except that mount laurels in spring has grown dear to me and we have engagements in london i am not quick i suppose at new projects i have ordered the yacht to be fitted out for a cruise in the mediterranean early in the summer there is an objection i am sureyes papa has invited mr tuckham here for easter we could carry him with us yes but i should wish to be entirely under your tutelage in rome we would pair your father and he you and i we might do that but mr tuckham is like you devoted to work and unlike you careless of antiquities and art he is a hard and serious worker and therefore the best of companions for a holiday at present he is working for the colonel who would easily persuade him to give over and come with us he certainly does love papa said cecilia mr austin dwelt on that subject cecilia perceived that she had praised mr tuckham for his devotedness to her father without recognizing the beauty of nature in the young man who could voluntarily take service under the elder he esteemed in simple admiration of him mr austin scarcely said so much or expected her to see the half of it but she wished to be extremely grateful and could only see at all by kindling altogether he does himself injustice in his manner said cecilia that has become somewhat tempered mr austin assured her and he acknowledged what it had been with a smile that she reciprocated a rough man of rare quality civilizing under various influences and half ludicrous a little irritating wholly estimable has frequently won the benign approbation of the sex in addition this rough man over whom she smiled was one of the few that never worried her concerning her hand there was not a whisper of it in him he simply loved her father cecilia welcomed him to mount laurels with grateful gladness the colonel had hastened mr tuckhams visit in view of the expedition to rome and they discoursed of it at the luncheon table mr tuckham let fall that he had just seen beauchamp did he thank you for his inheritance colonel halkett inquired not he tuckham replied jovially cecilias eyes quick to flash were dropped the colonel said i suppose you told him nothing of what you had done for him and said tuckham oh no what anybody else would have done and proceeded to recount that he had called at dr shrapnels on the chance of an interview with his friend lydiard who used generally to be hanging about the cottage but now hes free his lunatic wife is dead and im happy to think i was mistaken as to miss denham men practising literature should marry women with money the poor girl changed colour when i informed her he had been released for upwards of three months the old radicals not the thing in health hes anxious about leaving her alone in the world he said so to me beauchamps for rigging out a yacht to give him a sail it seems that salt water did him some good last year theyre both of them rather the worse for a row at one of their meetings in the north in support of that public nuisance the democrat and atheist roughleigh the radical doctor lost a hat and beauchamp almost lost an eye he would have been a nelson of politics if he had been a monops with an excuse for not seeing its a trifle to them part of their education they call themselves students rome will be capital miss halkett youre an italian scholar and i beg to be accepted as a pupil i fear we have postponed the expedition too long said cecilia she could have sunk with languor too long cried colonel halkett mystified until too late i mean papa do you not think mr austin that a fortnight in rome is too short a time not if we make it a month my dear cecilia is not our salt air better for you the yacht shall be fitted out im a poor sailor besides a hasty excursion to italy brings ones anticipated regrets at the farewell too close to the pleasure of beholding it for the enjoyment of that luxury of delight which i associate with the name of italy why my dear child said her father you were all for going the other day i do not remember it said she one plans agreeable schemes at least we need not hurry from home so very soon after our return we have been travelling incessantly the cottage in wales is not home it is hardly fair to mount laurels to quit it without observing the changes of the season in our flowers and birds here and we have visitors coming of course papa i would not chain you to england if i am not well enough to accompany you i can go to louise for a few weeks was ever transparency so threadbare cecilia shrank from herself in contemplating it when she was alone and colonel halkett put the question to mr austin saying to him privately with no further reserve its that fellow beauchamp in the neighbourhood im not so blind hell be knocking at my door and i cant lock him out austin would you guess it was my girl speaking i never in my life had such an example of intoxication before me im perfectly miserable at the sight you know her she was the proudest girl living her ideas were orderly and sound she had a good intellect now she more than half defends hima naval officer good lordfor getting up in a public room to announce that hes a republican and writing heaps of mad letters to justify himself hes ruined in his profession hopeless he can never get a ship his careers cut short hes a rudderless boat a gentleman drifting to bedlam his uncle calls him i call his treatment of grancey lespel anything but gentlemanly this is the sort of fellow my girl worships what can i do i cant interdict the house to him it would only make matters worse thank god the fellow hangs fire somehow and doesnt come to me i expect it every day either in a letter or the man in person and i declare to heaven id rather be threading a khyber pass with my poor old friend who fell to a shot there she certainly has another voice mr austin assented gravely he did not look on beauchamp as the best of possible husbands for cecilia let her see that youre anxious austin said the colonel im her old opponent in this affair she loves me but shes accustomed to think me prejudiced you she wont you may have a good effect not by speaking no no no assault not a word and not a word against him lay the wind to catch a gossamer ive had my experience of blowing cold and trying to run her down hes at shrapnels hell be up here to day and i have an engagement in the town dont quit her side let her fancy you are interested in some discussionradicalism if you like mr austin readily undertook to mount guard over her while her father rode into bevisham on business the enemy appeared cecilia saw him and could not step to meet him for trouble of heart it was bliss to know that he lived and was near a transient coldness following the fit of ecstasy enabled her to swim through the terrible first minutes face to face with him he folded her round like a mist but it grew a problem to understand why mr austin should be perpetually at hand in the garden in the woods in the drawing room wheresoever she wakened up from one of her trances to see things as they were yet beauchamp with a daring and cunning at which her soul exulted and her feminine nature trembled as at the divinely terrible had managed to convey to her no less than if they had been alone together his parting words were i must have five minutes with your father to morrow how had she behaved what could be seymour austins idea of her she saw the blind thing that she was the senseless thing the shameless and vulture like in her scorn of herself she alighted on that disgraced cecilia and picked her to pieces hungrily it was clear beauchamp had meant nothing beyond friendly civility it was only her abject greediness pecking at crumbs no he loved her could a womans heart be mistaken she melted and wept thanking him she offered him her remnant of pride pitiful to behold and still she asked herself between whiles whether it could be true of an english lady of our day that she the fairest stature under sun was ever knowingly twisted to this convulsion she seemed to look forth from a barred window on flower and field and hill quietness existed as a vision was it impossible to embrace it how pass into it by surrendering herself to the flames like a soul unto death for why if they were overpowering attempt to resist them it flattered her to imagine that she had been resisting them in their present burning might ever since her lover stepped on the esperanzas deck at the mouth of otley river how foolish seeing that they are fatal a thrill of satisfaction swept her in reflecting that her ability to reason was thus active and she was instantly rewarded for surrendering pain fled to prove her reasoning good the flames devoured her gently they cared not to torture so long as they had her to themselves at night candle in hand on the corridor her father told her he had come across grancey lespel in bevisham and heard what he had not quite relished of the countess of romfrey the glittering of cecilias eyes frightened him taking her for the moment to know almost as much as he the colonel doubted the weight his communication would have on her he talked obscurely of a scandalous affair at lord romfreys house in town and beauchamp and that frenchwoman but said he mrs grancey will be here to morrow so will nevil papa said cecilia ah hes coming yes well the colonel puffed well i shall see him of course but i i can only say that if his oaths worth having i and i think you too my dear if you but its no use anticipating i shall stand out for your honour and happiness there your cheeks are flushed go and sleep some idle tale cecilia murmured to herself a dozen times undisturbed by the recurrence of it nevil was coming to speak to her father tomorrow adieu to doubt and division happy to morrow and dear mount laurels the primroses were still fair in the woods and soon the cowslips would come and the nightingale she lay lapt in images of everything innocently pleasing to nevil soon the esperanza would be spreading wings she revelled in a picture of the yacht on a tumbling mediterranean sea meditating on the two specks near the tillerwho were blissful human creatures blest by heaven and in themselveswith luxurious olympian benevolence for all that she awoke starting up in the first cold circle of twilight her heart in violent action she had dreamed that the vessel was wrecked i did not think myself so cowardly she said aloud pressing her side and then with the dream in her eyes she gasped it would be together strangely chilled she tried to recover some fallen load the birds of the dawn twittered chirped dived aslant her window fluttered back instead of a fallen load she fancied presently that it was an expectation she was desiring to realize but what what could be expected at that hour she quitted her bed and paced up and down the room beneath a gold starred ceiling her expectation she resolved to think was of a splendid day of the young spring at mount laurelsa day to praise to nevil she raised her window blind at a window letting in sweet air to gather indications of promising weather her lover stood on the grass plot among the flower beds below looking up as though it had been his expectation to see her which had drawn her to gaze out with an idea of some expectation of her own so visionary was his figure in the grey solitariness of the moveless morning that she stared at the apparition scarce putting faith in him as man until he kissed his hand to her and had softly called her name impulsively she waved a hand from her lips now there was no retreat for either of them she awoke to this conviction after a flight of blushes that burnt her thoughts to ashes as they sprang thoughts born blushing all of the crimson colour a rose garden succeeded and corresponding with their speed her feet paced the room both slender hands crossed at her throat under an uplifted chin and the curves of her dark eyelashes dropped as in a swoon he loves me the attestation of it had been visible no one but me was that so evident her father picked up silly stories of hima man who made enemies recklessly cecilia was petrified by a gentle tapping at her door her father called to her and she threw on her dressing gown and opened the door the colonel was in his riding suit i havent slept a wink and i find its the same with you he said paining her with his distressed kind eyes i ought not to have hinted anything last night without proofs austins as unhappy as i am at what my dear papa at what cried cecilia i ride over to steynham this morning and i shall bring you proofs my poor child proofs that foreign tangle of his you speak of nevil papa its a common scandal over london that frenchwoman was found at lord romfreys house lady romfrey cloaked it i believe the woman would swear blacks white to make nevil beauchamp appear an angel and hes a desperately cunning hand with women you doubt that she had shuddered slightly you wont doubt if i bring you proofs till i come back from steynham i ask you not to see him alone not to go out to him the colonel glanced at her windows cecilia submitted to the request out of breath consenting to feel like a tutored girl that she might conceal her guilty knowledge of what was to be seen through the windows now im off said he and kissed her if you would accept nevils word she murmured not where women are concerned he left her with this remark which found no jealous response in her heart yet ranged over certain dispersed inflammable grains like a match applied to damp powder again and again running in little leaps of harmless firm keeping her alive to its existence and surprising her that it should not have been extinguished beauchamp presented himself rather late in the afternoon when mr austin and blackburn tuckham were sipping tea in cecilias boudoir with that lady and a cousin of her sex by whom she was led to notice a faint discoloration over one of his eyes that was considering whence it came repulsive to compassion a blow at a radical meeting he spoke of dr shrapnel to tuckham and assuredly could not complain that the latter was unsympathetic in regard to the old mans health though when he said poor old man he fears he will die tuckham rejoined he had better make his peace he fears he will die because of his leaving miss denham unprotected said beauchamp well shes a good looking girl hell be able to leave her something and he might easily get her married i should think said tuckham hes not satisfied with handing her to any kind of man if the choice is to be among radicals and infidels i dont wonder he has come to one of the tests cecilia heard beauchamp speaking of a newspaper a great radical journal unmatched in sincerity superior in ability soon to be equal in power to the leader and exemplar of the lucre press would some day see the light youll want money for that said tuckham i know said beauchamp are you prepared to stand forty or fifty thousand a year it need not be half so much counting the libels i rate the outlay rather low yes lawyers judges and juries of tradesmen dealing justice to a radical print tuckham brushed his hand over his mouth and ahemed its to be a penny journal yes a penny id make it a farthing pay to have it read willingly tuckham did some mental arithmetic quaintly with rapidly blinking eyelids and open mouth you may count it at the cost of two paying mines he said firmly that is if its to be a consistently radical journal at law with everybody all round the year and by the time it has won a reputation it will be undermined by a radicaller radical journal thats how weve lowered the country to this level thats an inferno of circles down to the ultimate mire and what on earth are you contending for freedom of thought for one thing we have quite enough free thinking theres not enough if theres not perfect freedom dangerous quoth mr austin but its that danger which makes men sir and its fear of the danger that makes our modern englishman oh oh cried tuckham in the voice of a parliamentary opposition well you start your paper well assume it what class of men will you get to write i shall get good men for the hire you wont get the best men you may catch a clever youngster or two and an old rogue of talent you wont get men of weight theyre prejudiced i dare say the journals which are commercial speculations give us a guarantee that they mean to be respectable they must if they wouldnt collapse thats why the best men consent to write for them money will do it said beauchamp mr austin disagreed with that observation some patriotic spirit i may hope sir mr austin shook his head we put different constructions upon patriotism besidesfiddle nonsense exclaimed tuckham in the mildest interjections he could summon for a vent in society to his offended common sense the better your men the worse your mark youre not dealing with an intelligent people theres the old charge against the people but theyre not you can madden you cant elevate them by writing and writing defend us from the uneducated english the common english are doltish except in the north where you wont do much with them compare them with the yankees for shrewdness the spaniards for sobriety the french for ingenuity the germans for enlightenment the italians in the arts yes the russians for good humour and obediencewhere are they theyre only worth something when theyre led they fight well theres good stuff in them ive heard all that before returned beauchamp unruffled you dont know them i mean to educate them by giving them an interest in their country at present they have next to none our governing class is decidedly unintelligent in my opinion brutish for its indifferent my paper shall render your traders justice for what they do and justice for what they dont do my traders as you call them are the soundest foundation for a civilized state that the world has yet seen what is your paper to be called said cecilia the dawn beauchamp answered she blushed fiery red and turned the leaves of a portfolio of drawings the dawn ejaculated tuckham the grey eyed or the red extraordinary name for a paper upon my word a paper that doesnt devote half its columns to the vices of the richto money getting spending and bettingwill be an extraordinary paper i have it before me nowtwo doses of flattery to one of the whip no no you havent hit the disease we want union not division turn your mind to being a moralist instead of a politician the distinction shouldnt exist only it does mrs grancey lespels entrance diverted their dialogue from a theme wearisome to cecilia for beauchamp shone but darkly in it and mr austin did not join in it mrs grancey touched beauchamps fingers still political she said you have been seen about london with a french officer in uniform it was m le comte de croisnel a very old friend and comrade of mine beauchamp replied why do those frenchmen everlastingly wear their uniformstell me dont you think it detestable style he came over in a hurry now dont be huffed i know you for defending your friends captain beauchamp did he not come over with ladies with relatives yes relatives of course but when british officers travel with ladies relatives or other they prefer the simplicity of mufti and so do i as a question of taste i must say it was quite by misadventure that m de croisnel chanced to come in his uniform ah i know you for defending your friends captain beauchamp he was in too great a hurry to change his uniform before he started or en route so it happened mrs grancey let a lingering eye dwell maliciously on beauchamp who said to shift the burden of it the french are not so jealous of military uniforms as we are m de croisnel lost his portmanteau ah lost it then of course he is excuseable except to the naked eye dear me you have had a bruise on yours was monsieur votre ami in the italian campaign no poor fellow he was not he is not an imperialist he had to remain in garrison he wore a multitude of medals i have been told a cup of tea cecilia and how long did he stay in england with his relatives two days only two days a very short visit indeedsingularly short somebody informed me of their having been seen at romfrey castle which cannot have been true she turned her eyes from beauchamp silent to cecilias hand on the teapot half a cup she said mildly to spare the poor hand its betrayal of nervousness and relapsed from her air of mistress of the situation to chatter to mr austin beauchamp continued silent he took up a book and presently a pencil from his pocket then talked of the book to cecilias cousin and leaving a paper cutter between the leaves he looked at cecilia and laid the book down she proceeded to conduct mrs grancey lespel to her room i do admire captain beauchamps cleverness he is as good as a french romance mrs grancey exclaimed on the stairs he fibs charmingly i could not help drawing him out two days why my dear his french party were a fortnight in the country it was the marquise you knowthe old affair and one may say hes a constant man i have not heard captain beauchamps cleverness much praised said cecilia this is your room mrs grancey stay with me a moment it is the room i like are we to have him at dinner cecilia did not suppose that captain beauchamp would remain to dine feeling herself in the clutches of a gossip she would fain have gone i am just one bit glad of it though i cant dislike him personally said mrs grancey detaining her and beginning to whisper it was really too bad there was a french party at the end but there was only one at the commencement the brother was got over for a curtain before the husband arrived in pursuit they say the trick captain beauchamp played his cousin cecil to get him out of the house when he had made a discovery was monstrousfiendishly cunning however lady romfrey as that woman appears to be at last covered it all you know she has one of those passions for captain beauchamp which completely blind women to right and wrong he is her saint let him sin ever so the storys in everybodys mouth by the way palmet saw her he describes her pale as marble with dark long eyes the most innocent look in the world and a walk the absurd fellow says like a statue set gliding no doubt frenchwomen do walk well he says her eyes are terrible traitors i need not quote palmet the sort of eyes that would look fondly on a stone you know what her reputation is in france i have only indistinctly heard she has one in england by this time i can assure you she found her match in captain beauchamp for boldness where any other couple would have seen danger they saw safety and they contrived to accomplish it according to those horrid talebearers you have plenty of time to dress my dear i have an immense deal to talk about there are half a dozen scandals in london already and you ought to know them or you will be behind the tittle tattle when you go to town and i remember as a girl i knew nothing so excruciating as to hear blanks dashes initials and half words without the key nothing makes a girl look so silly and unpalatable naturally the reason why captain beauchamp is more talked about than the rest is the politics your grand reformer should be careful doubly heterodox will not do it makes him interesting to women if you like but he wont soon hear the last of it if he is for a public career grancey literally crowed at the story and the wonderful part of it is that captain beauchamp refused to be present at the earls first ceremonial dinner in honour of his countess now that we all think was particularly ungrateful now was it not if the countessif ingratitude had anything to do with it said cecilia she escaped to her room and dressed impatiently her boudoir was empty beauchamp had departed she recollected his look at her and turned over the leaves of the book he had been hastily scanning and had condescended to approve of on the two pages where the paper cutter was fixed she perceived small pencil dots under certain words read consecutively with a participle termination struck out to convey his meaning they formed the pathetically ungrammatical line hear none but accused false treble dots were under the word to morrow he had scored the margin of the sentences containing his dotted words as if in admiration of their peculiar wisdom she thought it piteous that he should be reduced to such means of communication the next instant cecilia was shrinking from the adept intriguerfrench taught in the course of the evening her cousin remarked captain beauchamp must see merit in things undiscoverable by my poor faculties i will show you a book he has marked did you see it i was curious to examine it interposed cecilia and i am as much at a loss as you to understand what could have attracted him one sentence about the sheikh in the stables where he accused the pretended physician yes what was there in that where is the book said mrs grancey not here i think cecilia glanced at the drawing room book table and then at mr austin the victim of an unhappy love in his youth and unhappy about her as her father had said seymour austin was not one to spread the contagion of intrigue she felt herself caught by it even melting to feel enamoured of herself in consequence though not loving beauchamp the more this newspaper if its not merely an airy project will be ruination said tuckham the fact is beauchamp has no bend in him he cant meet a man without trying a wrestle and as long as he keeps his stiffness he believes he has won ive heard an oculist say that the eye that doesnt blink ends in blindness and he who wont bend breaks its a pity for hes a fine fellow a radical daily journal of shrapnels colour to educate the people by giving them an interest in the country goodness what a delusion and what a waste of money hell not be able to carry it on a couple of years and there goes his eighty thousand cecilias heart beat fast she had no defined cause for its excitement colonel halkett returned to mount laurels close upon midnight very tired coughing and complaining of the bitter blowing east his guests shook hands with him and went to bed i think ill follow their example he said to cecilia after drinking a tumbler of mulled wine have you nothing to tell me dear papa said she caressing him timidly a confirmation of the whole story from lord romfrey in personthats all he says beauchamps mad i begin to believe it you must use your judgement i suppose i must not expect you to consider me you might open your heart to austin as to my consent knowing what i do you will have to tear it out of me heres a country perfectly contented and that fellow at work digging up grievances to persuade the people theyre oppressed by us why should i talk of it he cant do much harm unless he has moneymoney romfrey says he means to start a furious paper hell make a bonfire of himself i cant stand by and see you in it too i may die i may be spared the sight cecilia flung her arms round his neck oh papa i dont want to make him out worse than he is my dear i own to his gallantryin the french sense as well as the english it seems its natural that romfrey should excuse his wife shes another of the women who are crazy about nevil beauchamp she spoke to me of the pleasant visit of her french friends and would have enlarged on it but romfrey stopped her by the way he proposes captain baskelett for you and were to look for baskeletts coming here backed by his uncle theres no end to it there never will be till youre married and no peace for me i hope i shant find myself with a cold to morrow the colonel coughed and perhaps exaggerated the premonitory symptoms of a cold italy papa would do you good said cecilia it might said he if we go immediately papa to morrow early in the morning before there is a chance of any visitors coming to the house from bevisham from steynham i cannot endure a second persecution but you have a world of packing my dear an hour before breakfast will be sufficient for me in that case we might be off early as you say and have part of the easter week in rome mr austin wishes it greatly papa though he has not mentioned it austin my darling girl is not one of your impatient men who burst with everything they have in their heads or their hearts oh but i know him so well said cecilia conjuring up that innocent enthusiasm of hers for mr austin as an antidote to her sharp suffering the next minute she looked on her father as the key of an enigma concerning seymour austin whom she imagined possibly she had not hitherto known at all her curiosity to pierce it faded she and her maid were packing through the night at dawn she requested her maid to lift the window blind and give her an opinion of the weather grey miss the maid reported it signified to cecilia no one roaming outside the step she was taking was a desperate attempt at a cure and she commenced it though sorely wounded with pity for nevils disappointment and a singularly clear eyed perception of his aims and motivesi am rich and he wants riches he likes me and he reads my weaknessjealousy shook her by fits but she had no right to be jealous nor any right to reproach him her task was to climb back to those heavenly heights she sat on before he distracted her and drew her down beauchamp came to a vacated house that day chapter xlvi as it might have been foreseen it was in italy that cecilias maiden dreams of life had opened she hoped to recover them in italy and the calm security of a mind untainted italy was to be her reviving air while this idea of a specific for her malady endured travelling at speed to the ridges of the italian frontier across franceshe simply remembered nevil he was distant he had no place in the storied landscape among the images of art and the names of patient great men who bear as they bestow an atmosphere other than earths for those adoring them if at night in her sleep he was a memory that conducted her through scenes which were lightnings the cool swift morning of her flight released her france too her rivalthe land of france personified by her instinctively though she had no vivid imaginative gift did not wound her with a poisoned dartshe knew him first she was his first love the alps and the sense of having italy below them renewed cecilias lofty perching youth theni am in italy she sighed with rapture the wine of delight and oblivion was at her lips but thirst is not enjoyment and a satiated thirst that we insist on over satisfying to drown the recollection of past anguish is baneful to the soul in rome cecilias vision of her track to rome was of a run of fire over a heath she could scarcely feel common pleasure in rome it seemed burnt out flung back on herself she was condemned to undergo the bitter torment she had flown from jealous love and reproachful and a shame in it like nothing she had yet experienced previous pains were but summer lightnings passing shadows she could have believed in sorcery the man had eaten her heart a disposition to mocking humour foreign to her nature gave her the notion of being off her feet in the claws of a fabulous bird it served to veil her dulness an ultra english family in rome composed shocking to relate of a baronet banker and his wife two faint faced girls and a young gentleman of our country once perhaps a light limbed boy chose to be followed by their footman in the melancholy pomp of state livery wherever she encountered them cecilia talked nevil beauchamp even mr tuckham perceived it she was extremely uncharitable she extended her ungenerous criticism to the institution of the footman england and the english were lashed these people are caricatures tuckham said in apology for poor england burlesqued abroad you must not generalize on them footmen are footmen all the world over the cardinals have a fine set of footmen they are at home those english sow contempt of us all over europe we cannot but be despised one comes abroad foredoomed to share the sentiment this is your middle class what society can they move in that sanctions a vulgarity so perplexing they have the air of ornaments on a cottagers parlour mantelpiece tuckham laughed something of that he said evidently they seek distinction and they have it of that kind she continued it is not wonderful that we have so much satirical writing in england with such objects of satire it may be as little wonderful that the satire has no effect immense wealth and native obtuseness combine to disfigure us with this aspect of overripeness not to say monstrosity i fall in love with the poor and think they have a cause to be pleaded when i look at those people we scoff at the vanity of the french but it is a graceful vanity pardonable compared with ours ive read all that a hundred times quoth tuckham bluntly so have i i speak of it because i see it we scoff at the simplicity of the germans the germans live in simple fashion because theyre poor french vanitys pretty and amusing i dont know whether its deep in them for i doubt their depth but i know its in their joints the first spring of a frenchman comes of vanity that you cant say of the english peace to all but i abhor cosmopolitanism no man has a firm foothold who pretends to it none despises the english in reality dont be misled miss halkett were solid that is the main point the world feels our power and has confidence in our good faith i ask for no more with germans we are supercilious celts with frenchmen we are sneering teutonscan we be loved mr tuckham thats a quotation from my friend lydiard loved no nation ever was loved while it lived as lydiard says it may be a good beast or a bad but a beast it is a nations much too big for refined feelings and affections it must be powerful or out of the way or down it goes when a nations dead you may love it but i dont see the use of dying to be loved my aim for my country is to have the land respected for that purpose we must have power for power wealth for wealth industry for industry internal peace therefore no agitation no artificial divisions alls plain in history and fact so long as we do not obtrude sentimentalism nothing mixes well with that stuffexcept poetical ideas contrary to her anticipation cecilia was thrown more into companionship with mr tuckham than with mr austin and though it often vexed her she acknowledged that she derived a benefit from his robust antagonism of opinion and italy had grown tasteless to her she could hardly simulate sufficient curiosity to serve for a vacant echo to mr austins historic ardour pliny the younger might indeed be the model of a gentleman of old rome there might be a scholarly pleasure in calculating as mr austin did the length of time it took pliny to journey from the city to his paternal farm or villa overlooking the lake or villa overlooking the bay and some abstruse fun in the tender ridicule of his readings of his poems to friends for mr austin smiled effusively in alluding to the illustrious roman pleaders foible of verse but pliny bore no resemblance to that island barbarian nevil beauchamp she could not realize the friend of trajan orator lawyer student statesman benefactor of his kind and model of her own modern english gentleman though he was yes she would reply encouragingly to seymour austins fond brooding hum about his hero and yes conclusively like an incarnation of stupidity dealing in monosyllables she was unworthy of the society of a scholar nor could she kneel at the feet of her especial heroes dante raphael buonarotti she was unworthy of them she longed to be at mount laurels mr tuckhams conversation was the nearest approach to itas it were round by greenland but it was homeward she was really grieved to lose him business called him to england what business can it be papa she inquired and the colonel replied briefly ours mr austin now devoted much of his time to the instruction of her in the ancient life of the eternal city he had certain volumes of livy niebuhr and gibbon from which he read her extracts at night shunning the scepticism and the irony of the moderns so that there should be no jar on the awakening interest of his fair pupil and patient a gentle cross hauling ensued between them that they grew conscious of and laughed over during their peregrinations in and out of rome she pulled for the republic of the scipios his predilections were toward the rome of the wise and clement emperors to cecilias mind rome rocked at a period so closely neighbouring her decay to him with an imagination brooding on the fuller knowledge of it the city breathed securely the sky was clear jurisprudence rhetoric statesmanship then flourished supreme and men eminent for culture the finest flowers of our race he thought them and he thought their age the manhood of rome struck suddenly by a feminine subtle comparison that she could not have framed in speech cecilia bowed to his views of the happiness and elevation proper to the sway of a sagacious and magnanimous imperialism of the roman patternhe rejected the french she mused on dim old thoughts of the gracious dignity of a womans life under high governorship turbulent young men imperilled it at every step the trained the grave the partly grey were fitting lords and mates for women aspiring to moral beauty and distinction beside such they should be planted if they would climb her walks and conversations with seymour austin charmed her as the haze of a summer evening charms the sight upon the conclusion of her term of exile cecilia would gladly have remained in italy another month an appointment of her fathers with mr tuckham at mount laurels on a particular day she considered as of no consequence whatever and she said so in response to a meaningless nod but mr austin was obliged to return to work she set her face homeward with his immediately and he looked pleased he did not try to dissuade her from accompanying him by affecting to think it a sacrifice clearly he knew that to be near him was her greatest delight thus do we round the perilous headland called love by wooing a good man for his friendship and requiting him with faithful esteem for the grief of an ill fortuned passion of his youth cecilia would not suffer her fancy to go very far in pursuit of the secret of mr austins present feelings until she reached mount laurels she barely examined her own the sight of the house warned her instantly that she must have a defence and then in desperation but with perfect distinctness she entertained the hope of hearing him speak the protecting words which could not be broken through when wedded to her consent if mr austin had no intentions it was at least strange that he did not part from her in london he whose coming she dreaded had been made aware of the hour of her return as his card with the pencilled line will call on the th informed her the th was the morrow after breakfast on the morning of the th seymour austin looked her in the eyes longer than it is customary for ladies to have to submit to keen inspection will you come into the library he said she went with him into the library was it to speak of his anxiousness as to the state of her fathers health that he had led her there and that he held her hand he alarmed her and he pacified her alarm yet bade her reflect on the matter saying that her father like other fathers would be more at peace upon the establishment of his daughter mr austin remarked that the colonel was troubled does he wish for my pledge never to marry without his approval i will give it said cecilia he would like you to undertake to marry the man of his choice cecilias features hung on an expression equivalent toi could almost do that at the same time she felt it was not seymour austins manner of speaking he seemed to be praising an unknown personsome gentleman who was rough but of solid promise and singular strength of character the house bell rang believing that beauchamp had now come she showed a painful ridging of the brows and mr austin considerately mentioned the name of the person he had in his mind she readily agreed with him regarding mr tuckhams excellent qualitiesif that was indeed the name and she hastened to recollect how little she had forgotten mr tuckhams generosity to beauchamp and confessed to herself it might as well have been forgotten utterly for the thanks he had received while revolving these ideas she was listening to mr austin gradually she was beginning to understand that she was parting company with her original conjectures but going at so swift a pace in so supple and sure a grasp that like the speeding train slipped on new lines of rails by the pointsman her hurrying sensibility was not shocked or the shock was imperceptible when she heard him proposing mr tuckham to her for a husband by her fathers authority and with his own warm seconding he had not dropped her hand he was very eloquent a masterly advocate he pleaded her fathers cause it was not put to her as mr tuckhams her father had set his heart on this union he was awaiting her decision is it so urgent she asked it is urgent it saves him from an annoyance he requires a son in law whom he can confidently rely on to manage the estates which you are woman of the world enough to know should be in strong hands he gives you to a man of settled principles it is urgent because he may wish to be armed with your answer at any instant her father entered the library he embraced her and well he said i must think papa i must think she pressed her hand across her eyes disillusioned by seymour austin she was utterly defenceless before beauchamp and possibly beauchamp was in the house she fancied he was by the impatient brevity of her fathers voice seymour austin and colonel halkett left the room and blackburn tuckham walked in not the most entirely self possessed of suitors puffing softly under his breath and blinking eyes as rapidly as a skylark claps wings on the ascent half an hour later beauchamp appeared he asked to see the colonel delivered himself of his pretensions and wishes to the colonel and was referred to cecilia but colonel halkett declined to send for her beauchamp declined to postpone his proposal until the following day he went outside the house and walked up and down the grass plot cecilia came to him at last i hear nevil that you are waiting to speak to me ive been waiting some weeks shall i speak here yes here quickly before the house i have come to ask you for your hand mine i cannot step into the park with me i ask you to marry me it is too late chapter xlvii the refusal of him passing from one scene of excitement to another cecilia was perfectly steeled for her bitter task and having done that which separated her a spheres distance from beauchamp she was cold inaccessible to the face of him who had swayed her on flood and ebb so long incapable of tender pity even for herself all she could feel was a harsh joy to have struck off her tyrants fetters with a determination to cherish it passionately lest she should presently be hating herself for the shadow of such a possibility fell within the narrow circle of her strung sensations but for the moment her delusion reached to the idea that she had escaped from him into freedom when she said it is too late those words were the sum and voice of her long term of endurance she said them hurriedly almost in a whisper in the manner of one changeing a theme of conversation for subjects happier and livelier though none followed the silence bore back on her a suspicion of a faint reproachfulness in the words and perhaps they carried a poetical tone still more distasteful you have been listening to tales of me said beauchamp nevil we can always be friends the best of friends were you astonished at my asking you for your hand you said mine as if you wondered you have known my feelings for you can you deny that i have reckoned on yourstoo longbut not falsely no hear me out the truth is i cannot lose you and dont look so resolute overlook little wounds i was never indifferent to you how could i bewith eyes in my head the colonel is opposed to me of course he will learn to understand me better but you and i we cannot be mere friends its like daylight blotted outor the eyes gone blindtoo late can you repeat it i tried to warn you before you left england i should have written a letter to put you on your guard against my enemiesi find i have some but a letter is sure to stumble i should have been obliged to tell you that i do not stand on my defence and i thought i should see you the next day you went and not a word for me you gave me no chance if you have no confidence in me i must bear it i may say the story is false with your hand in mine i would swear it let it be forgotten said cecilia surprised and shaken to think that her situation required further explanations fascinated and unnerved by simply hearing him we are nowwe are walking away from the house do you object to a walk with me they had crossed the garden plot and were at the gate of the park leading to the western wood beauchamp swung the gate open he cast a look at the clouds coming up from the south west in folds of grey and silver like the day of our drive into bevishamwithout the storm behind he said and doated on her soft shut lips and the mild sun rays of her hair in sunless light there are flowers that grow only in certain valleys and your home is mount laurels whatever your fancy may be for italy you colour the whole region for me when you were absent you were here i called here six times and walked and talked with you cecilia set her face to the garden her heart had entered on a course of heavy thumping like a sapper in the mine pain was not unwelcome to her but this threatened weakness what plain words could she use if mr tuckham had been away from the house she would have found it easier to speak of her engagement she knew not why or if the imperative communication could have been delivered in italian or french she was as little able to say why it should have slipped from her tongue without a critic shudder to arrest it she was cold enough to revolve the words betrothed affianced plighted and reject them pretty words as they are between the vulgarity of romantic language and the baldness of commonplace it seemed to her that our english gives us no choice that we cannot be dignified in simplicity and for some reason feminine and remote she now detested her hand so much as to be unable to bring herself to the metonymic mention of it the ladys difficulty was peculiar to sweet natures that have no great warmth of passion it can only be indicated like others of the kind it is traceable to the most delicate of sentiments and to the flattestfor mr blackburns tuckhams figure was she thought of it with no personal objection not of the graceful order neither cavalierly nor kingly and imagining himself to say i am engaged and he suddenly appearing on the field cecilias whole mind was shocked in so marked a way did he contrast with beauchamp this was the effect of beauchamps latest words on her he had disarmed her anger we must have a walk to day he said commandingly but it had stolen into him that he and she were not walking on the same bank of the river though they were side by side a chill water ran between them as in other days there hung her hand but not to be taken incredible as it was the icy sense of his having lost her benumbed him her beautiful face and beautiful tall figure so familiar to him that they were like a possession protested in his favour while they snatched her from him all the distance of the words too late will you not give me one half hour i am engaged cecilia plunged and extricated herself i am engaged to walk with mr austin and papa beauchamp tossed his head something induced him to speak of mr tuckham the colonel has discovered his tory young man its an object as incomprehensible to me as a tory working man i suppose i must take it that they exist as for blackburn tuckham i have nothing against him hes an honourable fellow enough and would govern great britain as men of that rich middle class rule their wiveswith a strict regard for ostensible humanity and what the law allows them his manners have improved your cousin mary seems to like him it struck me when i saw them together cecilia one half hour you refuse me you have not heard me you will not say too late nevil i have said it finally i have no longer the right to conceive it unsaid so we speak its the language of indolence temper faint hearts too late has no meaning turn back with me to the park i offer you my whole heart i love you theres no woman living who could be to me the wife you would be im like your male nightingale that you told me of i must have my mate to sing tothat is work for and live for and she must not delay too long did i pardon me if you think i did you have known i love you i have been distracted by things that kept me from thinking of myself and my wishes and loves a selfish business while while one has work in hand its clear i cant do two things at a timemake love and carry on my taskwork i have been idle for weeks i believed you were mine and wanted no lovemaking theres no folly in that if you understand me at all as for vanity about women ive outlived it in comparison with you im poor i knowyou look distressed but one has to allude to iti admit that wealth would help me to see wealth supporting the cause of the people for once wouldbut you say too late well i dont renounce you till i see you giving your hand to a man whos not myself you have been offended groundlessly on my honour you are the woman of all women in the world to hold me fast in faith and pride in you its useless to look icy you feel what i say nevil i feel grief and beg you to cease i amit is too late has not a rag of meaning cecilia i love your name i love this too this is mine and no one can rob me of it he drew forth a golden locket and showed her a curl of her hair crimsoning she said instantly language of the kind i used is open to misconstruction i fear i have not even the right to listen to you i am you ask me for what i have it no longer in my power to give i am engaged the shot rang through him and partly stunned him but incredulity made a mocking effort to sustain him the greater wounds do not immediately convince us of our fate though we may be conscious that we have been hit engaged in earnest said he yes of your free will yes her father stepped out on the terrace from one of the open windows trailing a newspaper like a pocket handkerchief cecilia threaded the flower beds to meet him heres an accident to one of our ironclads he called to beauchamp lives lost sir no thank heaven but upon my word its a warning read the telegram its the hastings if these are our defences at a cost of half a million of money each of them the sooner we look to our land forces the better the shop will not be considered safe said beauchamp taking in the telegram at a glance peppels a first rate officer too she couldnt have had a better captain ship seriously damaged he handed back the paper to the colonel cecilia expected him to say that he had foreseen such an event he said nothing and with a singular contraction of the heart she recollected how he had denounced our system of preparing mainly for the defensive in war on a day when they stood together in the park watching the slow passage of that very ship the hastings along the broad water distant below them the swarms of swift vessels of attack she recollected particularly and small wasps and rams under mighty steam power that he used to harp on when declaring that england must be known for the assailant in war she was to ray out her worrying fleets the defensive is perilous policy in war he had said it she recollected also her childish ridicule of his excess of emphasis he certainly had foresight mr austin and mr tuckham came strolling in conversation round the house to the terrace beauchamp bowed to the former nodded to the latter scrutinizing him after he had done so as if the flash of a thought were in his mind tuckhams radiant aspect possibly excited it congratulate me was the honest outcry of his face and frame he was as over flowingly rosy as a victorious candidate at the hustings commencing a speech cecilia laid her hand on an urn in dread of the next words from either of the persons present her father put an arm in hers and leaned on her she gazed at her chamber window above wishing to be wafted thither to her seclusion within the trembling limbs of physical irresoluteness was a new experience to her anything else in the paper colonel ive not seen it to day said beauchamp for the sake of speaking no i dont think theres anything colonel halkett replied our diplomatists havent been shining much thats not our forte no its our field for younger sons is it ah theres an expedition against the hilltribes in india and were such a peaceful nation eh we look as if we were in for a complication with china well sir we must sell our opium of course we must theres a man writing about surrendering gibraltar im afraid we cant do that but where do you draw the line quoth tuckham very susceptible to a sneer at the colonel and entirely ignorant of the circumstances attending beauchamps position before him you defend the chinaman and its questionable if his case is as good as the spaniards the chinaman has a case against our traders gibraltar concerns our imperial policy as to the case against the english merchants the chinaman is for shutting up his millions of acres of productive land and the action of commerce is merely a declaration of a universal public right to which all states must submit immorality brings its punishment be sure of that some day we shall have enough of china as to the rock i know the argument i may be wrong ive had the habit of regarding it as necessary to our naval supremacy come there we agree im not so certain the counter argument i call treason well said beauchamp theres a broad policy and a narrow theres the spanish view of the matterif you are for peace and harmony and disarmament im not then strengthen your forces not a bit of it then bully the feeble and truckle to the strong consent to be hated till you have to stand your ground talk it seems to me logical thats the french notioncest lodgique tuckhams pronunciation caused cecilia to level her eyes at him passingly by the way said colonel halkett there are lots of horrors in the paper to day wife kickings and starvationsoh dear me and the murder of a woman two columns to that that the tory reaction is responsible for said tuckham rather by way of a joke than a challenge beauchamp accepted it as a challenge much to the benevolent amusement of mr austin and colonel halkett he charged the responsibility of every crime committed in the country and every condition of misery upon the party which declined to move in advance and which therefore apologized for the perpetuation of knavery villany brutality injustice and foul dealing stick to your laws and systems and institutions and so long as you wont stir to amend them i hold you accountable for that long newspaper list daily he said this with a visible fire of conviction tuckham stood bursting at the monstrousness of such a statement he condensed his indignant rejoinder to madness cant go farther theres an idea in it said mr austin its an idea foaming at the mouth then perhaps it has no worse fault than that of not marching parallel with the truth said mr austin smiling the party accusing in those terms what do you say captain beauchampsupposing us to be pleading before a tribunal beauchamp admitted as much as that he had made the case gigantic though he stuck to his charge against the tory party and moreover the toriesand the old whigs now liberals ranked under the heading of toriesthose tories possessing and representing the wealth of the country yet had not started one respectable journal that a lady could read through without offence to her or a gentleman without disgust if there was not one english newspaper in existence independent of circulation and advertisements and of the tricks to win them the tories were answerable for the vacancy they being the rich who if they chose could set an example to our press by subscribing to maintain a journal superior to the flattering of vile appetitesall that nauseous matter beauchamp stretched his fingers at the sheets colonel halkett was holding and which he had not readthose tories he bowed to the colonel im afraid i must say you sir are answerable for it i am very well satisfied with my paper said the colonel beauchamp sighed to himself we choose to be satisfied he said his pure and mighty dawn was in his thoughts the unborn light of a day denied to earth one of the doctors of bevisham visiting a sick maid of the house trotted up the terrace to make his report to her master of the state of her health he hoped to pull her through with the aid of high feeding he alluded cursorily to a young girl living on the outskirts of the town whom he had been called in to see at the eleventh hour and had lost owing to the lowering of his patient from a prescription of a vegetable diet by a certain dr shrapnel that ever explosive name precipitated beauchamp to the front rank of the defence i happen to be staying with dr shrapnel he observed i dont eat meat there because he doesnt and i am certain i take no harm by avoiding it i think vegetarianism a humaner system and hope it may be wise i should like to set the poor practising it for their own sakes and i have half an opinion that it would be good for the richif we are to condemn gluttony ah captain beauchamp the doctor bowed to him but my case was one of poor blood requiring to be strengthened the girl was allowed to sink so low that stimulants were ineffective when i stepped in theres the point its all very well while you are in health you may do without meat till your system demands the stimulant or elseas with this poor girl and indeed captain beauchamp if i may venture the remarki had the pleasure of seeing you during the last election in our townand if i may be so bold i should venture to hint that the avoidance of animal foodto judge by appearanceshas not been quite wholesome for you eyes were turned on beauchamp chapter xlviii of the trial awaiting the earl of romfrey cecilia softly dropped her fathers arm and went into the house the exceeding pallor of beauchamps face haunted her in her room she heard the controversy proceeding below and an exclamation of blackburn tuckhams immorality of meat eating what nonsense are they up to now beauchamp was inaudible save in a word or two as usual he was the solitary minority but how mournfully changed he was she had not noticed it agitated by her own emotions as she had been and at one time three parts frozen he was the ghost of the nevil beauchamp who had sprung on the deck of the esperanza out of lieutenant wilmores boat that sunny breezy day which was the bright first chapter of her new lifeof her late life as it seemed to her now for she was dead to it and another creature the coldest of the women of earth she felt sensibly cold coveted warmth flung a shawl on her shoulders and sat in a corner of her room hidden and shivering beside the open window till long after the gentlemen had ceased to speak how much he must have suffered of late the room she had looked to as a refuge from nevil was now her stronghold against the man whom she had incredibly accepted she remained there the victim of a heart malady under the term of headache feeling entrapped she considered that she must have been encircled and betrayed she looked back on herself as a giddy figure falling into a pit and in the pit she lay and how vile to have suspected of unfaithfulness and sordidness the generous and stedfast man of earth he never abandoned a common friendship his love of his country was love still whatever the form it had taken his childlike reliance on effort and outspeaking for which men laughed at him was beautiful where am i she cried amid her melting images of him all dominated by his wan features she was bound fast imprisoned and a slave even mr austin had conspired against him for only she read nevil justly his defence of dr shrapnel filled her with an envy that no longer maligned the object of it but was humble and like the desire of the sick to creep into sunshine the only worthy thing she could think of doing was it must be mentioned for a revelation of her fallen state and moreover she was not lusty of health at the moment to abjure meat the body loathed it and consequently the mind of the invalided lady shrank away in horror of the bleeding joints and the increasingly fierce scramble of christian souls for the dismembered animals she saw the innocent pasturing beasts she saw the act of slaughter she had actually sweeping before her sight a spectacle of the ludicrous terrific in the shape of an entire community pursuing countless herds of poor scampering animal life for blood she meanwhile with nevil and dr shrapnel stood apart contemning for whoso would not partake of flesh in this kingdom of roast beef must be of the sparse number of nevils execrated minority in politics the example will show that she touched the borders of delirium physically the doctor pronounces her bilious she was in earnest so far as to send down to the library for medical books and books upon diet these however did not plead for the beasts they treated the subject without question of mans taking that which he has conquered poets and philosophers did the same again she beheld nevil beauchamp solitary in the adverse rank to the worldto his countrymen especially but that it was no material cause which had wasted his cheeks and lined his forehead she was sure and to starve with him to embark with him in his little boat on the seas he whipped to frenzy would have been a dream of bliss had she dared to contemplate herself in a dream as his companion it was not to be thought of no but this was and to be thought of seriously cecilia had said to herself for consolation that beauchamp was no spiritual guide he had her heart within her to plead for him and the reflection came to her like a bubble up from the heart that most of our spiritual guides neglect the root to trim the flower and thence turning sharply on herself she obtained a sudden view of her allurement and her sin in worshipping herself and recognized that the aim at an ideal life closely approaches or easily inclines to self worship to which the lady was woman and artist enough to have had no objection but that therein visibly she discerned the retributive vain longings in the guise of high individual superiority and distinction that had thwarted her with nevil beauchamp never permitting her to love single mindedly or whole heartedly but always in reclaiming her rights and sighing for the loss of her ideal adoring her own image in fact when she pretended to cherish and regret that she could not sufficiently cherish the finer elements of nature what was this ideal she had complained of losing it was a broken mirror she could think of it in no other form dr shrapnels ego ego yelped and gave chase to her through the pure beatitudes of her earlier days down to her present regrets it hunted all the saints in the calendar till their haloes top sided on their headsher favourite st francis of assisi excepted the doctor was called up from bevisham next day and pronounced her bilious he was humorous over captain beauchamp who had gone to the parents of the dead girl and gathered the information that they were a consumptive family to vindicate dr shrapnel the very family to require strong nourishment said the doctor cecilia did not rest in her sick room before hunting through one book and another she had found arguments on the contrary side a waste of labour that heaped oppression on her chest as with the worlds weight apparently one had only to be in beauchamps track to experience that she horrified her father by asking questions about consumption homoeopathy hydropathythe revolutionaries of medicine attracted her blackburn tuckham a model for an elected lover who is not beloved promised to procure all sorts of treatises for her no man could have been so deferential to a diseased mind beyond calling her by her christian name he did nothing to distress her with the broad aspect of their new relations together he and mr austin departed from mount laurels leaving her to sink into an agreeable stupor like one deposited on a mudbank after buffeting the waves she learnt that her father had seen captain baskelett and remembered marvelling how her personal dread of an interview that threatened to compromise her ideal of her feminine and peculiar dignity had assisted to precipitate her where she now lay helpless almost inanimate she was unaware of the passage of time save when her father spoke of a marriage day it told her that she lived and was moving the fear of death is not stronger in us nor the desire to put it off than cecilias shunning of such a day the naming of it numbed her blood like a snakebite yet she openly acknowledged her engagement and happily for tuckham his visits both in london and at mount laurels were few and short and he inflicted no foretaste of her coming subjection to him to alarm her under her air of calm abstraction she watched him rigorously for some sign of his ownership that should tempt her to revolt from her pledge or at least dream of breaking loose the dream would have sufficed he was never intrusive never pressing he did not vex because he absolutely trusted to the noble loyalty which made her admit to herself that she belonged irrevocably to him while her thoughts were upon beauchamp with a respectful gravity he submitted to her perusal a collection of treatises on diet classed pro and con and paged and pencil marked to simplify her study of the question they sketched in company she played music to him he read poetry to her and read it well he seemed to feel the beauty of it sensitively as she did critically in other days the positions had been reversed he invariably talked of beauchamp with kindness deploring only that he should be squandering his money on workmens halls and other hazy projects down in bevisham lydiard tells me he has a very sound idea of the value of money and has actually made money by cattle breeding but he has flung ten thousand pounds on a single building outside the town and hell have to endow it to support ita club to educate radicals the fact is he wants to jam the business of two or three centuries into a life time these men of their so called progress are like the majority of religious minds they cant believe without seeing and touching that is to say they dont believe in the abstract at all but they go to work blindly by agitating and proselytizing and persecuting to get together a mass they can believe in you see it in their way of arguing its half done with the fist lydiard tells me he left him last in a horrible despondency about progress ha ha beauchamps no radical he hasnt forgiven the countess of romfrey for marrying above her rank he may be a bit of a republican but really in this country republicans are fighting with the shadow of an old hat and a cockhorse i beg to state that i have a reverence for constituted authority i speak of what those fellows are contending with right said colonel halkett but the shadow of an old hat and a cockhorse what does that mean thats what our republicans are hitting at sir ah so yes quoth the colonel and i say this to nevil beauchamp that what weve grown up well with powerfully with its base ingratitude and dangerous folly to throw over he blamed beauchamp for ingratitude to the countess who had he affirmed of his own knowledge married lord romfrey to protect beauchamps interests a curious comment on this allegation was furnished by the announcement of the earls expectations of a son and heir the earl wrote to colonel halkett from romfrey castle inviting him to come and spend some time there now thats brave news the colonel exclaimed he proposed a cruise round by the cornish coast to the severn and so to romfrey castle to squeeze the old lords hand and congratulate him with all his heart cecilia was glad to acquiesce for an expedition of any description was a lull in the storm that hummed about her ears in the peace of home where her father would perpetually speak of the day to be fixed sailing the sea on a cruise was like the gazing at wonderful colours of a western sky an oblivion of earthly dates and obligations what mattered it that there were gales in august she loved the sea and the stinging salt spray and circling gull and plunging gannet the sun on the waves and the torn cloud the revelling libertine open sea wedded her to beauchamp in that veiled cold spiritual manner she could muse on as a circumstance out of her life fair companies of racing yachts were left behind the gales of august mattered frightfully to poor blackburn tuckham who was to be dropped at a town in south wales and descended greenish to his cabin as soon as they had crashed on the first wall waves of the chalk race a throw beyond the peaked cliffs edged with cormorants and were really tasting sea cecilia reclined on deck wrapped in shawl and waterproof as the alpine climber claims the upper air she had the wild sea to herself through her love of it quite to herself it was delicious to look round and ahead and the perturbation was just enough to preserve her from thoughts too deep inward in a scene where the ghost of nevil was abroad the hard dry gale increased her father stretched beside her drew her attention to a small cutter under double reefed main sail and small jib on the esperanzas weather bowa gallant boat carefully handled she watched it with some anxiety but the esperanza was bound for a devon bay and bore away from the black dorsetshire headland leaving the little cutter to run into haven if she pleased the passing her was no eventin a representation of the common events befalling us in these times upon an appreciation of which this history depends one turns at whiles a languishing glance toward the vast potential mood pluperfect tense for nevil beauchamp was on board the cutter steering her with dr shrapnel and lydiard in the well and if an accident had happened to cutter or schooner what else might not have happened cecilia gathered it from mrs wardour devereux whom to her surprise and pleasure she found at romfrey castle her friend louise received a letter from mr lydiard containing a literary amateur seamans log of a cruise of a fifteen ton cutter in a gale and a pure literary sketch of beauchamp standing drenched at the helm from five in the morning up to nine at night munching a biscuit for nourishment the beautiful widow prepared the way for what was very soon to be publicly known concerning herself by reading out this passage of her correspondents letter in the breakfast room yes the fellows a sailor said lord romfrey the countess rose from her chair and walked out now was that abuse of the fellow the old lord asked colonel halkett i said he was a sailor i said nothing else he is a sailor and hes fit for nothing else and no ship will he get unless he bends his neck never s nearer it he hesitated a moment and went after his wife cecilia sat with the countess in the afternoon at a window overlooking the swelling woods of romfrey she praised the loveliness of the view it is fire to me said rosamund cecilia looked at her startled rosamund said no more she was an excellent hostess nevertheless unpretending and simple in company and only when it chanced that beauchamps name was mentioned did she cast that quick supplicating nervous glance at the earl with a shadow of an elevation of her shoulders as if in apprehension of mordant pain we will make no mystery about it i would i could those happy tales of mystery are as much my envy as the popular narratives of the deeds of bread and cheese people for they both create a tide way in the attentive mind the mysterious pricking our credulous flesh to creep the familiar urging our obese imagination to constitutional exercise and oh the refreshment there is in dealing with characters either contemptibly beneath us or supernaturally above my way is like a rhone island in the summer drought stony unattractive and difficult between the two forceful streams of the unreal and the over real which delight mankindhonour to the conjurors my people conquer nothing win none they are actual yet uncommon it is the clock work of the brain that they are directed to set in motion andpoor troop of actors to vacant benchesthe conscience residing in thoughtfulness which they would appeal to and if you are there impervious to them we are lost back i go to my wilderness where as you perceive i have contracted the habit of listening to my own voice more than is good the burden of a child in her bosom had come upon rosamund with the visage of the angel of death fronting her in her path she believed that she would die but like much that we call belief there was a kernel of doubt in it which was lively when her frame was enlivened and she then thought of the giving birth to this unloved child which was to disinherit the man she loved in whose interest solely so she could presume to think because it had been her motive reason she had married the earl she had no wish to be a mother but that prospect and the dread attaching to it at her time of life she could have submitted to for lord romfreys sake it struck her like a scoffers blow that she the one woman on earth loving nevil should have become the instrument for dispossessing him the revulsion of her feelings enlightened her so far as to suggest without enabling her to fathom him that instead of having cleverly swayed lord romfrey she had been his dupe or a blind accomplice and though she was too humane a woman to think of punishing him she had so much to forgive that the trifles daily and at any instant added to the load flushed her resentment like fresh lights showing new features and gigantic outlines nevils loss of cecilia she had anticipated she had heard of it when she was lying in physical and mental apathy at steynham lord romfrey had repeated to her the nature of his replies to the searching parental questions of colonel halkett and having foreseen it all and what was more foretold it she was not aroused from her torpor latterly with the return of her natural strength she had shown herself incapable of hearing her husband speak of nevil nor was the earl tardy in taking the hint to spare the mother of his child allusions that vexed her now and then they occurred perforce the presence of cecilia exasperated rosamunds peculiar sensitiveness it required louise wardour devereuxs apologies and interpretations to account for what appeared to cecilia strangely ill conditioned if not insane in lady romfreys behaviour the most astonishing thing to hear was that lady romfrey had paid mrs devereux a visit at her surrey house unexpectedly one sunday in the london season for the purpose as it became evident of meeting mr blackburn tuckham and how she could have known that mr tuckham would be there mrs devereux could not tell for it was louise assured cecilia purely by chance that he and mr lydiard were present but the countess obtained an interview with him alone and mr tuckham came from it declaring it to have been more terrible than any he had ever been called upon to endure the object of the countess was to persuade him to renounce his bride louise replied to the natural inquiryupon what plea with a significant evasiveness she put her arms round cecilias neck i trust you are not unhappy you will get no release from him i am not unhappy said cecilia musically clear to convince her friend she was indeed glad to feel the stout chains of her anchor restraining her when lady romfrey talked of nevil they were like the safety of marriage without the dreaded ceremony and with solitude to let her weep bound thus to a weaker man than blackburn tuckham though he had been more warmly esteemed her fancy would have drifted away over the deeps perhaps her cherished loyalty would have drowned in her tearsfor lady romfrey tasked it very severely but he from whom she could hope for no release gave her some of the firmness which her nature craved in this trial from saying quietly to her i thought once you loved him when alluding to nevil lady romfrey passed to mournful exclamations and by degrees on to direct entreaties she related the whole story of rene in england and appeared distressed with a desperate wonderment at cecilias mildness after hearing it her hearer would have imagined that she had no moral sense if it had not been so perceptible that the poor ladys mind was distempered on the one subject of nevil beauchamp cecilias high conception of duty wherein she was a peerless flower of our english civilization was incommunicable she could practise not explain it she bowed to lady romfreys praises of nevil suffered her hands to be wrung her heart to be touched all but an avowal of her love of him to be wrested from her and not the less did she retain her cold resolution to marry to please her father and fulfil her pledge in truth it was too late to speak of rene to her now it did not beseem cecilia to remember that she had ever been a victim of jealousy and while confessing to many errors because she felt them and gained a necessary strength from themin the comfort of the consciousness of pain for example which she sorely needed that the pain in her own breast might deaden her to nevils jealousy the meanest of the errors of a lofty soul yielded no extract beyond the bare humiliation proper to an acknowledgement that it had existed so she discarded the recollection of the passion which had wrought the mischief since we cannot have a peerless flower of civilization without artificial aid it may be understood how it was that cecilia could extinguish some lights in her mind and kindle others and wherefore what it was not natural for her to do she did she had briefly a certain control of herself our common readings in the fictitious romances which mark out a plot and measure their characters to fit into it had made rosamund hopeful of the effect of that story of rene a wooden young woman or a galvanized sweet to the writer either of them as to the readerso moveable they are would have seen her business at this point and have glided melting to reconciliation and the chamber where romantic fiction ends joyously rosamund had counted on it she looked intently at cecilia he is ruined wasted ill unloved he has lost youi am the cause she cried in a convulsion of grief dear lady romfrey cecilia would have consoled her there is nothing to lead us to suppose that nevil is unwell and you are not to blame for anything how can you be i spoke falsely of dr shrapnel i am the cause it lies on me it pursues me let me give to the poor as i may and feel for the poor as i do to get nearer to nevili cannot have peace his heart has turned from me he despises me if i had spoken to lord romfrey at steynham as he commanded me you and heoh cowardice he is right cowardice is the chief evil in the world he is ill he is desperately ill he will die have you heard he is very ill lady romfrey no no rosamund exclaimed it is by not hearing that i know it with the assistance of louise devereux cecilia gradually awakened to what was going on in the house there had been a correspondence between miss denham and the countess letters from bevisham had suddenly ceased presumably the earl had stopped them and if so it must have been for a tragic reason cecilia hinted some blame of lord romfrey to her father he pressed her hand and said you dont know what that man suffers romfrey is fond of nevil too but he must guard his wife and the fact is nevil is down with fever its in the papers now he may be able to conceal it and i hope he will therell be a crisis and then he can tell her good newsa little illness and all right now of course the colonel continued buoyantly nevil will recover hes a tough wiry young fellow but poor romfreys fears are natural enough about the countess her mind seems to be haunted by the doctor thereshrapnel i mean and shes exciteable to a degree that threatens the worstin case of any accident in bevisham is it not a kind of cowardice to conceal it cecilia suggested it saves her from fretting said the colonel but she is fretting if lord romfrey would confide in her and trust to her courage papa it would be best colonel halkett thought that lord romfrey was the judge cecilia wished to leave a place where this visible torture of a human soul was proceeding and to no purpose she pointed out to her father by a variety of signs that lady romfrey either knew or suspected the state of affairs in bevisham and repeated her remarks upon nevils illness but colonel halkett was restrained from departing by the earls constant request to him to stay old friendship demanded it of him he began to share his daughters feelings at the sight of lady romfrey she was outwardly patient and submissive by nature she was a strong healthy woman and she attended to all her husbands prescriptions for the regulating of her habits walked with him lay down for the afternoons rest appeared amused when he laboured to that effect and did her utmost to subdue the worm devouring her heart but the hours of the delivery of the letter post were fatal to her her woeful no letter for me was piteous when that was heard no longer her silence and famished gaze chilled cecilia at night rosamund eyed her husband expressionlessly with her head leaning back in her chair to the sorrow of the ladies beholding her ultimately the contagion of her settled misery took hold of cecilia colonel halkett was induced by his daughter and mrs devereux to endeavour to combat a system that threatened consequences worse than those it was planned to avert he by this time was aware of the serious character of the malady which had prostrated nevil lord romfrey had directed his own medical man to go down to bevisham and dr gannets report of nevil was grave the colonel made light of it to his daughter after the fashion he condemned in lord romfrey to whom however he spoke earnestly of the necessity for partially taking his wife into his confidence to the extent of letting her know that a slight fever was running its course with nevil there will be no slight fever in my wifes blood said the earl i stand to weather the cape or run to wreck and it wont do to be taking in reefs on a lee shore you dont see what frets her colonel for years she has been bent on nevils marriage its off but if you catch cecilia by the hand and bring her to usi swear she loves the fellowthats the medicine for my wife say will you do it tell lady romfrey it shall be done we shall stand upright again im afraid thats impossible romfrey said the colonel play at it then let her think it youre helping me treat an invalid colonel my old friend you save my house and name if you do that its a hand round a candle in a burst of wind theres nevil dragged by a woman into one of their reeking hovelsso that miss denham at shrapnels writes to lady romfreybecause the womans drunken husband voted for him at the election and was kicked out of employment and fell upon the gin bottle and the brats of the den died starving and the man sickened of a fever and nevil goes in and sits with him out of that tangle of folly is my house to be struck down it looks as if the fellow with his infernal humanity were the bad genius of an old nurses tale hes a good fellow colonel he means well this fever will cure him they say it sobers like bloodletting hes a gallant fellow you know that he fought to the skeleton in our last big war on my soul i believe hes good for a husband frenchwoman or not that affairs over he shall have steynham and holdesbury can i say more now colonel you go in to the countess grasp my hand give me that help and god bless you you light up my old days shes a noble woman i would not change her against the best in the land she has this craze about nevil i suppose shell never get over it but there it is and we must feed her with the spoon colonel halkett argued stutteringly with the powerful man its the truth she ought to hear romfrey indeed it is if youll believe me its his life she is fearing for she knows half she knows positively nothing colonel miss denhams first letter spoke of the fellows having headaches and staggering he was out on a cruise and saw your schooner pass and put into some port and began falling right and left and they got him back to shrapnels and here it isthat if you go to him youll save him and if you go to my wife youll save her and there you have it and i ask my old friend i beg him to go to them both but you cant surely expect me to force my daughters inclinations my dear romfrey cecilia loves the fellow she is engaged to mr tuckham ill see the man tuckham really my dear lord play at it halkett play at it tide us over this talk to her hint it and nod it we have to round november i could strangle the world till that months past youll own he added mildly after his thunder im not much of the despot nevil calls me she has not a wish i dont supply im at her beck and everything thats mine shes a brave good woman i dont complain i run my chance but if we lose the childgood night boy or girlboy lord romfrey flung an arm up the child of his old age lived for him already he gave it all the life he had this miracle this young son springing up on an earth decaying and dark absorbed him this reviver of his ancient line must not be lost perish every consideration to avert it he was ready to fear love or hate terribly according to the prospects of his child colonel halkett was obliged to enter into a consultation of a shadowy sort with his daughter whose only advice was that they should leave the castle the penetrable gloom there and the growing apprehension concerning the countess and nevil tore her to pieces even if she could have conspired with the earl to hoodwink his wife her strong sense told her it would be fruitless besides base father and daughter had to make the stand against lord romfrey he saw their departure from the castle gates and kissed his hand to cecilia courteously without a smile he may well praise the countess papa said cecilia while they were looking back at the castle and the moveless flag that hung in folds by the mast above it she has given me her promise to avoid questioning him and to accept his view of her duty she said to me that if nevil should die she cecilia herself broke down and gave way to sobs in her fathers arms chapter xlix a fabric of baronial despotism crumbles the earls precautions did duty night and day in all the avenues leading to the castle and his wifes apartments and he could believe that he had undertaken as good a defence as the mountain guarding the fertile vale from storms but him the elements pelted heavily letters from acquaintances of nevil from old shipmates and from queer political admirers and opponents hailed on him things not to be frigidly read were related of the fellow lord romfreys faith in the power of constitution to beat disease battled sturdily with the daily reports of his physician and friends whom he had directed to visit the cottage on the common outside bevisham and with miss denhams intercepted letters to the countess still he had to calculate on the various injuries nevil had done to his constitution which had made of him another sort of man for a struggle of life and death than when he stood like a riddled flag through the war that latest freak of the fellows the abandonment of our natural and wholesome sustenance in animal food was to be taken in the reckoning dr gannet did not allude to it the bevisham doctor did and the earl meditated with a fury of wrath on the dismal chance that such a folly as this of one old vegetable idiot influencing a younger noodle might strike his house to the dust his watch over his wife had grown mechanical he failed to observe that her voice was missing she rarely spoke he lost the art of observing himself the wrinkling up and dropping of his brows became his habitual language so long as he had not to meet inquiries or face tears he enjoyed the sense of security he never quitted his wife save to walk to the southern park lodge where letters and telegrams were piled awaiting him and she was forbidden to take the air on the castle terrace without his being beside her lest a whisper some accident of the kind that donkeys who nod over their drowsy nose length ahead precautions call fatality should rouse her to suspect and in a turn of the hand undo his labour for the race was getting terrible death had not yet stepped out of that evil chamber in dr shrapnels cottage to aim his javelin at the bosom containing the prized young life to come but like the smoke of waxing fire he shadowed forth his presence in wreaths blacker and thicker day by day and everard romfrey knew that the hideous beast of darkness had only to spring up and pass his guard to deal a blow to his house the direr from all he supposed himself to have gained by masking it hitherto the young life he looked to for renewal swallowed him he partly lost human feeling for his wife in the tremendous watch and strain to hurry her as a vessel round the dangerous headland he was oblivious that his eyebrows talked that his head was bent low that his mouth was shut and that where a doubt had been sown silence and such signs are like revelations in black night to the spirit of a woman who loves one morning after breakfast rosamund hung on his arm eyeing him neither questioningly nor invitingly but long he kissed her forehead she clung to him and closed her eyes showing him a face of slumber like a mask of the dead mrs devereux was present cecilia had entreated her to stay with lady romfrey she stole away for the time had come which any close observer of the countess must have expected the earl lifted his wife and carried her to her sitting room a sunless weltering september day whipped the window panes and brought the roar of the beaten woods to her ears he was booted and gaitered for his customary walk to the park lodge and as he bent a knee beside her she murmured dont wait return soon he placed a cord attached to the bellrope within her reach this utter love of nevil beauchamp was beyond his comprehension but there it was and he had to submit to it and manuvre his letters and telegrams told the daily tale hes better said the earl preparing himself to answer what his wifes look had warned him would come she was an image of peace in the same posture on the couch where he had left her when he returned she did not open her eyes but felt about for his hand and touching it she seemed to weigh the fingers at last she said the fever should be at its height why my dear brave girl what ails you said he ignorance she raised her eyelids his head was bent down over her like a ravens watching a picture of gravest vigilance her bosom rose and sank what has miss denham written to day to day he asked her gently i shall bear it she answered you were my master before you were my husband i bear anything you think is good for my government only my ignorance is fever i share nevils have you been to my desk at all no i read your eyes and your hands i have been living on them to day i find that i have not gained by it as i hoped i should ignorance kills me i really have courage to bear to hearjust at this moment i have theres no bad news my love said the earl high fever is it the usual fever gannets with him i sent for gannet to go there to satisfy you nevil is not dead lord maam my dear soul he is alive quite certainly alive as much alive as i am only going a little faster as fellows do in the jumps of a fever the best doctor in england is by his bed hes doing fairly you should have let me know you were fretting my rosamund i did not wish to tempt you to lie my dear lord well there are times when a woman as you are but youre a brave woman a strong heart and my wife you want some one to sit with you dont you louise devereux is a pleasant person but you want a man to amuse you id have sent to stukely but you want a serious man i fancy so much had the earl been thrown out of his plan for protecting his wife that he felt helpless and hinted at the aids and comforts of religion he had not rejected the official church and regarding it now as in alliance with great houses he considered that its ministers might also be useful to the troubled women of noble families he offered if she pleased to call in the rector to sit with herthe bishop of the diocese if she liked but just as you like my love he added you know you have to avoid fretting ive heard my sisters talk of the parson doing them good off and on about the time of their being brought to bed he elevated their minds they said im sure ive no objection if he can doctor the minds of women hes got a profession worth something rosamund smothered an outcry you mean that nevil is past hope not if hes got a fair half of our blood in him and richard beauchamp gave the fellow good stock he has about the best blood in england thats not saying much when theyve taken to breed as they buildstuff to keep the plasterers at work devil a thought of posterity there i see you and nevil one my dear lord said rosamund you think of those that are to follow us talk to me of him do not say the fellow say nevil no no call him the fellow he was alive and well when you used to say it but smile kindly as if he made you love him down in your heart in spite of you we have both known that love and that opposition to him not liking his ideas yet liking him so we were obliged to laughi have seen you as love does laugh if i am not crying over his grave everard oh the earl smoothed her forehead all her suspicions were rekindled truth truth give me truth let me know what world i am in my dear a ships not lost because shes caught in a squall nor a man buffeting the waves for an hour hes all right he keeps up he is delirious i ask youi have fancied i heard him lord romfrey puffed from his nostrils but in affecting to blow to the winds her foolish womans wildness of fancy his mind rested on nevil and he said poor boy it seems hes chattering hundreds to the minute his wifes looks alarmed him after he had said it and he was for toning it and modifying it when she gasped to him to help her to her feet and standing up she exclaimed o heaven now i hear you now i know he lives see how much better it is for me to know the real truth it takes me to his bedside ignorance and suspense have been poison i have been washed about like a dead body let me read all my letters now nothing will harm me now you will do your best for me my husband will you not she tore at her dress at her throat for coolness panting and smiling for meusyoursours give me my letters lunch with me and start for bevisham now you see how good it is for me to hear the very truth you will give me your own report and i shall absolutely trust in it and go down with it if its false but you see i am perfectly strong for the truth it must be you or i to go i burn to go but your going will satisfy me if you look on him i look i feel as if i had been nailed down in a coffin and have got fresh air i pledge you my word sir my honour my dear husband that i will think first of my duty i know it would be nevils wish he has not quite forgiven mehe thought me ambitiousah stop he said that the birth of our child would give him greater happiness than he had known for years he begged me to persuade you to call a boy nevil beauchamp and a girl rene he has never believed in his own long living rosamund refreshed her lords heart by smiling archly as she said the boy to be educated to take the side of the people of course the girl is to learn a profession ha bless the fellow lord romfrey interjected well i might go there for an hour promise me no fretting you have hollows in your cheeks and your underlip hangs i dont like it i havent seen that before we do not see clearly when we are trying to deceive said rosamund my letters my letters lord romfrey went to fetch them they were intact in his desk his wife then had actually been reading the facts through a wall for he was convinced of mrs devereuxs fidelity as well as of the colonels and cecilias he was not a man to be disobeyed nor was his wife the woman to court or to acquiesce in trifling acts of disobedience to him he received the impression consequently that this matter of the visit to nevil was one in which the poor loving soul might be allowed to guide him singular as the intensity of her love of nevil beauchamp was considering that they were not of kindred blood he endeavoured to tone her mind for the sadder items in miss denhams letters oh said rosamund what if i shed the screaming eyedrops as you call them they will not hurt me but relieve i was sure i should someday envy that girl if he dies she will have nursed him and had the last of him hes not going to die said everard powerfully we must be prepared these letters will do that for me i have written out the hours of your trains stanton will attend on you i have directed him to telegraph to the dolphin in bevisham for rooms for the night that is to morrow night to night you sleep at your hotel in london which will be ready to receive you and is more comfortable than the empty house stanton takes wine madeira and claret and other small necessaries if nevil should be very unwell you will not leave him immediately i shall look to the supplies you will telegraph to me twice a day and write once we lunch at half past twelve so that you may hit the twenty minutes to two oclock train and now i go to see that the packing is done she carried off her letters to her bedroom where she fell upon the bed shutting her eyelids hard before she could suffer her eyes to be the intermediaries of that fever chamber in bevisham and her bursting heart but she had not positively deceived her husband in the reassurance she had given him by her collectedness and by the precise directions she had issued for his comforts indicating a mind so much more at ease she was firmer to meet the peril of her beloved and being indeed when thrown on her internal resources one among the brave women of earth though also one who required a lift from circumstances to take her stand calmly fronting a menace to her heart she saw the evidence of her influence with lord romfrey the level she could feel that they were on together so long as she was courageous inspirited her sovereignly he departed at the hour settled for him rosamund sat at her boudoir window watching the carriage that was conducting him to the railway station neither of them had touched on the necessity of his presenting himself at the door of dr shrapnels house that and the disgust belonging to it was a secondary consideration with lord romfrey after he had once resolved on it as the right thing to do and his wife admired and respected him for so supreme a loftiness and fervently she prayed that it might not be her evil fate to disappoint his hopes never had she experienced so strong a sense of devotedness to him as when she saw the carriage winding past the middle oak wood of the park under a wet sky brightened from the west and on out of sight chapter l at the cottage on the common rain went with lord romfrey in a pursuing cloud all the way to bevisham and across the common to the long garden and plain little green shuttered neat white cottage of dr shrapnel carriages were driving from the door idle men with hands deep in their pockets hung near it some women pointing their shoulders under wet shawls and boys the earl was on foot with no sign of discomposure he stood at the half open door and sent in his card bearing the request for permission to visit his nephew the reply failing to come to him immediately he began striding to and fro that garden gate where he had flourished the righteous whip was wide foot farers over the sodden common were attracted to the gateway and lingered in it looking at the long green extended windows apparently listening before they broke away to exchange undertone speech here and there boys had pushed up through the garden to the kitchen area from time to time a woman in a dripping bonnet whimpered aloud an air of a country churchyard on a sunday morning when the curate has commenced the service prevailed the boys were subdued by the moisture as they are when they sit in the church aisle or organ loft before their members have been much cramped the whole scene and especially the behaviour of the boys betokened to lord romfrey that an event had come to pass in the chronicle of a sickness the event is death he bethought him of various means of stopping the telegraph and smothering the tale if matters should have touched the worst here he calculated abstrusely the practicable shortness of the two routes from bevisham to romfrey by post horses on the straightest line of road or by express train on the triangle of railway in case of an extreme need requiring him to hasten back to his wife and renew his paternal despotic system with her she had but persuaded him of the policy of a liberal openness and confidence for the moments occasion she could not turn his nature which ran to strokes of craft and blunt decision whenever the emergency smote him and he felt himself hailed to show generalship while thus occupied in thoughtfulness he became aware of the monotony of a tuneless chant as if it struck him an insane young chorister or canon were galloping straight on end hippomaniacally through the psalms there was a creak at intervals leading him to think it a machine that might have run away with the winders arm the earls humour proposed the notion to him that this perhaps was one of the forms of radical lamentation ululation possibly practised by a veteran impietist like dr shrapnel for the loss of his youngster his political cubpoor lad deriding any such paganry and aught that could be set howling lord romfrey was presently moved to ask of the small crowd at the gate what that sound was its the poor commander sir said a wet shawled woman shivering hes been at it twenty hours already sir said one of the boys twenty foor hour heve been at it said another a short dispute grew over the exact number of hours one boy declared that thirty hours had been reached father heerd n yesterday morning as he was aff to s work in the town afore six that brings t nigh thirty and he hant stopped yet the earl was invited to step inside the gate a little way up to the house and under the commanders window that he might obtain a better hearing he swung round walked away walked back and listened if it was indeed a voice the voice he would have said was travelling high in air along the sky yesterday he had described to his wife nevils chattering of hundreds to the minute he had not realized the description which had been only his manner of painting delirium there had been no warrant for it he heard the wild scudding voice imperfectly it reminded him of a string of winter geese changeing waters shower gusts and the wail and hiss of the rows of fir trees bordering the garden came between and allowed him a moments incredulity as to its being a human voice such a cry will often haunt the moors and wolds from above at nightfall the voice hied on sank seemed swallowed it rose as if above water in a hush of wind and trees the trees bowed their heads rageing the voice drowned once more to rise chattering thrice rapidly in a high pitched key thin shrill weird interminable like winds through a crazy chamber door at midnight the voice of a broomstick witch in the clouds could not be thinner and stranger lord romfrey had some such thought dr gannet was the bearer of miss denhams excuses to lord romfrey for the delay in begging him to enter the house in the confusion of the household his lordships card had been laid on the table below and she was in the sick room is my nephew a dead man said the earl the doctor weighed his reply he lives whether he will after the exhaustion of this prolonged fit of raving i dont dare to predict in the course of my experience i have never known anything like it he lives theres the miracle but he lives on brandy that would soon have sped him ha you have everything here that you want everything hes in your hands gannet the earl was conducted to a sitting room where dr gannet left him for a while mindful that he was under the roof of his enemy he remained standing observing nothing the voice overheard was off at a prodigious rate like the far sound of a yell ringing on and on the earl unconsciously sought a refuge from it by turning the leaves of a book upon the table which was a complete edition of harry denhams poems with a preface by a man named lydiard and really to read the preface one would suppose that these poets were the princes of the earth lord romfrey closed the volume it was exquisitely bound and presented to miss denham by the mr lydiard the works of your illustrious father was written on the title page these writers deal queerly with their words of praise of one another there is no law to restrain them perhaps it is the consolation they take for the poor devils life they lead a lady addressing him familiarly invited him to go upstairs he thanked her at the foot of the stairs he turned he had recognized cecilia halkett seeing her there was more strange to him than being there himself but he bowed to facts what do you think he said she did not answer intelligibly he walked up the crazed gabbling tongue had entire possession of the house and rang through it at an amazing pitch to sustain for a single minute a reflection to the effect that dogs die more decently than we men saddened the earl but then it is true we shorten their pangs by shooting them a dismal figure loomed above him at the head of the stairs he distinguished it in the vast lean length he had once whipped and flung to earth dr shrapnel was planted against the wall outside that raving chamber at the salient angle of a common prop or buttress the edge of a shoulder and a heel were the supports to him sideways in his distorted attitude his wall arm hung dead beside his pendent frock coat the hair of his head had gone to wildness like a field of barley whipped by tempest one hand pressed his eyeballs his unshaven jaw dropped lord romfrey passed him by the dumb consent of all present affirmed the creature lying on the bed to be nevil beauchamp face voice lank arms chicken neck what a sepulchral sketch of him it was the revelry of a corpse shudders of alarm for his wife seized lord romfrey at the sight he thought the poor thing on the bed must be going resolving to a cry unwinding itself violently in its hurricane of speech that was not speech nor exclamation rather the tongue let loose to run to the death it seemed to be out in mid sea up wave and down wave a nurse was at the pillow smoothing it miss denham stood at the foot of the bed is that pain lord romfrey said low to dr gannet unconscious was the reply miss denham glided about the room and disappeared her business was to remove dr shrapnel that he might be out of the way when lord romfrey should pass him again but dr shrapnel heard one voice only and moaned my beauchamp she could not get him to stir miss denham saw him start slightly as the earl stepped forth and bowing to him said i thank you sir for permitting me to visit my nephew dr shrapnel made a motion of the hand to signify freedom of access to his house he would have spoken the effort fetched a burst of terrible chuckles he covered his face lord romfrey descended the silly old wretch had disturbed his equanimity as a composer of fiction for the comfort and sustainment of his wife and no sooner had he the front door in view than the calculation of the three strides requisite to carry him out of the house plucked at his legs much as young people are affected by a dancing measure for he had without deigning to think of matters disagreeable to him in doing so performed the duty imposed upon him by his wife and now it behoved him to ward off the coming blow from that double life at romfrey castle he was arrested in his hasty passage by cecilia halkett she handed him a telegraphic message rosamund requested him to stay two days in bevisham she said additionally perfectly well shall fear to see you returning yet have sent to tourdestelle all his friends ni espoir ni crainte mais point de dceptions lumire ce sont les tnbres qui tuent her nimble wits had spied him on the road he was choosing and outrun him he resigned himself to wait a couple of days at bevisham cecilia begged him to accept a bed at mount laurels he declined and asked her how is it you are here i called here said she compressing her eyelids in anguish at a wilder cry of the voice overhead and forgetting to state why she had called at the house and what services she had undertaken a heap of letters in her handwriting explained the nature of her task lord romfrey asked her where the colonel was he drives me down in the morning and back at night but they will give me a bed or a sofa here to nighti cant cecilia stretched her hand out blinded to the earl he squeezed her hand these letters take away my strength crying is quite useless i know that said she glancing at a pile of letters that she had partly replied to some are from people who can hardly write there were people who distrusted him some are from people who abused him and maltreated him see those poor creatures out in the rain lord romfrey looked through the venetian blinds of the parlour window its as good as a play to them he remarked cecilia lit a candle and applied a stick of black wax to the flame saying envelopes have fallen short these letters will frighten the receivers i cannot help it i will bring letter paper and envelopes in the afternoon said lord romfrey dont use black wax my dear i can find no other i do not like to trouble miss denham letter paper has to be sealed these letters must go by the afternoon post i do not like to rob the poor anxious people of a little hope while he lives let me have note paper and envelopes quickly not black edged plain thats right said lord romfrey black appeared to him like the torch of death flying over the country there may be hope he added she sighed oh yes gannet will do everything that man can do to save him he will i am sure you dont keep watch in the room my dear do you miss denham allows me an hour there in the day it is the only rest she takes she gives me her bedroom ha well women ejaculated the earl and paused that sounded like him at times murmured cecilia all yesterday all through the night and to day hell be missed any sudden light of happier expectation that might have animated him was extinguished by the flight of chatter following the cry which had sounded like beauchamp he went out into the rain thinking that beauchamp would be missed the fellow had bothered the world but the world without him would be heavy matter the hour was mid day workmens meal time a congregation of shipyard workmen and a multitude of children crowded near the door in passing through them lord romfrey was besought for the doctors report of commander beauchamp variously named beesham bosham bitcham bewsham the earl heard his own name pronounced as he particularly disliked to hear itrumfree two or three men scowled at him it had not occurred to him ever before in his meditations to separate his blood and race from the common english and he was not of a character to dwell on fantastical and purposeless distinctions but the mispronunciation of his name and his nephews at an instant when he was thinking of nevils laying down his life for such men as these gross excessive breeders of ill shape and wooden countenance pushed him to reflections on the madness of nevil in endeavouring to lift them up and brush them up and a curious tenderness for nevils madness worked in his breast as he contrasted this much abused nephew of his with our general englishthe so called nobles who were sunk in the mud of the traders the traders who were sinking in the mud of the workmen the workmen who were like harbour flats at ebb tide round a stuck fast fleet of vessels big and little decidedly a fellow like nevil would be missed by him these english huddling more and more in flocks turning to lumps getting to be cut in a pattern and marked by a labelhow they bark and snap to rend an obnoxious original one may chafe at the botheration everlastingly raised by the fellow but if our england is to keep her place she must have him and many of him have him hes gone lord romfrey reasoned himself into pathetic sentiment by degrees he purchased the note paper and envelopes in the town for cecilia late in the afternoon he deposited them on the parlour table at dr shrapnels miss denham received him she was about to lie down for her hour of rest on the sofa cecilia was upstairs he inquired if there was any change in his nephews condition not any said miss denham the voice was abroad for proof of that he stood with a swelling heart jenny flung out a rug to its length beside the sofa and holding it by one end said i must have my rest to be of service my lord he bowed he was mute and surprised the young lady was like no person of her age and sex that he remembered ever to have met i will close the door he said retiring softly do not my lord the rug was over her up to her throat and her eyes were shut he looked back through the doorway in going out she was asleep some delirium gannet of good hope all in the usual course he transmitted intelligence to his wife a strong desire for wine at his dinner table warned him of something wrong with his iron nerves chapter li in the night the delirious voice haunted him it came no longer accompanied by images and likenesses to this and that of animate nature which were relieving and distracting it came to him in its mortal nakednessan afflicting incessant ringing peal bare as deaths ribs in telling of death when would it stop and when it stopped what would succeed what ghastly silence he walked to within view of the lights of dr shrapnels at night then home to his hotel miss denhams power of commanding sleep as he could not though contrary to custom he tried it on the right side and the left set him thinking of her he owned she was pretty but that he contended was not the word and the word was undiscoverable not cecilia halkett herself had so high bred an air for cecilia had not her fineness of feature and full quick eyes of which the thin eyelids were part of the expression and cecilia sobbed sniffled was patched about the face reddish bluish this girl was pliable only to service not to grief she did her work for three and twenty hours and fell to her sleep of one hour like a soldier lord romfrey could not recollect anything in a young woman that had taken him so much as the girls tossing out of the rug and covering herself lying down and going to sleep under his nose absolutely independent of his presence she had not betrayed any womans petulance with him for his conduct to her uncle or guardian nor had she hypocritically affected the reverse as ductile women do when they feel wanting in force to do the other she was not unlike nevils marquise in face he thought less foreign of course looking thrice as firm both were delicately featured he had a dream it was of an interminable procession of that odd lot called the people all of them were quarrelling under a deluge one party was for umbrellas one was against them and sounding the dispute with a question or two everard held it logical that there should be protection from the wet just as logical on the other hand that so frail a shelter should be discarded considering the tremendous downpour but as he himself was dry save for two or three drops he deemed them all lunatics he requested them to gag their empty chatter boxes and put the mother upon that childs cry he was now a simple unit of the procession asking naturally whither they were going he saw them point st pauls he heard in his own bosom it was and striking like the cathedral big bell several ladies addressed him sorrowfully he stood alone it had become notorious that he was to do battle and no one thought well of his chances devil an enemy to be seen he muttered yet they said the enemy was close upon him his right arm was paralyzed there was the enemy hard in front mailed vizored gauntleted he tried to lift his right hand and found it grasping an iron ring at the bottom of the deep steynham well sunk one hundred feet through the chalk but the unexampled cunning of his left arm was his little secret and acting upon this knowledge he telegraphed to his first wife at steynham that dr gannet was of good hope and thereupon he re entered the ranks of the voluminous procession already winding spirally round the dome of st pauls and there said he is the tomb of beauchamp everything occurred according to his predictions and he was entirely devoid of astonishment yet he would fain have known the titles of the slain admirals naval battles he protested he had a right to know for he was the heros uncle and loved him he assured the stupid scowling people that he loved nevil beauchamp always loved the boy and was the staunchest friend the fellow had and saying that he certainly felt himself leaning up against the cathedral rails in the attitude of dr shrapnel and crying beauchamp beauchamp and then he walked firmly out of romfrey oakwoods and at a miles distance from her related to his countess rosamund that the burial was over without much silly ceremony and that she needed to know nothing of it whatever rosamunds face awoke him it was the face of a chalk quarry featureless hollowed appalling the hour was no later than three in the morning he quitted the detestable bed where a dreamone of some half dozen in the course of his lifehad befallen him for the maxim of the healthy man is up and have it out in exercise when sleep is for foisting base coin of dreams upon you and as the healthy only are fit to live their maxims should be law he dressed and directed his leisurely steps to the common under a black sky and stars of lively brilliancy the lights of a carriage gleamed on dr shrapnels door a footman informed lord romfrey that colonel halkett was in the house and soon afterward the colonel appeared is it over i dont hear him said lord romfrey colonel halkett grasped his hand not yet he said cissy cant be got away its killing her no hes alive you may hear him now lord romfrey bent his ear its weaker the colonel resumed by the way romfrey step out with me my dear friend the circumstances will excuse me you know im not a man to take liberties im bound to tell you what your wife writes to me she says she has it on her conscience and cant rest for it you know women she wants you to speak to the man hereshrapnel she wants nevil to hear that you and he were friendly before he dies thinks it would console the poor dear fellow thats only an idea but it concerns her you see im shocked to have to talk to you about it my dear colonel i have no feeling against the man lord romfrey replied i spoke to him when i saw him yesterday i bear no grudges where is he you can send to her to say i have spoken to him twice yes yes the colonel assented he could not imagine that lady romfrey required more of her husband well i must be off i leave blackburn tuckham here with a friend of his a man who seems to be very sweet with mrs wardour devereux ha fetch him to me colonel i beg you to do that said lord romfrey the colonel brought out lydiard to the earl you have been at my nephews bedside mr lydiard within ten minutes my lord what is your opinion of the case my opinion is the chances are in his favour lay me under obligation by communicating that to romfrey castle at the first opening of the telegraph office to morrow morning lydiard promised the raving has ended hardly sir but the exhaustion is less than we feared it would be gannet is there he is in an arm chair in the room and dr shrapnel he does not bear speaking to he is quiet he is attached to my nephew as much as to life itself lord romfrey thanked lydiard courteously let us hope sir that some day i shall have the pleasure of entertaining you as well as another friend of yours you are very kind my lord the earl stood at the door to see colonel halkett drive off he declined to accompany him to mount laurels in the place of the carriage stood a man who growled wheres your horsewhip butcher he dogged the earl some steps across the common everard returned to his hotel and slept soundly during the remainder of the dark hours chapter lii question of a pilgrimage and an act of penance then came a glorious morning for sportsmen one sniffed the dews and could fancy fresh smells of stubble earth and dank woodland grass in the very streets of dirty bevisham sound sleep like hearty dining endows men with a sense of rectitude and sunlight following the former as a pleasant spell of conversational ease or sweet music the latter smiles a celestial approval of the performance lord romfrey dismissed his anxieties his lady slightly ruffled him at breakfast in a letter saying that she wished to join him he was annoyed at noon by a message wherein the wish was put as a request and later arrived another message bearing the character of an urgent petition true it might be laid to the account of telegraphic brevity he saw dr shrapnel and spoke to him as before to thank him for the permission to visit his nephew nevil he contemplated for the space of five minutes he cordially saluted miss denham he kissed cecilias hand all here is going on so well that i am with you for a day or two to morrow he despatched the message to his wife her case was now the gravest he could not understand why she desired to be in bevisham she must have had execrable dreamsrank poison to mothers however her constitutional strength was great and his pride in the restoration of his house by her agency flourished anew what with fair weather and a favourable report from dr gannet the weather was most propitious to the hopes of any soul bent on dispersing the shadows of death and to sportsmen from the windows of his railway carriage he beheld the happy sportsmen stalking afield the birds whirred and dropped just where he counted on their dropping the smoke of the guns threaded to dazzling silver in the sunshine say what poor old nevil will or did say previous to the sobering of his blood where is there a land like england everard rejoiced in his country temperately having nevil as wellof which fact the report he was framing in his mind to deliver to his wife assured himhe was rich and you that put yourselves forward for republicans and democrats do you deny the aristocracy of an oaklike man who is young upon the verge of eighty these were poetic flights but he knew them not by name and had not to be ashamed of them rosamund met him in the hall of the castle you have not deceived me my dear lord she said embracing him you have done what you could for me the rest is for me to do he reciprocated her embrace warmly in commendation of her fresher good looks she asked him you have spoken to dr shrapnel he answered her twice the word seemed quaint she recollected that he was quaint he repeated i spoke to him the first day i saw him and the second we are so much indebted to him said rosamund his love of nevil surpasses ours poor man poor man at least we may now hope the blow will be spared him which would have carried off his life with nevils i have later news of nevil than you good of course ah me the pleasure of the absence of pain he is not gone lord romfrey liked her calm resignation theres a mr lydiard he said a friend of nevils and a friend of louise devereuxs yes we hear from him every four hours rosamund rejoined mention him to her before me thats exactly what i was going to tell you to do before me said her husband smiling because everard is it not sowidows and she loves this gentleman certainly my dear i think with you about widows the world asks them to practise its own hypocrisy louise devereux was married to a pipe shes the widow of tobacco ash well make daylight round her how good how kind you are my lord i did not think so shrewd but benevolence is almost all seeing you said you spoke to dr shrapnel twice was he polite thoroughly upset you know what did he say what was it beauchamp beauchamp the first time and the second time he said he thought it had left off raining ah rosamund drooped her head she looked up here is louise my lord has had a long conversation with mr lydiard i trust he will come here before you leave us added the earl rosamund took her hand my lord has been more acute than i or else your friend is less guarded than you what have you seen said the blushing lady stay i have an idea you are one of the women i promised to cecil baskelett said the earl now may i tell him theres no chance oh do they spent so very pleasant an evening that the earl settled down into a comfortable expectation of the renewal of his old habits in the september and october season nevils frightful cry played on his ear drum at whiles but not too affectingly he conducted rosamund to her room kissed her hoped she would sleep well and retired to his good hard bachelors bed where he confidently supposed he would sleep the sleep of a dyspeptic with a wilder than the monstrous bevisham dream befell him causing him to rise at three in the morning and proceed to his ladys chamber to assure himself that at least she slept well she was awake i thought you might come she said he reproached her gently for indulging foolish nervous fears she replied no i do not i am easier about nevil i begin to think he will live i have something at my heart that prevents me from sleeping it concerns me whether he is to live or die i should like him to know he has not striven in vainnot in everything not where my conscience tells me he was right and we i wrongutterly wrong wickedly wrong my dear girl you are exciting yourself no feel my pulse the dead of night brings out nevil to me like the writing on the wall it shall not be said he failed in everything shame to us if it could be said he tried to make me see what my duty was and my honour he was at every man jack of us i speak of one thing i thought i might not have to go now i feel i must i remember him at steynham when colonel halkett and cecilia were there but for me cecilia would now be his wife of that there is no doubt that is not the point regrets are fruitless i see how the struggle it cost him to break with his old lovethat endearing madame de rouaillout his renebroke his heart and then his loss of cecilia halkett but i do believe true as that i am lying here and you hold my hand my dear husband those losses were not so fatal to him as his sufferings he went through on account of his friend dr shrapnel i will not keep you here go and have some rest what i shall beg of you tomorrow will not injure my health in the slightest the reverse it will raise me from a bitter depression it shall not be said that those who loved him were unmoved by him before he comes back to life or is carried to his grave he shall know that i was not false to my love of him my dear your pulse is at ninety said the earl look lenient be kind be just my husband oh let us cleanse our hearts this great wrong was my doing i am not only quite strong enough to travel to bevisham i shall be happy in going and when i have done itsaid the wrong was all mine i shall rejoice like the pure in spirit forgiveness does not matter though i now believe that poor loving old man who waits outside his door weeping is wrong headed only in his political views we women can read men by their power to love where love exists there is goodness but it is not for the sake of the poor old man himself that i would go it is for nevils it is for ours chiefly for me for my childs if ever rosamund turned her head on her pillow the earl patted her cheek well talk it over in the morning he said now go to sleep he could not say more for he did not dare to attempt cajolery with her shading his lamp he stepped softly away to wrestle with a worse nightmare than sleeps her meaning was clear and she was a woman to insist on doing it she was nevertheless a woman not impervious to reason if only he could shape her understanding to perceive that the state of her nerves incident to her delicate situation and the shock of that fellow nevils illnesspoor ladwas acting on her mind rendering her a victim of exaggerated ideas of duty and so forth naturally apart from allowing her to undertake the journey by rail he could not sanction his ladys humbling of herself so egregiously and unnecessarily shrapnel had behaved unbecomingly and had been punished for it he had spoken to shrapnel and the affair was virtually at an end with his assistance she would see that when less excited her eternal brooding over nevil was the cause of these mental vagaries lord romfrey was for postponing the appointed discussion in the morning after breakfast he pleaded business engagements none so urgent as this of mine said rosamund but we have excellent news of nevil you have gannets word for it he argued theres really nothing to distress you my heart i must be worthy of good news to know happiness she answered i will say let me go to bevisham two three four days hence if you like but there is peace for me and nowhere else my precious rosamund have you set your two eyes on it what you are asking is for permission to make an apology to shrapnel that is the word thats nevils word it is a prescription to me an apology the earls gorge rose why such an act was comparable to the circular mission of the dog if i do not make the apology the mother of your child is a coward said rosamund shes not i trust not you are a reasonable woman my dear now listen the man insulted you its past done with he insulted you he did not what he was courteous to me hospitable to me kind to me he did not insult me i belied him my dear saint youre dreaming he spoke insultingly of you to cecil is my lord that mans dupe i would stand against him before the throne of god with what little i know of his interview with dr shrapnel to confront him and expose his lie do not speak of him he stirs my evil passions and makes me feel myself the creature i was when i returned to steynham from my first visit to bevisham enraged with jealousy of dr shrapnels influence over nevil spiteful malicious oh such a nest of vileness as i pray to heaven i am not now if it is granted me to give life to another nevils misfortunes date from that she continued in reply to the earls efforts to soothe her not the loss of the election that was no misfortune but a lesson he would not have shone in parliament he runs too much from first principles to extremes you see i am perfectly reasonable everard i can form an exact estimate of character and things she smiled in his face and i know my husband too what he will grant what he would not and justly would not i know to a certainty that vexatious as i must be to you now you are conscious of my having reason for being so you carry it so farfifty miles beyond the mark said he the man roughed you and i taught him manners no she half screamed her interposition i repeat he was in no way discourteous or disobliging to me he offered me a seat at his table and heaven forgive me i believe a bed in his house that i might wait and be sure of seeing nevil because i was very anxious to see him all the same you cant go to the man i should have said so too before my destiny touched me a certain dignity of position my dear demands a corresponding dignity of conduct you cant go if i am walking in the very eye of heaven and feeling it shining on me where i go there is no question for me of human dignity such flighty talk offended lord romfrey it comes to this youre in want of a parson rosamund was too careful to hint that she would have expected succour and seconding from one or other of the better order of clergymen she shook her head to this my dear lord i have a troubled mind and it is not to listen nor to talk that i am in need of but to act yes my dear girl but not to act insanely i do love soundness of head you have it only just now youre a little astray well leave this matter for another time rosamund held him by the arm not too long both of them applied privately to mrs wardour devereux for her opinion and counsel on the subject of the proposal to apologize to dr shrapnel she was against it with the earl and became rosamunds echo when with her when alone she was divided into two almost equal halves deeming that the countess should not insist and the earl should not refuse him she condemned for lack of sufficient spiritual insight to perceive the merits of his wifes request her she accused of some vestige of something underbred in her nature for putting such fervid stress upon the supplication ie making too much of ita trick of the vulgar and not known to the languid she wrote to lydiard for advice he condensed a paragraph into a line it should be the earl she is driving him to it intentionally or not mrs devereux doubted that the countess could have so false an idea of her husbands character as to think it possible he would ever be bent to humble himself to the man he had castigated she was right it was by honestly presenting to his mind something more loathsome still the humbling of herself that rosamund succeeded in awakening some remote thoughts of a compromise in case of necessity better i than she but the necessity was inconceivable he had really done everything required of him if anything was really required by speaking to shrapnel civilly he had spoken to shrapnel twice besides the castle was being gladdened by happier tidings of beauchamp gannet now pledged his word to the poor fellows recovery and the earls particular friends arrived and the countess entertained them october passed smoothly she said once ancestresses of yours my lord have undertaken pilgrimages as acts of penance for sin to obtain heavens intercession in their extremity i dare say they did he replied the monks got round them it is not to be laughed at if it eased their hearts timidly she renewed her request for permission to perform the pilgrimage to bevisham wait said he till nevil is on his legs have you considered where i may then be everard my love you sleep well dont you you see me every night i see you sound asleep i see you watching me lets reason said the earl and again they went through the argument upon the apology to dr shrapnel he was willing to indulge her in any amount of it and she perceived why fox she thought grand fox but fox downright for her time was shortening to days that would leave her no free will on the other hand the exercise of her free will in a fast resolve was growing all the more a privilege that he was bound to respect as she became sacreder and doubly precious to him the less would he venture to thwart her though he should think her mad there would be an analogy between his manner of regarding her and the way that superstitious villagers look on their crazy innocents she thought sadly and she bled for him too she grieved to hurt his pride but she had come to imagine that there was no avoidance of this deed of personal humiliation nevil had scrawled a note to her she had it in her hand one forenoon in mid november when she said to her husband i have ordered the carriage for two oclock to meet the quarter to three train to london and i have sent stanton on to get the house ready for us tonight lord romfrey levelled a marksmans eye at her why london you know my wish that it should be here at the castle i have decided to go to bevisham i have little time left none to my thinking oh i yes my heart will be light i shall gain you come with me to london you cant go dont attempt to reason with me please please i command madam my lord it is past the hour of commanding he nodded his head with the eyes up amid the puckered brows and blowing one of his long nasal expirations cried here we are in for another bout of argument no i can bear the journey rejoice in confessing my fault but more argument i cannot bear i will reason with you when i can submit to me in this feminine reasoning he interjected i have nothing better to offer it will be prudent to attend to me take my conduct for the portion i bring you before i put myself in gods care i must be clean i am unclean language like that offends you i have no better my reasoning has not touched you i am helpless except in this determination that my contrition shall be expressed to dr shrapnel if i am to have life to be worthy of living and being a mother it must be done now my dear lord see that and submit youre but one voice i am two he jumped off his chair frowning up his forehead and staring awfully at the insulting prospect an apology to the man by you away with it make allowances for me if you can my dear lord that is what i am going to do my wife going there he strode along furiously no you will not stop her theres a palsy in my arm if i dont she plucked at her watch why maam i dont know you he said coming close to her let s reason perhaps you overshot it you were disgusted with shrapnel perhaps i was hasty i get fired by an insult to a woman there was a rascal kissed a girl once against her will and i heard her cry out i laid him on his back for six months just to tell you id do the same to lord or beggar very well my dear heart well own i might have looked into the case when that dog cecil whats the matter speak on my dear husband said rosamund panting but your making the journey to bevisham is a foolish notion yes well well well wait oh have we to travel over it all again she exclaimed in despair at the dashing out of a light she had fancied you see the wrong you know the fever it is in my blood and you bid me wait drop a line to nevil to trick my conscience i might have done that and done well once do you think i dislike the task i propose to myself it is for your sake that i would shun it as for me the thought of going there is an ecstasy i shall be with nevil and be able to look in his face and how can i be actually abasing you when i am so certain that i am worthier of you in what i do her exaltation swept her on hurry there my lord if you will if you think it prudent that you should go in my place go you deprive me of a great joy but i will not put myself in your way and i consent the chief sin was mine remember that i rank it viler than cecil baskeletts and listen whencan you reckonwhen will he confess his wickedness we separate ourselves from a wretch like that pooh quoth the earl but you will go she fastened her arms round the arm nearest you or i does it matter which we are one you speak for me i should have been forced to speak for you you spare me the journey i do not in truth suppose it would have injured me but i would not run one unnecessary risk lord romfrey sighed profoundly he could not shake her off how could he refuse her how on earth had it come about that suddenly he was expected to be the person to go she would not let him elude her and her stained cheeks and her trembling on his arm pleaded most pressingly and masteringly it might be that she spoke with a knowledge of her case positive it undoubtedly was that she meant to go if he did not perhaps the hopes of his house hung on it having admitted that a wrong had been done he was not the man to leave it unamended only he would have chosen his time and the manner since nevils illness too he had once or twice been clouded with a little bit of regret at the recollection of poor innocent old shrapnel posted like a figure of total inebriation beside the doorway of the dreadful sickroom there had been women of the earls illustrious house who would have given their hands to the axe rather than conceal a stain and have to dread a scandal his rosamund after all was of their pattern even though she blew that conscience she prattled of into trifles and swelled them as women of high birth in this country out of the clutches of the priests do not do she clung to him for his promise to go he said well well that means you will said she his not denying it passed for the affirmative then indeed she bloomed with love of him yet do say yes she begged ill go maam shouted the earl ill go my love he said softly chapter liii the apology to dr shrapnel you and nevil are so alike lady romfrey said to her lord at some secret resemblance she detected and dwelt on fondly when the earl was on the point of starting a second time for bevisham to perform what she had prompted him to conceive his honourable duty without a single intimation that he loathed the task neither shrug nor grimace two ends of a stick are pretty much alike theyre all that length apart said he very little in the humour for compliments however well braced for his work his wifes admiring love was pleasant enough he preferred to have it unspoken few of us care to be eulogized in the act of taking a nauseous medical mixture for him the thing was as good as done on his deciding to think it both adviseable and right so he shouldered his load and marched off with it he could have postponed the right proceeding even after the partial recognition of his errorone drops a word or two by hazard one expresses an anxiety to afford reparation one sends a message and so forth for the satisfaction of ones conventionally gentlemanly feeling but the adviseable proceeding under stress of peculiar circumstances his clearly awakened recognition of that impelled him unhesitatingly his wife had said it was the portion she brought him tears would not have persuaded him so powerfully that he might prove to her he was glad of her whatever the portion she brought she was a good wife a brave woman likely to be an incomparable mother at present her very virtues excited her to fancifulness nevertheless she was in his charge and he was bound to break the neck of his will to give her perfect peace of wind the child suffers from the mothers mental agitation it might be a question of a nervous or an idiot future earl of romfrey better death to the house than such a mockery of his line these reflections reminded him of the heartiness of his whipping of that poor old tumbled signpost shrapnel in the name of outraged womankind if there was no outrage assuredly if there was no outrage consideration for the state of his wife would urge him to speak the apology in the most natural manner possible she vowed there was none he never thought of blaming her for formerly deceiving him nor of blaming her for now expediting him in the presence of colonel halkett mr tuckham and mr lydiard on a fine november afternoon standing bareheaded in the fir bordered garden of the cottage on the common lord romfrey delivered his apology to dr shrapnel and he said i call you to witness gentlemen i offer dr shrapnel the fullest reparation he may think fit to demand of me for an unprovoked assault on him that i find was quite unjustified and for which i am here to ask his forgiveness speech of man could not have been more nobly uttered dr shrapnel replied to the half of that sirtis over what remains is done with the hand he stretched his hand out lord romfrey closed his own on it the antagonists between whom was no pretence of their being other after the performance of a creditable ceremony bowed and exchanged civil remarks and then lord romfrey was invited to go into the house and see beauchamp who happened to be sitting with cecilia halkett and jenny denham beauchamp was thin pale and quiet but the sight of him standing and conversing after that scene of the skinny creature struggling with bareribbed obstruction on the bed was an example of constitutional vigour and a compliment to the family very gratifying to lord romfrey excepting by cecilia the earl was coldly received he had to leave early by special express for london to catch the last train to romfrey beauchamp declined to fix a day for his visit to the castle with lydiard but proposed that lydiard should accompany the earl on his return lydiard was called in and at once accepted the earls invitation and quitted the room to pack his portmanteau a faint sign of firm shutting shadowed the corners of jennys lips you have brought my nephew to life lord romfrey said to her my share in it was very small my lord gannet says that your share in it was very great and i say so with the authority of a witness added cecilia and i from my experience came from beauchamp his voice had a hollow sound unlike his natural voice the earl looked at him remembering the bright laughing lad he had once been and said why not try a month of madeira you have only to step on board the boat i dont want to lose a month of my friend said beauchamp take your friend with you after these fevers our winters are bad ive been idle too long but captain beauchamp said jenny you proposed to do nothing but read for a couple of years ay theres the voyage sighed he with a sailor invalids vision of sunny seas dancing in the far sky you must persuade dr shrapnel to come and he will not come unless you come too and you wont go anywhere but to the alps she bent her eyes on the floor beauchamp remembered what had brought her home from the alps he cast a cold look on his uncle talking with cecilia granite as he thought and the reflux of that slight feeling of despair seemed to tear down with it in wreckage every effort he had made in life and cry failure on him yet he was hoping that he had not been created for failure he touched his uncles hand indifferently my love to the countess let me hear of her sir if you please you shall said the earl but off to madeira and up teneriffe sail the azores ill hire you a good sized schooner there is the esperanza said cecilia and the vessel is lying idle nevil can you allow it he consented to laugh at himself and fell to coughing jenny denham saw a real human expression of anxiety cross the features of the earl at the sound of the cough lord romfrey said adieu to her he offered her his hand which she contrived to avoid taking by dropping a formal half reverence think of the esperanza she will be coasting her nominal native land and adieu for to day cecilia said to beauchamp jenny denham and he stood at the window to watch the leave taking in the garden for a distraction they interchanged no remark of surprise at seeing the earl and dr shrapnel hand locked but jennys heart reproached her uncle for being actually servile and beauchamp accused the earl of aristocratic impudence both were overcome with remorse when colonel halkett putting his head into the room to say good bye to beauchamp and place the esperanza at his disposal for a winter cruise chanced to mention in two or three half words the purpose of the earls visit and what had occurred he took it for known already to miss denham he remarked lord romfrey is very much concerned about your health he fears you have overdone it in nursing captain beauchamp i must be off after him said beauchamp and began trembling so that he could not stir the colonel knew the pain and shame of that condition of weakness to a man who has been strong and swift and said seven league boots are not to be caught youll see him soon why i thought some letter of yours had fetched him here i gave you all the credit of it no he deserves it all himselfall said beauchamp and with a dubious eye on jenny denham you see we were unfair the we meant you to her sensitiveness and probably he did mean it for you for as he would have felt so he supposed that his uncle must have felt jennys coldness was much the crueller her features which in animation were summer light playing upon smooth water could be exceedingly cold in repose the icier to those who knew her because they never expressed disdain no expression of the baser sort belonged to them beauchamp was intimate with these delicately cut features he would have shuddered had they chilled on him he had fallen in love with his uncle he fancied she ought to have done so too and from his excess of sympathy he found her deficient in it he sat himself down to write a hearty letter to his dear old uncle everard jenny left him to go to her chamber and cry chapter liv the fruits of the apology this clear heart had cause for tears her just indignation with lord romfrey had sustained her artificially hitherto now that it was erased she sank down to weep her sentiments toward lydiard had been very like cecilia halketts in favour of mr austin with something more to warm them on the part of the gentleman he first had led her mind in the direction of balanced thought when despite her affection for dr shrapnel her timorous maiden wits unable to contend with the copious exclamatory old politician opposed him silently lydiard had helped her tongue to speak as well as her mind to rational views and there had been a bond of union in common for them in his admiration of her fathers writings she had known that he was miserably yoked and had respected him when he seemed inclined for compassion without wooing her for tenderness he had not trifled with her hardly flattered he had done no more than kindle a young girls imaginative liking the pale flower of imagination fed by dews not by sunshine was born drooping and hung secret in her bosom shy as a bell of the frail wood sorrel yet there was pain for her in the perishing of a thing so poor and lowly she had not observed the change in lydiard after beauchamp came on the scene and that may tell us how passionlessly pure the little maidenly sentiment was for do but look on the dewy wood sorrel flower it is not violet or rose inviting hands to pluck it still it is there happy in the woods and jennys feeling was that a foot had crushed it she wept thinking confusedly of lord romfrey trying to think he had made his amends tardily and that beauchamp prized him too highly for the act she had no longer anything to resent she was obliged to weep in truth as the earl had noticed she was physically depressed by the strain of her protracted watch over beauchamp as well as rather heartsick but she had been of aid and use in saving him she was not quite a valueless person sweet too was the thought that he consulted her listened to her weighed her ideas he had evidently taken to study her as if dispersing some wonderment that one of her sex should have ideas he had repeated certain of her own which had been forgotten by her his eyes were often on her with this that she thought humorous intentness she smiled she had assisted in raising him from his bed of sickness whereof the memory affrighted her and melted her the difficulty now was to keep him indoors and why he would not go even temporarily to a large house like mount laurels whither colonel halkett was daily requesting him to go she was unable to comprehend his love of dr shrapnel might account for it own jenny said beauchamp springing up to meet her as she entered the room where he and dr shrapnel sat discussing lord romfreys bearing at his visit own that my uncle everard is a true nobleman he has to make the round to the right mark but he comes to it i could not move himand i like him the better for that he worked round to it himself i ought to have been sure he would youre right i break my head with impatience no you sowed seed said dr shrapnel heed not that girl my beauchamp the old womans in the tory and the tory leads the young maid heres a fable i draw from a naturalists book and well set it against the dicta of jenny do nothing jenny discretion jenny wait for the gods once upon a time in a tropical island a man lay sick so ill that he could not rise to trouble his neighbours for help so weak that it was lifting a mountain to get up from his bed so hopeless of succour that the last spark of distraught wisdom perching on his brains advised him to lie where he was and trouble not himself since peace at least he could command before he passed upon the black highroad men call our kingdom of peace ay he lay there now it chanced that this man had a mess to cook for his nourishment and life said do it and death said to what end he wrestled with the stark limbs of death and cooked the mess and that done he had no strength remaining to him to consume it but crept to his bed like the toad into winter now meanwhile a steam arose from the mess and he lay stretched so it befel that the birds of prey of the region scented the mess and they descended and thronged at that mans windows and the mans neighbours looked up at them for it was the sign of one who is fit for the beaks of birds lying unburied fail to spread the pall one hour where suns are decisive and the pall comes down out of heaven they said the man is dead within and they went to his room and saw him and succoured him they lifted him out of death by the last uncut thread now my jenny weigh words jenny halt there was it they who saved the man or he that saved himself the man taxed his expiring breath to sow seed of life lydiard shall put it into verse for a fable in song for our people i say it is a good fable and sung spiritedly may serve for nourishment and faith in work to many of our poor fainting fellows now you jenny said i think it is a good fable of self help does it quite illustrate the case i mean the virtue of impatience but i like the fable and the moral and i think it would do good if it were made popular though it would be hard to condense it to a song it would be hard ay then we do it forthwith and you shall compose the music as for the case of impatience my dear you tether the soaring universal to your pet lambs post the special i spoke of seed sown i spoke of the fruits of energy and resolution cared i for an apology i took the blows as i take hail from the cloudswhich apologize to you the moment you are in shelter if you laugh at them so good night to that matter are we to have rain this evening i must away into bevisham to the workmens hall and pay the men there will not be rain there will be frost and you must be well wrapped if you must go said jenny and tell them not to think of deputations to captain beauchamp yet no no deputations let them send killick if they want to say anything said beauchamp wrong the doctor cried wrong wrong six men wont hurt you more than one and why check them when their feelings are up they burn to be speaking some words to you trust me beauchamp if we shun to encounter the good warm soul of numbers our hearts are narrowed to them the business of our modern world is to open heart and stretch out arms to numbers in numbers we have our sinews they are our iron and gold scatter them not teach them the secret of cohesion practically since they gave you not their entire confidence once you should not rebuff them to suspicions of you as aristocrat when they rise on the effort to believe a man of as tis called birth their undivided friend meet them send them said beauchamp jenny denham fastened a vast cloak and a comforter on the doctors heedless shoulders and throat enjoining on him to return in good time for dinner he put his finger to her cheek in reproof of such supererogatory counsel to a man famous for his punctuality the day had darkened beauchamp begged jenny to play to him on the piano do you indeed care to have music said she i did not wish you to meet a deputation because your strength is not yet equal to it dr shrapnel dwells on principles forgetful of minor considerations i wish thousands did cried beauchamp when you play i seem to hear ideas your music makes me think jenny lit a pair of candles and set them on the piano waltzes she asked call in a puppet show at once she smiled turned over some leaves and struck the opening notes of the ninth symphony of beethoven and made her selections at the finish he said now read me your fathers poem the hunt of the fates she read it to him now read the ascent from the inferno that she read and also soul and brute another of his favourites he wanted more and told her to read first lovelast love i fear i have not the tone of voice for love poems jenny said returning the book to him ill read it said he he read with more impressiveness than effect lydiards reading thrilled her beauchamps insisted too much on particular lines but it was worth while observing him she saw him always as in a picture remote from herself his loftier social station and strange character precluded any of those keen suspicions by which women learn that a fire is beginning to glow near them how i should like to have known your father he said i dont wonder at dr shrapnels love of him yes he was one of the great men of his day and its a higher honour to be of his blood than any that rank can give you were ten years old when you lost him describe him to me he used to play with me like a boy said jenny she described her father from a childs recollection of him dr shrapnel declares he would have been one of the first surgeons in europe and he was one of the first of poets beauchamp pursued with enthusiasm so he was doubly great i hold a good surgeon to be in the front rank of public benefactorswhere they put rich brewers bankers and speculative manufacturers now well the world is young we shall alter that in time whom did your father marry jenny answered my mother was the daughter of a london lawyer she married without her fathers approval of the match and he left her nothing beauchamp interjected lawyers money it would have been useful to my mothers household when i was an infant said jenny poor soul i suppose so yes well beauchamp sighed money never mind how it comes were in such a primitive condition that we catch at anything to keep us out of the cold dogs with a boneinstead of living as dr shrapnel prophecies for and with one another its war now and moneys the weapon of war and were the worst nation in europe for that but if we fairly recognize it we shall be the first to alter our ways theres the point well jenny i can look you in the face to night thanks to my uncle everard at last captain beauchamp you have never been blamed i am captain beauchamp by courtesy in public my friends call me nevil i think i have heard the name on your lips when you were very ill he stood closer to her very close which was the arm that bled for me may i look at it there was a bruise have you not forgotten that trifle there is the faintest possible mark of it left i wish to see she gently defended the arm but he made it so much a matter of earnest to see the bruise of the old election missile on her fair arm that with a pardonable soft blush to avoid making much of it herself she turned her sleeve a little above the wrist he took her hand it was for me it was quite an accident no harm was intended but it was in my causefor me indeed captain beauchamp nevil we say indoors nevilbut is it not wiser to say what comes naturally to us who told you to day that you had brought me to life i am here to prove it true if i had paid attention to your advice i should not have gone into the cottage of those poor creatures and taken away the fever i did no good there but the mans wife said her husband had been ruined by voting for me and it was a point of honour to go in and sit with him you are not to have your hand back it is mine dont you remember jenny how you gave me your arm on the road when i staggered two days before the fever knocked me over shall i tell you what i thought then i thought that he who could have you for a mate would have the bravest and helpfullest wife in all england and not a mere beauty for you have good looks but you have the qualities i have been in search of why do your eyes look so mournfully at me i am full of hope well sail the esperanza for the winter you and i and our best friend with us and you shall have a voice in the council be sure if you are two to one jenny said quickly to keep from faltering beauchamp pressed his mouth to the mark of the bruise on her arm he held her fast i mean it if you will join me that you and i should rejoice the heart of the dear old manwill you he has been brooding over your loneliness here if you are unmarried ever since his recovery i owe my life to you and every debt of gratitude to him now jenny oh captain beauchampnevil if you will if i may have my hand you exaggerate common kindness he loves you we both esteem you but you dont love me indeed i have no fear that i shall be unable to support myself if i am left alone but i want your help i wake from illness with my eyes open i must have your arm to lean on now and then jenny dropped a shivering sigh uncle is long absent she said her hand was released beauchamp inspected his watch he may have fallen he may be lying on the common oh cried jenny why did i let him go out without me let me have his lantern ill go and search over the common you must not go out said she i must the old man may be perishing it will be death to you nevil thats foolish i can stand the air for a few minutes ill go said jenny unprotected no cook shall come with me two women nevil if you care a little for me be good be kind submit he is half an hour behind dinner time and hes never late something must have happened to him way for me my dear girl she stood firm between him and the door it came to pass that she stretched her hands to arrest him and he seized the hands rather than you should go out in this cold weather anything she said in the desperation of physical inability to hold him back ah beauchamp crossed his arms round her ill wait for five minutes one went by with jenny folded broken and sobbing senseless against his breast they had not heard dr shrapnel quietly opening the hall door and hanging up his hat he looked in beauchamp he exclaimed come doctor said beauchamp and loosened his clasp of jenny considerately she disengaged herself beauchamp now i die a glad man witness doctor shes mine by her own confession uncle jenny gasped oh captain beauchamp what an error what delusion forget it i will here are more misunderstandings you shall be excused but be be you the blessedest woman alive on this earth my jenny shouted dr shrapnel you have the choice man on all the earth for husband sweetheart ay of all the earth i go with a message for my old friend harry denham to quicken him in the grave for the husband of his girl is nevil beauchamp the one thing i dared not dream of thousands is established sunlight my jenny beauchamp kissed her hand she slipped away to her chamber grovelling to find her diminished self somewhere in the mid thunder of her amazement as though it were to discover a pin on the floor by the flash of lightning where was she this ensued from the apology of lord romfrey to dr shrapnel chapter lv without love at the end of november jenny denham wrote these lines to mr lydiard in reply to his request that she should furnish the latest particulars of nevil beauchamp for the satisfaction of the countess of romfrey there is everything to reassure lady romfrey in the state of captain beauchamps health and i have never seen him so placidly happy as he has been since the arrival yesterday morning of a lady from france madame la marquise de rouaillout with her brother m le comte de croisnel her husband i hear from m de croisnel dreads our climate and coffee too much to attempt the voyage i understand that she writes to lady romfrey to day lady romfreys letter to her informing her of captain beauchamps alarming illness went the round from normandy to touraine and dauphiny otherwise she would have come over earlier her first inquiry of me was il est mort you would have supposed her disappointed by my answer a light went out in her eyes like that of a veilleuse in the dawn she looked at me without speaking while her beautiful eyes regained their natural expression she shut them and sighed tell him that m de croisnel and his sister are here this morning her wish to see miss halkett was gratified you know my taste was formed in france i agree with captain beauchamp in his more than admiration of frenchwomen ours though more accomplished are colder and less plastic but miss halkett is surpassingly beautiful very amiable very generous a perfect friend she is our country at its best probably she is shy of speaking french she frequently puts the italian accent madame de rouaillout begged to speak with her alone i do not know what passed miss halkett did not return to us dr shrapnel and captain beauchamp have recently been speculating on our becoming a nation of artists and authorities in science and philosophy by the time our coalfields and material wealth are exhausted that and the cataclysm are their themes they say will things end utterlyall our gains be lost the question seems to me to come of that love of earth which is recognition of god for if they cannot reconcile themselves to believe in extinction to what must they be looking it is a confirmation of your saying that love leads to god through art or in acts you will regret to hear that the project of captain beauchamps voyage is in danger of being abandoned a committee of a vacant radical borough has offered to nominate him my influence is weak madame would have him go back with her and her brother to normandy my influence is weak i suppose because he finds me constantly leaning to expediencyi am your pupil it may be quite correct that powder is intended for explosion we do not therefore apply a spark to the barrel i ventured on that he pitied me in the snares of simile and metaphor he is the same you perceive how often have we not discussed what would have become of him with that rocket brain of his in less quiet times yet when he was addressing a deputation of workmen the other day he recommended patience to them as one of the virtues that count under wisdom he is curiously impatient for knowledge one of his reasons for not accepting colonel halketts offer of his yacht is that he will not be able to have books enough on board definite instead of vast and hazy duties are to be desired for him i think most fervently i pray that he will obtain a ship and serve some years at the risk of your accusing me of sententious posing i would say that men who do not live in the present chiefly but hamper themselves with giant tasks in excess of alarm for the future however devoted and noble they may beand he is an example of one that isreduce themselves to the dimensions of pigmies they have the cry of infants you reply foresight is an element of love of country and mankind but how often is not the foresight guess work he has not spoken of the dawn project to day he is repeating one of uncles noveltiessultry tories the sultry tory sits in the sun and prophecies woefully of storm it appears your accusation that i am one at heart amuses me i am not quite able to deny it sultriness i am not conscious of but it would appear to be an epithet for the conservatives of wealth so that england being very wealthy we are to call it a sultry country you are much wanted for where there is no middleman liberal to hold the scales for them these two have it all their own way which is not good for them captain beauchamp quotes you too it seems that you once talked to him of a machine for measuring the force of blows delivered with the fist and compared his efforts to those of one perpetually practising at it and this you are said to have called the case of the constitutional realm and the extreme radical elsewhere the radical smites at iron or rotten wood in england it is a cushion on springs did you say it he quotes it as yours half acquiescingly and ruefully for visitors we have had captain baskelett for two minutes and lord palmet who stayed longer and seems to intend to come daily he attempts french with madame de r and amuses her a little a silver foot and a ball of worsted mr and mrs grancey lespel have called and lord and lady croyston colonel halkett miss halkett and mr tuckham come frequently captain beauchamp spoke to her yesterday of her marriage madame de r leaves us to morrow her brother is a delightful gay tempered very handsome boyish frenchmannot her equal to my mind for i do not think frenchmen comparable to the women of france but she is exceedingly grave with hardly a smile and his high spirits excite nevils so it is pleasant to see them together the letter was handed to lady romfrey she read through it thoughtfully till she came to the name of nevil when she frowned on the morrow she pronounced it a disingenuous letter rene had sent her these lines i should come to you if my time were not restricted my brothers leave of absence is short i have done here what lay in my power to show you i have learnt something in the school of self immolation i have seen mlle halkett she is a beautiful young woman deficient only in words doubtless my labour except that it may satisfy you was the vainest of tasks she marries a ruddy monsieur of a name that i forget and of the bearing of a member of the gardes du corps without the stature enfin madame i have done my duty and do not regret it since i may hope that it will win for me some approbation and a portion of the esteem of a lady to whom i am indebted for that which is now the best of life to me and i do not undervalue it in saying i would gladly have it stamped on brass and deposited beside my fathers i have my faith i would it were nevils tooand yours should you be in need of it he will marry mlle denham if i may foretell events she will steady him she is a young person who will not feel astray in society of his rank she possesses the natural grace we do not expect to see out of our countryfrom sheer ignorance of what is beyond it for the moment she affects to consider herself unworthy and it is excuseable that she should be slightly alarmed at her prospect but nevil must have a wife i presume to think that he could not have chosen better above all make him leave england for the winter adieu dear countess nevil promises me a visit after his marriage i shall not set foot on england again but you should you ever come to our land of france will find my heart open to you at the gates of undying grateful recollection i am not skilled in writing you have looked into me once look now i am the same only i have succeeded in bringing myself to a greater likeness to the dead as it becomes a creature to be who is coupled with one of their body meanwhile i shall have news of you i trust that soon i may be warranted in forwarding congratulations to lord romfrey rosamund handed the letters to her husband not only did she think miss denham disingenuous she saw that the girl was not in love with beauchamp and the idea of a loveless marriage for him threw the mournfullest of hecates beams along the course of a career that the passionate love of a bride though she were not well born and not wealthy would have rosily coloured without love she exclaimed to herself she asked the earls opinion of the startling intelligence and of the character of that miss denham who could pen such a letter after engaging to give her hand to nevil lord romfrey laughed in his dumb way if nevil must have a wifeand the marquise tells you so and she ought to knowhe may as well marry a girl who wont go all the way down hill with him at his pace hell be cogged you do not object to such an alliance im past objection theres no law against a mans marrying his nurse but she is not even in love with him i dare say not he wants a wife she accepts a husband the two women who were in love with him he wouldnt have lady romfrey sighed deeply he has lost cecilia she might still have been his but he has taken to that girl and madame de rouaillout praises the girl becauseoh i see itshe has less to be jealous of in miss denham of whose birth and blood we know nothing let that pass if only she loved him i cannot endure the thought of his marrying a girl who is not in love with him just as you like my dear i used to suspect mr lydiard perhaps hes the man oh what an end of so brilliant a beginning it strikes me my dear said the earl its the proper common sense beginning that may have a fairish end no but what i feel is that heour nevilhas accomplished hardly anything if anything he hasnt marched on london with a couple of hundred thousand men no he hasnt done that the earl said glancing back in his mind through beauchamps career and he escapes what stukely calls his nations scourge in the shape of a statue turned out by an english chisel no we havent had much public excitement out of him but one thing he did do he got me down on my knees lord romfrey pronounced these words with a sober emphasis that struck the humour of it sharply into rosamunds heart through some contrast it presented between nevils aim at the world and hit of a man the immense deal thought of it by the earl and the very little that nevil would think of itthe great domestic achievement to be boasted of by an enthusiastic devotee of politics she embraced her husband with peals of loving laughter the last laughter heard in romfrey castle for many a day chapter lvi the last of nevil beauchamp not before beauchamp was flying with the winter gales to warmer climes could rosamund reflect on his career unshadowed by her feminine mortification at the thought that he was unloved by the girl he had decided to marry but when he was away and winds blew the clouds which obscured an embracing imagination of himsuch as to be true and full and sufficient should stretch like the dome of heaven over the humblest of lives under contemplationbroke and revealed him to her as one who had other than failed rather as one in mid career in mid forest who by force of character advancing in self conquest strikes his impress right and left around him because of his aim at stars he had faults and she gloried to think he had for the womans heart rejoiced in his portion of our common humanity while she named their prince to men but where was he to be matched in devotedness and in gallantry and what man of blood fiery as nevils ever fought so to subject it rosamund followed him like a migratory bird hovered over his vessel perched on deck beside the helm where her sailor was sure to be stationed entered his breast communed with him and wound him round and round with her love he has mine she cried her craving that he should be blest in the reward or flower crown of his wifes love of him lessened in proportion as her brooding spirit vividly realized his deeds in fact it had been but an example of our very general craving for a climax palpable and scenic she was completely satisfied by her conviction that his wife would respect and must be subordinate to him so it had been with her as for love let him come to his rosamund for love and appreciation adoration rosamund drew nigh to her hour of peril with this torch of her love of beauchamp to illuminate her there had been a difficulty in getting him to go one day cecilia walked down to dr shrapnels with mr tuckham to communicate that the esperanza awaited captain beauchamp manned and provisioned off the pier now he would not go without dr shrapnel nor the doctor without jenny and jenny could not hold back seeing that the wish of her heart was for nevil to be at sea untroubled by political questions and prowling radical deputies so her consent was the seal of the voyage what she would not consent to was the proposal to have her finger ringed previous to the voyage altogether in the manner of a sailors bride she seemed to stipulate for a term of courtship nevil frankly told the doctor that he was not equal to it anything that was kind he was quite ready to say and anything that was pretty but nothing particularly kind and pretty occurred to him he was exactly like a juvenile correspondent facing a blank sheet of letter paperhe really did not know what to say further than the uncomplicated exposition of his case that he wanted a wife and had found the very woman how then fathom jennys mood for delaying dr shrapnels exhortations were so worded as to induce her to comport herself like a scriptural woman humbly wakeful to the surpassing splendour of the high fortune which had befallen her in being so selected and obedient at a sign but she was it appeared that she was a maid of scaly vision not perceptive of the blessedness of her lot she could have been very little perceptive for she did not understand his casual allusion to beauchamps readiness to overcome a natural repugnance for the purpose of making her his wife up to the last moment before cecilia halkett left the deck of the esperanza to step on the pier jenny remained in vague but excited expectation of something intervening to bring cecilia and beauchamp together it was not a hope it was with pure suspense that she awaited the issue cecilia was pale beauchamp shook mr tuckham by the hand and said i shall not hear the bells but send me word of it will you and he wished them both all happiness the sails of the schooner filled on a fair frosty day with a light wind ruffling from the north west she swept away out of sight of bevisham and the island into the channel to within view of the coast of france england once below the water line alone with beauchamp and dr shrapnel jenny denham knew her fate as soon as that grew distinctly visible in shape and colour she ceased to be reluctant all about her in air and sea and unknown coast was fresh and prompting and if she looked on beauchamp the thoughtmy husband palpitated and destroyed and re made her rapidly she underwent her transformation from doubtfully minded woman to woman awakening clear eyed and with new sweet shivers in her temperate blood like the tremulous light seen running to the morn upon a quiet sea she fell under the charm of beauchamp at sea in view of the island of madeira jenny noticed that some trouble had come upon dr shrapnel and beauchamp both of whom had been hilarious during the gales but sailing into summer they began to wear that look which indicated one of their serious deliberations she was not taken into their confidence and after awhile they recovered partially the truth was they had been forced back upon old english ground by a recognition of the absolute necessity for her sake of handing themselves over to a parson in england possibly a civil marriage might have been proposed to the poor girl in a foreign island they would be driven not simply to accept the services of a parson but to seek him and solicit him otherwise the knot faster than any sailors in binding could not be tied decidedly it could not and how submit neither dr shrapnel nor beauchamp were of a temper to deceive the clerical gentleman only they had to think of jennys feelings alas for usthis our awful baggage in the rear of humanity these women who have not moved on their own feet one step since the primal mother taught them to suckle are perpetually pulling us backward on the march slaves of custom forms shows and superstitions they are slaves of the priests they are so in gratitude perchance as the matter works dr shrapnel admitted for at one period the priests did cherish and protect the weak from animal man but we have entered a broader daylight now when the sun of high heaven has crowned our structure with the flower of brain like him to scatter mists and penetrate darkness and shoot from end to end of earth and must we still be grinning subserviently to ancient usages and stale forms because of a baggage that it is woe to us too true we cannot cut ourselves loose from lydiard might say we are compelling the priests to fight and that they are compact foemen not always passive battle thenthe cry was valiant nevertheless jenny would certainly insist upon the presence of a parson in spite of her bridegrooms natural repugnance dr shrapnel offered to argue it with her being of opinion that a british consul could satisfactorily perform the ceremony beauchamp knew her too well moreover though tongue tied as to love making he was in a hurry to be married jennys eyes were lovely her smiles were soft the fair promise of her was in bloom on her face and figure he could not wait he must off to the parson then came the question as to whether honesty and honour did not impose it on them to deal openly with that gentle and on such occasions unobtrusive official by means of a candid statement to him overnight to the effect that they were the avowed antagonists of his church which would put him on his defence and lead to an argument that would accomplish his overthrow you parsons whose cause is good marshal out the poor of the land that we may see the sort of army your stewardship has gained for you what no army only women and hoary men and in the rear rank to support you as an institution none but fanatics cowards white eyeballed dogmatists timeservers money changers mockers in their sleeves what is this but the prospect of so completely confounding the unfortunate parson warned beauchamp that he might have a shot in his locker the parson heavily trodden on will turn i suppose we must be hypocrites he said in dejection dr shrapnel was even more melancholy he again offered to try his persuasiveness upon jenny beauchamp declined to let her be disturbed she did not yield so very lightly to the invitation to go before a parson she had to be wooed after all a harry hotspurs wooing three clergymen of the established church were on the island and where wont they be where theres fine scenery and comforts abound beauchamp said to the doctor ungratefully whether a celibate clergy ruins the faith faster than a non celibate i wont dispute replied the doctor but a non celibate interwinds with us and is likely to keep up a one storied edifice longer jenny hesitated she was a faltering unit against an ardent and imperative two in the council and beauchamp had shown her a letter of lady romfreys very clearly signifying that she and her lord anticipated tidings of the union marrying beauchamp was no simple adventure she feared in her bosom and resigned herself she had a taste of what it was to be at the conclusion of the service beauchamp thanked the good natured clergyman and spoke approvingly of him to his bride as an agreeable well bred gentlemanly person then fronting her and taking both her hands now my darling he said you must pledge me your word to this i have stooped my head to the parson and i am content to have done that to win you though i dont think much of myself for doing it i cant look so happy as i am and this idle ceremonyhowever i thank god i have you and i thank you for taking me but you wont expect me to give in to the parson again but nevil she said fearing what was to come they are gentlemen good men yes yes they are educated men nevil jenny jenny beauchamp theyre not men theyre churchmen my experience of the priest in our country is that he has abandonedhes dead against the only cause that can justify and keep up a church the cause of the poorthe people he is a creature of the moneyed class i look on him as a pretender i go through his forms to save my wife from annoyance but theres the end of it and if ever im helpless unable to resist him i rely on your word not to let him intrude hes to have nothing to do with the burial of me hes against the cause of the people very well i make my protest to the death against him when hes a christian instead of a churchman then may my example not be followed its little use looking for that jenny dropped some tears on her bridal day she sighed her submission so long as you do not change said she change cried nevil thats for the parson now its over we start fair my darling i have you i dont mean to bother you im sure youll see that the enemies of reason are the enemies of the human race you will see that i can wait if we can be sure that we ourselves are using reason rightly nevilnot prejudice of course but dont you see my jenny we have no interest in opposing reason but have we not all grown up together and is it just or wise to direct our efforts to overthrow a solid structure that is a part he put his legal right in force to shut her mouth telling her presently she might lydiardize as much as she liked while practising this mastery he assured her he would always listen to her yes whether she lydiardized or what dr shrapnel called jenny prated that is to say dear nevil that you have quite made up your mind to a toddling chattering little nursery wife very much the contrary to anything of the sort he declared and he proved his honesty by announcing an immediate reflection that had come to him how oddly things are settled cecilia halkett and tuckham you and i now i know for certain that i have brought cecilia halkett out of her womans toryism and given her at least liberal views and she goes and marries an arrant tory while you a bit of a tory at heart more than anything else have married an ultra perhaps we may hope that the conflict will be seasonable on both sidesif you give me fair play nevil as fair play as a womans lord could give her she was to have with which adieu to argumentation and controversy and all the thanks in life to the parson on a lovely island free from the seductions of care possessing a wife who instead of starting out of romance and poetry with him to the supreme honeymoon led him back to those forsaken valleys of his youth and taught him the joys of colour and sweet companionship simple delights a sister mind with a loveliness of person and nature unimagined by him beauchamp drank of a happiness that neither rene nor cecilia had promised his wooing of jenny beauchamp was a flattery richer than any the maiden jenny denham could have deemed her due and if his wonder in experiencing such strange gladness was quaintly ingenuous it was delicious to her to see and know full surely that he who was at little pains to court or please independently of the agency of the truth in him had come to be her lover through being her husband here i would stop it is beauchamps career that carries me on to its close where the lanterns throw their beams off the mudbanks by the black riverside when some few english men and women differed from the world in thinking that it had suffered a loss they sorrowed for the earl when tidings came to them of the loss of his child alive one hour in his arms rosamund caused them to be deceived as to her condition she survived she wrote to jenny bidding her keep her husband cruising lord romfrey added a brief word he told nevil that he would see no one for the present hoped he would be absent a year not a day less to render it the more easily practicable in the next packet of letters colonel halkett and cecilia begged them not to bring the esperanza home for the yachting season the colonel said his daughter was to be married in april and that bridegroom and bride had consented to take an old man off with them to italy perhaps in the autumn all might meet in venice and youve never seen venice beauchamp said to jenny everything is new to me said she penetrating and gladly joining the conspiracy to have him out of england dr shrapnel was not so compliant as the young husband where he could land and botanize as at madeira he let time fly and drum his wings on air but the cities of priests along the coast of portugal and spain roused him to a burning sense of that flight of time and the vacuity it told of in his labours greatly to his astonishment he found that it was no longer he and beauchamp against jenny but jenny and beauchamp against him what he cried to draw breath day by day and not to pay for it by striking daily at the rock iniquity are you for that beauchamp and in a land where these priests walk with hats curled like the water lilys leaf without the flower how far will you push indolent unreason to gain the delusion of happiness there is no such thing but theres trance that talk of happiness is a carrion clamour of the creatures of prey take itand youre helping tear some poor wretch to pieces whom you might be constructing saving perchance some one some thousands you beauchamp when i met you first you were for england england for a breadth of the palm of my hand comparativelythe round of a copper penny no wider and from that you jumped at a bound to the round of this earth you were for humanity ay we sailed our planet among the icy spheres and were at blood heat for its destiny you and i and now you hover for a wind to catch you so it is for a soul rejecting prayer this wind and that has it the well springs within are shut down fast i pardon my jenny my harry denhams girl she is a woman and has a brain like a bell that rings all round to the tongue it is her kingdom of the interdicted untraversed frontiers but what cares she or any woman that this age of ours should lie like a carcase against the sun what cares any woman to help to hold up life to him he breeds divinely upon life filthy upon stagnation sail you away if you will in your trance i go i go home by land alone and i await you here in this land of moles upright i do naught but execrate i am a pulpit of curses counter anathema you might call me oh i feel the comparison so for england shining spiritually bright said jenny and cut her husband adrift with the exclamation and saw him float away to dr shrapnel spiritually bright by comparison nevil theres neither spiritual nor political brightness in england but a common resolution to eat of good things and stick to them said the doctor and we two out of england theres barely a voice to cry scare to the feeders im back im home they lost him once in cadiz and discovered him on the quay looking about for a vessel in getting him to return to the esperanza they nearly all three fell into the hands of the police beauchamp gave him a great deal of his time reading and discussing with him on deck and in the cabin and projecting future enterprises to pacify his restlessness a translation of plato had become beauchamps intellectual world this philosopher singularly anticipated his ideas concerning himself he was beginning to think that he had many years ahead of him for work he was with dr shrapnel as to the battle and with jenny as to the delay in recommencing it both the men laughed at the constant employment she gave them among the greek islands in furnishing her severely accurate accounts of sea fights and land fights and the scenes being before them they could neither of them protest that their task work was an idle labour dr shrapnel assisted in fighting marathon and salamis over again cordiallyto shield great britain from the rule of a satrapy beauchamp often tried to conjure words to paint his wife on grave subjects she had the manner of speaking of a shy scholar and between grave and playful between smiling and serious her clear head her nobly poised character seemed to him to have never had a prototype and to elude the art of picturing it in expression until he heard lydiard call her whimsically portia disrobing portia half in her doctors gown half out of it they met lydiard and his wife louise and mr and mrs tuckham in venice where upon the first day of october jenny beauchamp gave birth to a son the thrilling mother did not perceive on this occasion the gloom she cast over the father of the child and dr shrapnel the youngster would insist on his right to be sprinkled by the parson to get a legal name and please his mother at all turns in the history of our healthy relations with women we are confronted by the parson and upon my word i believe beauchamp said to lydiard those parsonsnot bad creatures in private life there was one in madeira i took a personal liking tobut theyre utterly ignorant of what men feel to themmore ignorant than women mr tuckham and mrs lydiard would not listen to his foolish objections nor were they ever mentioned to jenny apparently the commission of the act of marriage was to force beauchamp from all his positions one by one the education of that child mrs lydiard said to her husband he considered that the mother would prevail cecilia feared she would not depend upon it hell make himself miserable if he can said tuckham that gentleman however was perpetually coming fuming from arguments with beauchamp and his opinion was a controversialists his common sense was much afflicted i thought marriage would have stopped all those absurdities he said glaring angrily laughing and then frowning ive warned him ill go out of my way to come across him if he carries on his headlong folly a man should accept his country for what it is when hes born into it dont tell me hes a good fellow i know he is but theres an ass mounted on the good fellow talks of the parsons why theyre men of education they couldnt steer a ship in a gale though oh hes a good sailor and let him go to sea said tuckham his wifes a prize hes hardly worthy of her if she manages him shell deserve a monument for doing a public service how fortunate it is for us that here and there we do not succeed in wresting our temporary treasure from the grasp of the fates this good old commonplace reflection came to beauchamp while clasping his wifes hand on the deck of the esperanza and looking up at the mountains over the gulf of venice the impression of that marvellous dawn when he and rene looked up hand in hand was ineffaceable and pity for the tender hand lost to him wrought in his blood but jenny was a peerless wife and though not in the music of her tongue or in subtlety of delicate meaning did she excel rene as a sober adviser she did and as a firm speaker and she had homelier deep eyes thoughtfuller brows the father could speculate with good hope of jennys child cecilias wealth too had gone over to the tory party with her incomprehensible espousal of tuckham let it go let all go for dowerless jenny it was she dared to recollect it in her anguish jennys choice to go home in the yacht that decided her husband not to make the journey by land in company with the lydiards the voyage was favourable beauchamp had a passing wish to land on the norman coast and take jenny for a day to tourdestelle he deferred to her desire to land baby speedily now they were so near home they ran past otley river having sight of mount laurels and on to bevisham with swelling sails there they parted beauchamp made it one of his points of honour to deliver the vessel where he had taken her at her moorings in the otley one of the piermen stood before beauchamp and saluting him said he had been directed to inform him that the earl of romfrey was with colonel halkett expecting him at mount laurels beauchamp wanted his wife to return in the yacht she turned her eyes to dr shrapnel it was out of the question that the doctor should think of going husband and wife parted she saw him no more this is no time to tell of weeping the dry chronicle is fittest hard on nine oclock in the december darkness the night being still and clear jennys babe was at her breast and her ears were awake for the return of her husband a man rang at the door of the house and asked to see dr shrapnel this man was killick the radical sam of politics he said to the doctor im going

beauchamps drowned dr shrapnel drove round by the shore of the broad water past a great hospital and ruined abbey to otley village killick had lifted him into the conveyance and he lifted him out dr shrapnel had not spoken a word lights were flaring on the river illuminating the small craft sombrely men women and children crowded the hard and landing places the marshy banks and the decks of colliers and trawlers neither killick nor dr shrapnel questioned them the lights were torches and lanterns the occupation of the boats moving in couples was the dragging for the dead o god lets find his body a woman called out just a word is it commander beauchamp killick said to her she was scarcely aware of a question here this one she said and plucked a little boy of eight by the hand close against her side and shook him roughly and kissed him an old man volunteered information thats the boy that boy was in his fathers boat out there with two of his brothers larking and he and another older than him fell overboard and just then commander beauchamp was rowing by and i saw him from off here where i stood jump up and dive and he swam to his boat with one of them and got him in safe that boy and he dived again after the other and was down a long time either he burst a vessel or he got cramp for hed been rowing himself from the schooner grounded down at the river mouth and must have been hot when he jumped in either way he fetched the second up and sank with him down he went a fisherman said to killick do you hear that voice thundering thats the great lord romfrey hes been directing the dragging since five o the evening and will till he drops or drowns or up comes the body o god lets find the body the woman with the little boy called out a torch lit up lord romfreys face as he stepped ashore the flood has played us a trick he said we want more drags or with the next ebb the body may be lost for days in this infernal water the mother of the rescued boy sobbed oh

i take you with me you must not be alone he put his arm within the arm of the heavily breathing man whom he had once flung to the ground to support him my lord my lord sobbed the woman and dropped on her knees whats this the earl said drawing his hand away from the womans clutch at it shes the mother my lord several explained to him mother of what my boy the woman cried and dragged the urchin to lord romfreys feet cleaning her boys face with her apron its the boy commander beauchamp drowned to save said a man all the lights of the ring were turned on the head of the boy dr shrapnels eyes and lord romfreys fell on the abashed little creature the boy struck out both arms to get his fists against his eyelids this is what we have in exchange for beauchamp it was not uttered but it was visible in the blank stare at one another of the two men who loved beauchamp after they had examined the insignificant bit of mudbank life remaining in this world in the place of him

and david widger widgercecometnet sandra belloni by george meredith book xxxiv indicates the degradation of brookfield together with certain proceedings of the yacht xxxv mrs chumps epistle xxxvi another pitfall of sentiment xxxvii emilias flight xxxviii she clings to her voice xxxix her voice fails chapter xxxiv lady charlotte was too late for emilia when she went forth to her to speak for wilfrid she found the youth braintop resting heavily against a tree muttering to himself that he had no notion where he was as an excuse for his stationary posture while the person he presumed he should have detained was being borne away near him a scrap of paper lay on the ground struck out of darkness by long slips of light from the upper windows thinking this might be something purposely dropped she took possession of it but a glance subsequently showed her that the writing was too fervid for a female hand or does the girl write in that way she thought she soon decided that it was wilfrid who had undone her work in the line of thirsty lovespeech how can a little fool read them and not believe any lie that he may tell she cried to herself she chose to say contemptuously its like a child proclaiming he is hungry that it was couched in bad taste she positively conceived taking the paper up again and again to correct her memory the termination your lover appeared to her if not laughable revolting she was uncertain in her sentiments at this point was it amusing or simply execrable some charity for the unhappy document lady charlotte found when she could say i suppose this is the general run of the kind of again was it she reflected and drank at the words again no she came to think men dont commonly write as he does whoever wrote this she had no doubt that it was wilfrid by fits her wrath was directed against him its villany she said but more and more frequently a crouching abject longing to call the words her ownto have them poured into her heart and braindesire for the intoxication of the naked speech of love usurped her spirit of pride until she read with envious tears half loathing herself but fascinated and subdued mine my angel you will see me tomorrowyour lover of jealousy she felt very littleher chief thought coming like a wave over her here is a man that can love she was a woman of chaste blood which spoke to her as shyly as a girls now that it was in tumult so indeed that pressing her heart she thought youth to have come back and feasted on the exultation we have when at an odd hour we fancy we have cheated time the sensation of youth and strength seemed to set a seal of lawfulness and naturalness hitherto wanting on her feeling for wilfrid i can help him she thought i know where he fails and what he can do i can give him position and be worth as much as any woman can be to a man thus she justified the direction taken by the new force in her two days later wilfrid received a letter from lady charlotte saying that she with a chaperon had started to join her brother at the yacht station according to appointment amazed and utterly discomfited he looked about for an escape but his father whose plea of sickness had kept him from pursuing emilia petulantly insisted that he should go down to lady charlotte adela was ready to go there were numbers either going or now on the spot and the net was around him cornelia held back declaring that her place was by her fathers side fine shades were still too dominant at brookfield for anyone to tell her why she stayed with anguish so deep that he could not act indifference wilfrid went on his miserable expeditionfirst setting a watch over mr pericles the which in connection with the electric telegraph was to enable him to join that gentleman speedily whithersoever he might journey he was not one to be deceived by the greeks mask in running down daily to brookfield a manoeuvre like that was poor and besides he had seen the sallow eyes give a twinkle more than once now on the besworth night georgiana ford had studied her brother merthyrs face when emilias voice called for wilfrid her heart was touched and in the midst of some little invidious wonder at the power of a girl to throw her attraction upon such a man she thought as she hoped that probably it was due to the girls italian blood merthyr was not unwilling to speak of her and say what he feared and desired for emilias sake and georgiana read by this mark of confidence how sincerely she was loved and trusted by him one never can have more than half of a mans heart she thoughtadding its our duty to deserve that nevertheless she was mystified say that merthyr loved a girl whom he certainly distinguished with some visible affection what sort of man must he be that was preferred to merthyr and this set georgiana at work thinking of wilfrid he has at times the air of a student he is one who trusts his own light too exclusively is he godless she concluded he is a soldier and an officer with brainsa good class rare also altogether though emilia did not elevate herself in this ladys mind by choosing wilfrid when she might have had merthyr the rivalry of the two men helped to dignify the one of whom she thought least might she have had merthyr georgiana would not believe itthat is to say she shut the doors and shot the bolts the knocking outside went on her brother had told her the whole circumstances of emilias life and position when he said do what you can for her she knew that it was not the common empty phrase young as she was simple in habits clear in mind open in all practices of daily life she was no sooner brought into an active course than astuteness and impetuosity combined wonderfully in her she did not tell merthyr that she had done anything to discover emilia and only betrayed that she was moving at all in a little conversation they had about a meeting at the house of his friend marini an italian exile possibly belloni goes there said merthyr i wonder whether marini knows anything of him they have a meeting every other night georgiana replied he went there and took his daughter the night after we were at besworth he took her to be sworn in still that old folly of marinis cried merthyr almost wrathfully he had some of the english objection to the mixingup of women in political matters georgiana instantly addressed herself to it he thinks that the country must be saved by its women as well as its men and if they have not brains and steadfast devotion he concludes that the country will not be saved but he gives them their share of the work and dearest has he had reason to repent it no merthyr was forced to admittaking shelter in his antipathy to the administration of an oath to women and consider that this is a girl the oaths of girls are sometimes more binding on them than the oaths of women true it affects their imaginations vividly but it seems childish does she have to kiss a sword and a book merthyr made a gesture like a shrug with a desponding grimace you know answered georgiana smiling that i was excused any formula by special exemption i have no idea of what is done water salt white thorns and other carbonaro mysteries may be in use or not i think no worse of the cause whatever is done i love the cause said merthyr i dislike this sort of conspiratorial masque marini and his chief indulge in i believe it sustains them and theres its only use i said georgiana love the cause only from association with it but in my opinion marini is right he deals with young and fervent minds that require a ceremony to keep them fastyes dear and women more than others do after that they cease to have to rely upon themselvesa reliance their good instinct teaches them is frail there now have i put my sex low enough she slid her head against her brothers shoulder if he had ever met a man worthy of her merthyr would have sighed to feel that all her precious love was his own is there any likelihood that belloni will be there tonight he asked she shook her head he has not been there since he went for that purpose perhaps marini is right after all said merthyr smiling georgiana knew what he meant and looked at him fondly but i have never bound you to an oath he resumed in the same tone i dare say you consider me a little different from most said georgiana she had as small reserve with her brother as vanity and could even tell him what she thought of her own worth without depreciating it after the fashion of chartered hypocrites mr powys wrote to marini to procure him an interview with belloni as early as possible and then he and georgiana went down to lady charlotte letters from adela kept the brookfield public informed of the doings on board the yacht before leaving home wilfrid with arabellas concurrence certainlyat her instigation as he thoughthad led his father to imagine on tolerably good grounds that mrs chump had quitted brookfield to make purchases for her excursion on lively waters and was then awaiting him at the appointed station one of the old mans intermittent nervous fits had frightened them into the quasifabrication of this little innocent tale the doctors words were that mr pole was to be crossed in nothingnot even if it should appear to be of imminent necessity that i should see him and he refuses the man of science stated that the malady originated in some long continued pressure of secret apprehension both wilfrid and arabella conceived that persuasion alone was wanted to send mrs chump flying to the yacht so they had less compunction in saying she is there and here began a terrible trial for the children of nine shades to save a father they had to lie grievouslyto continue the lie from day to day to turn it from a lie extensive and inappreciable to the lie minute and absolute then to get a particle of truth out of this monstrous lie they had to petition in utter humiliation the woman they had scorned that she would return among them and consider their house her own no answer came from mrs chump and as each day passed the querulous invalid still painfully acting the man in health had to be fed with fresh lies until at last writing of one of the scenes in brookfield arabella put down the word in all its unblessed aboriginal bluntness and did not ask herself whether she shrank from it lies she wrote what has happened to bella thought adela in pure wonder saltair and dazzling society kept all idea of penance from this vivacious young person it was queer that sit twickenham should be at the seaside instead of at brookfield wooing but a mans physical condition should be an excuse for any intermission of attentions now that i know him better wrote adela i think him the pink of chivalry and of this i am sure i can convince you bella c will be blessed indeed for a delicate nature in a man of the world is a treasure he has a beautiful little vessel of his own sailing beside us arabella was critic enough to smile at this last on the whole she was passably content for the moment in a severe fashion save to feel herself the dreadful lying engine and fruitlessly abject person that she had become we imagine that when souls have had a fall they immediately look up and contrast their present with their preceding position this does not occur the lower their fall the less generally their despair for despair is a business of the will and when they come heavily upon their humanity they get something of the practical seriousness of nature if they fall very low the shock and the sense that they are still on their feet make them singularly earnest to set about the plain plan of existencegetting air for their lungs and elbowroom contrast that mother of melancholy comes when they are some way advanced upon the upward scale the poles did not look up to their lost height but merely exerted their faculties to go forward and great as their ambition had been in them now that it was suddenly blown to pieces they did not sit and weep but strove in a stunned way to work ahead the truth is that we rarely indulge in melancholy until we can take it as a luxury little people never do and they when we have not put them on their guard are humankind naked the yachting excursions were depicted vividly by adela and were addressed as a sort of reproach to the lugubrious letters of her sister she said pointedly once really if we are to be miserable i turn catholic and go into a convent the strange thing was that arabella imagined her letters to be rather of a cheerful character she related the daily events at brookfieldthe change in her fathers soups and his remarks on them and which he preferred his fight with his medicine and declaration that he was as sound as any man on shore the health of the servants mr marter the curates call with a gregorian chant doubts of his orthodoxy cornelias lonely walks and singular appetite the bills and so forthending what is to be said further of her in return adelas delight was to date each day from a different port to which catching the wind the party had sailed and there slept the ladies were under the protecting wing of the hon mrs bayruffle a smooth woman of the world you think she must have sinned in her time but are certain it will never be known wrote adela i do confess kind as she is she does me much harm for when she is near me i begin to think that society is everything her tact is prodigious it is never seenonly felt i cannot describe her influence yet it leads to nothing i cannot absolutely respect her but i know i shall miss her acutely when we part what charm does she possess i call her the hon mrs heathencaptain g the hon mrs balm i know you hate nicknames be merciful to people yachting what are we to do i would look through a telescope all day and calculate the number of gulls and gannets we see but i am not so old as sir t and that occupation could not absorb me i begin to understand lady charlotte and her liking for mr powys better he is ready to play or be serious as you please but in either case merthyr is never a buffoon nor a parsonlady c remarked this morning and that describes him if it were not for the detestable fling at the clergy which she never misses it seems in her blood to think that all priests are hypocrites what a little boat to be in on a stormy sea bella she appears to have no concern about it whether she adores wilfrid or not i do not pretend to guess she snubs hima thing he would bear from nobody but her i do believe he feels flattered by it he is chiefly attentive to miss ford whom i like and do not like and like and do not likebut do like she is utterly cold and has not an affection on earth sir ti have not a dictionarycalls her a fair clictic i think let even cornelia read hard or woe to her in their hours of privacyhis vocabulary grows distressingly rich the more you know him i am not uneducated but he introduces me to words that seem monsters i must pretend to know them intimately well whether a clictic or notand pray burn this letter lest i should not have the word correctshe has the air of a pale young princess above any creature i have seen in the world i know it has struck wilfred also my darling and i are ever twins in sentiment he converses with miss ford a great deal lady c is peculiarly civil to captain g we scud along and are becalmed having no will of our own we have no knowledge of contrary winds as mr powys saysthe word is eclictic i find i ventured on it and it was repeated and i heard that i had missed a syllable ask c to look it outi mean to tell me they mining on a little slip of paper in your next i would buy a pocketdictionary at one of the ports but you are never alone aesthetic we know mr barrett used to be of service for this sort of thing i admit i am inferior to mrs bayruffle who if men talk difficult words in her presence holds her chin above the conversation and seems to shame them i love to learni love the humility of learning and there is something divine in the idea of a teacher i listen to sir t on parliament and parties and chide myself if my interest flags his algebrapuzzles or euclidpuzzles in figuressometimes about sheepboys and sheep and hurdles or geese oxen or anythingare delicious he quite masters the conversation with them i disagree with mrs bayruffle when she complains that they are posts in the way of speech there is a use in all men and though she is an acknowledged tactician materially she cannot see she has in sir t a quality necessary to intellectual conversation if she knew how to employ it remarks of this nature read very oddly to arabella insomuch that she would question herself at times in forced seriousness whether she had dreamed that an evil had befallen brookfield or whether adela were forgetting that it had in a dream one day she enclosed a letter from her father to mrs chump adela did not forge a reply but she had the audacity to give the words of a message from the woman in which mrs chump was supposed to say that she could not write while she was being tossed about we must carry it on adela told her sister with horrible bluntness the message savoured strongly of mrs chump it was wickedly clever arabella resolved to put it by but morning after morning she saw her fathers anxiety for the reply mounting to a pitch of fever she consulted with cornelia who said no never do such a thing and subsequently with a fainter firmness repeated the negative monosyllable arabella in her wretchedness became endued with remorseless discernment it means that cornelia would never do it herself she thought and comforted haply by reflecting that for their common good she could do it she did it she repeated an irish message her father calmed immediately making her speak it over twice he smiled and blinked his birdseyes pleasurably ah thats martha he said and fell into a state of comparative repose for some hours a sensation of bubbling hotwater remained about the sera of arabella happily mrs chump in person did not write a correspondence now commenced between the fictitious mrs chump on sea and mr pole dyspeptic in his armchair arabella took the doctor aside to ask him if in a hypothetical instance it would really be dangerous to thwart or irritate her father she asked the curate if he deemed it wicked to speak falsely to an invalid for the invalids benefit the spiritual and bodily doctors agreed that occasion altered and necessity justified certain acts so far there was comfort but the task of assisting in this correspondence and yet more the contemplation of adelas growing delight in it she would now use irish words vulgar words words expressive of physical facts airing her natural wit in irish as if she had found a new weapon became a bitter strain on arabellas mind and she was compelled to make cornelia take her share of the burden but i cannot conceali cannot feign said cornelia arabella looked at her whom she knew to be feigning thinking must i lose my high esteem of both my sisters action alone saved her from denuding herself of this garment that night was now the allusion to the scene at besworth it stood for all the misery they suffered nor could they see that they had since made any of their own a letter with the dover postmark brought exciting news a debate had been held on board the yacht wilfrid and lady charlotte gave their votes for the devon coast all were ready to be off when miss ford received a telegram from shore and said no it must be dover now mrs chumps villa was on the devon coast lady charlotte had talked to wilfrid about her and in the simplest language had said that she must be got on board this was the reason of their deciding for devon but georgiana stood for dover thither merthyr said that he must go whether be sailed or went on land by a simultaneous reading of georgianas eyes both wilfrid and lady charlotte saw what was meant by her decision wilfrid at once affected to give way halfprotestingly and this wrote adela taught me that he was well pleased to abandon the west for the east lady c favoured him with a look such as i could not have believed i should ever behold off the stage there was a perfect dagger in her eyes she fought against dover do men feel such compliments as these they are the only true ones she called the captain to witness that the wind was not for dover she called the mate she was really eloquentyes and handsome i think wilfrid thought so or the reason far the opposition to dover impressed my brother i like him to be made to look foolish for then he retrieves his character so dashinglyalways his face was red and he seemed undecidedwasuntil one taunt it must have been a taunt roused him up they exchanged about six sentencesthese two i cannot remember them unhappily but for neatness and irony never was anything so delicious heard they came sharp as fencingthrusts and you could really believe if you liked that they were merely stating grounds for diverse opinions of course we sailed east reaching dover at ten and the story is thisi knew emilia was in ittracy runningbrook had been stationed at dover ten days by miss ford to intercept emilias father if he should be found taking her to the continent by that route he waited and met them at last on the esplanade he telegraphed to miss ford and a signor marini we were wrong in not adding illustrious exiles to our list while he invited them to dine and detained them till the steamboat was starting and signor marini came down by rail in a great hurry and would not let emilia be taken away there was a quarrel but by some mysterious power that he possesses this signor marini actually prevented the father from taking his child mysterious but is anything more mysterious than emilias influence i cannot forget what she was ere we trained her and when i think that we seem to be allall who come near herconnected with her fortunes explain it if you can i know it is not her singing i know it is not her looks captivations she does not deal in is it the magic of indifference no for then some one whom you know and who longs to kiss her bella bella now would be dangerous she is very little so believe me emilia is am i chronicling a princessshe is in london with signor marini and wilfrid has not seen her lady charlotte managed to get the first boat full and pushed off as he was about to descend i pitied his poor trembling hand i went on shore in the second boat with him we did not find the others for an hour when we heard that emilia had gone with signor m the next day whom should we sea but mr pericles he i have never seen him so civilhe shook wilfrid by the hand almost like an englishman and wilfrid too though he detests him was civil to him and even laughed when he said here it is dull ze continent for a week i follow philomelaze nightingales i was just going to say well then you are running away from one wilfrid pressed my fingers and taught me to be still and i did not know why till i reflected poor mr pericles seeing him friendly for the first time rubbed his hands and it was most painful to me to see him shake hands with wilfrid again and again till he was on board the vessel chuckling wilfrid suddenly laughed with all his mighta cruel laugh and mr pericles tried to be as loud but commenced coughing and tapping his chest to explain that his intention was good bella the passion of love must be judged by the person who inspires it and i cannot even go so far as to feel pity for wilfrid if he has stooped to the humiliation ofthere is another way of regarding it know let him be sincere and noble but not his own victim he scarcely holds up his head we are now for devon tracy is with us and we never did a wiser thing than when we decided to patronize poets if kept in orderunderthey are the aristocracy of light conversationalists adieu we speed for beautiful devon me love to pole and im just etc that will do this time next she will speak herself that i should wish it but the world is full of change as i begin to learn what will ensue chapter xxxv when mrs chump had turned her back on brookfield the feelings of the outcast woman were too deep for much distinctly acrimonious sensation toward the ladies but their letters soon lifted and revived her until being in a proper condition of prickly wrath she sat down to compose a reply that should bury them under a mountain of shame the point however was to transfer this mountain from her bosom which laboured heavily beneath it to their heads nothing could appear simpler here is the mountain the heads are yonder accordingly she prepared to commence in a moment the difficulty yawned monstrous for the mountain she felt was not a mountain of shame yet that was the character of mountain she wished to cast if she crushed them her reputation as a forgiving soul might suffer she could not pardon without seeing them abased thus shaken at starting she found herself writing i know that your father has been hearing tales told of me or he would have written and he has not so you shall never see me not if you cried to me from the next worldthe hot part perusing this it was too tremendous oh thats awful she said getting her body a little away from the manuscript ye couldnt curse much louder a fresh trial found her again rounding the fact that mr pole had not written to her and again flying into consequent angers she had some dim conception of the sculpture of an offended goddess i look so she said before the glass im above ye and ye cant hurt me and dont come anigh me but heres a chequeand may ye be haunted in your dreamsbut heres a cheque there was pain in her heart for she had felt faith in mr poles affection for her and he said she cried out in her lonely roomhe said martha yeve onnly to come and be known to m and then theyll take to the ideea and wasnt i a patient creature and its pole thats turnedpole varied with the frequent oh and augh these dramatic monologues occupied her time while the yacht was sailing for her devon bay at last the thought struck her that she would send for braintop telegraphing that expenses would be paid and that he must come with a good quill it goes faster she whispered suggesting the pentup torrent as it were of blackest ink in her breast that there was to pour forth a very cunning postscript to the telegram brought braintop almost as quick to her as a return message it was merely little belloni she had forgotten this piece of artifice but when she saw him start at the opening of the door keeping a sheepish watch in that direction bynby she said with a nod and shortly afterward unfolded her object in summoning him from his london labours a widdewoman ought to get marrud mr braintop if onnly to have a husband to write letters for rr now thats a task but sup tonight and mind ye say yer prayers before gettin into bed and no tryin to flatter your maker with your knees cuddled up to your chin under the counterpane i do t myself sometimes and i know one prayer out of beds worrth ten of m in then ill pray too and mayhap well get permission and help to write our letter tomorrow though sunday as ye say on the morrow braintops spirits were low he having perceived that the little belloni postscript had been but an irish chuckle and nudge in his ribs by way of sly insinuation or reminder he looked out on the sea and sighed to be under certain white sails visible in the offing mrs chump had received by the mornings post another letter from arabella enclosing one for wilfrid a dim sense of approaching mastery and that she might soon be melted combined with the continued silence of mr pole to make her feel yet more spiteful she displayed no commendable cunning when to sharpen and fortify braintops wits she plumped him at breakfast with all things tempting to the appetite of man ill help ye to rr she said from time to time finding that no encouragement made him potent in speech fronting the sea a desk was laid open on it were the quills faithfully brought down by braintop poles own quills she said having fixed braintop in this official seat while she took hers at a station halfcommanding the young clerks face the mighty breakfast had given braintop intolerable desire to stretch his limbs by the sounding shore and enjoy life in semioblivion he cheered himself with the reflection that there was only one letter to write so he remarked politely that he was at his hostesss disposal thereat mrs chump questioned him closely whether mr pole had spoken her name aloud and whether he did it somehow now and then by accident and whether he had looked worse of late braintop answered the latter question first assuring her that mr pole was improving then theres no marcy from me said mrs chump and immediately discharged an exclamatory narrative of her recent troubles and the breach between herself and brookfield at braintops ears this done she told him that he was there to write the reply to the letters of the ladies in her name begin she said yeve got head enough to guess my feelins im invited and i wont gotill im fetched but dont say that thats their guess ye know and i dont care for ye enough to be angry at all but its pity i feel at a parcel of fine garlsso on mr braintop the perplexities of epistolary correspondence were assuming the like proportions to the recruited secretary that they had worn to mrs chump steadily watching his countenance she jogged him thus as if ye couldnt help ut ye know ye begin jest like wakin in the mornin after dancin all night ye make the garls seem to hear me seemin to sayoooo i was so comfortable before your disturbin me with your horrud voices ye understand mr braintop im in bed and youre a cold bath begin like that ye know heres clover and youre nettles dye see here from my glass o good porrt to your tumbler of horrud acud vingar bless the boy he dont begin she stamped her foot braintop in desperation made a plunge at the paper looking over his shoulder in a delighted eagerness she suddenly gave it a scornful push dear she exclaimed youre dearin them absurd young man im not the woman to i dear emnot at the starrt im indignantim hurrt i come round to the dear byandby after i have whipped each of the proud sluts and their brother mr wilfrid just as if by accident yell promus to forget avery secret i tell ye but our way is always to pretend to believe the men cant help themselves so the men look like fools ye sly laughin fella and the women horrud scheming spiders now away with ye and no dearin the sundaybells sounded mockingly in braintops ears appearing to ask him how he liked his holiday and the white sails on the horizon line have seldom taunted prisoner more he spread out another sheet of notepaper and wrote my and there he stopped mrs chump was again at his elbow but they arent my she remonstrated when ive nothin to do with m and a my has a dear to t always yere not awake mr braintop try again shall i begin formally mrs chump presents her compliments maam said braintop stiffly and i stick myself up on a post and talk like a parrot sir dont you see im familiar and im woundud go along try again braintops next effort was ladies but they dont behave to me like ladus and its against my conscience to call em said mrs chump with resolution braintop wrote down women in the very irony of disgust and avery one of em unmarred garls exclaimed mrs chump throwing up her hands mr braintop mr braintop yere next to an ejut braintop threw dawn the pen i really do not know what to say he remarked rising in distress i naver had such a desire to shake anny man in all my life said mrs chump dropping to her chair the posture of affairs was chimed to by the monotonous bell after listening to it for some minutes mrs chump was struck with a notion that braintops sinfulness in working on a sunday or else the shortness of the prayer he had put up to gain absolution was the cause of his lack of ready wit hearing that he had gloves she told him to go to church listen devoutly and return to luncheon braintop departed with a sensation of relief in the anticipation of a sermon quite new to him when he next made his bow to his hostess he was greeted by a pleasant sparkle of refreshments mrs chump herself primed him with sherry thinking in the cunning of her heart that it might haply help the inspiration derived from his devotional exercise after this pen and paper were again produced well now mr braintop and what have ye thought of said mrs chump encouragingly braintop thought rapidly over what he might possibly have been thinking of and having put a file of ideas into the past said with the air of a man who delicately suggests a subtlety it has struck me maam that perhaps girls might begin very well to be sure dear girls is the best if you would consent to it take another glass of wine mr braintop mrs chump nodded yere nearer to ut now garls is what they are at all events but dont you see my dear your man it isnt the real thing we want so much as a sort of a proud beginnin shorrt of slappin their faces think of dinner furrst soup that prepares ye for whats comin then fish which is on the road to meat dye seewe pepper em then joint mr braintopout we burrst oh and what inslent hussies yeve been to me and yell naver see annything of me but my back then the sweetsbut im a forgivin woman and a christian in the bargain ye ungrateful minxes and if ye really are sorrowful and there mr braintop yeve got it all laid out as flat as a pancake mrs chump gave the motion of a lightning scrawl of the pen braintop looked at the paper which now appeared to recede from his eyes and flourish like a descending kite the nature of the task he had undertaken became mountainous in his imagination till at last he fixed his forehead in his thumbs and fingers and resolutely counted a number of meaningless words one hundred times as this was the attitude of a severe student mrs chump remained in expectation aware of the fearful confidence he had excited in her braintop fell upon a fresh hundred with variations the truth is i think better in church he said disclosing at last as ingenuous a face as he could assume he scarcely ventured to hope for a second dismissal to his joy mrs chump responded with a sigh there go again and the lord forgive ye for directin your mind to temporal matters when yere there its none of my doin remember that and dont be tryin to make me a particpator in your wickudness this is so difficult maam because you wont begin with dear he observed snappishly as he was retiring of coorse its difficult if it bothers me retorted mrs chump divided between that view of the case and contempt of braintop for being on her own level do you see we are not to say dear anything or ladies orin short really if you come to think maam is that a womans business mr braintop said mrs chump as from a height and the youth retired in humiliation braintop was not destitute of the ambition of his time of life and yearned to be what he believed himselfsomething better than a clerk if he had put forth no effort to compose mrs chumps letter he would not have felt that he was the partner of her stupidity but he had thoughtlessly attempted the impossible thing and now contemplating his utter failure he was in so low a state of mind that he would have taken pen and written himself down with ordinary honesty goodfornothing he returned to his task and found the dinner spread mrs chump gave him champagne and drank to him requesting him to challenge her we wont be beaten she said and at least they dined the we smote braintops swelling vanity it signified an alliance and that they were yoked to a common difficulty oh lets finish it and have it over he remarked with a complacent roll in his chair naver stop a good impulse said mrs chump herself removing the lamp to light him braintop sat in the chair of torture and wrote flowingly while his taskmistress looked over him ladies of brookfield he read it out ladies of brookfield ill be vary happy to represent ye at the forthcomin lection mrs chump gave a continuation in his tone why wont that do maam braintop asked in wonderment captal for a circular mr braintop and yell allow me to say that i dont think yeve been to church at all this accusation containing a partial truth that is true if it referred to the afternoon but not as to the morning it was necessary for braintops selfvindication that he should feel angry the two were very soon recriminating much in the manner of boy and girl shut up on a sunny afternoon after which they in like manner made it upthe fact of both having a habit of consulting the glass and the accident of their doing it at the same time causing an encounter of glances there that could hardly fail to be succeeded by some affability for a last effort mrs chump laid before braintop a prospect of advancement in his office if he so contrived as to write a letter that should land her in brookfield among a scourged repentant and forgiven people that he might understand the position she went far modestly to reveal her weakness for mr pole she even consented to let ladies be the opening apostrophe provided the word young went before it theyll feel that sting she said braintop stipulated that she should not look till the letter was done and observing his pen travelling the lines in quick succession mrs chump became inspired by a great but uneasy hope she was only to be restrained from peeping by braintops petulant pray maam which sent her bouncing back to her chair with a face upon one occasion too solemn for braintops gravity he had written himself into excellent spirits and happening to look up as mrs chump retreated from his shoulder the womans comic reverence for his occupationthe prim movement of her lips while she repeated mutely the words she supposed he might be penningtouched him to laughter at once mrs chump seized on the paper young ladus she read aloud yours of the nd the th and st ulto the ffection i bear to your onnly remaining parent her enunciation waxed slower and significantly staccato toward a pause the composition might undoubtedly have issued from a merchants office and would have done no discredit to the establishment when the pause came braintop half for an opinion and to encourage progress said yes maam and with there sir mrs chump crumpled up the paper and flung it at him and there sir she tossed a pen hearing braintop mutter ladylike behaviour mrs chump came out in a fiery bloom ye detestable young fella oh ye young deceiver ye cannt do the work of a man oh and heres another woman dispointed and when she thought shed got a man to write her letters braintop rose and retorted yere false mr braintopyere offensuv sir said mrs chump and braintop instantly retired upon an expressive bow when he was out of the room mrs chump appealed spitefully to an audience of chairs but when she heard the frontdoor shut with a report she jumped up in terror crying incredulously is the young man postively one oh and me alone in a ragethe contemplated horrors of which position set her shouting vociferously mr braintop sounded over the stairs and mr braintop into the street the maid brought mrs chump her bonnet night had fallen and nothing but the greatest anxiety to recover braintop would have tempted her from her house she made halfadozen steps and then stopped to mutter oh if yed onnly come id forgive yeindeed i would well here i am was instantaneously answered her waist was clasped and her forehead was kissed the madness of braintops libertinism petrified her yeve taken such a liberty sir deed yeve forgotten yourself while she was speaking she grew confused with the thought that braintop had mightily altered both his voice and shape when on the doorstep he said come out of the darkness or upon my honour i shall behave worse she recognized wilfrid and understood by his yachting costume in what manner he had come he gave her no time to think of her dignity or her wrath lady charlotte is with me i sleep at the hotel but you have no objection to receive her have you this set her mind upon her best bedroom her linen and the fitness of her roof to receive a title then in a partial fit of gratitude for the honour and immense thankfulness at being spared the task of the letter she fell on wilfrids shoulder beginning to sobtill he in alarm at his absurd position suggested that lady charlotte awaited a welcome mrs chump immediately flew to her drawingroom and rang bells appearing presently with a lamp which she set on a gardenpillar together they stood by the lamp a spectacle to ocean but no lady charlotte drew near chapter xxxvi though mrs chump and wilfrid as they stood by the light of the lamp saw no one they themselves were seen lady charlotte had arranged to give him a moment in advance to make his peace she had settled it with that air of practical sense which her title made graceful to him i will follow and i dare say i can complete what you leave unfinished she said her humorous sense of the aristocratic prestige was conveyed to him in a very taking smile he scarcely understood why she should have planned so decisively to bring about a reconciliation between mrs chump and his family still as it now chimed perfectly with his own views and wishes he acquiesced in her scheme giving her at the same time credit for more than common wisdom while lady charlotte lingered on the beach she became aware of a figure that hung about her as she was moving away a voice of one she knew well enough asked to be directed to the house inhabited by mrs chump the lady was more startled than it pleased her to admit to herself dont you know me she said bluntly you went emilias voice why on earth are you here what brings you here are you alone returned the lady emilia did not answer what extraordinary expedition are you making but tell me one thing are you here of your own accord or at somebody elses bidding impatient at the prospect of a continuation of silences lady charlotte added come with me emilia seemed to be refusing the appointment was made at that house i know said the lady but if you come with me you will see him just as readily at this instant the lamp was placed on the pillar showing wilfrid in his sailors hat and overcoat beside the fluttering irishwoman come i must speak to you first said lady charlotte hurriedly thinking that she saw emilias hands stretch out pray dont go into attitudes there he is as you perceive and i dont use witchcraft come with me i will send for him havent you learnt by this time that theres nothing he detests so much as a public display of the kind youre trying to provoke emilia half comprehended her he changes when hes away from me she said low toneless voice less than i fancied the lady thought then she told emilia that there was really no necessity for her to whine and be miserable she was among friends and so forth the simplicity of her manner of speech found its way to emilias reason quicker than her arguments and in the belief that wilfrid was speaking to mrs chump on urgent private matters she had great awe of the word business emilia suffered herself to be led away she uttered twice a little exclamation as she looked back that sounded exceedingly comical to lady charlottes ears they were the repressions of a poignant outcry doggies make that noise thought the lady and succeeded in feeling contemptuous wilfrid when he found that lady charlotte was not coming bestowed a remark upon her sex and went indoors for his letter he considered it politic not to read it there mrs chump having grown so friendly and even motherly that she might desire out of pure affection to share the contents he put it by and talked gaily till mrs chump partly to account for the defection of the lady observed that she knew they had a quarrel she was confirmed in this idea on a note being brought in to him over which before opening it he frowned and flushed aware of the treachery of his countenance he continued doing so after his eyes had taken in the words though there was no special ground furnished by them for any such exhibition mrs chump immediately with a gaze of mightiest tribulation burst out ill help ye pon my honour ill help ye oh the arrstocracy oh their pride but if i say my dear when i die which its so horrud to think of youll have a share and the biggestthis vary cottage and a good parrt o the bank property shell come down at that and if ye marry a lady of title ill be s good as my word i will wilfrid pressed her fingers can you ever believe that i have called you a simmering pot of emerald broth my dear annything thats lots o words ye may call me returned mrs chump as long as its no name ye wont call me a name will ye lots o wordsits onnly as if ye peppered me and i sneeze and thats all but a name sticks to yer back like a bit o pinned paper dont call me a name and she wriggled pathetically yes said wilfrid i shall call you pole oh ye sweetest of young fellas mrs chump threw out her arms she was on the point of kissing him but he fenced with the open letter and learning that she might read it she gave a cry of joy dear w she begins and its twice dear from a lady of title shes just a multiplicationtable for annything she says and touches dear w and the shorter time a single you the better ill have my joke mr wilfrud dear w bless her heart now i seem to like her next best to

and deed i am a simmerin pot for shell be a relation my dear go to r ill have your bed ready for ye here at the end of an hour and tomorrrow perhaps if lady charlotte can spare me ill condescend to see adla wilfrid fanned her cheek with the note and then dropped it on her neck and left the room he was soon hurrying on his way to the dolphin midway he stopped there may be a bad shot in bellas letter he thought shoplights were ahead a very luminous chemist sent a green ray into the darkness wilfrid fixed himself under it confoundedly appropriate for a man reading that his wife has run away from him he muttered and hard quickly plunged into matter quite as absorbing when he had finished it he shivered thus it ran my beloved brother i bring myself to plain words happy those who can trifle with human language papa has at last taken us into his confidence he has not spoken distinctly he did us the credit to see that it was not necessary if in our abyss of grief we loss delicacy what is leftwhat the step he desired to take which we opposed he has anticipated and must consummate oh wilfrid you see it do you not you comprehend me i am surf i should have said had anticipated how to convey to you but it would be unjust to himto ourselveswere i to say emphatically what i have not yet a right to think what i have hinted above is after all nothing but cornelias conjecture i wish i could not say confirmed by mine we sat with papa two hours before any idea of his meaning dawned upon us he first scolded us we both saw from this that more was to come i hope there are not many in this world to whom the thought of honour being tied to money ever appears possible if it is so there is wide sufferingdeep for it must be silent cornelia suggests one comfort for them that they will think less of poverty why was brookfield ever bought our old peaceful citylifethe vacant sundaysmy ears are haunted by their bells for evening service i said there they go the dowdy population of heaven i remember it now it should be almost punishment enough to be certain that of all those people going to church there cannot be one more miserable than we who stood at the old window ridiculing them they at least do not feel that everything they hope for in human life is dependent upon one human will the will of a mortal weathervane it is the case and it must be conciliated there is no halfmeasureno choice feel that nothing you have ever dreamed of can be a disgrace if it is undergone to forestall what positively impends and act immediately i shall expect to see you in three days she is to have the southwest bedroom mine for which she expressed a preference prepare every mind for the ceremonyan old mans infatuationmoneywe submit it will take place in town to have the tinleys in the church but this is certainly my experience that misfortune makes me feel more and more superior to those whom i despise i have even asked myselfwas i so once and apropos of laura we hear that their evenings are occupied in performing the scene at besworth they are still as distant as ever from richford let me add that albert tinley requested my hand in marriage yesterday i agree with cornelia that this is the first palpable sign that we have sunk consequent upon the natural consequences came the interview with papa dearest dearest wilfrid can you can i can any one of us settlethat is involve another life in doubt while doubt exists papa insists his argument is now now and no delay i accuse nothing but his love excessive love is perilous for principle you have understood me i know and forgiven me for writing so nakedly i dare not reperuse it you must satisfy him that lady c has fixed a date adela is incomprehensible one day she sees a friend in lady c and again it is an enemy papas immediate state of health is not alarming above all things do not let the girl come near him papa will send the cheque you required when wilfrid burst out upon arabellas affectionate signature when will he send it he doesnt do me the honour to mention the time and this is his reply to a third application the truth was that wilfrid was in dire want of tangible cash simply to provision his yacht the light kindled in him by this unsatisfied need made him keen to comprehend all that arabellas attempt at plain writing designed to unfold good god my fathers the womans trustee shaped itself in wilfrids brain and next if he marries her we may all be as poor as before that is to say honour may be saved without ruin being averted his immediate pressing necessity struck like a pulse through all the chords of dismal conjecture his heart flying about for comfort dropped at emilias feet bellas right he said reverting to the green page in his hand we cant involve others in our scrape whatever it may be he ceased on the spot to be at war with himself as he had been for many a day by which he was taught to imagine that he had achieved a mental indifference to misfortune this lightened his spirit considerably so theres an end of that he emphasized as the resolve took form to tell lady charlotte flatly that his father was ruined and that the son therefore renounced his particular hope and aspiration she will say in the most matteroffact way in the world oh very well that quite alters the case said wilfrid aloud with the smallest infusion of bitterness then he murmured poor old governor and wondered whether emilia would come to this place according to his desire love that had lain crushed in him for the few recent days sprang up and gave him the thought she may be here now but his eyes not being satiated instantly with a sight of her the possibility of such happiness faded out blessed little woman he cried openly ashamed to translate in tenderer terms the soft fresh blossom of love that his fancy conjured forth at the recollection of her he pictured to himself hopefully moreover that she would be shy when they met a contradictory vision of her eyes lifted hungry for his first words or the pressure of his arm displeased him slightly it occurred to him that they would be characterized as a singular couple to combat this he drew around him all the mysteries of sentiment that had issued from her voice and her eyes she had made earth lovely to him and heaven human shewhat a grief for ever that her origin should be what it was for this reasonlovers must live like ordinary people outwardly and say ye fates how had she been educated to direct a gentlemens household i cant exist on potatoes he pronounced humorously but when his thoughts began to dwell with fitting seriousness on the womanoftheworld tone to be expected from lady charlotte he folded the mental image of emilia closely to his breast and framed a misty idea of a little lighted cottage wherein she sat singing to herself while he was campaigning two or three fellowslumley and fredericksshall see her he thought the rest of his brother officers were not even to know that he was married his yacht was lying in a strip of moonlight near sir twickenhams companion yawl he gave one glance at it as at a history finished and sent up his name to lady charlotte ah you havent brought the good old dame with you she said rising to meet him i thought it better not to see her tonight he acquiesced mentioning the lateness of the hour and adding you are alone she stared and let fall certainly and then laughed i had forgotten your regard for the proprieties i have just sent my maid for georgiana she will sleep here i preferred to come here because those people at the hotel tire me and besides i said i should sleep at the villa and i never go back to people who dont expect me wilfrid looked about the room perplexed and almost suspicious because of his unexplained perplexity her as he deemed itnot much above the level of mrs chump in that respect aristocratic indifference to opinion and conventional social observances would have pleased him by daylight but it fretted him now lady charlottes maid came in to say that miss ford would join her the maid was dismissed to her bed theres nothing to do there said her mistress as she was moving to the foldingdoors the window facing seaward was open he went straight to it and closed it next in an apparent distraction he went to the foldingdoors he was about to press the handle when lady charlottes quiet remark my bedroom brought him back to his seat crying pardon have you had news she inquired you thought that a letter might be there bad is it it is not good he replied briefly i am sorry that isit tells me wilfrid disciplined his tongue that iwe area lieutenant on halfpay may say that he is ruined i suppose when his other supplies are cut off i can excuse him for thinking it said lady charlotte she exhibited no sign of eagerness for his statement of facts her outward composure and a hard animation of countenance which having ceased the talking within himself he had now leisure to notice humiliated him the sting helped him to progress i may try to doubt it as much as i please to avoid seeing what must follow i may shut my eyes in the dark but when the light stares me in the facei give you my word that i have not been justified even in imagining such a catastrophe the preamble is awful said lady charlotte rising from her recumbent posture pardon me i have no right to intrude my feelings i learn today for the first time that we areare ruined she did not lift her eyebrows or look fixedly but without any change at all said is there no doubt about it none whatever this was given emphatically resentment at the perfect realization of her anticipated worldly indifference lent him force ruined she said yes you ill be more so than you were a month ago i mean you tell me nothing new i have known it amid the crush and hurry in his brain caused by this strange communication pressed the necessity to vindicate his honour i give you the word of a gentleman lady charlotte that i came to you the first moment it has been made known to me i never suspected it before this day nothing would prompt me to disbelieve that she reached him her hand you have known it he broke from a short silence yesnever mind how i could not allude to it of course i had to wait till you took the initiative the impulse to think the best of what we are on the point of renouncing is spontaneous if at the same time this object shall exhibit itself in altogether new undreamtof glorious colours others besides a sentimentalist might waver and be in some danger of clutching it a little tenderly ere it is cast off my duty was to tell you the very instant it came to my knowledge he said fascinated in his heart by the display of greatness of mind which he now half divined to be approaching and wished to avoid well i suppose that is a duty between friends said she between friends shall we stillalways be friends i think i have said more than once that it wont be my fault if we are not because the greater and happier ambition to which i aspired this was what he designed to say sentimentally propelled by way of graceful exit and what was almost printed on a scroll in his head for the tongue to read off fluently he stopped at the greater beginning to stumble to flounder and fearing that he said less than was due as a compliment to the occasion he said more by no means a quick reader of character lady charlotte nevertheless perceived that the man who spoke in this fashion after what she had confessed must be sentimentally if not actually playing double thus she came to his assistance are you begging permission to break our engagement at least whatever i do get i must beg for now he took refuge adroitly in a foolish reply and it served him that he had in all probability lost his chance by the method he had adopted and by sentimentalizing at the wrong moment was becoming evident notwithstanding in a sort of despair he attempted comfort by critically examining her features and trying to suit them to one or other of the numerous models of love that a young man carries about with him her eyes met his and even as he was deciding against her on almost every point the force of their frankness held his judgement in suspense the world is rather harsh upon women in these cases she said turning her head a lithe with a conscious droop of the eyelids i will act as if we had an equal burden between us on my side what you have to tell me does not alter me i have known it you see that i am just the same to you for your part you are free if you please that is fair dealing is it not the gentlemans mechanical assent provoked the ladys smile but wilfrid was torn between a profound admiration of her and the galling reflection that until she had named the engagement none had virtually existed which diplomacy aided by time and accident might not have stopped you must be aware that i am portionless she continued i havelet me name the suma thousand pounds it is some credit to me that i have had it five years and not spent it some men would think that a quality worth double the amount well you will make up your mind to my bringing you no moneyi have a few jewels en revanche my habits are not expensive i like a horse but i can do without one i like a large house and can live in a small one i like a french cook and can dine comfortably off a single dish society is very much to my taste i shall indulge it when i am whipped at home wilfrid took her hand and pressed his lips to the fingers keeping his face ponderingly down he was again so divided that the effort to find himself absorbed all his thinking faculties at last he muttered a lieutenants payexpecting her to reply we can wait as girls do that find it pleasant to be adored by curates then might follow a meditative pausea short gaze at her from which she could have the option of reflecting that to wait is not the privilege of those who have lived to acquire patience the track he marked out was clever in a poor way perhaps it was not positively unkind to instigate her to look at her age but though he read character shrewdly and knew hers pretty accurately he was himself too much of a straw at the moment to be capable of leadingmoves we can make up our minds without great difficulty to regard the lieutenants pay as nothing at all was lady charlottes answer you will enter the diplomatic service my interest alone could do that if we are married there would be plenty to see the necessity for pushing us i dont know whether you could keep the lieutenancy you might i should not like you to quit the army an opening might come in it theres the indian staffthe persian mission they like soldiers for those eastern posts but we must take what we can get we should anyhow live abroad where in the matter of money society is more sensible we should be able to choose our own and advertize tea brioche and conversation in return for the delicacies of the season but you charlotteyou could never live that life wilfrid broke in the contemplation of her plain sincerity diminishing him to himself it would drag you down too horribly remorse at giving tea in return for dinners and balls ah there are other things to consider she blushed unwontedly something lighted by the blush struck him as very feminine and noble then i may flatter myself that you love me he whispered do you not see she rejoined my project is nothing but a whima whim the divided man saw himself whole if not happy in the ranks of diplomacy with a resolute frank faithful woman a lady of title loving him to back him fortune shone ahead and on the road he saw where his deficiencies would be filled up by her she was firm and open he irresolute and selfinvolved animal courage both possessed their differences were so extreme that they met where they differed it struck him specially now that she would be like day to his spirit in continued intercourse young as he was he had wisdom to know the right meaning of the word helpmate it was as if the head had dealt the heart a blow saying see here the lady thou art to serve but the heart was a surly rebel lady charlotte was fully justified in retorting upon his last question i think i also should ask do you love me it is not absolutely imperative for the occasion or for the catastrophe i merely ask for what is called information and yet despite her flippancy which was partly designed to relieve his embarrassment her hand was moist and her eyes were singularly watchful you who sneer at love he gave a musical murmur not at all i think it a very useful part of the capital to begin the married business upon you unsay your own words not absolutely imperative i think i said if i remember rightly but i take the other view charlotte you imagine that there must be a little bit of love there should be no marriage without it on both sides at least if not on both sides one should bring such a love enough for two so then we are not to examine your basket touched by the pretty thing herein implied he squeezed her hand this is the answer said she can you doubt me she rose from her seat oh if you talk in that style i really am tempted to say that i do are there menwomen and womenmen my dear wilfrid have we changed parts tonight his quickness in retrieving a false position outwardly came to his aid he rose likewise and while perfecting the minor details of an easy attitude against the mantelpiece said i am so constituted charlotte that i cant talk of my feelings in a business tone and i avoid that subject unless you spoke of a basket just now well i confess i cant bring mine into the market and bawl out that i have so many pounds weight of the required material would a man go to the market at all if he had nothing to dispose of in plain wordssince my fault appears to be according to your reading in the opposite directionshould i be here if my sentiments could not reply eloquently to your question this very common masterpiece of cunning from a man in a corner which suggests with so persuasive an air that he has ruled his actions up to the very moment when he faces you and had almost preconceived the present occasion rather won lady charlotte or it seemed to or the scene had been too long for her vigilance in the affirmative she whispered coming nearer to him she knew that she had only to let her right shoulder slip under his left arm and he would very soon proclaim himself her lover as ardently as might be wished why did she hesitate to touch the blood of the man it was her fate never to have her great heart read aright wilfrid could not know that generosity rather than iciness restrained her from yielding that one unknown kiss which would have given the final spring to passion in his breast he wanted the justification of his senses and to run headlong blindly had she nothing of a womans instinct in the affirmative was his serene reply that means yes her tone had become pleasantly soft yes that means yes said he she shut her eyes murmuring how happy are those who hear that they are loved and opening them all her face being red say it she pleaded her fingers fell upon his wrist i have this weakness wilfrid i wish to hear you say it the flush of her face and tremour of her fingers told of an unimagined agitation hardly to be believed though seen and felt yet still some sign some shade of a repulsion in her figure kept him as far from her as any rigid rival might have stipulated for the interrogation to the attentive heavens was partially framed in his mind how can i tell this woman i love her without without putting his arm about her waist and demonstrating it satisfactorily to himself as well as to her in other words not so framed how without that frenzy which shall make me forget whether it be so or not he remained in his attitude incapable of moving or speaking but fancying that possibly he was again to catch a glimpse of the vanished mountain nymph sweet liberty her womans instinct warmed more and more until if she did not quite apprehend his condition she at least understood that the pause was one preliminary to a mans feeling himself a fool dear wilfrid she whispered you think you are doubted i want to be certain that you think you have met the right woman to help you in me he passed through the loophole here indicated and breathed yes charlotte i am sure of that if i could be only half as worthy you are full of courage and unselfishness and i could swear faithful as steel thank younot dogs she laughed i like steel i hope to be a good sword in your hand my knightor shield or whatever purpose you put me to she went on smiling and seeming to draw closer to him and throw down defences after all wilfrid the task of loving your good piece of steel wont be less thoroughly accomplished because you find it difficult sir i do not admit any protestation handsome faces musical voices sly manners and methods that i choose not to employ make the business easy to men who discover that the lady is not steel said wilfrid need she in any case wear so much there he pointed flittingly as it were with his little finger to the slope of her neck she turned her wrist touching the spot here you have seen then that it is something worn there followed a delicious interplay of eyes who would have thought that hers could be sweet and mean so much it is something worn then and thrown aside for me only charlotte for him who loves me she said for me for him who loves me she repeated then it is for me she had moved back showing a harder figure or the i love you love you would have sounded with force it came though not so vehemently as might have been to the appeal of a soft fixed look yes i love you charlotte you know that i do you love me yes say it i love you dead inanimate charlotte i love you she threw out her hand as one would throw a bone to a dog my living breathing noble charlotte he cried a little bewitched i love you with all my heart it surprised him that her features should be gradually expressing less delight with all your heart could i give you a part it is done sometimes she said mocksadly then in her original voice good i never credited that story of you and the girl emilia i suppose what people say is a lie her eyes in perfect accordance with the tone she had adopted set a quiet watch on him who says it he thundered just as she anticipated its not true not truehow can it be true you never loved emilia bellonidont love her nowdo not love her now if you have ever said that you love emilia belloni recant and you are forgiven and then go for i think i hear georgiana below quick i am not acting its earnest the word if you please as you are a gentleman tell me because i have heard tales i have been perplexed about you i am sure youre a manly fellow who would never have played tricks with a girl you were bound to protect but you might havepardon the slangspoonedwho knows you might have been in love with her downright no harm even if a trifle foolish but in the present case set my mind at rest quick there are both my hands take them press them and speak the two hands were taken but his voice was not so much at command no image of emilia rose in his mind to reproach him with the casting over of his hearts dear mistress but a blind struggle went on it seemed that he could do what he dared not utter the folly of lips more loyal than the spirit touched his lively perception and as the hot inward struggle masked behind his softlyplaying eyes had reduced his personal consciousness so that if he spoke from his feeling there was a chance of his figuring feebly he put on his everready other self categorically i reply have i loved miss emilia bellonino do i no do i love charlotte chillingworthyes ten thousand times and now let britomart disarm he sought to get his reward by gentle muscular persuasion her arms alone yielded and he judged from the angle of the neck ultrasharp though it was that her averted face might be her form of exhibiting maidenly reluctance feminine modesty suddenly the fingers in his grasp twisted and not being at once released she turned round to him for gods sake spare the girl emilia stood in the doorway chapter xxxvii a knock at merthyrs chamber called him out while he sat writing to marini on the national business he heard georgianas voice begging him to come to her quickly when he saw her face the stain of tears was there anything the matter with charlotte was his first question no but come i will tell you on the way do not look at me no personal matter of any kind oh no i can have none and she took his hand for a moment they passed into the dark windy street smelling of the sea emilia is here said georgiana i want you to persuade heryou will have influence with her oh merthyr my darling brother i thank god i love my brother with all my love what a dreadful thing it is for a woman to love a man i suppose it is while she has nothing else to do said merthyr how did she comewhy if you had seen emilia tonight you would have felt that the difference is absolute georgiana dealt first with the general case she came i think by some appointment also just as absolute between her and her sex he rejoined controlling himself not to be less cool what has happened georgiana pointed to the hotel whither their steps were bent that is where charlotte sleeps her going there was not a freak she had an object she wished to cure emilia of her love for mr wilfrid pole emilia had come down to see him charlotte put her in an adjoining room to hear him saywhat i presume they do say when the fit is on them was it not singular folly it was a folly that merthyr could not understand in his friend charlotte he said so and then he gave a kindly sad exclamation of emilias name you do pity her still cried georgiana her heart leaping to hear it expressed so simply why what other feeling can i have said he unsuspiciously no dear merthyr she replied and only by her tone he read the guilty little rejoicing in her heart marvelling at jealousy that could twist so straight a stem as his sisters spirit this had taught her who knew nothing of love that a man loving does not pity in such a ease i hope you will find her here georgiana hurried her steps say anything to comfort her i will have her with me and try and teach her what selfcontrol means and how it is to be won if ever she can act on the stage as she spoke tonight she will be a great dramatic genius she was transformed she uses strange forcible expressions that one does not hear in everyday life she crushed charlotte as if she had taken her up in one hand and without any display at all no gesture or spasm i noticed as they stood together that there is such a contrast between animal courage and imaginative fire charlotte could meet a great occasion i should think said merthyr and taking his sister by the elbow you speak as if you had observed very coolly did emilia leave you so cold did she seem to speak from head not from heart no she moved mepoor child only how humiliating to hear her beg for lovebefore us merthyr smiled i thought it must be the womans feeling that would interfere to stop a natural emotion is it trueor did i not see that certain eyes were red just now that was for him said georgiana hastily i am sure that no man has stood in such a position as he did to see a man made publicly ashamed and bearing it i have never had to endure so painful a sight to stand between two women claimed by both like solomons babe a man might as well at once have solomons judgement put into execution upon him you wept for him do you know georgey that charity of your sex which makes you cry at any affecting situation must have been designed to compensate to us for the severities of providence no merthyr she arrested his raillery do i ever cry but i thoughtif it had been my brother and almost at the thought i felt the tears rush at my eyelids as if the shame had been mine the probability of its not being your brother seemed distant at the moment said merthyr with his halfmelancholy smile tell mei can conjure up the scene but tell me whether you saw more passions than one in her face emilias no her face reminded me of the sombrethat dull glow of a fire that you leave burning in the grate late on winter nights was that natural it struck me that her dramatic instinct was as much alive as her passion had she been clumsy would you not have been less suspicious of her and if she had only shown the accustomed northern retenue and merely looked all that she had to say preserved her dignityour womanly critic would have been completely satisfied but merthyr to parade her feelings and then to go on appealing on the principle that she ought to be ashamed of them she was wrong if you had heard her utter abandonment i can believe that she did not blush it seems to me to belong to those excesses that promptthat are in themselves a species of suicide love is said to be the death of self no but i must use cant words merthyr i do wish to see modesty yes i know i must be right there is very little of it to be had in a tropical storm you admit then that this sort of love is a storm that passes it passes i hope but where is your defence of her now have i defended her i need not try a man has deceived her and she doesnt think it possible and has said so i presume when she sees it she will be quieter than most she will not reproach him subsequently here is the hotel and that must be charlottes room if i may judge by the lights what pranks will she always be playing we seem to have brought new elements into the little town do you remember bergamo the rainy night the austrian trooped out of milanone light that was a thousand in the twinkling of an eye having arrived he ran hastily up to the room expecting to find the three but lady charlotte was alone sitting in her chair with knotted arms ah merthyr she said im sorry you should have been disturbed i perceive what georgeys leaving the room meant i suppose the hotel people are used to yachtingparties and then not seeing any friendly demonstration on his part she folded her arms in another knot georgiana asked where emilia was lady charlotte replied that emilia had gone and then wilfrid had followed her one minute later to get her into shelter somewhere or put penknives out of her way i am rather fatigued with a scene merthyr i never had an idea before of what your southern women were one plays decidedly second to them while the fit lasts of course you have a notion that i planned the whole of the absurd business this is the casei found the girl on the beach she follows him everywhere which is bad for her reputation because in this climate people suspect positive reasons for that kind of female devotedness so to put an end to itreally for her own sake quite as much as anything elseam i a monster of insensibility merthyri made her swear an oath one must be a point above wild animals to feel that to be binding however i made her swear to listen and remain there silent till i opened the door to set her at liberty she consentedgave her word solemnly i calculated that she might faint and fixed her in an armchair was that cruel merthyr you have called me austrian more than once but upon my honour i wanted her to get over her delusion comfortably i thought she would have kept the oath i confess she looked up like a child when she was making it you have heard the rest from georgey i must say the situation was rather hard on wilfrid if he blames me it will be excuseable though what i did plan was to save him from a situation somewhat worse so now you know the whole merthyr commence your lecture make me a martyr to the sorrows of italy once more merthyr took her wrist feeling the quick pulse and dropped it she was effectually humbled by this direct method of dealing with her secret heart after some commonplace remarks had passed she herself urged him to send out men in search for emilia before he went she murmured a soft forgive me the pressure of her fingers was replied to but the words were not spoken there she cried to georgiana i have offended the only man for whose esteem i care one particle devote yourself to your friends how devote yourself murmured georgiana astonished do you think i should have got into this hobble if i hadnt wished to serve some one else you must have seen that merthyr has a sentimental sort of fondnesscall it passionfor this girl shes his italy in the flesh is there a more civilized man in the world than merthyr so he becomes fascinated by a savage we all play the game of oppositesor like to and no woman in his class will ever catch him i couldnt have believed that he was touched by a girl but for two or three recent indications you must have noticed that he has given up reading others and he objected the other day to a responsible office which would have thrown him into her neighbourhood alone these are unmistakeable signs in merthyr though he has never been in love and doesnt understand his case a bit tell me do you think it impossible georgiana answered dryly you have fallen into a fresh mistake exactly then let me rescue you from a similar fatality georgey if your eyes are bandaged now are you going to be devoted to me also charlotte i believe im a miracle of devotion said the lady retiring into indifferent topics upon that phrase she had at any rate partially covered the figure of ridicule presented to her feminine imagination by the aspect of her fair self exposed in public contention with one of her sexand for a man it was enough to make her pulse and her brain lively on second thoughts too it had struck her that she might be serving merthyr in disengaging emilia and undoubtedly she served georgiana by giving her a warning through this silliness went the current of a clear mind nevertheless the ladys heart was justified in crying out what would i not abandon for my friend in his need meantime her battle in her own behalf looked less pleasing by the light of new advantages the question recurred shall i care to win at all she had to force the idea of a violent love to excuse her proceedings to get up any flame whatsoever an occasional blast of jealousy had to be called for jealousy was a quality she could not admit as possible to her so she acted on herself by an agent she repudiated and there was no help for it had wilfrid loved her the womans heart was ready it was ready with a trembling tenderness softer and deeper than a girls for charlotte would have felt with this love that i have craved for you give me life and she would have thanked him for both exultingly to feel i can repay you as no girl could do though she had none of the rage of love to give as it was she thought conscientiously that she could help him she liked him his peculiar suppleness of a growing mind his shrouded sensibility in conjunction with his reputation for an evidently quite reliable prompt courage and the mask he wore which was to her transparent pleased her and touched her fancy nor was he so vain of his person as to make him seem like a boy to her he affected maturity he could pass a mirror on his right or his left without an abstracted look over either shouldera poor example but worth something to a judge of young men indeed had she chosen from a crowd the choice would have been one of his age she was too set for an older man but a youth aspiring to be older than he was whose faults she saw and forgave whose merits supplied two or three of her own deficiencies whom her station might help to elevate to whom she might come as a benefactress feeling so while she accomplished her own desiresuch a youth was everything to her as she awoke to discover after having played with him a season if she lost him what became of her even if she had rejoiced in a mother to plot and playto bait and snare for her her time was slipping and the choosers among her class were wary her spirit besides was high and elective it was gradually stooping to nature but would never have bowed to a fool or save under protest to one who gave all on wilfrid she had fixed her mind so therefore she bore the remembrance of the recent scene without much fretting at her burdensthe more that wilfrid had in no way shamed her and the more that the heat of emilias love played round him and illumined him this borrowing of the passion of another is not uncommon at daybreak mrs chump was abroad she had sat up for wilfrid almost through the night oh the arrstocracy she breathed exclamations as she swept along the esplanade ill be killed and murdered if i tell a word meeting captain gambier she fell into a great agitation and explained it as an anxiety she entertained for wilfrid when becoming entangled in the mesh of questions she told all she knew and nearly as much as she suspected which fatal step to retrieve she entreated his secresy adela was now seen fluttering hastily up the walk fresh as a creature of the seawave before mrs chump could summon her old wrath of yesterday she was kissed and to the arch interrogation as to what she had done with this young ladys brother replied by telling the tale of the night again mrs chump was ostentatiously caressed into a more comfortable opinion of the worlds morality for the nonce invited by them to breakfast at the hotel she hurried back to her villa for a flounced dress and a lace cap of some pretensions while they paced the shore see what may be said adelas countenance changed as she muttered it thought would be enough she added shuddering yes if one is off guardcareless the captain assented flowingly can one in earnest be other than careless i shall walk on that line up to the end who makes me deviate is my enemy the playful little person balanced herself to make one foot follow the other along a piece of washed grey rope on the shingle soon she had to stretch out her hand for help and the captain at full arms length conducted her to the final knot arrived safe she said smiling but not disengaged he rejoined in similar style please she doubled her elbow to give a little tug for her fingers no he pressed them tighter pray no must i speak to somebody else to get me released would you must i thank heaven he is not yet in existence husband being implied games of this sweet sort are warranted to carry little people as far as they may go swifter than any other invention of lively satan the yachting party including mrs chump were at the breakfasttable and that dumb guest had done all the blushing for lady charlotte when wilfrid entered neat carefully brushed and with ready answers though his face could put on no fresh colours to mrs chump he bent passing and was pushed away and drawn back your eyes she whispered myyeyes went wilfrid in schoolboy style and she who rarely laughed was struck by his humorous skill saying to sir twickenham beside her hes as cunnin as a lord sir twickenham expressed his ignorance of lords having usurped priority in that department frightened by his portentous parliamentary phraseology she remained tolerably demure till the sitting was over now sidling in her heart to the sins of the great whom anon she angrily reproached her principal idea was that as the world was discovered to be so wicked they were all in a boat going to perdition and it would be as well to jump out immediately but while so resolving she hung upon lady charlottes looks and little speeches altogether seduced by so fresh and frank a sinner if safe from temptation here was the soul of a woman in great danger of corruption among the aristocracy thought mrs chump its just the male that hangs his head and the female struts and is sprightly the contrast between lady charlotte and wilfrid who when he ceased to set outrageously sat like a man stricken by a bolt produced this reflection and in spite of her disastrous vision of the fate of the boat they were in mrs chump owned to the intoxication of gliding smoothly gliding on the rapids the breakfast was coming to an end when braintops name was sent in to mrs chump she gave a cry of motherly compassion for braintop and began to relate the little deficiencies of his temper while as it were simmering on her seat to go to him wilfrid sent out word for him to appear which he did unluckily for himself even as mrs chump wound up the public description of his character by remarking hes just the opposite of a lord now in everything braintop stood bowing like the most faithful confirmation of an opinion ever seen he looked the victim of fatigue in the bargain a light broke on mrs chump ill never forgive myself ye poor gentle heart to throw pens and pen wipers at ye that did your best poor boy what have ye been doin and why didnt ye return and not go hoppin about about all night like a young kangaroo as they say they do have ye read the arcana of nature and science maam the hon mrs bayruffle thus abruptly addressed observed that she had not and was it an amusing book becas itll open your mind pursued mrs chump and there hes eatin and when a man takes to eatin yell never have any fear about his abouts and if ye read the arcana of nature and science maam yell first feel that yeve gone half mad for it contains averything in the world and yell read ut ten times all through and not remember five lines runnin oh its a dreadful book and thats the book to read to your husband when hes got a fit o the gout hes got nothin to do but swallow knolludge then now mr braintop dont stop but tell me as ye go on what ye did with yourself all night a slight hesitation in braintop caused her to crossexamine him rigidly suggesting that he might not dare to tell and he exercising some self command adopted narrative as the less ignominious form of confession no one save mrs chump listened to him until he mentioned the name miss belloni and then it was curious to see the steadiness with which certain eyes feigning abstraction fixed in his direction he had met emilia on the outskirts of the town and unable to persuade her to take shelter anywhere had walked on with her in dead silence through the night to the third station of the railway for london is this a mad person asked the hon mrs bayruffle adela shrugged a genius dont eat with the tips of your teeth like a bird mr braintop for no company minds your eatin cried mrs chump angrily and encouragingly and this little bellonimy belief is that she came after you and what have ye done with her it was queerly worried out of braintop who was trying his best all the time to be obedient to wilfrids direct eye that the two wanderers by night had lost themselves in lanes refreshed themselves with purloined apples from the tree at dawn obtained a draught of morning milk with a handful of damsons apiece and that nothing would persuade emilia to turn back from the route to london braintop bit daintily at his toast unwilling to proceed under the discouraging expression of wilfrids face and the meditative silence of two or three others the discovery was forcibly extracted that emilia had no moneythat all she had in her possession was sevenpence and a thimble and that he braintop had but a few shillings which she would not accept and what has become of her was asked braintop stated that she had returned to london and blushing confessed that he had given her his return ticket georgiana here interposed to save him from the awful encomiums of mrs chump by desiring to know whether emilia seemed unhappy or distressed braintops spirited reply not at all was corrected to she did not cry and further modified that is she called out sharply when i whistled an opera tune lady charlotte put a stop to the subject by rising pointedly watch in hand she questioned the ladies as to their occupations and told them what time they had to dispose of then baynes captain of the yacht heard to be outside was summoned in he pronounced doubtfully about the weather but admitted that there was plenty of wind and if the ladies did not mind it a little fresh he was sure he did not wind was favourable for the island headquarters of the yacht well see who gets there first she said to wilfrid and the company learnt that wilfrid was going to other headquarters on special business whereupon there followed chatter and exclamations wilfrid quickly explained that his fathers condition called him away imperiously to adela and mrs chump demanding peculiar personal explanations he gave reassuring reasons separately aside mrs chump understood that this was merely his excuse to get away that he might see her safe to brookfield adela only required a look and a gesture merthyr and georgiana likewise spoke expected adieux as did sir twickenham who parted company in his own little yawl lady charlotte with her head over a map and one hand arranging an eyeglass hastily nodded them off scarcely looking at them she allowed herself to be diverted from this study for an instant by the unbefitting noise made by adela for the loss of her brother not that she objected to the noise particularly it was modulated and delicate in tone but that she could not understand it seeing sir twickenham however in a leavetaking attitude she uttered an easy oh to herself and diligently recommenced spying at ports and harbours and following the walnut thumb of baynes on the map all seemed to be perfectly correct in the arrangements to go to london was wilfrids thought and the rest were almost as much occupied with their own ideas captain gambier received their semiironical congratulations and condolences incident to the man who is left alone in the charge of sweet ladies and the hon mrs bayruffle remarked that she supposed ten hours not a long period of time though her responsibility was onerous lady gosstre is at the island said lady charlotte to show where it might end if she pleased within an hour the yacht was flying for the island with a full western breeze and mrs chump and wilfrid were speeding to brookfield as the latter permitted her to imagine braintop realized the fruits of the sacrifice of his return ticket by facing mrs chump in the train merthyr had telegraphed to marini to meet emilia at the station in london and instructed braintop to deliver a letter for her at marinis house to marini he wrote let giulia guard her as no one but a woman can in such a case by this time giulia will know her value there is dangerous stuff in her now and my anxiety is very great have you seen what a nature it is you have not alluded to her beyond answers to instructions but her character cannot have escaped you i am never mistaken in my estimates of italian and cymric blood singularly too she is part welsh on the mothers side to judge by the name leave her mind entirely free till it craves openly for some counteraction her italy and her music will not do let them be my fear is that you have seen too clearly what a daughter of italy i have found for you but whatever you put up now to distract her you sacrifice my good marini bear that in mind it will be a disgust in her memory and i wish her to love her country and her art when she recovers so we treat the disease dear friend let your italy have no sorrows for her ears till the storm within is tranquil i am with you speedily marinis reply said among all the things we have to thank our merthyr for this treasure if it is not the greatest he has given to us makes us grateful the most we met her at the station ah there was an elbow when she gave her hand she thought to be alone and started and hated till giulia smothered her face and there was dead fire in the eyes which is powder when you spring it we go with her to her new lodging and the track is lost this is your wish it is pitching new camps to avoid the enemy but so a man takes this disease and his common work at once of a womanshe is all the disease till it is extinct or she what is this disease but a silly a senseless waste giuliawoman that she iswill not call it so see her eyes doze and her voice go a soft buzz when she speaks it as a dove of the woods that it almost makes it sweet to me yes a daughter of italy so giulia has beenwill be i know not so will this your emilia be in the time that comes to the young people she has this as you say malady very strongma ogni male ha la sua ricetta i can say it of persons of nations to think my heart is as an infidelvery heavy ah till i turn to youwho revive to the thought as you were an army of deliverance for you are hope you know not despair you are hope and you love as myself a mother whose son you are not oh is giulias cry will our italy reward him with a daughterthe noblest that we have yes for she would be italian always through you we pray that you may not get old too soon before she grows for you and is found only that you may know in her our love see i am brought to talk this language the woman is in me merthyr said as he read this i could wish no better his feeling for emilia waxed toward a selfavowal as she advanced to womanhood and the last stage of it had struck among trembling strings in the inmost chambers of his heart that last stage of ither passionate claiming of wilfrid before two women one her rivalslept like a covered furnace within him can you remember none of her words he said more than once to georgiana who replied i would try to give you an idea of what she said but i might as well try to paint lightning my lover suggested merthyr oh yes that she said it sounded oddly to your ears very indeed what more did she say do you mean is my poor sister ashamed to repeat it i would repeat anything that would give you pleasure to hear sometimes pain you know is sweet little by little and with a contest at each step georgiana coasted the conviction that her undivided reign was over then she judged emilia by human natures hardest standard the measure of the qualities brought as usurper and successor unconsciously she placed herself in the seat of one who had fulfilled all the great things demanded of a woman for merthyr and it seemed to her that emilia exercised some fatal fascination girl though she was to hurl her from that happy sovereignty but emilias worst crime before the arraigning lady was that wilfrid had cast her off female justice therefore said you must be unworthy of my brother and female delicacy thought you have been soiled by a previous history she had pitied wilfrid now she held him partially blameless and while love was throbbing in many pulses all round her the man she had seen besieged by passionate love touched her cold imagination with a hue of fire as winter dawn lies on a frosty field she almost conceived what this other not sisterly love might be though not as its victim by any means she became as she had never before been spiritually tormented and restless the thought framed itself that charlotte and wilfrid were not by any law of selection to match what mattered it simply that it in some way seemed to increase the merits of one of the two the task moreover of avoiding to tease her brother was made easier to her by flying to this new refuge of mysterious reflection at times she poured back the whole flood of her heart upon merthyr and then in alarm at the host of little passions that grew cravingly alive in her she turned her thoughts to wilfrid again and so till they turned wittingly to him that this host of little passions will invariably surround a false great one she learnt by degrees by having to quell them and rise out of them she knew that now she occasionally forced her passion for merthyr but what nothing could teach her was that she did so to eject anothers image on the contrary her confession would have been voluntarily i dwell upon that other that my love for merthyr may avoid excess to such a state of clearness much selfquestioning brought her but her blood was as yet unwarmed and that is a condition fostering selfdeception as much as when it rages madame marini wrote to ask whether emilia might receive the visits of a sir purcell barrett whom they had met and whom emilia called her friend adding the other gentleman has called at our old lodgings three times the last time our landlady says he wept is it an englishman really merthyr laughed at this remarking charlotte is not so vigilant after all he wept georgiana thought and remembered the cold selfcommand that his face had shown when emilia claimed him and his sole reply was i am engaged to this lady designating lady charlotte now too some of emilias phrases took life in her memory she studied them thinking over them as if a voice of nature had spoken less and less it seemed to her that a woman need feel shame to utter them she interpreted this as her growth of charity for a girl so violently stricken with love in such a case the more she says the more is she to be excused for nothing but a frenzy of passion could move her to speak so thought georgiana accepting the words and sanctioning the passion the person of him who had inspired it stood magnified in its light she believed that if he had played with the girl he repented and the idea of a man shedding tears burnt to her heart merthyr and georgiana remained in devonshire till a letter from madame marini one morning told them that emilia had disappeared you delayed too long to go to her merthyr said his sister astonishing him i understand why but you may trust to time and scorn chance too much let us go now and find her if it is not too late marini met them at the station in london and they heard that wilfrid had discovered marinis new abode and had called there that morning i had my eye on him it was not a piece of loveplay said marini and today she should have seen my chief which would have cured her of sis pestilence of a love to give her sublime thoughts do you love her miss ford aha it will be christian names in italy again i like her very much said georgiana but i confess it mystifies me to see you all so excited about her it must be some attraction possessed by herwhat i cannot say i like her certainly figlia mia she is an elementshe is fire said marini my sought when our mertyr brought her was it is italy he sees in her faceher voicenameanysing and a day passed and i could not lose her for my own sake and felt a somesing too she is half man a singular reason for an attraction georgiana smiled she is not marini put out his fingers like claws to explain while his eyelashes met over his eyesshe is not what man has made of your sex and she is brave of heart can you possibly tell what such a child can be questioned georgiana almost irritably marini did not reply to her a face to find a home ineh mertyr lets discover where that face has found a home said merthyr she is a very plain and unpretending person if people will not insist upon her being more this morbid admiration of heroines puts a trifle too much weight upon their shoulders does it not georgiana knew that to call emilia child was to wound the most sensitive nerve in merthyrs system if he loved her and she had determined to try harshly whether he did nevertheless though the expression succeeded and was designedly cruel she could not forgive the insincerity of his last speech craving in truth for confidence as her smallest claim on him now so at all the consultations she acquiesced in any scheme that was proposed the advertizings and the use of detectives the communication with emilias mother and father and the callings at suburban concertrooms sir purcell barrett frequently called to assist in the discovery at first he led them to suspect mr pericles but a trusty italian playing spy upon that gentleman soon cleared him and they were more in the dark than ever it was only when at last georgiana heard merthyr the picture of polished selfpossession giving way to a burst of disappointment in the room before them all are we sure that she lives he criedthen georgiana looking at the firelight over her joined fingers said but have you forgotten the serviceable brigade you have in your organ boys marini if emilia sees one be sure she will speak to him have i not said she is a general marini pointed at georgiana with a gleam of his dark eyes and merthyr squeezed his sisters hand thanking her by which he gave her one whole night of remorse because she had not spoken earlier chapter xxxviii my voice i have my voice emilia had cried it out to herself almost aloud on the journey from devon to london the landscape slipping under her eyes with flashing grey pools and light silver freshets little glades little copses farms and meadows rounding away to spires of village churches under blue hills would not let her sink heavy as was the spirit within her and dead to everything as she desired to be here a great strange old oak spread out its arms and seemed to hold the hurrying train a minute when gone by emilia thought of it as a friend and that there there was the shelter and thick darkness she had hoped she might be flying to or the reach of a stream was seen and in the middle of it one fair group of clouds showing distance beyond distance in colour emilia shut her sight and tried painfully to believe that there were no distances for her this was an easy task when the train stopped it was surprising to her then why the people moved the whistle of the engine and rush of the scenery set her imagination anew upon the horror of being motionless my voice i have my voice the exclamation recurred at intervals as a quick fear that bubbled up from blind sensation of her being utterly abandoned and a stray thing carrying no light startled her darkness she still had her desire for but not to be dark in the darkness she looked back on the recent night as a lake of fire through which she had plunged and of all the faculties about her memory had suffered most so that it could recall no images of what had happened but lay against its black corner a shuddering bundle of nerves the varying fields and woods and waters offering themselves to her in the swiftness were as wine dashed to her lips which could not be dead to it the wish to be of some worth began a painful quickening movement at first she could have sobbed with the keen anguish that instantaneously beset her forif i am of worth who looks on me was her outcry and the darkness she had previously coveted fell with the strength of a mace on her forehead but the creatures heart struggled further and byandby in despite of her the pulses sprang a clear outlook on hope it struck through her like the first throb of a swordcut she tried to blind herself to it the face of hope was hateful this conflict of the baffled spirit of youth with its forceful flood of being continued until it seemed that emilia was lifted through the fiery circles into daylight her last cry being as her first i have my voice of that which her voice was to achieve for her she never thought she had no thought of value but only an eagerness to feel herself possessor of something wilfrid had appeared to her to have taken all from her until the recollection of her voice made her breathe suddenly quick and deep as one recovering the taste of life despair i have said before is a wilful business common to corrupt blood and to weak woeful minds native to the sentimentalist of the better order the only touch of it that came to emilia was when she attempted to penetrate to wilfrids reason for calling her down to devon that he might renounce and abandon her she wanted a reason to make him in harmony with his acts and she could get none this made the world look black to her but i have my voice she said exhausted by the passion of the night tearless and only sensible to pain when the keen swift wind and the flying squares of field and meadow prompted her nature mysteriously to press for healthy action a man opposite to her ventured a remark were going at a pretty good pace now miss she turned her eyes to him and the sense of speed was reduced in her at once she could not comprehend how remembering presently that she had not answered him she said it is because you are going home perhaps that you think it fast no miss he replied im going to market they cant put on steam too stiff for me when im bound on business emilia found it impossible to fathom the sensations of the man and their common desire for speed bewildered her more she was relieved when the train was lightened of him soon the skirts of red vapour were visible and when the guard took poor braintops returnticket from her petulant hand all of the journey that she bore in mind was the sight of a butcherboy in blue with a red cap mounted on a white horse who rode gallantly along a broad highroad and for whom she had struck out some tune to suit the measure of his gallop she accepted her capture by the marinis more calmly than merthyr had been led to suppose the butcherboys gallop kept her senses in motion for many hours and that reckless equestrian embodied the idea of the vivifying pace from which she had dropped he went slower and slower by degrees the tune grew dull and jarred and then emilia looked out on the cold grey skies of our autumn the rain and the fogs and roaring london filled her ears so had ended a dream she thought she would stand at the window listening to streetorgans whose hideous discord and clippings and drawls did not madden her and whose suggestion of a lovely tune rolled out no golden land to her that treasure of her voice to which no one in the house made allusion became indeed a buried treasure in the southwestern suburb where the marinis lived plots of foliage were to be seen and there were lanes not so black but that they showed the hues of the season these led to the parks and to noble gardens emilia daily went out to keep the dying colours of the year in view and walked to get among the trees where with madame attendant on her she sat counting the leaves as each one curved and slid and spun to earth or on a gust of air hosts went aloft but it always ended in their coming down emilia verified that fact repeatedly however high they flew the ground awaited them madame entertained her with talk of italy and tuscan wine and lombard bread and turin chocolate marini never alluded to his sufferings for the loss of these cruelly interdicted dainties never but madame knew how his exile affected him and in england the sums one paid for everything one fancies one pays for breath said madame shivering one day the exorganist of hillford church passed before them emilia let him go the day following he passed again but turned at the end of the alley and simulated astonishment at the appearance of emilia as he neared her they shook hands and talked while madame zealously eyed any chance person promenading the neighbourhood she wrote for instructions concerning this gentleman calling himself sir purcell barrett and receiving them she permitted emilia to invite him to their house he is an englishman under a rope ready for heaven madame described him to her husband who though more at heart with englishmen could not but admit that this one wore a look that appeared as a prognostication of sadness sir purcell informed emilia of his accession to title and in reply to her are you not glad smiled and said that a mockery could scarcely make him glad indicating nevertheless how feeble the note of poverty was in his grand scale of sorrow he came to the house and met them in the gardens frequently with some perversity he would analyze to herself emilias spirit of hope partly perhaps for the sake of probing to what sort of thing it might be in its nature and defences and as against an accomplished disputant she made but a poor battle he injured what was precious to her without himself gaining any good whatever why what do you look forward to she said wondering at the end of one of their arguments as he courteously termed this play of logical foils with a baby death answered the grave gentleman striding on emilia pitied him thinking i might feel as he does if i had not my voice seeing that calamity very remote she added i should she knew of his position toward cornelia that is she knew as much as he did for the want of a womans heart over which to simmer his troubles was urgent within him and emilias though it lacked experience was a womans regarding love and moreover she did not weep but practically suggested his favourable chances which it was a sad satisfaction to him to prove baseless and to knock utterly over the grief in which the soul of a human creature is persistently seeking since it cannot be thrown off to clothe itself comfortably finds in tears an irritating expression of sympathy hints of a brighter future are its nourishment such embryos are not tenacious of existence and when destroyed they are succulent food for a space to the moody grief i am describing the melancholy gentleman did emilia this good that never appearing to imagine others to know misery save himself he gave her full occupation apart from the workings of her own mind as to her case he might have offered the excuse that she really had nothing of the aspect of a lovesick young lady and was not a bit seagreen to view or lamentable in tone he was sufficiently humane to have felt for anyone suffering and the proof of it is that the only creature he saw under such an influence he pitied so deplorably as to make melancholy a habit with him he fretted her because he would do nothing and this spectacle of a lover beloved but consenting to be mystified consentingly paralyzed of a lover beloved does she love you said emilia beseechingly if the truth is in her she does he returned she has told you she loves youthat she loves no one else of this i am certain then why are you downcast my goodness i would take her by the hand woman do you know yourself you belong to mei would say that and never let go her hand that would decide everything she must come to you then or you know what it is that means to separate you my goodness i see it so plain but he declined to look thus low and stood pitifully smilingthis spectacle together with some subtle spur from the talk of love roused emilia from her lethargy the warmth of a new desire struck around her heart the old belief in her power over wilfrid joined to a distinct admission that she had for the moment lost him and she said yes now as i am now he can abandon me but how if he should see her and hear her in that hushed hour when she was to stand as a star before men emilia flushed and trembled she lived vividly though her farprojected sensations until truly pity for wilfrid was active in her bosom she feeling how he would yearn for her the vengeance seemed to her so keen that pity could not fail to come thus to her contemplation their positions became reversed it was wilfrid now who stood in the darkness unselected her fiery fancy unchained from the despotic heart illumined her under the golden future come to us this evening i will sing to you she said and the englishman under a rope bowed assentingly sad songs if you like she added i have always thought sadness more musical than mirth said he surely there is more grace in sadness poetry sculpture and songs and all the arts were brought forward in mournful array to demonstrate the truth of his theory when emilia understood him she cited dogs and cats and birds and all things of nature that rejoiced and revelled in support of the opposite view nay if animals are to be your illustration he protested he had been perhaps half under the delusion that he spoke with cornelia and with a sense of infinite misery he compressed the apt distinction that he had in his mind which was to show where humanity and simple nature drew a line and wherein humanity claimed the loftier seat but such talk must be uttered to a soul he phrased internally and emilia was denied what belonged to cornelia hitherto emilia had refused to sing and madame marini faithful to her instructions had never allowed her to be pressed to sing emilia would brood over notes thinking i can take that and that and dwell on such and such a note for any length of time but she would not call up her voice she would not look at her treasure it seemed more to her untouched and went on doubling its worth until doubtless her idea of capacity greatly relieved her of the burden on her breast and the reflection that she held a charm for all and held it from all flattered one who had been cruelly robbed on their way homeward among the chrysanthemums in the long gardenwalk they met tracy runningbrook between whose shouts of delight and emilias reserve there was so marked a contrast that one would have deemed tracy an offender in her sight she had said to him entreatingly do not come when he volunteered to call on the marinis in the evening and she got away from him as quickly as she could promising to be pleased if he called the day following tracy flew leaping to one of the great houses where he was tame cat when sir purcell as they passed on spoke a contemptuous word of his soft habits and idleness emilia said he is one of my true friends and why is he interdicted the visit this evening because she answered and grew pale hehe does not care for music i wish i had not met him she recollected how tracys flaming head had sprung up before herhe who had always prophesied that she would be famous for arts unknown to her and not for song just when she was having a vision of triumph and caressing the idea of her imprisoned voice bursting its captivity and soaring into its old heavens he does not care for music interjected sir purcell with something like a frown i have nothing in common with him but that i might have known i can have nothing in common with a man who is not to be impressed by music i love him quite as well said emilia he is a quick friend i am always certain of him and i imagine also that you are quits with your quick friend added sir purcell you do not care for verse or he for voices poetry said emilia no not much it seems like talking on tiptoe like animals in cages always going to one end and back again and making the same noise when they get at the endlike the bears sir purcell slightly laughed you dont approve of the rhymes yes i like the rhymes but when you use wordsi mean if you are in earnesthow can you count and have stops andno i do not care anything for poetry sir purcells opinion of emilia though he liked her was that if a genius she was an incomplete one and his positive judgement which i set down in phrase that would have startled him ranked both her and tracy as a pair of partial humbugs entertaining enough they were both too real for him haply at that moment the girl was intensely susceptible for she chilled by his side and when he left her she begged madame to walk fast i wonder whether i have a cold she said madame explained all the signs of it with tragic minuteness deciding that emilia was free at present and by miracle from this english scourge but emilia kept her hands at her mouth over the hornbeam hedge of the lane that ran through the marketgardens she could see a murky sunset spreading its deepcoloured lines that seemed to her really like a great sorrowing over earth it had never seemed so till now and entering the house the roar of vehicles in a neighbouring road sounded like something implacable in the order of things among us and clung about her ears pitilessly running upstairs she tried a scale of notes that broke on a cough did i cough purposely she asked herself but she had not the courage to try the notes again while dressing she hummed a passage and sought stealthily to pass the barrier of her own watchfulness by dwelling on a deep note from which she was to rise bursting with full bravura energy and so forth on a tide of song but her breath failed she stared into the glass and forced the note a panic caught at her heart when she heard the sound that issued am i ill i must be hungry she exclaimed it is a cough but i dont cough what is the matter with me under these auspices she forced her voice again and subsequently loosened her dress complaining of the dressmakers affection for tightness now she said having fallen upon an attempt at simple do re me fa and laughed at herself was it the laugh that stopping her at si made that si so husky asthmatic like the wheezing of a crooked old witch i am unlucky tonight said emilia or rather so said her surfaceself the submerged selfself in the depthsrarely speaks to the occasions but lies under calamity quietly apprehending all willing that the talker overhead should deceive others and herself likewise if possible emilia found her hands acting daintily and critically in the attirement of her person and then surprised herself murmuring i forgot that tracy wont be here tonight by which she betrayed that she had divined those arts she was to shine in according to tracy and betrayed that she had a terrible fear of a loss of all else it pained her now that tracy should not be coming can i send for him she thought as she looked winningly into the glass trying to feel what sort of a feeling it was to be in love with a face like that one fronting her so familiar in its aspects so strange when scrutinized studiously she drew a chair and laying her elbow on the toilettable gazed hard until the thought what face did wilfrid see last meaning when he saw me last drove her away not only did she know herself now a face of many faces but the life within her likewise as a soul of many souls the one emilia so unquestioning so sure lay dead and a dozen new spirits with but a dim likeness to her were fighting for possession of her frame now occupying it alone now in couples and each casting grim reflections on the other which is only a way of telling you that the great result of mortal sufferingconsciousnesshad fully set in to ripen perhaps to debase at any rate to prove her to be of worth was still her fixed ideaall that was clear in the thickening mist i cannot be ugly she said and reproved herself for simulating a childish tone why do i talk in that way i know i am not ugly but if a fire scorched my face there is nothing that seems safe the love of friends was suggested to her as something to rely on and the loving them but if i have nothing to give said emilia and opened both her empty hands she had diverted her mind from the pressure upon it by this colloquy with a lookingglass and gave herself a great rapture by running up notes to this theme no no no no nonothing nothing clear full sonant notes the notes of her true voice she did not attempt them a second time nor when sir purcell requested her to sing in the course of the evening did she comply the signora thinks i have a cold she said madame marini protested that she hoped not she even thought not though none could avoid it at this season in this climate and she turned to sir purcell to petition for any receipts he might have in his possession specifics for warding off the frightful affliction of households in england i have now twenty said madame and throwing up her eyes i have tried all oh so many lozenge marini and emilia laughed while sir purcell was maintaining the fact of his total ignorance of the subject against madames incredulity emilia left the room when she came back madame was pressing her visitor to be explicit with regard to a certain process of cure conducted by an application of cold water the neapolitan gave several shudders as she marked him attentively water cold she murmured with the deepest pathos and dropped her face in her hands with narrowed shoulders emilia held a letter over to sir purcell he took it first assuring himself that marini was in complicity with them to marini emilia addressed a momus forefinger and marini shrugged smiling water cold ejaculated madame showing her countenance again in winter luigi they are mad marini poked the fire briskly for his sensations entirely sided with his wife the letter sir purcell held contained these words be kind and meet me tomorrow at ten in the morning at that place where you first saw me sitting i want you to take me to one who will help me i cannot lose time any more i must work i have been dead for i cannot say how long i know you will come i am for ever your thankful friend emilia chapter xxxix the pride of punctuality brought sir purcell to that appointed seat in the gardens about a minute in advance of emilia she came hurrying up to him with three fingers over her lips the morning was cold frost edged the flat brown chestnut and beech leaves lying about on rimy grass so at first he made no remark on her evident unwillingness to open her mouth but a feverish look of her eyes touched him with some kindly alarm for her you should not have come out if you think you are in any danger he said not if we walk fast she replied in a visiblycontrolled excitement it will be over in an hour this way she led the marvelling gentleman toward the row and across it under the big black elms begging him to walk faster to accommodate her he suggested that if they had any distance to go they might ride and after a short calculating hesitation she consented letting him know that she would tell him on what expedition she was bound whilst they were riding the accompaniment of the wheels however necessitated a higher pitch of her voice which apparently caused her to suffer from a contraction of the throat for she remained silent with a discouraged aspect her full brown eyes showing as in a sombre meditation beneath the thick brows the direction had been given to the city on they went with the torrent and were presently engulfed in fog the roar grew muffled phantoms poured along the pavement yellow beamless lights were in the shopwindows all the vehicles went at a slow march it looks as if business were attending its own obsequies said sir purcell whose spirits were enlivened by an atmosphere that confirmed his impression of things emilia cried twice oh what cruel weather her eyelids blinked either with anger or in misery they were set down a little beyond the bank and when they turned from the cabman sir purcell was warm in his offer of his arm to her for he had seen her wistfully touching what money she had in her pocket and approved her natural good breeding in allowing it to pass unmentioned now he said i must know what you want to do a quiet place there is no quiet place in this city said emilia fretfully a gentleman passing took off his hat saying with city politeness pardon me you are close to a quiet place through that door and the hall you will find a garden where you will hear london as if it sounded fifty miles off he bowed and retired and the two emilia thankful sir purcell tending to anger following his indication soon found themselves in a most perfect retreat the solitude of which they had the misfortune however of destroying for another and a scared couple here emilia said i have determined to go to italy at once mr pericles has offered to pay for me its my fathers wish andand i cannot wait and feel like a beggar i must go i shall always love englanddont fear that sir purcell smiled at the simplicity of her pleading look now i want to know where to find mr pericles she pursued and if you will come to him with me he is sure to be very angryi thought you might protect me from that but when he hears that i am really going at lastat oncehe can laugh sometimes you will see him rub his hands i must enquire where his chambers are to be found said sir purcell oh anybody in the city must know him because he is so rich emilia coughed this fog kills me pray make haste dear friend i trouble you very much but i want to get away from this i can hardly breathe i shall have no heart for my task if i dont see him soon wait for me then said sir purcell you cannot wait in a better place and i must entreat you to be careful he half alluded to the adjustment of her shawl and to anything else as far as she might choose to apprehend him her dexterity in tossing him the letter unseen by madame marini might have frightened him and given him a dread that albeit woman there was germ of wickedness in her this pained him acutely for he never forgot that she had been the means of his introduction to cornelia from whom he could not wholly dissociate her and the idea that any prospective shred of impurity hung about one who had even looked on his beloved was utter anguish to the keen sentimentalist be very careful he would have repeated but that he had a warning sense of the ludicrous and emilias large eyes when they fixed calmly on a face were not of a flighty east she stood too with the dignity of sadness as he was pleased to phrase it she must be safe here he said to himself and yet upon reflection he decided not to leave her peremptorily informing her to that effect emilia took his arm and as they were passing through the hall of entrance they met the same gentleman who had directed them to the spot of quiet both she and sir purcell heard him say to a companion there she is a deep glow covered emilias face do they know you asked sir purcell no she said and then he turned but the couple had gone on that deserves chastisement he muttered briefly telling her to wait he pursued them emilia was standing in the gateway not at all comprehending why she was alone sandra belloni struck her ear looking forward she perceived a hand and a head gesticulating from a cab window she sprang out into the street and instantly the hand clenched and the head glared savagely it was mr pericles himself in travelling costume i am your fool he began overbearing emilias most irritating how are you and are you quite well i am your fool hein you send me to paris to geneve i go over lago maggiore and aha it is your joke meess i juste return oh capital at milano i waiti enquiretill a letter from old belloni and i learn i am your foolof you all jomp in a gentleman is coming said emilia by no means intimidated though the forehead of mr pericles looked portentous he was bringing me to you zen jomp in cried mr pericles here sir purcell came up emilia said softly mr pericles there was the form of a bow of moderate recognition between them but other hats were off to emilia the two gentlemen who had offended sir purcell had insisted on learning the nature of their offence that they had a right to present their regrets to the lady in person and beg an excuse from her lips sir purcell stood white with a futile effort at selfcontrol as one of them preluding pardon me said i had the misfortune to remark to my friend as i passed you there she is may i indeed ask your pardon my friend is an artist i met him after i had first seen you he at least does not think foolish my recommendation to him that he should look on you at all hazards let me petition you to overlook the impertinence i think gentlemen you have now made the most of the advantage my folly in supposing you would regret or apologize fittingly for an impropriety has given you interposed sir purcell his new and superior tone for he had previously lost his temper and spoken with a silly vehemence caused them to hesitate one begged the word of pardon from emilia to cover his retreat she gave it with an air of thoroughbred repose saying i willingly pardon you and looking at them no more whereupon they vanished ten minutes later emilia and sir purcell were in the chambers of mr pericles the greek had done nothing but grin obnoxiously to every word spoken on the way drawing his hand down across his jaw to efface the hard pale wrinkles and eyeing emilias cavalier with his shrewdest suspicious look you will excusehe pointed to the confusion of the room they were in and the heap of unopened lettersi am from ze continent i do not expect ze pleasure a seat mr pericles handed chairs to his visitors it is a climate is it not he resumed emilia said a word and he snapped at her immediately adding hein ah so with a charming urbanity how lucky that we should meet you exclaimed emilia we were just coming to youto find out i mean where you were and call on you ough do not tell me lies said mr pericles clasping the hollow of his cheeks between thumb and forefinger allow me to assure you that what miss belloni has said is perfectly correct sir purcell remarked mr pericles gave a short bow it is ze same i am much obliged and you have just come from italy said emilia where you did me ze favour to send me it is true sanks oh what a difference between italy and this emilia turned her face to the mottled yellow windows many sanks repeated mr pericles after which the three continued silent for a time at last emilia said bluntly i have come to ask you to take me to italy mr pericles made no sign but sir purcell leaned forward to her with a gaze of astonishment almost of horror will you take me persisted emilia still the sullen greek refused either to look at her or to answer because i am ready to go she went on i want to go at once today if you like i am getting too old to waste an hour mr pericles uncrossed his legs ejaculating what a fog ah and that was all he rose and went to a cupboard sir purcell murmured hurriedly in emilias ear have you considered what youve been saying yes yes it is only a journey emilia replied in a like tone a journey my father wishes it your mother hush i intend to make him take the madre with me she designated mr pericles who had poured into a small liqueur glass some green chartreuse smelling strong of pines his visitors declined to eject the london fog by this aid of the mountain monks and mr pericles warmed himself alone you are wiz old belloni he called out i am not staying with my father said emilia where mr pericles shed a baleful glance on sir purcell i am staying with signor marini servente mr pericles ducked his head quite low while his hand swept the floor with an imaginary cap malice had lighted up his features and finding after the first burst of sarcasm that it was vain to indulge it toward an absent person he altered his style look he cried to emilia it is marini stops you and old bellonia conspirator aha is it for an artist to conspire and be carbonaro and kiss books and mon dieu bon it is marini plays me zis trick i mark him i mark him i say he is paid by young pole i hold zat family in my hand i say so i go to be met by you and on i go to italy i get a letter at milano marini stop me at dover signed giuseppe belloni ze letter have been spied into by ze austrians i am watchedi am doggedi am imprisonedi am examined you know zis giuseppe belloni meine herrn he was to come i leave word at paris for him at geneve at stresa to bring his daughter to ze conservatoire for which i pay she has a voiceor she had has exclaimed emilia had mr pericles repeated she has zen sing with which thunder of command mr pericles gave up his vindictive narration of the points of his injuries sustained and pitching into a chair pressed his fingers to his temples frowning attention his eyes were on the floor presently he glanced up and saw emilias chest rising quickly no voice issued it is to commence cried mr pericles hein now sing emilia laid her hand under her throat not now oh not now when you have told me what those austrians did to you i want to hear i am very anxious to hear and what they said of my father how could he have come to milan without a passport he had only a passport to paris and at paris i leave instructions for ze procuration of a passport over lombardy am i not antonio pericles agriolopoulos sing i say ah but what voices you must have heard in italy said emilia softly i am afraid to sing after them si i dare not she panted little in keeping with the cajolery of her tones but she had got mr pericles upon a theme serious to his mind not a voice not one he cried stamping his foot all is french i go twice wizin six monz and if i go to a gooseyard i hear better oh yes it is tunetatatatititito and of ze heartwhere is zat mon dieu i despair i see music go dead let me hear you sandra his enthusiasm had always affected emilia and painfully since her love had given her a consciousness of infidelity to her art but now the pathetic appeal to her took away her strength and tears rose in her eyes at the thought of his faith in her his repetition of her namethe sandra being uttered with unwonted softnessplunged her into a fit of weeping ah mr pericles shouted see what she has come to and he walked two or three paces off to turn upon her spitefully she will be vapeurs nerfs i know not when it wants a physique of a saint sandra belloni he added gravely lift up ze head sing sempre al tuo santo nome emilia checked her tears his hand being raised to beat time she could not withstand the signal semprethere came two struggling notes to which another clung shuddering like two creatures on the deeps she stopped herself oddly calling out stop stop who donc mr pericles postured an indignant interrogation i mean i must stop emilia faltered its the fog i cannot sing in this fog it chokes me apparently mr pericles was about to say something frightfully savage which was restrained by the presence of sir purcell he went to the door in answer to a knock while emilia drew breath as calmly as she might her head moving a little backward with her breathing in a sad mechanical way painful to witness sir purcell stretched his hand out to her but she did not take it she was listening to voices at the door was it really mr pole who was there quite unaware of the effect the sight of her would produce on him emilia rose and walked to the doorway she heard mr pole abusing mr pericles half banteringly for his absence while business was urgent saying that they must lay their heads together and consult otherwisea significant indication appeared to close the sentence but if youve just come off your journey and have got a lady in there we must postpone i suppose say this afternoon ill keep up to the mark if nothing happens emilia pushed the door from the hand of mr pericles and was advancing toward the old man on the landing but no sooner did the latter verify to his startled understanding that he had seen her than with an exclamation of all right goodbye he began a rapid descent of the stairs a distance below he bade mr pericles take care of her and as an excuse for his abrupt retreat the word busy sounded up does my face frighten him emilia thought it made her look on herself with a foreign eye this is a dreadful but instructive piece of contemplation acting as if the rich warm blood of self should have ceased to hug about us and we stand forth to be dissected unresistingly all emilias vital strength now seemed to vanish at the renewal of mr pericles peremptory mandate for her to sing she could neither appeal to him nor resist but raising her chest she made her best effort and then covered her face this was done less for concealment of her shame stricken features than to avoid sight of the stupefaction imprinted upon mr pericles again zat a flat he called sternly she tried it again again she did her utmost to accomplish the task if you have seen a girl in a fit of sobs elevate her head with hardshut eyelids while her nostrils convulsively take in a long breath as if for speech but it is expended in one quick vacant sigh you know how emilia looked and it requires a humane nature to pardon such an aspect in a person from whom we have expected triumphing glances and strong thrilling tones what is zis mr pericles came nearer to her he would listen to no charges against the atmosphere commanding her to give one simple run of notes a contralto octave he stood over her with keenly watchful eyes sir purcell bade him observe her distress i am much obliged mr pericles bowed she is ruined i have suspected ha but i ask for a note one this imperious signal drew her to another attempt the deplorable sound that came sent emilia sinking down with a groan basta basta so it is zis tale said mr pericles after an observation of her huddled shape did i not say his voice was so menacingly loud and harsh that sir purcell remarked this is not the time to repeat itpardon mewhatever you said ze foolshe play ze fool sir i forget ze christianah purcelli say she play ze fool and look at her why is it she comes to me now a dozen times i warn her to italy to italy all is ready you will have a place at ze conservatorio no she refuse i say go and you are a queen you are a prima at twenty and europe is beneas you no she refuse and she is ruined what i say what zat dam silly smile mean oh no i am not lazy but you area fool oh no and what are you zen and what shall you do nussing nussing nussing and dam zere is an end emilia had caught blindly at sir purcells hand by which she raised herself and then uncovering her face looked furtively at the malign furnacewhite face of mr pericles it cannot have goneshe spoke as if mentally balancing the possibility it has gone i say and you know why mademoiselle ze fool mr pericles retorted no no it cant be gone gone voices never go the reiteration of the you know why from mr pericles and all the wretchedness of loss it suggested robbed her of the little spark of nervous fire by which she felt halfreviving in courage and confidence let me try once more she appealed to him in a frenzy mr pericles though fully believing in his heart that it might only be a temporary deprivation of voice affected to scout the notion of another trial but finally extended his forefinger well now start sempre al tuo santo commence sem and mr pericles hummed the opening bar not as an unhopeful man would do the next moment he was laughing horribly emilia to make sure of the thing she dreaded forced the note and would not be denied what voice there was in her came to the summons it issued if i may so express it ragged as if it had torn through a briarhedge then there was a whimper of tones and the effect was like the lamentation of a hardlyused urchin lacking a certain music that there is in his undoubted heartfelt earnestness no single note poised firmly for the instant but swayed trembling on its neighbour to right and to left when pressed for articulate sound it went into a ghastly whisper the laughter of mr pericles was pleasing discord in comparison etext editors bookmarks am i ill i must be hungry depreciating it after the fashion of chartered hypocrites fine shades were still too dominant at brookfield he thinks that the country must be saved by its women as well i know that your father has been hearing tales told of me my voice i have my voice emilia had cried it out to herself she had great awe of the word business

have to do it byandby when i am captain charles stewart and so as i have been sent to school to prepare for my work in the world byandby this will be helping in the preparation mamma often talks about my work in the world but i am almost sure there is no sea in the world she is thinking about while to mewell the sea is all the world to me but mamma wants me to forget it and all uncle alfreds wonderful stories about it and that is why i have been sent here to school but tom haslitt is with me and is not likely to let me forget uncle and his sea yarns tom is to be my lieutenant byandby and as he will have to help with the ships log then he is to take a turn with this it was kind of mamma to arrange for tom and i to have this little bedroomcabin i meanall to ourselves but i am afraid she would not be pleased to see how we have rigged it up considering that she wants me to mount uncle charless office stool byandby i hope that tarred yarn tom has stowed away under the bed dont smell too strong the compasses and charts and bits of boats weve got hanging about are pretty ornaments and byandby when we get our ship finished our little cockloft will be furnished i cant say much about the fellows here at present but they look a very quiet lot and one with fair hair certainly ought to have it put in curlpapers every night i shant have much to say to him i know give him a wide berth and stick close to tom if we could only have gone somewhere else some school where they train sailors i might learn something but it will do me no good to come here im sure and ive told mamma so october ththe captain says i must help with the log id rather heave up a couple of hammocks here and bundle these bedsteads out of the window but i suppose we may look out for squalls if we do too much in the nautical line for charley has got into a scrape already what they want to keep housemaids for at a boys school i cant think unless it is that they may go poking about where they are not wanted im sure that rope yarn did not smell much but she found it out that housemaid did and when charley tried to get it back there was a row the fellows here are not so bad when you come to know them but i dont think i shall ever like the governorthe doctor as everybody calls himor the under masters either although i think we shall be able to do very much as we like here as we have done at home at least charley and i mean to have our own way in most things if we possibly can october thwhat a place this is for rows everybody looks as mild as turnips from the governor down to the housemaid that took our yarn but looks are deceitful i suppose at least tom and i wont have such a pleasant easy time as we expected if things get much worse i shall write and ask mamma to fetch me home im sure she wouldnt let me stop if i didnt like it for i have always had my own way about everything but this sea scheme and like all mothers shes afraid of the sea of coursethinks it a monster that will certainly swallow me up i dont know what to make of the governor yesterday he called me into his room and gave me a private lecture about duty and conscience and a lot more about my lessons never being properly learned and about school being a little world where character was tested and made stronger and nobler or worse according as we used our opportunities or yielded to our temptations i told tom all about it afterwards and we laughed over it together but i cannot forget it or the grave earnest way in which the governor spokeexactly as though he knew that tom and i had made up our minds not to learn more than we were obliged october thtom hates keeping the log but i tell him he will have to do it byandby and so he ought to get his hand in now but he says weve come to school to have a good time and as much fun as we can well so we have i suppose at least that was all i thought about it until lately but somehow mammas talk about preparing for our lifework and the governors talk about it being a test and trial of character have got mixed up in my mind and it has made me remember that mamma is not rich and that i am her only child and i shall have to work byandby i mean to work and take care of her buy a carriage for her to ride in and everything she wants when i am a captain and have made my fortune but i am afraid i shall have to begin by running away to sea ive quite made up my mind to do it for mamma is more than a little unreasonable about this she wont even let me talk about it to her but there i wont grumble shes a dear mother and reasonable enough in everything else and has always let me have my own way about most things tom has got himself into another scrape and the governor has threatened to separate ussend tom to another room and put another fellow in here i should write home to the mater at once if he did that for it would upset everything and the place would be unbearable some of the fellows grumbled too yesterday that we were always in the shed they call the workshop instead of in the playground what is it to them if we like to make boats instead of throwing a ball about we can do as we like in the playground i suppose i hate cricket that they make such a fuss about here and if they drag me into playing it theyll soon find im no good and wish me out again october ththis is the last chance i shall get of writing in charleys log i expect for i am to be turned out of his cabin and miss chandos is to take my place i mean to call him miss in the playground now as well as between ourselves for i hate the thought of his taking my place here i wonder how charley will like the young lady miss chandos dont seem to like the prospect much more than i do but we dare not rebel charley is packing up my traps while i do the log grumbling all the time and threatening to serve out miss chandos the young lady will not have it all her own way i can tell her there will be lively times with her and charley i wish i could stay and see the fun but i shall hear all about it tomorrow and charley has promised to put it all down in the log he says it will be good fun to read this log over to ourselves byandby we mean to keep it to read on board our ship of an evening and many a good laugh we shall have over it i dare say i wonder whether we shall ever laugh at this turn out i dont think i ever shall for charley and i have always been chums ever since i can remember so that it seems likelike something dreadful to have him turned over to miss chandos october ndno more of dear old toms sprawling writing in our log for i wouldnt take it down into the schoolroom for the other fellows to see no not for anything yes poor toms gone and miss chandos has arrived i soon let her know what sort of a welcome she was likely to have from me toms traps had hardly been bundled out before the housemaid came with her hands full and whitefaced miss chandos behind her is this your ladys maid miss chandos i asked does she curl your hair and powder your face his face was scarlet enough then but he only said thank you ann if you will put down those things i will put them into their places oh ann i said with a sniff you had better come back ann and bring the curlpapers or do you use curlingirons i asked ann looked indignant and chandos too but neither said a word and she went out of the room when we were left to ourselves and chandos had put away some of his things he suddenly turned round and said i hope we shall be friends stewart i hardly knew what to say for a minute for i felt surprised and half ashamed of myself but thinking of tom and what he expected to hear i made a mock bow and replied gentlemen must always be friends with a young lady tom and i will be delighted miss chandos and then i stopped for such a look came into his fair girlface as never was seen in a girls face before i fancy there was no more said and i went downstairs feeling somehow as though i had not got the best of it after all and that i might even be mistaken in thinking miss chandos such a coward but after a little time spent in the playground with tom i forgot miss chandos and her looks until tom reminded me of it and i promised to let him know everything that happened of course something was bound to happen then how could i meet tom in the morning and tell him the young lady had slept in peace and everything had passed off comfortably but what could i do tom and i generally had some fun throwing our clothes at each other or shooting paper pellets from under the bedclothes after we had scrambled into bed until swain came and took the light away and then we ducked our heads down and went to sleep but there was no telling whether miss chandos would tumble into bed as quickly as we did i certainly was not surprised to see her sit down and take up a book that lay on the drawers and begin to read i let her read in peace for about five minutes and then snatched it away and flung it across the room i really did not see that it was a bible until it was out of my hand but i did not mean to let chandos know that or that i felt sorry for throwing it dont do that again stewart he said as he went to pick it up and i burst out laughing to hide my vexation and asked when ann was coming to do his hair he took no notice of my question and i tumbled into bed wondering what chandos would do next i had my peashooter and a good supply of pellets ready for whatever happened but i certainly expected to see him follow my example and tumble into bed but instead of doing this he kneeled down at the side of the bed as though i had not been there which rather startled me for i thought he would and ought to be afraid to attempt it after what i had already done i waited a minute or two and then taking a good aim hit him right in the back of the neck it made him start i could see and i laughed though i expected he would jump up and give me a good pommelling the next minute for it was clear he was no coward as i had thought at first and he would never have a better chance of pitching in if he meant to fight it out but no she kept on and so did ipop pop pop at his head and the back of his neck until it tingled again i know but she wouldnt complain wanted to make believe she hadnt felt it and said good night as though i was the most civil and obliging companion in the world it was plucky anyhow and i like pluck but we shall see who gives in first miss chandos it will take a good deal to make me tire of peashooting i can tell you and it will be good practice too october thhow tom and i have laughed over that plucky miss chandos i am not sure that the fellow deserves to be called miss either for he is plucky right through i knowthe sort of fellow that would walk up to a cannons mouth without flinching if he was a soldier and it was his duty what a splendid sailor he would make i could fancy him steering his ship right under the enemys guns if it was necessary but never yielding an inch or knowing when he was beaten hes beaten me at peashooting and made me feel ashamed of myself i wonder what miss chandos is going to bea parson i should think and he means to do his lifework thoroughly and is beginning now as i am in keeping this log it seems queer that we shall all be men very soonsome sailors some soldiers some lawyers and some tied to a merchants desk which is mothers highest ambition for me she talks grandly sometimes about merchant princes and how uncle will give me a share in his business but i always try to get out of the way for i mean to run away to sea when the time comes and i hate to be a hypocrite october thanother row i knew it would come if they turned us out of our workshop but the best of the fun is they dont know who has been up to this mischief though tom and i are both suspected i believe for a wonder though i had no hand in this i only wish i had tom managed cleverly too to turn all the farmyard out as he didpigs and cows ducks and hens and didnt they enjoy their hours feast in the garden i fancy i see the governor now as he came rushing out in time to see the last of his dahlias disappear and then the whooping and helterskelter charge of the servants with the governor at the head of the fray this will be something to laugh over many a night when the wind is blowing great guns and we are pitching and tossing so that it is impossible to read or write up the ships log which we shall have to keep then the picture of todays fun will rise up before us long after everybody else has forgotten it plucky tom i wish i had had a share of the fun in setting the animals at liberty i dont dare ask how he did it all yet for the fuss is at its height and everybody is being questioned of course suspicions go for nothing and nobody really saw who did it and so tom is not likely to be found out unless he splits himself which is not very probable unless somebody else is charged with it and then of course he would make a clean breast of it chapter ii disenchantment november stchandos has got himself into a scrape and nobody seems to know what it is about i have asked several of the fellows but they only shake their heads and tell me i know more about it than they do i am sure i do not but as chandos shares my room they think i must be in his secrets i suppose i cannot help wondering what it issomething that has got the governors back up awfully i can see chandos has been locked up all day in the punishmentroom and nobody seems to know whether he will be let out tonight i wish i was sure he was not coming and i would try to get tom in here and wed have some fun for once i wonder what the young lady has been up to november thi have not written up my log for a fortnight and now i have only a miserable tale to tell at first i thought id give up the log as tom will never be my lieutenant now to laugh over it but ill keep on with it a bit longer i thought we should often laugh over toms setting the farmyard at liberty as he did but somehow it seems to have been a dreadful trouble to everybody but no one can feel just as i do about it for it has taken my old chum away from me and we can never be again what we have been what did they want to make such a fuss about it for and punish miss chandos the governor must have been as blind as a mole to think chandos had anything to do with it it was ever so long before i found out the tops and bottoms of the business but at last i found one of the juniors could tell something and i got him by himself and threatened to break every bone in his skin if he didnt shell out all he knew and then it came out that he had seen chandos close to the farmyard just before the animals were turned out and the miserable little muff had gone with that tale to the governor as soon as the row began but you know it wasnt chandos i said thinking he must have seen tom too wasnt it said the youngster i gave him a shake and ran off to chandos who was just going into the cricketfield whats this row about you and the farmyard miss chandos i said he seems to be getting used to his name and only said oh its all right now stewart do you know who did turn the things out i said do you he asked i nodded it wasnt you and i didnt think you knew anything about it suspicions go for nothing you know well let this pass its over now and lets drop it but youve been punished for what you had no hand in did the governor think you did it i dont think he believed i actually did it myself but he said i was worse than those who did it if i was screening them for i was encouraging insubordination in the school do you know who was suspected stewart me yes i cleared you at once but i couldnt say any more and that vexed dr mellor oh the doctor be hanged why didnt you go to tom and tell him the fix you was in i suppose you knew he did it i couldnt help knowing it where i was and i did contrive to say a word to him about going to the doctor but you told tom you were to be punished for his fault and he wouldnt make a clean breast of it to the governor i said angrily there i told you it was better to let it pass stewart you could do no good now said chandos walking away but a sudden thought had seized me and i placed myself in his path but you shall give me a plain answer to my question i said not that i will believe it of tom it is you that are the sneak you look one with your white face and quiet ways and i know you are only trying to set me against my old chum i was almost mad with rage and longed to knock chandos down and for a minute he looked as though he would fight it out but the next he had pushed me aside and was striding on to take his place as longstop in the game that was just beginning i looked after him for a minute thinking i would go and have it out when i suddenly thought of going to tom and turned back to the workshop where tom was busy hacking at some wood for a rudder i say old fellow did chandos tell you he was taking your punishment for the farmyard scrape i asked oh never mind chandos come and rub down this mast said tom turning away thenhedidtellyou i said slowly didnt you know chandos was a sneak before today said tom sharply butbut tell me all about it tom i said rubbing my eyes and feeling as though i must be dreaming oh there aint much to tellnothing to make such a fuss about the fellow came to me and said he had got into a scrape through the things getting out but of course i didnt believe him this was an easy way of getting me into a row as well as helping himself out but tom if he took your punishment you know bah my punishment the governor isnt such a duffer as to think that whitefaced milksop did that mischief he hasnt pluck enough i always told you he was a sneak and now hes proved it for he said the thing should always be a secret between us whether i told or not and now hes run openmouthed to you with the tale no he hasnt and without another word i walked out of the workshop i didnt feel as though i wanted to fight tom it didnt seem as though i could fight for i couldnt understand things a bit somehow theyd got so mixed up in this row that tom seemed to be chandos and chandos tom and whether i should wake and find they were all right or tom running about with chandoss head on his shoulders i couldnt tell for a little while but presently chandos came walking through the gate on which i was mounted and certainly he had his own strawcoloured hair safe enough he didnt condescend to look at me as he passed and i felt as though i hated him for robbing me of tom what right had he to do ithe with that white face to be so plucky and not even for a friend either for tom is no friend to him any more than i am and all the school have adopted our private name and call him miss chandos it isnt as though he didnt care about it either for i can see he does no boy likes to be thought a girl or have a girls name tacked to him and chandos is like the rest but he takes it quietly although i fancy now he would be as good in a standup fight as tom himself bother tom i dont want to think about him now i wish he had left the pigs and cows alone or i hadnt been in such a fume to find out all about it i dont like to think he has been mean and cowardlymy brave bold tom anyhow i shall always hate miss chandos for her share in the matter and ill call her miss chandos more than ever now its been a miserable time somehow ever since i heard the tops and bottoms of this row for though tom and i have never said a word about it since we both seem to remember it always and we keep apart as we never did before november thall the school is in a ferment about a special prize that is to be given for the best essay on something or other im not going to try so it dont trouble me much but it seems as though everybody else is and they can talk of nothing else even tom is going in for this it seems though he dont stand much chance i fancy but he wants a watch and thinks he may as well try for this the weather is dull and cold and our shipbuilding is almost at a standstill we havent done much since that row and things are altogether miserable tom seems to be making new friends among the other fellows and ive dropped shooting at miss chandos and hiding her bible so that altogether im rather glum and ready to quarrel with anybody that is good for a standup fight i know everybody thinks me a bear and i am i think for i dont care for anybody or anything now november thit seems as though there was never to be an end to this row which has made everything so miserable for me the governor has taken it into his head to consider the matter still unsettled although chandos took toms punishment and now poor chandos has been told that he cant try for this prize its the meanest shame for chandos stood as good a chance as anybody if not better than most and now he isnt to be allowed that chance he tries to hide his disappointment but i know he had begun to read up and yesterday i asked him if he didnt mean to split on tom and tell the governor all about it i wish haslitt would do it himself he said it would be better for everybody if he did of course it would and ill tell him so and the governor too if you wont no no dont do that stewart the school would send you to coventry if you split on another fellow about anything and besides well what more can the school do i asked angrily oh nothing only your splitting would do no good now i fancy well tom shall make a clean breast of it and give up his chance of this prize it aint much of a chance for him and so it wont be much for him to give it up but youll get it chandosat least i hope you will and then i ran off to find tom and have it out with him i hardly knew how to begin but i did it somehow and then tom said crossly what a fuss you make about nothing i suppose miss chandos has set you on has she taught you to say your prayers yet saying my prayers has nothing to do with this tom you know that oh hasnt it i thought the young lady was making a milksop of you youve been so glum lately now look here tom i havent told you what i thought about this sneakish business but i will if you dont make a clean breast of it to the governor at once well who cares what you think said tom laughing and he tried to push past me but i wasnt going to have that now look here old fellow we have been chums for ever so long and i never knew you to do anything mean before and i believe youre sorry for this now make a clean breast of it tom and let miss chandos go in for this prize has she told you shes sure to get it no of course not but you know shed stand a good chancea better chance than you do i dont know so much about that and i dont see why i should give up my chance just to suit your whims it wouldnt help miss chandos either yes it would the governor wants to get at the bottom of this farmyard affair and that is why he is so hard on poor chandos poor chandos the young lady has bewitched you charley as if this had anything to do with that old row she knows how to come it over you the mean sneak as though she didnt know this was for another affair altogether i dont believe it tom dont you ask some of the other fellows then here jackson what did you tell me miss chandos had been doing to lose her chance of the prize called tom i dont know now collins told me it was some artful dodge the governor had found out anyhow im glad shes out for the chances will be pretty evenly balanced among us now but chandos always goes in for such a lot of grind that hed be sure to swamp us all do you go in for it stewart he asked im not fond of grind and shouldnt have a ghost of a chance any more than tom has oh well haslitt will pass muster i dare say but we aint much afraid of him laughed jackson as he ran away i tell you the fellows will kick up no end of a row now if they find i gave up for chandos to go in not that i think he would mind hes a sneak and has just told you this to hide something he has been doing himself well i shouldnt care for what the fellows said tom they want to keep chandos outa few of them i dont believe they all dojust because they will stand a better chance of the prize and its mean and cowardly and i wouldnt help them in it if i were you but i tell you charley you mustnt go against a lot like this im beginning to find out that you must think of others a bit when you are at school like this andand there tom stopped look here tom it may be all very well to mind what other fellows say a bit but i never knew you to do a mean thing in my life before and i shall wish we had never come here if its going to make you a sneak now who says i am a sneak chandos i suppose no it isnt chandos he hasnt been your chum as i have he didnt know what you were before you came to school and never talks about you only to call me a sneak i suppose no he has never called you a sneak but i do and mean it if you wont go to the governor and make a clean breast of everything it would do no good i tell you charley and the other fellows would be down upon me directly if i did three or four are going in for this prize that wouldnt try if chandos wasnt out i tell you theyd never forgive me if i split now ill promise this charley ill never get into a scrape like it again i wish now id gone to the governor at once about it i wish you had but it isnt too late you know now tom come on at once we shall find him in the library ill go with you if you like i really thought tom would go then but just as we were turning round jackson ran to tell him collins and the rest wanted him and tom went off calling to me its no good charley i cant do it i felt half ashamed to meet chandos after this for he knew i had been to talk to tom and i couldnt bear him to think he was such a sneak as he has been over this but there was no getting out of it for he was standing by the lobby door as i went in and looked at me in such a way that i said crossly why dont you go to the governor yourself and tell him all about it then haslitt wont go no he wont i said this beastly school has made him a sneakhe never was before he never served anybody such a trick and he never would if he hadnt come here well dont get so angry about it stewart my mother says one of the principal uses of a school is to try what mettle we are of we cannot tell whether a character is strong or weak until it has been tried and the temptations and failures at school prepare us better for the temptations of the world afterwards what do i care about the temptations of the world its this school that has spoiled tom and he will never be my chum again and i shall have to look out for another lieutenant for my ship and i rushed off indoors for fear chandos should say any more for i could not bear to hear him speak against tom chapter iii the skating party november thi havent spoken to tom for a week but hes so mixed up with the other fellows now that he dont seem to mind but i am very dull and it makes me very miserable not to have tom working with me at our boats as we used to do i have found out too that chandos is not a general favourite in the school but he has two or three friendschums like tom and i used to bewho seem to be fond of reading and dont get into so many scrapes as toms set i belong to nobody just now i join in a game sometimes when i dont feel too sulky but i miss tom too much to feel pleased with anybody else though chandos and i talk a bit sometimes when we go to bed last night we were talking about prayer fancy boys talking about that but it seems chandos believes it is all as realas real as writing a letter to his mother and as sure of having an answer i was as much surprised as when the doctor talked about us having a conscience for it seems chandos is not going to be a parson after all but is to go into his uncles countinghouse just as mother wants me to do the only difference is that chandos has made up his mind to it because it is his duty he says though he hates it as much as i do and wants to be a doctor awfully i begin to think the world is a dreadful puzzle why cant people do just what they like instead of being driven to do what they hate so often chandos is a firstrate sort of fellow too i think in spite of his white face and curly hair and yet hes got to do what he dont like so that being good dont seem to have much to do with it though my old nurse used to say good boys were always happy well im not good anyhow so its not very wonderful that im pretty miserable only tom seems happy enough and he ought to be miserable too which is another of the puzzles i suppose december theverybody is essay madthat is all the fellows in our class who have gone in for it chandos and i never talk about it to each other but i know he is disappointed for he was ill the first part of this half and so he will have no prizes to take home at christmas i suppose i should be disappointed too if i was one of the fellows that grind but i dont see the use of it and so prizes dont come in my way not but what i should like to please mamma and she would be pleased i know if such a wonder was to happen but then i hate books unless they are about the sea or something of that sort i shall be glad when the holidays are here now i should not like to confess it even to tom but i want to see my mother and ask her some of the questions that have puzzled me lately then there is always lots of fun at christmas and there has been so little here another week and this essay fuss will be over and then the fellows will talk about the other prizes and going home and i shall try to forget all the bother and toms share in it too if i can i wonder who will get this essay prizenot tom i am certain december thtom has got the prize i cannot understand it one bit i know he has gone in for lots of grind lately like the other fellows but there were two or three that i felt sure would be better up to that kind of work than he was i cannot feel glad that he has won it and i have not told him i am and some of the fellows that were most urgent for him to go in have scarcely spoken to him since i wonder whether they think as i do that this watch should of right belong to chandos tom and i are going home together no one at home knows anything of what has happened and i shall not tell them if i can help it chandos has asked me to go and see him in the holidays and i mean to ask mamma to let him come to our house i think i shall like that better than going to his place for i fancy his people are dreadfully religious and we know nothing about that sort of thing but i dont like to be thought quite a heathen january ththe holidays are over and we are back at school in our old places once more tom has taken up the notion that i am envious of his good luck in getting the watch good luck i call it bad luck for it was a bad business altogether and i let out something about this at home but mamma only thought it was one of our ordinary quarrels i went to see chandos in the holidays he has several brothers and sisters one of them has come back with him to school and is among the juniors although he is only a year or two younger than his brother but he has been delicate and is very backward and so was obliged to go into the lower division of the school i like mrs chandos very much she is religious after a different pattern from my aunt phoebe and somehow everything seems so real about her that i dont wonder chandos believes everything she says but i dont mean to like chandos too much he is all very well but he is not tom and can never be my lieutenant i had a talk to mamma about going to sea but she is as obstinate as ever i told chandos of this when he came to see me and he said then i am afraid you will have to give it up stewart give it up give up the sea you dont know what you are talking about chandos yes i do for i wanted to be a doctor quite as badly as you want to go to sea but when my father died and my mother told me how impossible it was that my wish could be gratified i set to work at once to conquer it set to work to conquer it but how could you do that i said ii began in the only way i could i asked god to help me for my mothers sake to overcome the selfish desire and make me willing to do all i could to learn what was necessary to be a merchant but you dont hate the idea of being chained to a desk as i do or you wouldnt talk so coolly about it not now but i did hate it quite as much as you can stewart but i remembered that my mother was not rich when my father died we were very much reduced and if i should offend my uncle by refusing this offer he might refuse to help the younger ones byandby and so you see it was my duty to forget myself and my own wishes and do what i could to help my mother but my mother does not need my help and so i dont see why i should give up everything i want if you do your mother may not want your help but she wants you you are her only son andand shall i tell youi have heard of such things happening you knowshe may break her heart if you run away to sea you would not do that stewart break her heart kill my mother chandos you know me better than that yes i do stewart and that is why i have spoken in time but i have heard of boys going to sea and coming home expecting to find everything as they left it and finding mother and father both deadkilled by grief for the runaway oh thats all twaddle you know chandos nobody ever really died of a broken heart i said then you mean to try the experiment on your mother very well stewart if you will you will i know only beware of the consequences for if the twaddle should prove truth it would cause you lifelong unhappiness afterwards this ended his lecture and i made up my mind to forget it as soon as i could but somehow it mixes itself up with everything and try as i will i cannot forget it of course i dont want to run away if i can persuade mamma to let me go to sea properly but if she wont what am i to do i cant and wont go to be perched up at an office desk all day and so there will be nothing else i can do but cut and run some fine morning of course i shall write to mamma just before i sail and tell her im all right and jolly and when she knows that shell soon be all right tom and i have talked over the plan dozens of times for he was to come with me only somehow i dont want him so much now though his watch might be handy to sell if we were short of money on the road for i suppose we should have to go to liverpool or plymouth or southampton or some of those places bother chandos making me feel uncomfortable about it but there im not going to run away today and so ill forget the whole bother january that last we are going to have some fun it has been freezing splendidly these two days and if the governor hadnt been a duffer he would have let us go out on the ice today for there is a firstrate pondtwo or three in factclose by and i know the ice will bear but he has promised we shall go tomorrow and everybody has been looking up skates in readiness i hope it will not thaw tonight for we are all looking forward to the fun we shall have tomorrowall but chandos and he has taken it into his head that his brother ought to stay at home as he has a cold but chandos junior has a will of his own i can see and i mean to help him to stand out against his brothers coddling and give miss chandos a fright into the bargain if i can it will be good fun to coax the youngster to go to another pond especially if one happens to be labelled dangerous i fancy i can see his brother now running about like a hen after her brood of ducklings for he does fuss after this youngster as though he was different from other boys and ill stop it if i can february thi wonder whether i can put down in my log all that has happened i shall try for i am very dull today sitting up here alone while the others are in school it did not thaw as everybody feared it would and we started for the ponds in good time swain and the other master with us for the governor would not trust us alone which made some of the fellows pretty wild and they vowed swain should not come for nothing just before we started tom came tearing across the playground to me and said youve split on chandos junior split on him what do you mean i dont often speak to the youngster you and your set know more about him than i do i said yes but you and miss chandos are as thick as thieves and you know he did not want young frank to go today yes i do know that and i said if i was frank i wouldnt be coddled to that tune what of that why chandos has locked him up or something for he isnt here locked up your grandmother how could he do that without appealing to the governor and you know chandos is not likely to do that now the youngster will turn up presently unless he has made up his mind to do as his brother wishes and declares himself on the sicklist there are three to stay indoors you know yes but young chandos wont stay if he can help it weve laughed him out of thattold him the school calls his brother a young lady for his meek ways and the sooner he breaks away from her apronstring the better well chandos is too fussy i said but dont lead the youngster into any harm tom ill help with some fun just to give chandos a fright you know bravo charley jackson was just talking about the same thing and well do it now and we both rushed off to jackson and the rest to inquire if they had seen anything of the youngster its what i call confoundedly selfish if chandos has stopped the young prig from coming out said one of the fellows chandos aint selfish i said for though i felt cross with chandos myself i did not care to hear him run down by toms set well i dont know what you would call it but if somebody tried to make me stay at home the only day we are likely to have any fun on the ice i should feel ready to punch him i dont believe chandos junior will stay but now what are you going to do with him when he comes do with him do you think we want to eat him stewart no i dont suppose you do but mind theres to be no harm doneno sousing him or anything of that sort if its just a bit of fun to give chandos senior a fright ill be in it i should think you would for things are awfully slow here now tom says you used to be up to anything but since miss chandos there we wont talk about that tom knows all about it if you dont and i was just turning away when frank chandos ran towards us with his skates in his hand looking angry and defiant at his brother who had followed him half across the playground a few minutes afterwards we started for the ponds in groups and knots of twos and threes all laughing and chattering together the masters at the head and leading the way to the broadest and shallowest now boys i think you can skate and slide to your hearts delight here but mind dr mellor has given orders that no one is to go to the pond round by the alder bushes for there are dangerous holes in it as you all know and if the ice should breakwell you know what the consequences are likely to be all right sir well keep clear of that said two or three as they were fastening the straps of their skates while some who had already begun sliding laughed at the notion of the ice breaking it is as firm as the schoolroom floor and one is as likely to give way as the other i dont believe the governor would have let us come here at all if all the ponds hadnt been safe i said safe of course theyre safe the governor knows that only he must tell us something by way of a scare hes as bad as miss chandos said tom where is the young lady i said and the youngster we must look after them we were off now spinning across the pond tom and i with jackson close behind and the three of us managed to keep together what a lark it would be to take chandos junior to the alder pond said jackson looking at me as he wheeled round on his skates well do it i said but not just now wait a bit till the fellows get warm to the work and they wont miss us we must keep our eye on the youngster is he skating or sliding skating but that dont matter said tom no but if chandos senior had the skates on it would be all the better they are his skates too i happen to know that and so i shall tell master frank presently that he ought not to stick to them for the whole afternoon i see if chandos senior should happen to see us he will not be able to fly to the rescue of his duckling at once but look here stewart well manage so that he dont know anything about it oh no we wont i want him to see us to tease him a bit i say jackson are you a judge of ice dont you think this seems to be giving a bit i said no its as firm as a rock what ice would give in such a cutting wind as this and jackson pulled his comforter closer round his throat as he spoke we were all pretty well wrapped up in greatcoats and mufflers and worsted gloves so that when we had a fall as most of us did every few minutes we had something to break the concussion a little but these heavy things would prove rather awkward if the ice should break and let us through i said something about this to jackson but he laughed at the notion and tom said why what has come to you lately charley you have been tied to miss chandoss apronstring until you have got to be a coward i believe now you are afraid to go to the alder pond am i you shall see about that wheres chandos junior and i wheeled off at once to look for the youngster and see what miss chandos was about and whether swain was likely to have his eye upon our movements i cannot write any more today tomorrow i shall be stronger i hope and then i may finish this story about our skating chapter iv the accident february thit helps to pass some of the time i am obliged to spend alone to write in my log and so i will go on from where i left off yesterday i found everybody was on the ice the masters enjoying the fun as much as the boys and chandos the merriest of the lot he and two or three of his friends were racing curveting cutting figures in the ice for i found that frank had been glad to give up the skates and take to sliding its rather crowded here i said as i ran the youngster down and then stopped and wheeled round to help him up its crowded everywhere and the fellows with skates seem to think they ought to have it all their own way he grumbled come over here there are some good slides at the farther end of the pond and i helped the youngster over purposely going close to miss chandos but she didnt smell mischief or was too much occupied with her own fun to notice us and we soon came up with jackson and the rest its dreadfully cold here said young chandos shivering yes it is cold said tom the wind sweeps down upon us freezing our very marrow if we dont keep moving the best place for sliding would be the alder pond that is sheltered a good deal from this cutting wind said jackson but it isnt safe said frank chandos safe as if theyd let us come near this place at all if all the ponds were not safe i tell you it will bear as well as this said jackson shall we go there proposed tom mr swain said we were not to go near it feebly ventured frank oh well if youre afraid stay where you are but im going said jackson stewart will you come tom will i know yes im off said tom nodding to me but i wanted miss chandos to see where we were taking her duckling to give her a fright the youngster saw me looking towards his brother and said in a whisper if we mean to go eustace had better not see us youre sure its safe he added safe as the schoolroom floor i said and then we went after the others but i kept looking back towards miss chandos as we went towards the alder pond we got out of sight as soon as we could and screened by the closegrowing trees the bitter east wind did not sting us quite so much jackson and tom were soon skimming across the pond i wonder where the holes are they make such a fuss about said tom i dont believe there are any said jackson well holes or no holes i think we had better keep near the edge i said but young chandos did not hear me he says and went at once towards the trees for shelter from the wind the ice was very thin there and the next minute there was a crack a splash and a scream and young chandos had gone down run for help i called to tom and then i skimmed across what i thought was the strongest part of the ice to help frank but before i could reach him the ice gave way and we were both struggling for life i dont remember much of what happened beyond telling frank to catch hold of some of the branches of the trees that were close to the water and hearing the shouts of the boys when tom gave the alarm i could hear them coming but it would be too late to save me for my heavy clothes kept me down in the water and i sank never to rise again i thought i seemed to see my mother at that moment more plainly than i had ever seen her before and to understand her grief for my death in a way that i could not have thought possible but still although i longed to escape for her sake i seemed bound by invisible fetters that were in reality my heavy wet clothes they have told me since that this probably saved me although they thought i was dead when they got me out of the water once out however i soon began to revive for i am strong and healthy but poor frank chandos lay hovering between life and death for nearly a week afterwards i shall never forget that terrible time i felt if he died i should be a murderer for he would never have gone to the alder pond if i had not taken him there poor miss chandos too who had promised his mother to take good care of the lad he was almost stunned with grief and it was not until after his mother had come that he could be persuaded to leave his brother even for five minutes tom and the other fellows who came to see me told me all about it for i was ill too from cold and fright but nothing to cause any alarm and little notice was taken of me or my ailments and i did not let any one know how miserably unhappy i was i tried to talk to tom about it once but he only laughed and said oh its no good crying over spilt milk lets forget all that miserable affair now of course we were all in the wrong box i suppose but then it was only done for a lark and weve all been punished for it pretty stiffly jackson and i had a hundred lines of milton to learn in after hours that took no end of time to get perfect for the governor was so crabby he wouldnt let us off a single word and actually heard us himself so if you dont think that has squared accounts for us then i dont know what will if learning two hundred lines would square things id do it but think of poor frank chandos lying there dying and all our fault how can it be our fault we didnt carry him to the pond he came to please himself and if he wasnt ill hed have an imposition as well as us i wonder whether the doctor will give you one when you get well charley i wish he would i said bitterly oh i dare say its all very well for you to talk when it isnt likely to happen for i expect the governor will think it punishment enough for you to be kept up here and fed on slops for ever so long i dont know myself that i would not rather have the imposition how glad i was when poor chandos came to see me at last i almost wished we really had been girls then that i might have thrown my arms round his neck and kissed him and asked him to forgive me for i could see he felt sorry for me and the first words he spoke were meant to comfort me only somehow they seemed to make me miserable you did not mean to do any harm stewart i know he said his voice shaking as he spoke will he die i asked it dont matter about me and what i meant about it but tell me about him is there any hope chandos not much i am afraid only god can save him the doctor can do no more he says stewart youll pray for him wont youpray that god will give him back to my mother for she is almost heartbroken over it me pray what is the good i dont know how i never prayed in my life ive said my prayers but its different that is from what you mean and i havent done that since i was a little chap then begin again now stewart pray for poor frank i know you feel unhappy about him yes i do id do anything i could but thats just it i cant do anything and it seems mean to go sneaking to god now when i didnt care a pin about the whole business until i got into this trouble and i cant do it oh but you mustnt think of itthink of god in that way if you had been very ill you would have liked your mother sent for wouldnt you and she would have liked to come i am sure yes i expect there will be a row that she was not sent for as it is but what has that to do with it everything god feels as kindly towards us as our mother and father and he wants us to go to him when we are in trouble although we may have kept away before my mother says he often sends trouble to be his messenger and make us come so that he will not be offended if you should begin to pray now i cant chandos its just the meanest business i ever heard of to go sneaking to god whenever im in trouble and cant help myself and forget him directly afterwards but why should you forget him afterwards why not make him your friend as he desires to be what be religious and grumpy and lose all the fun of life i said staring at chandos in amazement you need not be grumpy stewart and you can have just as much fun only i think you will be more careful not to let the fun do harm to other people well i will be more careful in future i promise you that chandos but about being religious why i never heard of a schoolboy being religious unless he was a dreadful muff and a sneaking prig and i hate sneaks of all sorts so do i said chandos and if i thought praying to god and trying to live in fear and love of him would make you one i wouldnt ask you to do it but it wont look here youve heard of general havelock havent you and hedley vicars that fought in the crimean war did you ever hear that they were sneaks or anything but brave noble menbrave enough to serve god openly and fearlessly i tell you stewart it takes a brave man not a coward to declare himself determined to serve god but i have said enough about this perhaps and you look tired my head aches i said but i should soon be all right if i could only know there was a chance for poor frank to get better too i wish i had better news for you stewart my mother and i can only pray for him chandos was going away as he said this but i caught his hand and held him back i will pray too i whispered but if god hears me now how shall i ever keep square afterwards and i must you know to keep from being a sneak look here stewart you are mistaken altogether in thinking gods service such a dreadful bondage he knows you are a boy and does not expect you to be prim and precise and always praying and singing psalms i am not sure that it would not displease him if you tried to do that for he knows it would be a poor preparation for our work in the world byandby but what would he want me to do then i said first of all to think of him as your friend the lord jesus was a boy himself once you know and so he knows all about a boys feelings and temptations almost my fathers last words to me were be honest and upright and pure and i know god will help me to keep my fathers command if i seek his help as he will you if you will take him to be your friend and isnt that what i want i said to be honest and upright and pure i believe you do stewart and its what god wants you to be and what he will help you to be if you will let him but what else must i do religious folks always are different from others you know well they ought to be a religious sailor ought to be the bravest and most fearless man on board the ship and do his work better and more cheerfully than anybody else well my uncle did tell me of a fellow like that once and i thought i should like all my sailors to be like him he was a jolly goodnatured chap ready to spin a yarn to his mates and they were willing to listen to the moral he always contrived to bring in he was as brave as a lion too and yet as kind as a woman if any of the others were sick but there aint many like him you know chandos you might make another stewart and a captainyou mean to be a captain you knowand a captain of that pattern might do as much or even more good than a common sailor yes but its the beginning i dont see that boys have anything to do with religion what can they do learn betterlearn their lessons more thoroughly so as to be better fitted to do their work in the world byandby i suppose youll admit that we shall be men byandby if we are spared well yes of course but then its just that religion seems to be for those who dont live to prepare them for death and all that you know if i was very ill and dying i should want to be religious of course but now thats quite a mistake stewart to suppose that because you are likely to live many years this matter of serving god ought to be put off i might ask you how you can be sure that you will live even six months longer or that you may not be carried off by some sudden accident but i dont like to think of religion as just something to sneak out of the world comfortably with religion is to fit us to liveto live well to fill life full of joy and happiness you stare stewart but i can tell you the happiest people in the world today are those who serve god best then what makes them pull such long faces and look so wretched and talk about being miserable sinners i asked well we are sinners you know stewart and one of the first things we have to learn in coming to god is just this very thing it is because we have sinned that christ died to put away our sins but some people dont seem to believe in this thoroughly they know they are sinners and it makes them unhappy and they fancy they ought to go mourning over them all the days of their life thats just my aunt phoebe and mamma says she is very religious and one of the best women that ever lived which makes me say i hate good women and all religious people into the bargain but chandos there are not many of your sort of religious people in the world more than you think for there are some of the fellows here in this school i wont mention any names but two of the best and jolliest in the cricketfield will be just such men i believe boys here in this school are religious i said of course i know you are but you thought i was the only one stewart well now im glad to say when i came here i found one or two trying to solve the problem you think so improbablehow a schoolboy can serve god and though it may be difficult sometimesi grant you that for temptation to do wrong even in fun must be resisted and then lessons must be learned fairly not shirked and no cribs must be used or else where is our honesty but still if a boy once starts to keep on the square all round things are not so hard as you might think but i must not stop any longer now stewart i will come in and have another chat byandby butbut you will not forget to pray for poor frank forget sometimes i wish i could forget that dreadful day and everything that happened then it isnt often i suppose that such dreadful things happen through a little fun or else it would help chandoss argument about the happiness of not doing wrong even in fun for this has made me miserable enough i wish i could be the sort of fellow chandos talked about its different altogether from what i thought and to be fair and square and honest right through in lessons and everything else has nothing of the sneak about it but i have promised id pray for frank and i mean to do it how am i to begin will god hear me im not good like chandos he saw me shooting the pellets at him from under the bedclothes only a little while ago i suppose and wont he think im mocking chandos now if i kneel down as he did what was it that he said though about the lord jesus being a boy once well if he was hell know all about me and after all its poor frank i want him to help i wouldnt venture to ask him to help me yet i want nothing now so much as for frank to get well after thinking like this for some time i locked the door for fear anybody should come in and see me and then i kneeled down but i dont know what i said only that it was about frank and his getting well and that id try and do the square thing and be honest and upright and pure right through if god would only make him well again chapter v cribs february thi am in the schoolroom again and poor frank chandos is getting better he is to go away as soon as he can be moved but he is too weak even to sit up in bed yet i went to see him yesterday and chandos told him i had prayed that god would make him well again he turned his white face round and looked at me with his big dark eyes and said thank you stewart oh dont do that i didnt mean to do any harm you know but i led you into the mischief and ive been sorry enough ever since and i hope youll forgive me chandos i said but i felt almost frightened when he put out his hand and slipped it into minesuch a thin white hand it was with fingers for all the world like claws i suppose the doctors know best but i should have thought he was dying if mrs chandos had not told me he was looking better chandos seems to expect that im going in for plenty of grind and all that sort of thing well its only fair for i couldnt think of asking god to help me out of a scrape and then forgetting all about it as soon as its over though what a schoolboy can pray about when things are all right i dont know of course i havent done with frank yet for i dont feel so sure about his getting well as the others do he looks awfully thin and white and if god was just to leave off making him well for a day or two hed be as bad as ever i expect february thits awful hard work to grind away like thisas i have the last two days it aint so easy to do lessons on the square when one has been using cribs for ever so long and then grind as much as you may the lessons dont look so well after all when one is a duffer at them as i am yesterday i sat poring over one book for hours and hours trying to make out what it meant i suppose i ought to know well enough by this time for ive learned it all up to there but then ive used cribs and swain dont know that and so he pitched into me and threatened a heavy imposition if ever i took up such another piece of construing its easy enough talking about always doing the square thing and it mightnt be so hard if id always done it but i havent and theres the rub february ththeres no end of a row with the fellows over these cribs ive always used them and i always shall they say and tom backs them and tells them im tied to miss chandoss apronstrings it began about another wretched construe i handed in to swain is this your own work stewart asked swain and i thought it was so good he could hardly believe i had done it and i said quite proudly yes sir ive done every word of it then all i can say is you have no right to be in this division of the school and i shall talk to the doctor about it he was turning over the leaves of the exercisebook while he was talking and presently turning up one of the cribs he said look here stewart who did this i wrote that a month ago sir i said yes i know you wrote it but who did the construing i looked at swain and then at the map on the wall for i didnt know who had done it i always did my lessons with tom and the rest and they managed the cribs somehow and i just copied them off the slips of paper jackson or some of the fellows handed to me you have been using cribs sir thundered swain and then he looked round at the other fellows who were all very busy over their books i wished for once that the schoolroom floor was like the ice on the alder pond and i could slip through out of sight for i couldnt tell a direct lie about it and swain had cornered me so that there was no other way of getting out of it so i said nothing though i knew i should catch it from tom and the rest when we got into the playground for i could see by swains looks that he suspected cribs had been used by all the lot you may go to your seat now stewart and i will see dr mellor about this he said at last as soon as ever we got into the playground the row began with the other fellows look here you miserable muff what right have you to get us all into this awful scrape said jackson pulling off his jacket ready to fight who says im a miserable muff i said looking round at the others who had gathered near well charley it was mean of you not to open your mouth when you might have saved us all by a single word swain would have believed you if youd said i havent been cribbing and it wouldnt have been much of a fib either for you havent cribbed for nearly a month i know no because i havent done many lessons lately you may call it a fib if you like but i call it a lie and you know i hate lying tom as you did a little while ago now jackson do you want to fight it out i asked beginning to roll up my shirtsleeves no no dont fight things are bad enough now and the governor will be furious if he hears you have been fighting said tom and he caught hold of jackson and held him back try and settle it without fighting said one of the other fellows i dont suppose stewart meant to get us into a row no i didnt i said i only wanted to go on the square for myself one of miss chandoss tricks for serving us out i heard jackson whisper to tom well thats all very well you see stewart but youve been using cribs with us for ever so long and so you must stick to them now i shant i said i mean to act on the square go on the square for anything else you like but you mustnt throw us overboard in this crib business were all in the same boat you see charley and it wont do the other fellows dont like it then they can lump it i said and i was turning away but tom ran after me now be reasonable old fellow ive stuck up for you he said for jackson and the rest wanted to kick up a row as soon as they found you were doing your lessons on the square but i said let him be a bit and have his own way hell soon be glad of cribs again but i dont mean to have anything to do with them again i tell you tom its downright dishonest hoighty toightydishonest youll tell us next were all thieves said tom angrily whats that he says asked collins who happened to hear the last words oh hes setting up for a solomon after the chandos pattern says we are all dishonestlittle better than thieves of course what do you mean stewart said collins turning upon me fiercely just what i saywhat i told tomit isnt honest to use cribs and ive done with them youll have to ask us about that now stewart weve helped you and well do it again though you have served us this shabby trick for it wont do you know to have another kickup with swain about your wretched construing this may blow over but the next wont and then we shall all be in for it why dont you give the muff a good pommelling said jackson hes done no end of mischief its no better than peaching to serve us such a shabby trick swain suspects us i know look here jackson a fight will just bring the whole thing out and we shall all be condemned to no end of grind if it does therell be no time for the playground or cricketfield or anything else we shall just be worked like galleyslaves for the governor will have all the old lessons done over again by way of extra impositions i know him better than you but if youll just keep cool and take my advice we may all escape now then boys listen to the words of the sage said one of the fellows elbowing his way to the front go on collins make us a speech said another it aint much of a speech you must give up cribs now oh thats all cram we cant do it said tom we must we shall all look as interesting as stewart did today when we go up i say why didnt you put your finger in your mouth stewart he asked i was too angry to answer but the rest burst into a loud laugh and i punched one fellows head but collins wouldnt let us have a fair standup fight and so i walked away leaving them to settle about the cribs as they liked but tom came to me afterwards and said that the fellows had agreed to use no more cribs for a fortnight but after that i must do as the rest did or they would send me to coventry february thmrs chandos is still here nursing frank i go into his room to see him every day for a few minutes but there isnt time for anything now except on halfholidays for it is grind grind grind all day long and the worst of it is we get impositions and the masters are cross because all the construing is done so badly i wonder who invented cribs its an easy way of getting over the lessons at first but a fellow is nicely floored if he has to do without them for a bit as we have just now i fancy too that swain suspects what is going on and is watching to catch some of us for we have heard nothing since the day of the rownot a word more about my being sent to the governor i wish it wasnt so hard to do everything on the square chandos says i find it hard because i made a bad beginning when i came here and the longer i go on without altering this the harder it will be to alter he gave me quite a lecture about this last nightabout everything in my life depending upon the sort of beginning i make now i laughed and told him he ought to be a parson and i should expect to see him preaching at some street corner if they wouldnt give him a gown and pulpit but though i laughed i cannot help thinking he may be right after all i suppose these lessons they give us to learn will be useful in some way and when i leave school i shall be supposed to know all about them as swain thinks i know all about the construing in my exercisebook and it may be more awkward byandby not to know it than it is now ill try to think of this dear old chandos i like to tease him a bit about his lectures and yet i like him to talk to me as he does i can understand now how it is he is so grave and quiet he is the eldest son and his mother talks to him as though he was franks father what a pity it is he cannot have his wish and be a doctor its cruel i think that people cant have their own way about things like this i couldnt give up going to sea as chandos has given up his wish march ththe fortnight is up and cribs are coming in fashion again but everybody is very careful for swain is still on the lookout i can see last night i had a talk with chandos about it and he says if i am firm the boys will not send me to coventry as they threaten jackson and a few others may bully me a bit but the school will not be led by them to tell the truth i am not so much afraid of jackson and that lot as of the endless grind i shall have to do to keep on the square and do without cribs i wish id never begun with them and it wouldnt be so hard now but once begun it seems almost impossible to leave them off i said something of this to chandos and he said if i asked gods help i should not find things so difficult but i dont see how praying can help me with my lessons or make them any easier but still i mean to keep on march ththe fellows are awfully rusty because i wont use cribs yesterday tom came to talk to me about itthe first time he has spoken for a week for most of the fellows have kept their word and sent me to coventry for it now look here charley the fellows have sent me to speak to you once moremind its the last timeand if you aint reasonable now you wont have another chance if it is about cribs you can hold your tongue for ive made up my mind long ago i said oh thats all cram it wont do to come over us with that tale you know charley youve used em for months and months before you came here i know and youll be glad enough to use em again but youll find then the fellows wont help you and so ive come to give you one more chance now then yes or no no i said firmly oh im not going to take your answer in such a hurry as all that just think a bit old fellow what youll do when the summer comes and you have to sit stewing over your lessons in that musty old classroom while we are in the cricketfield why youll never get that big ship of yours finished unless you take to cribs again i cant help it i said sulkily and wishing all the time i could get my lessons done sooner oh yes you can and you neednt think to cram me with the tale that you are fond of grind because i know better you hate it like poison and if you werent afraid of miss chandos and her slowgoing lot youd take to cribs again like a sensible fellow who says im afraid of chandos i do and so do the other fellows and shes just taking all the spirit out of you and making you as big a coward as she is herself i tell you tom youre mistaken in thinking chandos is a coward and ill fight any fellow that dares to say so oh everybody knows you can fight but that isnt the thing i havent come to quarrel with you charley but to talk over this look here now things are getting awfully dull and slow we havent had a real good lark this half for all our time has to be spent in grind you and collins and jackson always get done in good time yes and a few others besides but some of them talk about giving up cribs through you and it aint fair swain will find out about the cribs if you are so much longer over your lessons than we are mind this isnt the only thing charley were old chums we were at one time tom but i cant forget that farmyard business i put in oh botheration to the farmyard that was months and months ago and everybody has forgotten that if you havent im not so sure of that tom i said tom put his hands into his pockets and whistled after a minute or two he said well charley youll never be the sailor i thought you would bother being a sailor whats that got to do with it i said you were talking about our being chums well only thissailors dont bear malice like you i dont bear malice it isnt that at all you didnt hurt me except that i felt id lost my old chum when you did that sneaking business and let chandos take your punishment oh bother chandos im sick of hearing the young ladys name and i didnt come to talk about her but about these cribs i tell you charley if you dont take them up again therell be no fun this half we can live without fun i suppose i said crossly i suppose we can but you were always up to anything in that line but nowwell theres been nothing since the skating but just maundering about like a parcel of girls would you like that skating business over againbecause i shouldnt i do like a good lark as well as anybody but i may as well tell you straight out tom i mean to go on the square with our larks as well as with lessons i shant forget how near frank chandos was to dying for one while and i mean to be careful in that direction for the future for i shouldnt like to be a murderer even in fun chapter vi was it robbery april tha month since i wrote up my log i have been home for a few days holiday but the rest has been all grind and not a single lark im afraid i shant be able to hold out much longer and yet it seems jolly mean when god has made frank chandos almost well and saved me from being miserable all my life i had a letter from frank yesterday and he says he can run aboutclamber over the rocks and build castles in the sand now i wish i was at the seaside though it would be better to be on the sea i shall run away soon to get away from this grind if something dont happen though im not sure that it wouldnt be as mean as cribbing the fellows have sent me to coventry over that and everything is as dull as can be i wish something would happen even a row would be a change april thsomething has happened or is going to happen at least and ive laughed so much already over it that my sides ached yesterday morning i heard a knocking at our bedroom door just before the dressingbell rang whos there i called out hush up and come out here came a whisper through the keyhole i knew it was tom and though i felt inclined to give him a turn at coventry at first i got up and opened the door now then whats the row have you set all the waterjugs on fire i asked we want you in our room a minute is miss chandos asleep he added it aint likely with all the row youve been making at this door what do you want tom you know im in coventry well you wont be much longer well give up about the cribs charley youve beat us but slip on some of your things and come into our room collins wants to speak to you hes got some news and a hamper too hasnt he yes but there wasnt much besides clothes and thats whats put him out does he think im to blame then i said no but he thinks you might help him fill it but come on charley now before swain comes we must think of something at once i shant be a minute chandos i said slipping my head inside the door and then i followed tom to his room this is a good deal larger than ours and has six beds in it jackson collins and tom with three others sleeping here they were all perched on collinss bed when we went in talking over the matter upon which tom had been dispatched i say stewart youll promise us first of all not to tell what goes on here even if you shouldnt join the fun did you ever know me to turn sneak any of you fellows i asked rather angrily you need not get your back up stewart we only asked you a civil question and you might give us a civil answer its all right though i dont believe youd peach no i wouldnt well i believe you now look here the governors birthday is on the twentyfourth and we shall have a holidaya whole holiday this year as i happen to know for i overheard swain talking about the weather being unusually fine and the boys having worked very steadily lately they were to have the whole day to spend at dinglewell youve never been to dinglewell have you stewart no but ive heard about it oh its the jolliest place and we can do pretty much as we like in the woods theres only one thing theyre mean about and thats the grub sandwiches and stale buns i dont relish especially when i think of the pantry shelves almost cracking with the good things at home for you must know theres always a grand dinnerparty in the evening and cook begins preparing for it days beforehand i tell you stewart its enough to make a fellows mouth water to see the pies and tarts and custards standing there youre not obliged to look at them i suppose oh its not the looking at them i object to but the not tasting and i mean to remedy that this year are you game for a lark just try me thats all i said charleys good for any lark that dont hurt anybody said tom then this will fit him as nicely as possible for nobody will be hurt even the governor himself will laugh over it and we shall have a jolly feed into the bargain you mean to have some of the pies and tarts out of cooks pantry then exactly old fellow youd help us i know what am i to do i asked and how are you going to get them awayput them in your pockets pockets be bothered no everybody knows i had a hamper from home yesterday and i mean to let the school think it was stuffed full of good things and that i mean to save them until we go to dinglewell oh i see i said laughing but there wasnt time to say any more for the bell rang and i was obliged to hurry back to my room for theres no telling when or where swain will turn up in the morning chandos looked at me when i got back but he would not ask any questions and of course i cant split on the other fellows later in the day i had another talk with collins about clearing the larder and we agreed to do it the night before we went to dinglewell and the things were to be packed in his hamper and swain is to be asked beforehand to let it go in the cart with the other grub and things this is the best of the whole fun to think swain should help us clear the governors larder i laughed until collins declared i should bring it all out and spoil it i wouldnt be out of this fun for anything i only wish i could be at home when cook finds it out id give my share of the fun to see the scare illustration clearing the larder april rdive only time for a line before chandos comes in and the other fellows dont want him to know anything of whats going on weve done itcleared the larder of every pie and custard we could get hold of i thought we should be caught once and my hair almost stood on end as i heard cooks voice outside the door but she went on and so did we i handed the things to collins through the window and each fellow in the secret took something and stole up to his room with it and now they are all safely packed in the hamper and swain has promised it shall go in the cart poor old swain if he only knew what he had promised but hell never know that he helped to clear the governors pantry although hell pull a long face tomorrow when he comes home and finds theres precious little to eat the best of the fun is they wont find out that theyre gone until dinner is nearly ready for the precious things were packed on the top shelves out of the way and i nearly broke my neck once trying to reach them i wonder what chandos will say about this when he hears of it he is looking forward to the fun we shall have in the woods tomorrow as much as anybody i wonder whether he would think this innocent fun i dont think i shall go to the feed though i helped to get the things for collins wont ask him which i think is rather mean of him considering that chandos had to stay here for the easter holidays while the rest of us went home for a fortnight i wonder what we shall do with the dishes when weve eaten the pies we cant bring em home thats certain and swain mustnt see them either and hell expect to be invited for collins has pitched him a fine yarn about the things his mother has sent for this feed i must ask collins what he means to do about this for if we dont look out the crockery will spoil the whole game what a pity it is they cant make pies without dishes i almost wish id only brought those little tarts that collins carried away in his handkerchief they got broken a bit and some of the jam ran out but theyre just as good broken as whole and theres no dishes to worry about bother the dishes i must go and speak to him about them before chandos comes up i wonder why he is downstairs so long after time surely he cant have any mischief on hand april thour holiday is over and the fun too but im afraid we havent heard the last of the governors pies if he only knew what a bother they were to us after all and how often we wished them back in the pantry even before we had eaten them he would feel more comfortable about it i should think for its the last time ill ever have anything to do with robbing a larder even for a lark it was all through the dishes nobody knew how we were to get rid of them and some of the fellows got so frightened they wanted to pitch the whole lot away but we couldnt do that even if collins and jackson would have agreed to it for the hamper had gone in the cart and we couldnt get at it until swain said soon after we reached dinglewell would you like your hamper left with the other things until dinnertime collins i dont think so sir stewart and jackson and a few more of us are going to look for ferns and so we can carry the hamper and if we shouldnt get back by dinnertime it wont matter i dont know so much about that said swain turning rather rusty i cannot let you stray miles off you may take the hamper of course but you must not go beyond the old tower and then i shall know where to find you if you are wanted the contrary old hunkshes never done that before grumbled collins as we turned away carrying the hamper between us we didnt feel very jolly about the thing now and i wished i could back out of it and join the football party with chandos and the rest we might have been carrying a coffin with the body of somebody wed killed by the solemn way we marched along as soon as we were away from swain and the rest i said now lets pitch all the rubbish down the first hole we can find thats your own throat i suppose stewart said jackson no i dont want a bit ive had enough thinking of the dishes i said oh hang the dishes i wish you hadnt thought of them at all or had left them in the pantry said collins well i like thatafter dragging me into the scrape to grumble at me for helping now look here ive had enough of the fun and will give up the feed to you and go back to the rest if you like and leave me to take care of the precious dishes i knew you were a coward stewart no im not a coward and ill stay and see it out if you like we must smash the dishes up you know and throw the bits about swain will never see anything of them then bravo charley what a pity we hadnt thought of that before now then lets find a place where we can be sure to be to ourselves and when weve cleared out the good things well begin the smashing business it did not take us long to demolish the pies and custards and each dish as it was emptied was broken into pieces and we amused ourselves by throwing these as far as we could in every direction it was quite a relief when the last tart was eaten and the last dish scattered and i then proposed returning to the others for our penance over surely we might have some play now you forget weve come ferngrubbing said collins i propose that as we have robbed the governor of his dinner we should take him something for his fernery it will help to ward off suspicion too i should think it ought i am sure i am not at all sure i said and i know nothing about ferns either he wants to get back to his nurse laughed jackson miss chandos said he mustnt be long put in tom provokingly but the next minute he had measured his length on the ground for if i did want to have a game with chandos i wasnt going to be told of it by tom then the fellows all turned rusty and there was something of a fight until about the middle of the afternoon we were so tired of each other and our fruitless search for ferns that we threw the hamper away and went back to the rest i knew you wouldnt get any ferns said swain when he heard of the result of our expedition i suppose you have had your dinner he added speaking rather stiffly yes sir answered collins and we were glad to turn away for we fancied he looked at us very suspiciously we had certainly missed the fun today in our eagerness to grasp it for seven more disagreeable disconsolate boys it would be hard to find than we as we sauntered towards the two football parties who were running shouting laughing and evidently enjoying the game wonderfully there seemed to be no room for us now and we stood about watching the fun as it grew more fast and furious chandos saw me at last and ran across to where i was standing why stewart where have you been all day what made you run away from this football it has been such glorious play im glad youve enjoyed it ive been with collins and the rest to look for some ferns to look for ferns why collins must know that ferns dont grow in dinglewell forest at least i never saw any said chandos i dont think they do for we couldnt find them either and so we came back well youll join the game now wont you come on well make room for you no i dont care about it today i said for i began to feel a kind of dizziness in my head i had felt sick for the last hour but this pain in my head was something quite new and i began to fear i should be ill certainly i had no inclination to join in the mle over the ball and only wanted to be left alone the miserable day came to an end at last and i was glad enough to go home and go to bed and i fancy tom and one or two of the others felt as bad as i did although nobody complained or even owned to having a headache for fear swain should suspect us when he heard of the robbery robbery what an ugly word that is but of course it isnt as though we really stole things we only took the pies for fun which is different from common stealing only we missed the fun altogether this time we expected to hear all about the affair when we came homethat the cook had gone into hysterics and the governor fainted or something like that but we did not hear a single word and of course we couldnt ask yesterday we did hear a little bit from the housemaid but she didnt know who the governor suspected she thought it was burglars and of course we said it must be and sent the whisper through the school that burglars had broken into the pantry one of the juniors was so frightened at the word robbers that he went and asked swain if he thought they would come any more or whether he had better write and ask his mamma to send for him who has been telling you this tale about burglars and robbers it is nothing to be afraid of burglars such as you are thinking of dont come to steal pies and custards we shall find out the thief or thieves very soon i have no doubt i have been wondering ever since i heard this whether swain suspects us after all or whether he just said it to pacify the youngster not a word has been said about it by the governor and so i am inclined to think we shall get off without any further punishment it will only be fair after all for if the governor knew how his precious pies spoiled all our holiday and how miserable and sick they made us feel he wouldnt want to serve us out any more by way of making us remember it im not likely to forget or repeat it again for a day like that is worse than the hardest grind at euclid chapter vii a surprise april ththeres been a most awful row and the fellows say i turned ratat least jackson and collins have sent me to coventry over it but i should do it again if there was the same occasion for how could i let a poor servant lose her place and her character through one of my larks the governor must be a drivelling donkey not to suspect us instead of the servants i always fancied that swain did smell a rat until young came tearing up to me with the tale that the police were to be sent for to search the kitchenmaids boxes why whats the row now i asked they cant find out anything clear about those pies but its pretty certain the kitchenmaid has been giving away bread and meat which it seems is against the rules and they think she has handed the pies away toosold them perhaps sold your grandmother young youre not such a muff as to think the servants did that are you i dont know what to think it couldnt be burglars you know of course not it was us i did most of the business and im off to the governor now to tell him all about it and leaving young staring with all his eyes i rushed indoors past swain who stood near the schoolroom door and bolted on to the masters study i could hardly wait for him to say come in but when i opened the door all my courage seemed to have gone and i felt ready to run away again did you wish to speak to me stewart yes sir please sir its about the pies i said hardly knowing how to begin you mean the robbery that has been committed lately please sir i never thought about its being a robbery when i took them you took them you robbed my pantry stewart it wasnt a robbery sirit was only a lark i did not want the pies to eat it was just for the fun and what did you do with them asked the governor sternly well sir mr swain helped us get them away although he didnt know it and then bit by bit it all came out i tried to screen collins and the rest but somehow there was no getting over the governors close questions and he sent for them and gave us all a lecture and then a long imposition i hate impositions and all sorts of grind but i didnt mind that so much for after all the governor didnt give it us so stiff as he mightas i thought he would and that poor girl is not to lose her place after all i thought when the impositions were got over there would be an end of the affair but it seems i shall for ever be nagged about itcalled a rat a sneak a coward tom says i need not have been in such a hurry to run off to the governorthat if the police had come they would not have found the empty dishes in her box and so she would not have lost her place and we could still have kept our secret chandos too talks something like the governor according to them it was an actual robbery although i did it in fun the result was the same they say and it might have led to disastrous consequences if i had not told the whole truth about it and then he went on to say it was not keeping the promise i had made when frank was so ill well how in the world is a fellow to keep straight for ever i said what pleasure did you get out of this none at all as it happened and its the last pantry ill rob but still and there i stopped i suppose you mean to say you will get into some other mischief at the first opportunity well how am i to keep out of it i asked what pleasure did you ever get by it now i know you did not enjoy the holiday at dinglewell as i did and yet no that i didnt i said it was the most miserable day i ever spent and ill never rob a pantry any more even for fun i tell you chandos id like to keep straight if i could but how can i ive tried and tried hard ever since that affair of poor franks ive never touched a crib since i give you my word and you dont know how hard it is to leave off when once youve begun on that tack i know it must be hard work and i think you have done very well in resisting as you have the temptation to use cribs but you might have done better stewart if you were not so proud proud i said nobody ever called me that before sailors are never proud you know well you are or you would accept the help a friend is waiting to give you if you were not now chandos that isnt fair i said i have always been willing to accept help and take advice from you i wasnt speaking of myself but of one who cares for you far more than i do although i feel sorry enough when you go wrong and get into scrapes and make people miserable as you often do through your thoughtlessness i suppose you mean my mother but i tell you chandos she expects itshe knows boys cant keep out of mischief but i know they can and it wasnt your mother i was thinking of just now but god butbut you dont think he cares much about it do you chandos he cant you know you believe that i care dont youat least a little well yes i do for you have always been my friend and helped me out of a scrape and given me good advice butbut its different about god i said why is it different he is your friend who cares far more for your welfare than i do and he is more anxious to see you do welllive a pure honest upright lifethan i can be and yet you will not accept the help he alone can give and by which alone you can conquer this inclination to get into mischief and often do such great wrong god is my friend i repeated look here chandos if i could believe thatwell i dont know what i should do but somehow i should want to be different i almost wish it could be true it is true stewart as true as truth as true as you and i are standing here i wish you would believe that god feels a personal interest in you as much as though you were the only schoolboy in the world i wish i could but somehow chandos it seems so strangetoo wonderful you know to be true that godthe great god who made heaven and earthcan care for a harumscarum lot like us yes it is wonderful but you know the lord jesus christ cared so much for this harumscarum world and all the people in it that he was content to dieto lay down his life to bring them to god yes ive heard something about it in church and since ive been trying to do the square thing and write bits of the sermon ive heard about it there too but then it never seemed to me that it could be for boys god the friend of boys like me why look here chandos if the governor was to proclaim himself my friend it would be an honour you know but look at the difference i take it that you mean i could go and tell god about every little scrape and trouble i got into and he would help me out of it or help you to bear it as the case might be that is exactly what i do mean stewart you do and you believe it believe it of course i believe it i dont know how i should get on if i did not said chandos and i am sure he spoke truly well perhaps i may come to believe it too some day but i cant nownot just in the way you do of course i know we ought to pray and do the square thing but as long as we do that and go to church it always seemed to me that god wouldnt trouble himself about us any further i have been doing the square thing too lately at least ive tried at it and isnt that enough but stewart according to your belief we should all be the slaves of goddoing just what we were obliged for fear of punishment and no more god does not ask will not accept such service as that dont you remember the text of last sunday my son give me thine heart and what the minister said of god desiring our will our affection to be given to him the service would follow then quite naturally he said and when i heard it i was thinking of youthinking you had begun at the wrong end trying to force yourself into giving god service without any heart or love or pleasure in it yes youre about right chandos i said but i dont see how it could be different god made frank well and i promised that if he would do that and save me from being miserable all my life id do the square thing and im not mean enough to back out of the bargain if i can help it but stewart you do not surely think that god answered our prayers for frank just because he wanted to tie you to this miserable bondagefor it is bondage slaverythis service which you know ought to be and is perfect freedom to those who begin at the right end and not the wrongby giving their heartstheir will and love to god well i dont know of course god wants me to be good i suppose but he would never take such an advantage of us as you supposemaking a bargain with us as it were no no stewart you have made a great mistake about this god heard and answered our prayers because he pitied our distress and loved you too well to let the miserable consequences of your thoughtless mischief follow you through all your life and you ought to return love for love and not treat god as though you thought him a hard taskmaster well i dont know you may be right chandos but i dont see how i am to begin what a pity it is you are not going to be a parson i couldnt help saying that and i meant it too may thsomething has happened that i never thought did happen anywhere except in books chandos that so many of the boys have looked down upon as being poor and beneath them because he never seemed to have any pocket money to spend like the rest of us has suddenly become a baronetsir eustace chandos of chandos court and i dont know how many other places besides it came upon us like a thunderbolt for chandos never told us his uncle was a baronet or that he had any relatives but the merchant uncle he did tell me a few weeks ago that he had just heard of the sudden death of his two cousins but he did not say any more except that he had not seen them above twice in his life i suppose he may have thought it would make no great difference to him as his uncle was not a very old man but now his uncle has just died too and our miss chandos becomes sir eustace well i only wish his uncle had put off dying a little bit longerjust till i felt more settled about things but now i feel sure i shall run away to sea if the mother dont come round and give her consent may thbravo sir eustace is not going to leave us just yet it seems his brother frank is just coming back and he prefers to stay another year and then he will go to college i suppose it dont seem to have made a bit of difference in him either i thought perhaps he might like to drop our friendship now he was so rich and i still poor charley stewart but he seemed hurt at the bare suggestion and so i am to call him chandos as usual and we shall share the room just the same as though nothing had happened i have thought a good deal about this the last two days i know a good many fellows would have packed up their traps and gone off at once or else held their heads so high that a poor chap like me would never be able to speak to them and ive been wondering whether its chandos having learned so many things about god that makes him different in this ive thought too that perhaps after all as chandos is just as willing to be my friend now he is sir eustace that god may be my friend as he said though i can hardly get used to the thought yet may ththere has been a tremendous row over the prize essay by which tom won the watch last christmas after all this time when everybody thought it was forgottenthough a good many of us did wonder then how tom managed itnow it is found out that it was all made up of cribs some taken from books and some from notes that one of the older fellows lost somebody must have turned rat tom says he is in an awful rage at having to give up the watch but the governor insisted and now tom is as dull and looks as miserable as he can be for the school has sent him to coventry over it which is very mean i think seeing they upheld him last winter when a good many at least knew he had no right to try for this prize he must wish he had let chandos take his chance now i should think i cannot help pitying him and chandos and i have agreed not to join the school this time though the other fellows threaten us with coventry for speaking to tom as we do the sea fever as chandos calls it has suddenly seized tom again and he is always talking about it as though we were both sure of going i wish we were but toms father says he has no real liking for it and therefore wont let him go and my mother is afraid oh dear if mother would only give her consent but she never will i am afraid and there will be nothing for it but to run away tom says we had better make up our minds to go from here before next christmas if it wasnt for the talks ive had with chandos id do it but i think i must give the mother one more chance and see if i cant persuade her in the holidays to let me go i wish i could think of something to please her very much id do anything to get her consent to my going to sea june thive been talking to chandos he says i have got the sea fever very bad this time and he is afraid some of the other boys will catch the infection i know what he means he is afraid his brother may learn to like the sea from hearing so much about it from tom for the two are always together now but i dont think he need to be afraid frank would never do for the sea i am sure he has persuaded me not to tease my mother too much about these plans of mine these holidays but to go in for lots of grind next half and get a prize at christmas and then perhaps when she sees i have really been industrious with my lessons and yet love the sea as dearly as ever she will be more likely to yield the plan may be a good onei think it is but its precious hard grind is not quite such a trouble as it was at first but still its bad enough and what with no cribs and the extra i shall have to do if i am to have a chance of taking a prize it is just enough to turn my brain i scratch my head and pull a long face every time i think of it but still i think i will try it hard as it is june thmrs chandos has sent a very pressing invitation for mamma and me to pay them a visit at chandos court and of course sir eustace is quite eager that i should accept it not that he wants to show off his grandeur i could never believe that of chandos chapter viii running away to sea augustwe are back at school once more and i am going to begin grinding in real earnest for this prize the mater has half consented or at least half promised to give her consent if i get this prize mrs chandos talked her into this i fancy while we were staying at the court what a jolly time we had there in spite of its being awfully grand everybody calls chandos the young baronet about there and people touch their caps to him as though he were a great swell as i suppose he is i never thought there was so much fun in him as i know there is now he seems to love fun as much as any of us only he is very careful that his pleasure does not give any one else pain which makes all the difference in our way of getting fun and i fancy his enjoyment of it is deeper after all september stthere is to be an extra prize given for latin this year and the examination is to take place early in december chandos wants me to go in for this but i am half afraid it will want such lots of grind he says learning would not be so much trouble to me if i would only make up my mind to like it but i dont think i shall ever do this but still i must get one prize at christmas somehow and having done my lessons so long on the square without even touching a crib i think i may manage it without quite killing myself september thi wish prizes had never been inventednever been thought of i believe its done just to plague boys here we are working like galley slaves and if i dont go on grind grind chandos whispers you forget the prizeyou are going to sea no i dont forget it i have been thinking of it more than ever lately and so has tom he means to run away and get to liverpool before the winter sets in and of course he wants me to go with him and calls me rat and coward because i will not promise of course i dont mean to split on him for i cant help wishing i could go too but somehow now that it seems possible i may get my mothers consent to go in a proper mannergo as a midshipman in the navyi would rather wait although i do hate the grind chandos says i shall have to grind harder still if i go to the naval college at greenwich but i wont mind that so much for the grind will be about ships and navigation and not the stupid things we have to learn here october thtom means to go everything is so miserable here he says the fellows have been rather hard upon him i think considering they all backed him up to keep chandos out of trying for the watch last year well he dont want a watch now but hes going in for as much grind as though he did or as though he was still poor and going to mount his uncles office stool instead of living in all the glory of chandos court but i began about tom he means to be missing some fine morning and to make his way to liverpool he thinks he shall be sure to get a ship there and is to write to me and his father just before he sails he dont mean to write to the governor at all because he was so mean about the watch we always talked about selling that to pay our expenses on the road for of course tom dont want to beg and to save him from this i have given him all the pocketmoney i had left which was only halfacrown and twopence for i never can keep money long now that old woman with the bullseyes comes to the playground gate so often poor tom i wish i had more i could give him for things have been pretty hard for him here lately though i dare say he deserved it for the mean trick he served chandos what a scare it will be when they first find out that tom has gone i shall have to keep quiet thoughhear see and say nothing as they tell the youngsters for i cannot pretend to be anxious when i know all about it and i dont mean to split on tom sometimes i fancy that chandos minor is in the secret tom is stupid if he lets too many know what he is up to i should have kept my own counsel and not let chandos know this october ththe house is all in commotion nothing has gone on in its proper order and everybody seems to be wondering what will happen next tom has gonerun away to sea as the boys are whispering to each other but that is not the worst i knew he meant going when he said good night to me last night and so i risked the imposition i might get and stayed in my room this morning until chandos came rushing in looking white and scared is frank here stewart he said frankno i havent seen him i said then hes gonegone with haslitt he said dropping into a chair did you know anything about this stewart he asked i knew that tom meant to go some time ive told you the same but about frankwhat have you heard about him tell me instantly stewart think of my poor mother i dont believe your brother has gone with tom he isnt such a muff as to do that you forget the sea fever that we used to tease him about in the holidays yes i know we teased him but nobody could ever think frank would be fit for sea tom didnt i know but hes taken himtheyre gone away together im certain oh nonsense chandos look here now you mustnt split on tom or say a word to the governor that i know anything about it but ive talked to tom lots of times about this but he never said a word about anybody else going with him he wanted me to go of course but failing me he should have to go alone he said but where can frank be nobody has seen him this morning and most of his clothes and all his money have gonei have been to look well if i thought and then i stopped look here i cant split on tom unless i am quite sure that young muff has really gone dont tell what i have said chandos but if they are together tom is the greatest stupid i ever heard of for he might be sure i should tell all i knew then and i will too fancy that poor little muff frank handling tarred ropeshed want to put his gloves on first and i burst out laughing at the thought of chandos minor going to sea chandos court would do for him nicely but on board a ship he would be in misery chandos left me laughing but soon came back stewart you must go to the governor and tell him all you know about this affair there is no time to be lost you see for somebody must go after them a carriage has been ordered and swain is to go with a policeman but if they find out before starting which road they have probably taken perhaps it may save hours perhaps days of delay well i know tom meant to go to liverpool he told me so over and over again well come and tell the doctor before he sends off the telegram to haslitts father is he going to send to your mother too i asked not just yet i want to spare my mother this anxiety if i can it was for thisto look after frank a little longer because he is inclined to get into mischief that i decided to stay here for the rest of the year but it seems i am of little use in preventing the mischief but come now stewart every moment is precious so we tore off to the doctors study where he was closeted with a policeman if you please sir stewart has come to tell you something about haslitt said chandos pushing me forward i dont know much sir only he said he was going to liverpool i shouldnt have split about it only for little chandos and he when did he tell you this stewart you came to school together i remember yes sir we are old chums and he had talked about going to liverpool lots of times you meant to go together then young gentleman said the policeman yes i mean to go to sea but ill wait till i get my mothers consent now young chandos though isnt fit for the sea and he mustnt go and you think they have taken the road to liverpool young gentleman i am sure they have and how do you think they meant to travel asked the policeman again oh theyd walk unless chandos junior had lots of tin and that aint likely for mother brown makes us shell out for her bullseyes do you know how much money your brother had chandos asked the governor not much sir i should think he came to borrow some of me yesterday but i only gave him a shilling then we may conclude they are walking said the policeman and a few minutes afterwards he and swain drove away and we have been wondering ever since whether they would catch the runaways october thnobody heard anything about tom and chandos until yesterday for they didnt go to liverpool after all and so swain and the policeman had their journey for nothing mr haslitt got here a few hours after the telegram was sent and asked me all about tom but he was too impatient to wait until swain got back at night as everybody expected he would do but went off to london to set people to work at once in case they were not heard of it was just as well he did too for tom must have changed his mind at the last minute and started for plymouth instead of liverpool for that was where he was foundhe and chandoswandering about the docks asking everybody if they wanted a boy to go to sea fancy anybody taking that poor little muff chandos and it seems tom might have got a berth for himself but he wouldnt go without chandos so they were both caught and im glad of itglad at least that they found chandos minor though i cant help feeling sorry for tom for hell have a harder time of it than ever now i fancy illustration do you want a boy to go to sea his father is very angry with him not only for this last scrape but about pretty well everything thats happened since hes been here for of course it all came out in talking to the governor and the boys and that watch affair he is mad about and thinks it began all the mischief but i think the beginning of it was when he let chandos into that scrape about the farmyardthat was the first mean thing i ever knew tom to do and now if it wasnt actual stealing it was next to it for he put chandos minor up to taking his brothers studs and a locket that was with them the police found that out i dont know what those london fellows could not find out if they tried nobody had missed the things until we heard they had been found and then chandos went to the drawer where he had put them and found they were gone and some money too but he wont say a word about the money it seems he is dreadfully upset i know although he is very quiet about it but i have come in rather suddenly once or twice in the middle of the day and found him kneeling down and though he has tried to hide it i know he was crying too he need not be afraid of me now though for idwell id rather kick up a row and laugh in church than tell the other fellows of it im in the secret a little i know he feels it awfully about frank and i suppose it helps him a bit to go and tell god all about it thats just what it is i know he prays as though god was as much his friend as i am and just as ready to help him as i should be if i could and i know if id only got the chance id do it october thfrank chandos is back in his place once more but tom has gone home with his father i dont think anybody is likely to try running away again in a hurry for to see tom and chandos minor when the policeman brought them in was enough to make anybody think twice before they tried that game that poor little muff chandos cried like a girl but tom tried to brave it out until he saw his father he gave it up then and i almost wished for his sake that we were all on the alder pond again for a more miserable look i never saw on any face than that on toms his head drooped and he never raised his eyes from the floor again while we were there poor old tom if he could only have been brave enough to speak out the truth last year about that farmyard business all the rest might not have followed but this fuss about him and chandos minor has put everything else out of my head and i have forgotten all about the prize and the grind too what a bother prizes are im afraid i shall stand a poor chance of getting this one now for the other fellows who mean to go in for it have been working like galley slaves all the time this row was going on but i couldnt and chandos seemed to forget everything but that little muff and so i am all behind i know chandos says i shall be able to make up for lost time now if i only work steadily every day but theres the rub how can i be sure that i can work steadily for more than a month fancy grinding without a lazy spell for a whole month im sure i couldnt do it and so i may as well give up at once i think i will for what is the use of trying now it will be so much grind thrown away and we are having such splendid weather now that wont last much longer that it seems a pity to be boring over a book a single minute longer than i am obliged i shall tell chandos tomorrow that i mean to give up the whole thing for i cant do it november sti am grinding still for chandos wont hear of my giving up he says the things i learnthe grindwill be more useful than the prize byandby and then he reminded me of my mother and how very pleased she would be if i gained this prize i know that and i should like to please her for once independent of the sea scheme this is the prize to me for i dont care much about the watch for itself it will remind me too much of poor tom and his watch as to the grind what do i care about julius csar and hannibal and rome and carthage if it was about nelson and howe and abercrombie and cook and a few more like them id grind away never fear why cant they let us know what the questions are going to bea few of them at least and then we might manage but to be expected to know all about everything and the fellows that lived hundreds of years ago is rather too stiff and if it wasnt for chandos i should give it up i know much as i want to please my mother november thive had a letter from tom fancy tom writing a letter he says everything is just as miserable at home as it was here and he has to do no end of grind shut up in his fathers room he saw my mother last week and his father told her she need not be afraid i should run away to sea now for i had learned a few things at school i was not likely to forget in a hurry well thats true enough but i dont think toms father knows what it is i have learned that prevented me going with tom and i am not sure myself that i have learned all the secret that makes such a difference between chandos and two or three others and the rest of us at school that makes everybody take their word for anything and be sure they would not do a mean sneakish trick i feel as though i was stopping just outside this secret for god is not my friendat least i cannot feel that he is as chandos does sometimes i wish i could for i know this is more to him a great deal than being sir eustace chandos but somehow i dont seem able to get hold of it although i do believe its trueall that chandos says about god being his friend chapter ix conclusion november thim in for it again it isnt much this timeonly a trick we played off on mother brown the mean old hunks to say she never gave credit when shes cleaned us all out with her nasty bullseyes ill never eat another that i wont the governor has heard of this lark and my share in it i suppose for im ordered to go to his study at nine oclock tomorrow morning well i dont care what the punishment is so long as mother brown dont hear of it but she would glory in that i know for ive led her a nice life lately november thi wish i could hang mother brown and choke her with her own precious bullseyes a nice imposition ive had through her this fresh hindrance would have taken away my last chance of the prize but nowwell i did not go looking for the prize questions but when they were there right before my eyes and nobody else in the room how could i help seeing them i dont see that its much of a cheat either for of course i shall answer them all by myself and if it helps me to know where to read upwell ive had a good many hindrances so that its about fair after all november thim getting along famously with my grind i think although i almost wish i could forget those questions sometimes but i cant and without meaning it i turn over the leaves of the book that will answer some of them yesterday chandos came and looked over my shoulder and when he saw where i was reading he said halloa stewart i thought you said you shouldnt look at that did i i stammered and i shut the book dont shut it up i dont want to hinder you im glad youre going in for it so thoroughly he said oh dont bother i said crossly for somehow i cant think of these questions and chandos at the same time and i shall tell him not to interfere if he comes poking round again november stwe have just heard that our examination is to take place the second of next monthabout ten days hence i wish it was over or that i had never made up my mind to go in for it i hate the very name of prizes and if i get it ill shy the watch down the first well i see what a fuss chandos is making too he says i am so cross and touchy he cannot understand me i suppose not for i cannot understand myself just now i know one thing though i hate mother brown and her bullseyes for if it hadnt been for her i couldnt have seen these questions but now i have seen them i cant forget them ive triedive turned to another part of the book and tried to read and learn all about that but although i began to feel some interest in that before i couldnt now and i was soon turning the leaves again i wish i had given it up when tom went away id do it now if it wasnt for chandos but i should not like him to know anything about this and so i suppose i must go on i can do one thing though i can answer the questions so badly that i shall lose the prize and that is how i must manage though its rather hard after doing such lots of grind for it november thive just had a letter from mamma i wish it had not come yet for it makes me wish to get this prize more than ever i feel as though i must get it must have it now and yet i have not touched a book the last two days chandos is puzzled and concerned i can see and i hardly know how to avoid him and yet i try to do so all i can oh why did the governor leave those questions about it was dreadfully careless of him if he had only locked them up in his desk when he went to breakfast as he ought to have done i couldnt have seen them and i shouldnt be in this trouble now i wonder whether toms prize essay worried him as much if i could only get out of it without letting anybody know of that sneaking trick of peeping id do it but how could i tell them i was every bit as mean as tom when i raved so about him last year everybody would remember that and throw it up in my teeth and they would say i had learned it of chandos too and i couldnt bear that its precious hard but i shall have to go on i must and i will get this prize if i can though i shall hate the sight of it and hate myself too december rdits over i could answer every question of course butbut oh how i wish i had been ill or something had happened to prevent my going in for it at the last minute i dont want this prize now and if i dont get it i shall be almost as thankful as i was when frank chandos began to get well i wish i could feel that god was my friend and would help me out of this scrape but i cant ask him ive felt afraid somehow to kneel down since i turned sneak yes i am a sneak a mean miserable sneak and i hate myself more than i hated tom and i said hard things enough about him but i never thought then i should ever come to do the same myself december thi had dropped my pen and was actually crying yesterday when chandos came in and caught me what is the matter stewart are you ill old fellow he asked and he put his arm round me so that there was no getting away from him dont chandos i said i cant bear it im a miserable mean sneak and if you were to kick me out of the room i should feel better for thats what i deserve mind i never meant to be a sneak and i didnt think i ever should do such a mean trick but now you do know it youd better turn me up as i did tom well i dont know what youve done yet well talk about that afterwards but just tell me this would you do the same thing again if you had the chance do it again i tell you i hate myself for it but the worst of it is it wont undo it now its done i never thought i could be so mean chandos i suppose not but bad as it is you need not give up all hope god knew how mean you could be and yet he will be your friend if you would let him is it about the prize stewart oh yes i do hope i shant get it i groaned well you shall tell me all about it byandby if you like but now just let me say a word you never felt before that you were a sinnerthat you could do anything bad ive been trying to keep straight and do everything on the square but i may as well give up now for i see i cant do it no no you wont give up charley im going to call you charley now because i hope we shall be better friends than ever after this i was just as miserable once as you are now i had told a lie and i felt i could never be forgiven but my mother talked to me and ill tell you as well as i can remember what she said youve been very proud my boy and thought you could get on very well without any help but your own determination to do right well what more do we want i said has it been enough stewart hasnt this been a miserable failure and are you not complaining now that you are more wicked than you thought possible well yes thats true enough i confessed now let me tell you stewart what mother told me god knew you would fail he knew when he put adam into the garden of eden that he wouldnt keep straight long but he gave him a fair chance and he loved him so much that he provided a remedy at once for the sins he and all men would commit the lord jesus christ agreed then to bear the sins of the whole worldyours and mine among them stewartand this is what is meant by forgiveness of sins you never felt you needed forgiveness before for you never felt the burden of sin but look here chandos i dont see how god is going to forgive me because you see i knew better of course you did but have you never read in your bible the blood of jesus christ cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but god is showing you the truth nowthat you need pardon and forgiveness and he is willing to give you these pardon for the sins already committed to wash them all away in the blood of his dear son who gave his life for you and not only pardon but grace and strength for the future to enable you to resist the temptation to do wrong at any future time look here if god would help me like that i shall feel so glad i said its no good for me to say ill always keep on the square any more after this mean trick for i may do another as tom did he didnt stop at the first and im afraid i shant if god dont help me oh chandos i do want him to help me out of this scrape and keep me from doing anything like this again well charley suppose we kneel down now and ask god for this and then you shall tell me all about it if you like i think i had better tell you first i said and then you can tell god for me ill try and do it myself byandby but i cant just at once im not good enough to kneel down at all then i told chandos about the questions and we kneeled down together and he asked god to forgive me and help me to do what was right if god will only let me lose this prize now i shant care i said when we got up butbut i dont think we ought to wait for that said chandos what can i do i said suppose you get itand you may you know said chandos you would be obliged to do something then oh i cant bear to think of that wont god help me by giving it to another fellow god will never help us to be cowards he will help you to do the brave and right thing which is to go to dr mellor at once tell him all about it and ask him to destroy your papers tell the governor im a mean sneak i couldnt do it chandos then god cannot help you in any other way nor i either i tell you he helps people to be brave and do the right but dont expect he is going to screen you from the consequences of sin because he cannot and will not and to expect it would be like sawing your finger with a sharp knife and not expecting to cut it i will not attempt to persuade you charley but if you are sincere in asking gods pardon now and his help for the future you will not hesitate about this long but it is so hard to do this chandos yes and god knows exactly how hard it is better than i do but as soon as he sees you are willing to bear this and do the right he will give you the strength and courage necessary when i lifted my head from my arms i found that chandos was gone i sat for nearly an hour thinking over what he had been sayingdear old chandos who is so good himself and yet not half so proud as i was about poor tom i wonder whether god will help me as he says i dont deserve it one bit any more than i deserve that the lord jesus should forgive me december thi am sure god has begun to help me i went and made a clean breast of it to the governor this morning and he has promised to burn my papers and keep the whole thing a secret from the rest it was pretty hard to begin telling him but when once i had begun i did not feel a bit afraid and i must say he behaved splendidly he didnt blow me up or order me an imposition for prying round his table but he said quite kindly i am very sorry for you stewart i wish you had come to me before or told me you had seen these questions and i might have saved you a great deal of unhappinessfor i am sure you have been unhappyand not deprived you of all chance of getting the prize try and remember this for the futurei am your friend as well as your schoolmaster and if there is any difficulty in which i can help you i hope you will trust me as a friend i am glad to see you and chandos get on so well together and then he actually shook hands with me as i was going out of the door i told chandos all about it afterwards and he said you know now how god helps those who trust in him i hope you will never forget it again i dont think i ever shall i dont feel afraid to kneel down and ask his help now and i know i need it for who can tell what i might do next after this mean trick december thi have written and told mamma how i have lost the prize i thought i had better do this for she had made so sure i should get it if i really tried that i did not like to go home without telling her first poor mamma i am sorry for she is dreadfully disappointed i know and i am afraid she will not let me go to sea either i wonder whether i shall be able to give up this wish entirely as chandos did his i am afraid not for often in my dreams i seem to be on the sea and how can i ever forget it but i must try to settle down i suppose god will help me in this i know as he did to go to the governor only it makes me feel dreadfully old to think of it december theverybody is busy packing and getting ready to go home but my packing must wait until i write up my log once more i mean to tie it up and put it away until i go to sea for i am really going after all the news came yesterday my mother wrote to say that as i had had the moral courage to confess having done wrong half her fear about my going to sea was taken away for she felt sure i was less likely to do wrong now i had felt so much unhappiness about it than i was before dear mamma she is mistaken here but i wonder whether i shall ever be able to tell her that god alone can keep me from the evil she fears i could not think much about this yesterday it was enough for me that i was going to sea and when i had read that much of the letter so as to understand it i tore round the playground holding up the letter and shouting hurrah im going to seaim going to sea some of the fellows pretended to think i was mad when i rushed at chandos and hugged him and shouted its all your doing old fellow im going to sea im going to sea let him alone let him blow off steam laughed chandos when some of the fellows tried to stop me and i went round the playground again like a steamengine everybody in the house knew it five minutes after the letter came luckily lessons were over for the day or there would have been an imposition for me but as it was nobody interfered today i can think more about it and finish my log for i shant come here after christmas and if i write another i shall get a new book but i mean to keep this for i shall like to read it byandby and if ever i am likely to forget how god has been my friend and how i learned to know it or if ever i get into a scrape and am unhappy again i shall read what chandos said to me a day or two ago that i may never forget the blood of jesus christ cleanseth us from all sin we only meant to laugh over it tom and i but now i think i shall remember some wise and good words when i read up charleys log illustration sailing ship london r k burt and co wine office court

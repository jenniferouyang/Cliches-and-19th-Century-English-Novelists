complications arise and disaster is narrowly averted later the hero and his companion leave their island home carrying the treasure with them the strange adventures of eric blackburn by harry collingwood chapter one the catastrophe it happened on our seventh night out from cape town when we had accomplished about a third of the distance between that city and melbourne the ship was the saturn of the wellknown planet line of combined freight and passenger steamers trading between london cape town and melbourne and ieric blackburn aged a trifle over twentythree yearswas her fourth officer the saturn was a brandnew ship this being her maiden voyage she was a twinscrew of tons register a at lloyds steaming knots and she had accommodation for passengers of whom were first class second class and steerage and every berth was occupied the steerage crowd consisting mostly of miners attracted to australia by the rumour of a newly discovered goldfield of fabulous richness the crew of the ship numbered all told therefore when the catastrophe occurred the saturn was responsible for the lives of people of whom about were women and children i was officer of the watch and was therefore on the bridge when it happened the time being shortly after six bells in the middle watch or say about a quarter past three oclock in the morning the weather was fine with so moderate a westerly wind blowing that the speed of the ship just balanced it the smoke and sparks from the funnel rising straight up into the air when the firemen shovelled coal into the furnaces and apart from the long westerly swell there was very little sea running the motion of the ship was therefore very easy just a slow roll of four or five degrees to port and starboard and an equally slow gentle rise and fall of the ship over the swell that followed us the moon was only four days old consequently she had set hours earlier but the sky was cloudless the air was clear and the stars shining brilliantly afforded light enough to reveal a ship at a distance of quite three miles it would be difficult therefore to imagine conditions of more apparently perfect safety than those at the moment prevailing aboard the saturn yet destruction came upon us in a manner and with a suddenness that was absolutely appalling i was pacing the bridge from one extremity to the other keeping a sharp lookout ahead and all round the ship and when at the port end of my promenade i wheeled on my return march there was no sign that but a few minutes intervened between us and eternity but as i approached the wheelhouse i became aware of a sudden access of light in the sky behind me illuminating the entire ship in a radiance that increased with incredible rapidity while at the same moment a low humming sound became audible that also grew in volume as rapidly as the light wheeling sharply round to ascertain the meaning of this strange phenomenon i heard the helmsman ejaculate through the open window of the wheel house gosh thats a big un and no mistake the biggest i ever seen andon a note of sudden alarmit aint goin to fall so very far away from us neither dye see that big fireball sir headin this way as the man spoke i caught sight of the object to which he referredand horror chilled me to the marrow for never before i verily believe had mortal eyes beheld so awful an apparition broad over the port bow at an elevation of some forty degrees above the horizon i beheld a great whitehot flaming mass emitting a long trail of brilliant sparks coming straight for the ship it was increasing in apparent size even as i gazed at it dumb and paralysed with terror indescribable while the sound of its passage through the air grew in the course of a second or two from a murmur to a deafening roar and the light which it emitted became so dazzling that it nearly blinded me as i looked at it as it came hurtling toward us it seemed to expand until it looked almost as big as the ship herself but that was of course an optical illusion for when a second or two later it struck us i saw that the fiercely incandescent mass of roughly spherical shape was some twelve feet in diameter it struck the ship aslant on her port side a few feet abaft the funnel and close to the waterline passing through the engineroom and out through her bottom there was no perceptible shock attending the blow but the crash was terrific while the smell of burning was almost suffocatingwhich is not to be wondered at since the mass was blazing so fiercely that it set the ship on fire merely by passing through her so intense was the heat of it that as it passed through the ships bottom into the water we instantly became enveloped in a dense cloud of hot steamy vapour a moment later it exploded under us throwing up a cone of water that came near to swamping the ship for a space of perhaps two seconds after the passage of the meteor through the ships hull the silence of the night continued and then as though in response to a signal there arose such a dreadful outcry as i hope never to hear again while the cabin doors were dashed open and out from the cabins and the companionways streamed crowds of distracted men women and children clad in their night gear just as they had leapt from their berths the men shouting to know what had happened while the poor women and children rushed frantically hither and thither jostling each other wringing their hands some weeping some screaming hysterically and some calling to children who had become separated from them in the seething crowd the first man to run up against me was the skipper who sprang out of his cabin straight on to the bridge exclaiming as he clutched me by the arm what is it what has happened for gods sake speak man the ship i answered has been struck by an enormous meteorite sir which has set her on fire i believe and has passed out through her bottom she has taken a perceptible list to starboard already at this moment i was interrupted by the chief engineer who dashed up on the bridge demanding breathlessly where is the captain i am here mr kennedy what is the news out with it jerked the skipper my engines are wrecked sir utterly destroyed answered kennedy and the ship is holed through her bottom down in the engineroom the hole is big enough to drive a coach through and the room is halffull of water already if either of the bulkheads goes we shall sink like a stone at this juncture we were joined by the chief second and third officers who came upon each others heels ah here you are gentlemen remarked the skipper i was about to send for you i learn from mr blackburn that the ship has been struck by a falling meteor which mr kennedy tells me has passed through her bottom according to him the engineroom is flooded and he is of opinion that if either of the engineroom bulkheads yields the ship will go down quicklyin which opinion i agree with him even as it is you may notice that the ship is taking a strong list and is very perceptibly deeper in the water therefore i will ask you mr hoskins to the chief officer and you mr cooper to the second to muster the hands proceed to the boatdeck and clear away the boats ready for lowering in case of necessity you mr stroud to the third officer will mount guard at the foot of the boatdeck ladder and prevent passengers passing up until the boats are ready and i give the word mr blackburn go down and find the purser tell him what has happened what we are doing and ask him to keep the people quiet until we are ready for them and you can lend him a hand thank god the boats are all provisioned ready for any emergency while the water in them was renewed only yesterday so there is nothing to do but cut them adrift and swing them outboard that is all at present gentlemen so go and get to work at oncewhy who are those men on the boatdeck now and what are they doing with the boats looks like the miners answered hoskins theyre a rough lot and as likely as not we may have trouble with em ay i thought so our chaps are up there too trying to send the others away and they dont seem inclined to go come along cooper weve got to clear those miners off somehow or we shall get nothing done therewith the four of us departed upon our respective missions leaving the captain in charge on the bridge the decks were now full of people rushing aimlessly hither and thither stopping everybody they met and asking each other what had happened meanwhile all the electric lights had been switched on so that it was possible to see who was who and as i quite expected no sooner did those poor distracted creatures catch sight of my uniform than i was surrounded hemmed in by a crowd who piteously besought me to tell them what had happened and if there was any danger i had by this time quite recovered my selfpossession and was therefore able to answer them calmly and with a steady voice naturally i did not tell them the whole truth for that i knew would precipitate a panic in which everybody would get out of hand i therefore told them there had been a breakdown in the engineroom which was being attended to that there was no immediate danger but that i strongly advised them purely as a measure of precaution to return to their cabins dress themselves warmly and put into their pockets or into parcels any money or valuables they might have in their baggage so that in the event of anything untoward happening whereby we might be compelled to take to the boats they would be prepared to do so at a moments notice some of them listened to me and allowed themselves to be persuaded but others seemed afraid to leave the deck for a moment lest they should be overtaken by calamity after all their apprehension was not to be wondered at there was excuse enough for it and to spare there was a very strong smell of burning and occasional puffs of smoke coming up from below where the engineroom staff were fighting the flames the ship had taken a heavy and steadilyincreasing list to starboard she was visibly settling in the water and to crown all the crowd of miners who upon the first alarm had taken possession of the boatdeck were refusing to leave it and a brisk struggle between them and the seamen was proceeding though as yet no firearms were being used but i knew hoskinss temper he was by no means a patient man or one given to much verbal argument it was usually a word and a blow with him and not infrequently the blow came first i knew also that he habitually carried a revolver in his pocket when at sea i should not therefore have been at all surprised to hear the crack of the weapon at any moment i had just managed to extricate myself from the crowd and was making my way toward the pursers cabin when from the interior of the ship and almost beneath my feet there came a deep boom and i knew that the after bulkhead of the engineroom had given way and that the moments of the saturn were numbered no use to hunt up the purser now i thought and i made a dash for the boatdeck to see if i could render any assistance there but i was too late the sound of the bursting bulkhead coming on top of the previous alarms was all that was needed to produce the panic i had all along been dreading and in an instant the decks were alive with frantic people all desperately fighting their way upward to the boatdeck where pandemonium now raged supreme and where pistols were popping freely showing that hoskins was by no means the only man in the ship who went armed now what was the best thing for me to do could i do anything useful i stood on the outskirts of that seething maddened crowd and watched men and women striving desperately together trampling each other remorselessly down shrieking cursing fighting no longer human but reduced by the fear of death to the condition of rabid ferocious brutes no i could do nothing as well go down below and attempt to stay the inrush of water with my two hands as strive by argument to restore those people to reason while as for force what could my strength avail against that of hundreds no they had all gone mad and in their madness were destroying themselves rendering it impossible to launch the boats and so dooming themselves and everybody else to death it was awful that scene often revisits me in dreams even to this day and i awake sweating and trembling with the unspeakable horror of it meanwhile the ship was rapidly sinking she had taken so strong a list to starboard that it was only with the utmost difficulty i could retain my footing upon her steeply inclined deck while she was so much down by the stern that the sea was almost level with the deck right aft scarcely knowing what i did acting with the inconsequence of one in a dream i clawed my way across the bridge that led from the upper deck to the poop and reached the taffrail where i stood gazing blankly down into the black water thinking i am afraid some rather rebellious thoughts i must have stood thus for at least five minutes before i realised that my hands were gripping a lifebuoy one of six that were stopped to the rail still acting mechanically and with no very definite purpose i drew forth my pocketknife severed the lashing passed the buoy over my head and shoulders thrust my arms through it climbed the railand dropped into the water the chill of the immersion instantly brought me to my senses in a moment i realised that if i would save my life i must without an instants delay put the greatest possible distance between the ship and myself before she foundered otherwise when she sankwhich she might do at any momentshe would drag me down with her and drown me the desire to live which seemed to have been paralysed within me by the suddenness of the disaster and the dreadful scenes i had subsequently witnessed reawoke and i struck out vigorously i know not how long i had been swimmingit seemed to me in my anxiety to get well away from the ship to have been but a very few minutes when the tumultuous sounds of contention aboard the doomed saturn suddenly changed to a long wailing scream and glancing back over my shoulder i saw upreared against the starlit sky the fore end of the ship standing almost vertically out of the water while at the same instant another loud boom reached my ears proclaiming either the bursting of the ships boilers the yielding of another bulkhead or possibly the blowing up of her decks then as i paused for a moment to watch the conclusion of the catastrophe the hull sank lower and lower still in the water until within the space of a minute it completely vanished the dreadful sight stimulated me to superhuman exertion for i believed i was still perilously near that great sinking mass and indeed i had scarcely covered another dozen yards when i felt the strong suction of the foundering ship i fought against it with desperate energy and in about a minutes time it relaxed and i ceased swimming now i asked myself what is the next thing to be done i suppose it was instinct that prompted me to get into this lifebuoy and swim away from the sinking ship but in doing so have i not merely exchanged a quick for a lingering death if i had stuck to the ship i should have gone down with her and died with very little suffering if any while so far as i can see i am now fated to drift about in this buoy until i perish slowly and miserably of cold hunger and thirst it was a most depressing reflection and for a moment i felt strongly tempted to slip out of the buoy throw up my hands sink and have done with it but no love of life selfpreservation which we are told is the first law of nature would not permit me to act foolishly reason reasserted herself reminding me that while there is life there is hope i remembered that i was floating in a stretch of water that is the highway for ships bound round the cape to and from australia and new zealand it is a highway that if not quite so busy as londons fleet street is traversed almost daily by craft of one sort or another bound either east or west and something might come along at any moment and if i could but attract attention to myself pick me up besides i did not really believe in giving up it had been instilled into me from my earliest childhood that the correct way to meet difficulties is to fight them and to fight the harder the more formidable appear the difficulties and the doctrine is sound i had and have proved it to be so over and over again and i meant again to put it to the test then in the most discouraging combination of adverse circumstances with which i had ever been confronted but the water was bitterly cold if i remained submerged to my armpits as i then was i could not survive long enough to get a fair chance i needed a raft of some sort buoyant enough to support me practically dry and remembering that there were numerous loose articles such as deck chairs gratings and what not that would probably float off the wreck when she sank i turned and swam back towards the spot where the saturn had gone down hoping that i might be fortunate enough to find something that would afford me the support i required and as i struck out afresh i was cheered and encouraged by the assurance that day was not far distant for looking ahead i saw that the sky low down toward the horizon wore the pallor that is the forerunner of dawn by imperceptible degrees the day crept up over the eastern horizon cold and white and as soon as there was light enough to enable me to see from the crest of one swell to that of the next i began to look about me in the hope of finding flotsam of some sort that would be useful to me also it occurred to me that there might be some who had remembered that cork jackets were to be found in every stateroom and might have made use of them in which case i might fall in with other survivors who might be useful to me and i to them if we joined forces for several minutes my search of the surface of the sea proved fruitless at which i was distinctly disconcerted for i knew that there were many articles of a buoyant nature which had been lying loose about the decks and which must have floated off when the ship sank and i was beginning to fear that somehow i had got out of my reckoning and had missed the scene of the catastrophe but a minute or two later as i topped the ridge of a swell i caught a momentary glimpse of something floating some fifty or sixty fathoms away and striking out vigorously in that direction i presently arrived at the spot and found myself in the midst of a small collection of brooms scrubbingbrushes squeegees buckets deckchairs gratings andgigantic slice of luckone of the ships lifeboats floating bottom up but of human beings living or dead not a sign it was therefore evident that of the five hundred and thirtyfive aboard the saturn at the moment of the disaster i was the sole survivor naturally i made straight for the upturned lifeboat but recognising that a bucket might prove very useful i secured one and towed it along with me reaching the boat i was greatly gratified to find that not only was she quite undamaged but also that she was riding buoyantly with the whole of her keel and about a foot of her bottom above the surface of the water of course the first thing to be done was to right the boat and then to bale her out and with the water as smooth as it then was i thought there ought not to be much difficulty in doing either the righting of the boat however proved to be very much more difficult than i had imagined she was a fairly big boat and floating wrong side up and full of water she was very sluggish and for a long time scarcely responded to my efforts but i eventually succeeded and with a glad heart seized the bucket i had secured hove it into the boat and climbed in after it finding to my joy that even with my weight in her the boat floated with both gunwales nearly four inches above the surface of the water thus there would be no difficulty in baling her dry and this i at once proceeded to do working vigorously at the task not only with the object of freeing the boat as speedily as possible but still more to restore my circulation and get a little warmth into my chilled and benumbed body chapter two the yorkshire lass by the time that i had baled the boat dry the sun was above the horizon the air had become quite genially warm and my exertions had set my body aglow while my clothing was rapidly drying in the gentle breeze that was blowing out from about northwest also i discovered that i had somehow developed a most voracious appetite fortunately i was able to regard this last circumstance with equanimity for the manager of the planet line of steamers had laid it down as a most stringent rule that while the ships were at sea all boats were not only to be maintained in a state of perfect preparation for instant launching but were also to be fully supplied with provisions and water upon a scale proportional to their passengercarrying capacity and each was also to have her full equipment of gear stowed in her ready for instant service now the boat which i had been fortunate enough to findand which by the way seemed to be the only one that had not been carried down with the shipwas number a craft thirtytwo feet long by eight feet beam carvelbuilt doubleended fitted with airchambers fore and aft and along each side with a keel six inches deep to enable her to work to windward under sail she was yawlrigged pulled six oars and her full carrying capacity was twenty four persons for which number she carried provisions and water enough to last according to a carefully regulated scale four days or even six days at a pinch these provisions were all of the tinned variety and were stowed in a locker specially arranged for their reception between the two midship thwarts thus there was no risk of the food being damaged by salt water on the one hand or of being washed out of the boat on the other upon coming into possession of the boat therefore i was not only so fortunate as to find an ark of refuge but also rations of food sufficient to last me ninetysix days knowing all thissuch knowledge being a part of my dutyno sooner had i hove the last bucketful of water out over the gunwale than i opened the food locker and spread the constituents of a very satisfying breakfast in the sternsheets of the boat whereupon i fell to and made an excellent meal as i sat there eating and drinking a solitary individual adrift in the vast expanse of the southern ocean i began to look my future in the face and ask myself what i was now to do in a general sense it was not at all a difficult question to answer the saturn that splendid new perfectly equipped steamship had gone to the bottom taking with her five hundred and thirtyfour human beings and apart from myself and the boat i sat in there was nothing and nobody to tell what her fate had been i was the sole survivor of a probably unexampled disaster and my obvious duty was to hasten with as little delay as possible to some spot from which i could report the particulars of that disaster to the owners of the ship but what spot precisely must i endeavour to reach as an officer of the ship i of course knew her exact position at noon on the day preceding her loss it was latitude degrees minutes seconds south longitude degrees minutes seconds east i remembered the figures well having something of a gift in that direction which i had sedulously cultivated in view of the possibility that some day i might find it exceedingly useful in the same way i was able to form a fairly accurate mental picture of the chart upon which that position had been pricked off for cooper our second and i had been studying it together in the charthouse shortly after the skipper had pricked her off as a result i knew that the saturn had foundered some two thousand miles eastsoutheast of the cape of good hope that madagascarthe nearest landbore about northbywest true with the islands of reunion and mauritius not much farther off bearing about two points farther east these items of information were of course valuable but their value was to a very great extent discounted by the fact that i had neither sextant nor chronometer wherewith to determine the boats position day after day nor a chart to guide me at this point in my selfcommunion i realised that alternative courses were open to me and i proceeded to give them my most careful consideration comparing the one with the other and the more carefully i examined them the more difficult did i find it to come to a decision on the one hand here was i right in the track of ships bound east and west consequently i stood a very fair chance of being picked up at any moment when the ships wireless installation would at once enable me to make my report on the other hand in the unlikely event of my failing to be picked up i could dispatch a cablegram from say port louis mauritius immediately upon my arrival there and the point which i had to decide was whether i should at once steer north or whether i should remain where i was and trust to being speedily picked up i will not weary the reader by repeating in detail the arguments pro and con that presented themselves to my mind let it suffice me to say that i eventually adopted the second of the courses outlined above and so certain did i feel that this was the right decision that i actually adhered to it for seven days during which i sighted four steamers and one sailing ship but as illfortune would have it three of the steamers and the sailing ship passed me at too great a distance to permit of my intercepting them while the fourth steamera big liner with three tiers of ports blazing with electric lightpassed during the night within less than four miles of me but i had no light with which to signal to her and thus i was passed unseen the liner passed me during the fifth night succeeding that of the wreck and during the following two days i saw nothing as i watched the sun go down on the seventh day that i had spent in the boat i said to myself well here endeth the seventh day of a most disappointing experience if seven days ago anyone had told me that i could hang about here in a boat for a whole week right in the track of ships without being sighted and picked up i would not have believed it yet here i am and judging from past experience here i may remain for another seven days or even longer with no more satisfactory result i have spent seven precious days waiting for a ship to come along and find me now i will go and see if i cannot find a ship or failing that find land where i shall at least be safe from destruction by the first gale that chances to spring up thinking thus i put up my helm wore the boat round and headed her upon a course that i believed would eventually enable me to hit off either reunion or mauritius should i not be picked up beforehand that was a very anxious night indeed for me by far the most anxious that i had thus far spent since the destruction of the saturn for the wind steadily increased compelling me to haul down a first and then a second reef in the mainsail whilethe wind and sea being now square abeami was continually exposed to the danger of being swamped by a sea breaking aboard by constant watchfulness however i contrived to escape this danger and my eighth morning found the boat bowling along to the northward and reeling off her six knots per hour with a steady breeze from the westward a long regular sea running and a clear sky giving promise that the weather conditions were unlikely to grow any worse than they were then but i had to stick to the mainsheet and the yokelines and do as best i could without rest for the time being fortunately as the day wore on the wind moderated until by nightfall it had dropped to such an extent that i was able to shake out first one reef and then the other while with the moderating of the breeze the sea also went down until it was no longer dangerous i had now had no sleep for thirtysix hours consequently i felt in sore need of rest i therefore hoveto the boat coiled myself down and instantly sank into a dreamless slumber it must have been about midnight when i awoke i at once let draw the foresheet filled away upon the course i had decided upon and kept the boat going for the remainder of the night the ninth day of my boat voyage dawned pleasantly with the wind still blowing a moderate breeze from the westward a long regular swell running and no sea worth troubling about the conditions were therefore quite favourable for a little experiment i desired to make being only human i could not avoid the necessity for securing a certain amount of sleep and up to now when i needed rest it had been my habit to heaveto the boat and leave her to take care of herself trusting to that curious sailorsense which all sailormen soon acquire to awake me should the need arise but heavingto meant loss of time and having already lost so much i was very reluctant to lose more if such loss could possibly be avoided i therefore set the boat going on her correct compass course and then releasing the yokelines i endeavoured to render the craft selfsteering by adjusting the fore and mizen sheets it took me the best part of half an hour to accomplish this to my complete satisfaction but i did it at length and this done i went aloft and took a good look round there was nothing in sight indeed i scarcely expected to see anything in the part of the ocean which i had then reached i therefore descended and rested until dinner time indulging in another nap until the hour for my evening meal in preparation for an allnight watch the weather had now become quite settled and was as favourable as it could possibly be to persons who like myself were engaged upon an ocean voyage in an open boat the wind still held steadily in the western quarter enabling me to lay my course with eased sheets while its strength was sufficient to push the boat along under whole canvas at a speed of about five knots with no need to keep ones eye continually watching the lee gunwale my only difficulty at this time was the lack of a light to illuminate the boat compass at night the can containing the supply of lamp oil seeming to have gone adrift when the boat was capsized i was therefore compelled to steer entirely by the stars and i was sometimes disturbed by an uneasy doubt as to whether i might not occasionally have deviated slightly from my proper course by holding on to one particular star for too long a time in all other respects i did splendidly the morning of the tenth day of this remarkable but on the whole uneventful voyage of mine in the lifeboat dawned auspiciously and the daily routine into which i had settled began i went aloft for a look round and then the horizon being empty i had breakfast after which with the boat steering herself i stretched myself out for a short sleep i must have slept for perhaps two hours when some mysterious influence awoke me and i started up gazing eagerly about me there was still nothing in sight from the low elevation of the boat herself but being awake i decided to have a look round from aloft in another minute i was straddling the yard of the main lug from which position as the boat floated up on a ridge of swell i caught a momentary glimpse of something gleaming white in the brilliant sunshine right ahead it could of course be but one thing namely the upper canvas of a sailing craft of some sort i remained where i was intently watching that gleaming white speck until it had grown into the semblance of a royal and the head of a topgallant sail from time to time i also got occasional glimpses of the upper part of another sail which i could not for the moment identify but ultimately as i watched the strange craft seemed to alter her course a little and then i made out the puzzling piece of canvas to be the triangular head of a gafftopsail the vessel was therefore without a doubt a brigantine what i could not at first understand however was the way she was steering at one moment she would appear absolutely endon while a minute or two later she would be broad off the wind to the extent of four or five points it was exceedingly erratic steering to say the least of it and i was tantalised too by my inability to determine whether she was heading toward or away from me but eventually i decided that since her masts had hove up above the horizon just where they were she must be heading toward me the only argument against this assumption was that she did not appear to be rising rapidly enough to justify it but she certainly was rising although slowly and that was enough for me in the meantime without further ado therefore i slid down from aloft went aft and seized the yokelines saying to myself i believe its going to be all right this time she is a sailing craft and i am raising her although very slowly it will be afternoon before i can get alongside her but please god there will be no more open boating for me after today that the craft in sight was indeed a brigantine became unmistakable as i stood on slowly raising her canvas above the horizon and later on in the day i made two further discoveries of a rather peculiar character in connection with her one was that she was hoveto the other that she was flying her ensign upsidedown at the peak of her mainsail the latter circumstance indicating that she was in distress or required assistance of some kind it was about three oclock in the afternoon when the lifeboat crept up near enough to the brigantine to enable me to distinguish details and the first thing i observed was that a group of five or six men apparently forecastle handswere grouped aft curiously inspecting the boat through a telescope as i approached a little later when i arrived within a few fathoms of her i learned from the inscription in white letters on her stern that the craft was named the yorkshire lass and that she hailed from hull as i drew up within hail i put my hands to my mouth trumpetwise and shouted yorkshire lass ahoy i am a castaway and have been adrift in this boat ten days may i board you to my amazement instead of replying the group of men clustered on deck aft turned to each other and seemed to hold a brief consultation finally after a short palaver one of them hailed boat ahoy i say mister are you a navigator yes certainly i replied much astonished at having such a question addressed to me by a british seaman instead ofas i had fully expectedreceiving a cordial invitation to come alongside i was fourth officer of the saturn of the planet line of steamers running between london and melbourne and then i stopped for instead of listening to me they were all talking together again at length when the lifeboat had crept up close under the brigantines lee quarter one of the men came to the rail and looking down into the boat remarked all right mister come aboard and welcome look out and ill heave ye a line a couple of minutes later the lifeboat with her sails lowered was alongside and climbing the crafts low side i reached her deck welcome aboard the yorkshire lass mister i was greeted by a great burly specimen of the british shellback as i stepped in over the rail very glad to see ye im sure but what about your boat shes a fine boat and no mistake but im afraid well have to let her go adrift shes too big for us to hoist her in weve no place on deck where we could stow her but if theres anything of value aboard her well have it out eh mister certainly i agreed there is still a quantity of preserved provisions in that locker there are the two water breakers there is a lifebuoyand that is about all but look here i continued if something must be turned adrift why not get rid of that longboat of yours and hoist in the lifeboat in her place the latter is very much the better boat of the twothere is indeed no comparison between them and i am sure she would stow very snugly in your longboats chocks ay agreed the other i believe she would and as you say shes a lot better than the longboat sheve got airchambers i see andin fact shes a proper lifeboat and shes roomy enough to take all hands of us if anything should happen what say chaps shall us try it this last to the other men who had stood around listening to everything that was said the party five of them in all slouched over to the rail and stood looking down into the lifeboat with an air of stolid indifference as she rose and fell alongside then they turned and looked inboard at the longboat which stood upright in chocks on top of the main hatch with the jollyboat stowed keelup inside her finally one of them said yah vell do id shes wort de drouble gome on poys leds ged do vork we havend done moosh dese lasd dwo days und id vond hurd us shoomp ub dere zome of you und ged de shollyboad oud of dad now thought i what sort of a craft is this that ive blundered aboard of shes liberty hall afloat by the look of itjack as good as his master there seems to be something a bit queer heresomething that i cant quite understand at present but ill find out what it is before long which of those fellows is the skipper i wonderor if neither of them is as i am very much inclined to think where is he and then i suddenly recalled to mind the questionare you a navigatorwhich had been put to me before i received permission to come aboard for a moment i thought of demanding an explanation before permitting the lifeboat to be hoisted in but i changed my mind and resolved to defer my investigation until later i flattered myself that if anything should prove to be really wrong aboard the brigantine i had wit enough to enable me to deal with it meanwhile the five men having summoned three others from the forecastle to their assistance got to work with the exasperating deliberation characteristic of the british merchant seaman to be found in the forecastles of small craft and first of all they got the jolly boat down on deck and ran her aft out of the way then they cleared out a number of warps cork fenders and other lumber from the longboat lifted her out of her chocks and finally unshipping the gangway launched her overboard fishermanfashion and dropped her astern riding to her painter then they got their mast and yard tackles aloft arranged the chocks in place on the main hatch and with a tremendous amount of fuss with the assistance of snatchblocks the windlass and the winch they contrived to hoist in and stow the lifeboat that had stood me in such good stead for nearly a fortnight that done all hands held another somewhat lengthy and animated powwow on the forecastlehead at the conclusion of which the man who had given me permission to come aboard came aft and pointing to the lifeboat remarked to me i reckon weve made a very good job of that mister and im sure were all very much obliged to ye for the idee shes worth a dozen of the longboat and quite worth all the trouble weve took to put her where she is then without waiting for any response he stepped aft peered through the skylight and stepping to where the ships bell hung he struck eight bells four oclock rejoining me as i stood watching the longboat that had been cast adrift he remarked with a clumsy effort at civility teall be coming along aft in about five minutes and i reckon youll be glad of a cup i spose you havent been gettin much hot food while youve been moochin about in that boat have ye i have not i replied it was impossible to do cooking of any kind as of course you will readily understand ah well yell be able to make up for it now was the rejoinder for here comes the steward teapot and all step down below into the cabin and make yourself at home many thanks said i by the way are you the master of this vessel and i gather from your ensign being hoisted uniondown that you are in distress what is wrong with you chapter three an amazing story we were now passing down the companion ladder on our way to the cabin and as i finished speaking the man to whom i addressed my question and who had led the way below motioned me to enter an open doorway at the foot of the stairs obeying the invitation i found myself in a small rather dark and stuffy cabin very plainly fitted up the woodwork painted darkoak colour the beams and underside of the deck planking overhead imparting a little cheerfulness to the small interior by being painted white while the lockers were covered with cushions of much worn plush that had once been crimson but which through age wear and dirt had become almost black the place was lighted by a small skylight in the deck and two ports or scuttles on each side at one end of the skylight was screwed a clock while to the other end was screwed a mercurial barometer hung in gimbals and immediately over the chair at the fore end of the table hung a telltale compass the table was laid with a damask tablecloth that had seen better days and no doubt had once been white while the ware was white and of that thick and solid character that defies breakage a wellfilled bread barge containing ordinary ship biscuit stood at one end of the table flanked by a dish of butter on one side and a pot of jam on the other the tray was placed at the starboard side of the table and amidships at the fore end there stood a dish containing a large lump of salt beef behind three plates with a carving knife and fork alongside them to the chair in front of these or at the head of the table the man who was acting the part of host now waved a hand mutely inviting me to take it certainly not i said you are the master of the ship i presume and as such this is of course your rightful place why should you surrender it to me ah but thats just where you make a mistake mrereri forget your name no im not the skipper im the bosun and my names enderbyjohn enderby and this manindicating an individual who at this moment joined usis william johnson the carpenterotherwise chips then where is your skipperand your mate i demanded thats what were in distress about answered the boatswain sit down sir please and lets get on with our tea and while were gettin of it ill spin ye the yarn thats why me and chips is havin tea down here aft this afternoon at other times we messes with the rest of the men in the focsle but as soon as you comed aboard we all reckernised that youd want to know the ins and outs of this here traverse that we finds ourselves in so twas arranged that me and chips should have tea with ye and explain the whole thing i see said i well you may heave ahead while i carve this beef i can do that and listen at the same time yes assented enderby then breathing deeply he gazed steadfastly at the clock for so long a time and with an air of such complete abstraction that at length chips who was sitting on the locker alongside him gave him an awakening nudge of the elbow accompanied by the injunction heave ahead man heave ahead youll never get under way if you dont show better than this ay youre right there my lad i shant and thats a fact returned enderby the trouble is that i dont know where to make a start whether to begin with what happened the night afore last or whether twould be best to go back to our sailin from london perhaps the last will be the better plan i suggested if you start at the very beginning i shall stand a better chance of understanding the whole affair ay ay yes of course you will agreed the boatswain well its like this here he began we left london last septemberyoull find the exact date in the logbookwith a full cargo for cape town our complement bein thirteen all told thirteens an unlucky number mister and as soon as i reckernised that our ships company totted up to that i knowed we should have trouble in some shape or form but we arrived at cape town all right discharged our cargo took in ballast filled up our water tanks and got away to sea again all right and it wasnt until the night afore last that the trouble comed along our skippers name was stenson and the mate called hisself john barber but i low it was as likely as not a pursers name for i never liked the man and no more didnt any of us for though he was a good enough seaman he had a very nasty temper and was everlastinly naggin the men it appeared that he and the skipper was old friendsor anyway they knowed one another pretty well havin been schoolfellers together and the story goes that some while ago this man barber bein at the time on his beamends runned foul of the skipper and begged help from him spinnin a yarn about a lot of treasure that hed found on an island somewhere away to the eastard and offerin to go shares if hed help barber to get hold of the stuff i dunno whether the yarns true or no but the skipper believed it for the upshot of it was that capn stensonwho i might say was the owner of the yorkshire lass hustled around and got a general cargo for cape town after dischargin which we took in ballast and sailed in search of this here treasure well everything worked all right until the night afore last when barber who was takin the middle watch went below and for some reason or another brought the skipper up on deck svorenssen who was at the wheel says that the pair of em walked fore and aft in the waist for a goodish bit talkin together and then suddenly they got to high words then all in a minute they started fightin or strugglin together and before svorenssen could sing out or do anything they was at the rail and the pair of em went overboard locked in one anothers arms went overboard i reiterated good heavens what an extraordinary thing and was no effort made to save them svorenssen sung out of course replied the boatswain but he couldnt leave the wheel for twas pipin up a freshish breeze on our port quarter and we was doin about seven or seven and a half knots with topmast and lower stunsails set to port and of course we had to take em in clew up the royal and togantsail and haul down the gaff topsl before we could round to and that took us so long that at last when wed brought the hooker to the wind hove her to and had got the jollyboat over the side we knowed that itd be no earthly use to look for either of em all the same i took the boat with three hands and we pulled back over the course wed come as near as we could guess at it but although we pulled about until daylight we never got a sight of either of em what a truly extraordinary story i repeated and pray who is now in command of the ship well i spose i am as much as anybodythough there havent been much commandin since the skipper was lost answered enderby but im the oldest and most experienced man aboard and the others have been sort of lookin to me to advise em what to do and since theres neer a one of us as knows anything about navigation i advised that we should heaveto hoist a signal of distress and then wait until something comed along that would supply us with a navigator but now that youve comed along we neednt waste any more of this fine fair wind because i spose you wont have no objection to do our navigatin for us eh that depends entirely upon where you are bound for i replied of course i shall be very pleased to navigate the ship to the nearest port on your way but i cannot promise to do more than that and you have not yet told me where you are bound did i not understand that it is to some island ay yes thats right answered the boatswain buthere he raised his voice to a shoutbilly come here my lad and tell the genleman what you knows about this here vyage whereupon to my astonishment a very intelligentlooking boy of apparently about eleven or twelve years of age emerged from the pantry where it appeared he had been helping the steward and stood before us alert and evidently prepared to answer questions he was only a little chap fairhaired and blueeyed and his eyelids were red as though he had recently been crying but there were honesty straightforwardness and fearlessness in the way in which he looked me straight in the eye and an evident eagerness in his manner that greatly pleased me this said enderby by way of introduction is billy stenson the skippers son he havent no mother pore little chap so heve been comin to sea with his father the last two or three years havent you billy yes thats quite right bosun answered the boy well now this gentleman mrerdashed if i can remember your name mister proceeded enderby blackburn i prompted thank e sir blackburn well billy continued the boatswain this here mr blackburn is a firstclass navigator havin been an orficer aboard a liner and hell be able to take us to barbers treasure island if anybody can but of course hell have to know whereabouts it is afore he can navigate the ship to it and now that your pore fathersumno longer aboard i reckon that youre the only one who can say whats the latitood and longitood of it but thats just what i cant do bosun answered billy i know what the latitude of it is but the longitudes another matter mr barber didnt know it father didnt know it and i dont know it what i exclaimed do you mean to tell me that your father actually started out with the deliberate intention of looking for an island the latitude only of which he knew yes sir answered the boy thats right let me tell you how it all happened i know because father told me the story lots of times and besides ive heard him and mr barber talking about it so often that im not likely to forget a word of it this is how it was before mr barber met father this last time he was mate of a dutch ship trading out of batavia collecting sandalwood and shell they called at a place namednamedwaing do you mind sir if i get the chart and show you the place on it somehow i never can exactly remember the names of these places but i can point em out on the chart because ive listened and watched while father and mr barber talked it over together yes i said by all means get the chart my boy i shall be able to understand your story ever so much better with that before me whereupon the lad entered a stateroom at the fore end of the main cabin and presently returned with a chart of the malay archipelago which he spread open on the table there he said pointing with his finger thats the place they called atwaingapu in sumba island and this pencilmark mr barber drew to show the track of the ship and the boat afterwardsas nearly as he could remember after leaving waingapu the ship sailed along this linepointing with his fingerthrough maurissa strait up to here and here mr barber and the dutch captain had a terrible quarrel and a fighti dont know what about because mr barber didnt say but it ended in mr barber being turned adrift by himself in a boat with a small stock of provisions and one breaker of fresh water the boat was an old one very leaky and she had no sail so mr barber could do nothing but just let her drift hoping every day that something would come along and pick him up but nothing came and five days later he found that his water was all gone the breaker havin been leaky the next thing that happened was that mr barker got lightheaded with thirst and it used to make me feel awfully uncomfortable to hear him tell about the things he thought he saw while he was that way at last he got so thirsty that he couldnt stand it any longer and bein mad he filled the baler with water from over the side and drank it and then he found that the water was fresh and he drank some more and his senses came back to him and lookin round he saw that there was land on both sides of the boat and that she was in a sort of wide river but although the land was so plain in sight mr barber was so weak that he couldnt do anything for while he was lightheaded hed hove all his grub overboard and was now starving so he just had to let the boat drift with the wind and after a bit she drove ashore but even then mr barber couldnt do anything but just climb out of the boat and fling himself down upon the sand where he slept until next morning when he woke up he felt a bit better but awfully hungry so he got up and seeing a few trees not far off he managed to crawl over to em and was lucky enough to find some fruit on em he said he didnt know what the fruit was and didnt care he was so awfully hungry that hed have eaten it even if hed known it was poison but it wasnt it was quite good and after he had eaten he felt so much stronger that he went back to the beach and moored his boat to a big boulder so that she wouldnt drift away now that mr barber had found food and water he set about taking care of himself so that he might get strong again and be able to get away from where he wasbecause of course he didnt want to spend the rest of his days there but he wanted to find out as much as he could about the place so as soon as he was strong enough he began to wander about a bit explorin and in particular he wanted to have a look at something that he thought might be a house all overgrown with creepers and when at last he was able to get to it he found that it was a very ancient ship that he thought must have drove ashore during the height of a very heavy gale of wind when the level of the sea surface was raised several feet above ordinary deeply flooding the low ground where he found her of course mr barber climbed aboard and had a good look round thinking that hed perhaps be able to take up his quarters aboard her until he could get away from the place but he found her timbers and deck planking all so rotten that it wasnt safe to move about aboard her all the same he gave her a good overhaul and down in the run he found a little room and in it eight big chests all bound round with thick steel bands with a lot of trouble he broke em open and five of em he found packed full of gold and silver thingscoins candlesticks images and things that he believed had been stolen out of churches with chains and rings and bracelets and things of that sort and the other three chests had in em all sorts of gemsdiamonds rubies emeralds and oh i forget the names of all the things he said he found in them but i remember he said that they looked as though theyd been broken out of articles of jewellery two of the chests were full chockablock and the other was about threeparts full and he said that altogether the treasure must be worth millions so as soon as mr barber felt well and strong enough to get away from the place he caulked the seams of his boat and his water breaker with a kind of cotton that he found growing wild made a mat sail for his boat out of grass laid in a stock of fruit and water and taking a handful of the gems along with him went out to sea again but before leaving the place he got the meridian altitude of the sun by setting a stick upright in the ground and measuring the length of its shadow very carefully several days running and in this way he afterwards found that the latitude of the wreck was about degrees minutes south then when he was satisfied that hed got the position near enough to be able to find it again he set his sail and went out to sea but he was unlucky again for on that very night a gale sprang up his sail was blown away and he had all his work cut out to keep the boat from being swamped then he fell ill again and went crazy once more coming to himself again aboard a chinese junk bound for singapore of course the first thing he did was to search for his little packet of gems but they were gone and although he strongly suspected the chinese of having stolen them they swore that they had seen nothing of them at singapore mr barber applied for help as a distressed sailor and after waiting a bit he was sent home in a ship bound for london four days after he landed in london he met father who helped him by giving him money and inviting him to take up his quarters for a bit aboard the yorkshire lass then he told father all about the treasure and they kept on talkin about it every evenin when the days work was done until at last father agreed to help mr barber to search for the treasure he and mr barber to go halves in everything they found and mr barber to come with us as mate andandi think sir thats all and quite enough too i said why it is the most amazing story to which i have ever listened and do you really mean to say that your father actually allowed himself to be persuaded into engaging in such a wildgoose chase as that of hunting for a spot of which the latitude only is knownand that merely approximately i should imagine yes indeed sir it is a fact answered billy i know because father and mr barber drew up an agreement and signed it father keeping one copy and mr barber the other fathers copy is in his desk now if youd care to see it later on perhaps i said there are other and more pressing matters requiring attention just now thiserunfortunate affair of the night before last has i suppose upset all plans and clapped an effectual stopper on the treasurehunting scheme eh i asked turning to the boatswain oh no sir it havent answered enderby it looked a bit like it first off ill allow cause you see the loss of the old man and the mate left us without a navigator and none of us knew which way to head the ship but me and chips bein the only two officers left had a confab together and then we mustered the rest of the hands and put it to em whether theyd all agree to what we two proposed and what we proposed was this barber had evidently persuaded capn stenson that there wasnt no mistake about the treasure actually existin and that it might be found with a bit of tryin otherwise the ship wouldnt be where she is now then there was the agreement between the two by which the treasure when foundwas to be equally divided between em both of em havin gone over the side that agreement couldnt be carried out but there was billy here and there was us the crew of the ship and what me and chips proposed was first of all to get hold of a navigator whod agree to join in with us and then go and try to find the treasure the arrangement bein that billy as his fathers son should have half of it and wethe crew and the navigatorshould divide the other half equally between us there was a lot of palaver over it naturallyyou know sir what sailormen arebut at last everybody agreed and then since we didnt know where to head for we hoveto waitin for something to come along whereby we could get hold of a navigator then at last along comes you and you havin turned up i spose theres no reason why we shouldnt haul down our ensign swing the head yards and fill away to complete the vyage no i said no reason at all why you should not do those things i advise you to fill on the ship at once and steer as you were heading when you had the misfortune to lose your skipper and mate do you know what that course was oh yes answered enderby the course was northeast a quarter east very good said i let that be the course until i shall have had an opportunity to take a set of sights to determine the ships position i suppose captain stenson had a sextant chronometer and all necessary navigation tables aboard yes sir said billy theyre all in his stateroom if youll come with me ill show them to you thanks i said what i am chiefly interested in just now is the chronometer do you happen to know when it was last wound billy yes sir answered the boy last sunday morning father used always to wind it every sunday morning directly after breakfast good i remarked then everything will be quite all right and now bosun what about berthing me where can you stow me no difficulty at all about that sir answered enderby the old mans stateroom is the place for you because his instruments and charts and books are all in there and as of course youll want the place to yourself billy can shift over into the mates stateroom which is also vacant an excellent suggestion i remarked all right agreed enderby then well call that settled steward and when that functionary appeared the boatswain continued joe this is mr blackburn our new skipper youll take your orders from him in future andjoe see that things are straightened up in those two staterooms the beds made and so on the steward very cheerfully assented and enderby and the carpenter then rose to go on deck quickly followed by myself the two men went forard and joined the little crowd assembled on the forecastle to whom as i of course surmised they forthwith proceeded to relate what had passed in the cabin whatever it may have been it seemed to afford the hearers satisfaction for they smiled and nodded approval from time to time as the story was being told and when at length it was ended they all came aft and while one hand hauled down the ensign and stowed it away another stationed himself at the wheel and the remainder tailed on to the braces swung the headyards boarded the foretack and trimmed the jib and staysail sheets getting way upon the ship and bringing her to her former course after which without waiting for any order from me they set the port topgallant topmast and lower studdingsails this done the boatswain and carpenter came aft to where i stood and inquired whether what had been done met with my approval to which i replied in the affirmative and now sir about the watches remarked enderby before the night afore last the mate took the port watch and i the starboard but now that the mates gone how would it be if i was to take the port and chips the starboard watch would that suit ye sir yes i said that would be an excellent arrangement i think by the way how many do you muster in a watch four in each includin me and chips answered the boatswain um none too many especially considering the part of the world to which you are bound i remarked you will have to keep a sharp eye upon the weather and call me in good time if you should be in the least doubt as to what you ought to do has either of you ever been this way before they had not it appeared and what about your forecastle crowd i asked are they all good reliable men some of them are foreigners arent they yes answered enderby lowering his voice and drawing me away from the vicinity of the man at the wheel yes worse luck our four abs are all foreigners not that ive got anything very special to say against em theyre good sailormen all of em but the fact is sir i dont like bein shipmates with foreigners i dont like their ways and some of em has got very nasty tempers theres svorenssen for instance that big chap with the red hair and beardhes a roosian finn and heve got a vile temper and i believe hes an unforgivin sort of feller remembers things against a manif you understand what i mean then theres dutchy as we calls himthat chap that pushed hisself forard when we hoisted in your boathes an awkard feller to get on with too hates bein ordered about and dont believe in discipline he and svorenssen will both be in my watch and ill see to it that they minds their ps and qs the other two arent so bad but theyd be a lot better if svorenssen and dutchy was out of the ship ah well i said we are five englishmen to four of them if they should take it into their heads to be insubordinate i have no doubt we shall know how to deal with them and now i should like to have a look at the logbook i suppose you know where it is kept yes answered enderby the skipper used to keep it in his cabin billyll give it you and show you all you want to see he knows where his father kept everything oh and i forgot to mention it but supperll be on the table at seven oclock righto i returned as i wheeled about and headed for the companion chapter four i take command of the yorkshire lass billy my boy where are you i called as i entered the cabin here i am sir replied the lad emerging from what had been his fathers stateroom is there anything i can do for you sir billy stenson was certainly an amusing and very lovable little chap as he stood there before me alert and brighteyed reminding me somehow of a dog asking for a stick to be thrown into the water that he may show how cleverly he can retrieve it if billy had possessed a tail i am certain that at that moment it would have been wagging vigorously yes billy i said i should like to see the ships logbook enderby tells me that you know where it is kept and can find it for me and i should like another look at the chart that you showed me a little while ago also if you can put your hand upon that agreement between your father and mr barber i should like to look through itwith any other papers there may be bearing upon the matter the story is a very remarkable one and i feel greatly interested in it yes sir said billy ill get you the logbook and the chart and the agreement and i think youd like to see fathers diary too sir when he met mr barber and they began to talk about goin huntin for the treasure he started to keep a diary writin down in it everything that mr barber told him about it and theres a drawin in it that mr barber madea sort of picture of the place showing how it looked so that they might know it when they saw it again ah said i i should certainly like to see that diary if you care to show it me the perusal of it will be most interesting and will probably tell me all that i want to know a few minutes later i was seated at the table with the chart spread open before me the logbook open and the diary at hand ready for immediate reference the logbook however had nothing to do with the story of the treasure it simply recorded the daily happenings aboard the brigantine and her position every noon from the date of her departure from london and the only interest it had for me was that it enabled me to approximate the position of the ship at the moment of the tragedy it had been written up to four oclock in the afternoon of the day on which the tragedy had occurred while the log slate carried on the story up to midnight a few minutes sufficed to make me fully acquainted with all that i required to learn from the logbook and i then laid it aside and turned to the diary this document was inscribed in a thick manuscript book and appeared to have been started about the time when the writer first began seriously to entertain barbers proposal to join him in a search for the treasure it opened with a record of the meeting between barber and the writer and set forth at some length the story of barbers destitute condition and what the writer did to ameliorate it then followed in full detail barbers story of his adventure culminating in the discovery of the stranded wreck and the chests of treasure stowed down in her run with the expression of barbers conviction that the ship had been a pirate it also recorded at length the steps which barber had taken to obtain the necessary data from which to calculate the latitude of the wreck and it was the ingenuity of the mans methods that at last began to impress upon me the conviction that the story might possibly be true especially as it was illustrated by a sketchdrawn from memory it is trueshowing the appearance of the land from the entrance of the river very much in the same way that charts are occasionally illustrated for the guidance of the seaman this story was succeeded by a record of the successive stages by which the negotiations between the writer and barber advanced winding up with a final statement that on such and such a date an agreement had been drawn up in duplicate and signed by the contracting parties whereby stenson was to bear the entire cost of the expeditionrecouping himself so far as might be by securing freights along the route barber undertaking to discharge the duties of mate during the voyage without pay the proceeds of such treasure as might be found to be equally divided between the two men the perusal of the diary fully occupied me right up to the moment when the steward entered to lay the table for supper and when i had finished it i found myself regarding the adventure with very different eyes from those which i had turned upon it to start with to be perfectly frank when i first heard the yarn i had not a particle of faith in the existence of the treasure and quite set down the late skipper as a credulous fool for risking his hardearned money in such a harebrained speculation but after reading the story as set out in extenso and with a very great wealth of detail i felt by no means sure that skipper stenson very far from being the credulous fool that i had originally supposed him to be might not prove to have been an exceedingly shrewd and wideawake person in a word i had begun to believe in the truth of the story of the treasure strange and incredible as it had seemed at first hearing and this change of view on my part involved a corresponding change in my attitude toward the adventure my conversation with enderby and johnson over the teatable had left upon my mind the impression that i had been invited by them as representatives of the entire crew to act as navigator and assist in every possible way to secure the treasure my remuneration for this service to be one share of half the value of the amount of treasure obtained now barber had expressed the opinion that this value was to be reckoned in millions but the eight chests notwithstanding i regarded this estimate as enormously exaggerated the result probably of ignorance of values on barbers part nevertheless assuming the value to be very considerably less say half a millionand i believed it might possibly amount to thatonly a very simple calculation was needed to show that if this sum were divided by two and one of those parts were awarded to billy as skipper stensons heir the remaining sum of one quarter of a million divided into eleven equal partsthere being eleven prospective participants including myselfwould yield to each participant nearly twentythree thousand pounds a sum very well worth trying for viewing the matter in all its bearings i finally came to the conclusion that regarding it merely as a speculation it might be quite worth my while to throw in my lot with these men the project certainly had its allurements for it must be remembered that i was then young enough to be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of adventure i was poor and even the bare possibility of making over twenty thousand pounds in a few months very powerfully appealed to me and finally if i rejected this chance and made the best of my way back home there was the possibility that i might be out of employment for a considerable period while at best i could hope for nothing better than another billet as fourth officer in a planet boat in fine the more i considered the boatswains proposal the better i liked it but at the same time some inward monitor whispered that it would be wise not to manifest too keen a readiness to fall in with the mens proposals while these reflections were passing through my mind i noticed that the steward in laying the table for supper was laying for one person onlymyself but while this arrangement had its advantages it also had certain disadvantages which i regarded as outweighing the former i therefore bade him lay for the boatswain and the carpenter as well for i had sense enough to recognise the importance of keeping my finger upon the pulse of the crew so to speak and i knew that this could best be done by means of little confidential chats with the boatswain and chips who were the mens representatives the steward presently brought along from the galley the chief ingredients of the supper consisting of a pot of piping hot cocoa and a dish of steaming lobscouse to be followed he informed me by a jam tart then i sent billy up on deck to find enderby and bid him come to supper in the cabin during the progress of the meal the conversation was of a general character consisting chiefly of discussions concerning the weather the behaviour of the ship under various circumstances and the relation of certain not very interesting incidents connected with the voyage but after we had finished and chips had come down to take his supper while enderby took over the charge of the deck the boatswain fell into step alongside me as i paced fore and aft enjoying the unwonted luxury of a pipe theres just one pint in what was said at teatime mr blackburn he remarked that i feels a bit hazy about and that i havent been able to make quite clear to the men you remember that when i spoke about you navigatin the ship for us you said youd be willin to do it so far as the nearest port thats about what it was isnt it yes i replied that is what i said so i thought concurred the boatswain well sir he continued do that mean that youre unwillin to take a hand in this here treasure huntin game with us oh as to that i said i really have not had time to consider the matter as yet besides i do not quite know what it is that you men propose let me know that and i will give the matter my most careful consideration ay ay yes of course thats quite right agreed enderby ill have a talk to the chaps forard and hear what theyve got to say about it andabout that nearest port that you mentioned sir had ye got any particular port in your minds eye no i can scarcely say that i had i returnedor if i had it was probably port louis mauritius but all my ideas are very hazy thus far you must understand for at the present moment i do not know where the ship is and i shall be unable to discover her position until i can take the requisite sights then we will have out the chart prick off our position and discuss the matter further yes sir thank e answered enderby and thatll be some time to morrow i spose certainly i agreed some time tomorrowunless of course the sky should be obscured by cloud preventing the taking of the necessary observations but i think we need not seriously fear anything of that kind no sir no not much fear of that agreed enderby and therewith he trundled away forard and joined a little group of men who seemed to be somewhat impatiently awaiting him it was a pleasant evening the sun was on the point of setting and the western sky was a magnificent picture of massed clouds ablaze with the most brilliant hues of gold scarlet crimson and purple while the zenith was a vast dome of purest richest ultramarine a fresh breeze was blowing steadily out from about westsouwest and there was a long and rather high swell overrun by seas just heavy enough to break in squadrons of creaming foamcaps that would have meant an anxious night for me had i still been adrift in the lifeboat apart from those white foamcaps the ocean was a wide expanse of deepest sapphire blue over which the brigantine was rolling and plunging at a speed of fully eight knots her taut rigging humming like an aeolian harp with the sweep of the wind through it for several minutes after enderby had left me i stood gazing in admiration at the brilliant exhilarating scene then for the mere pleasure of stretching my legs a bit after being for so long cramped within the confined limits of the lifeboat i started upon a vigorous tramp fore and aft the weather side of the deck between the wheel grating and the main rigging on the following morning immediately after breakfast i had a long talk with enderby who came aft to lay before me the proposals of the men as to the terms upon which i was to be admitted to partnership in the adventure these were in brief that in consideration of my undertaking the navigation of the ship i was to receive oneeleventh part of that half of the treasure to be shared among the crew so far so good i had no objection to that part of the proposal but when we came to the question of my status in the ship i learned that the four foreigners insisted upon the brigantine being run upon strictly socialistic lines there was to be no skipper no officers no giving of orders the ship was to be worked by two committees consisting of the two watches who were to decide all questions as to making shortening or trimming sail while i was to have no authority whatever no voice in anything except just the determination of the courses to be steered well i demanded what have you englishmen to say to such a proposal oh as to that said enderby me and chips is dead against it we knows as it wouldnt work at all fancy me sayin svorenssen nip up aloft and stow that there togarnsl and him turnin round and sayin if you wants the togarnsl stowed nip up and stow it yourself oh no it wouldnt never do of course it would not i returned but what do the other englishmen think of it why i fancy they dont much care one way or tother answered enderby ye see sir theyre an ignorant lot and can easy be talked over by chaps with the gift of the gab like svorenssen and van ryn theyd be all right if they was left to their selves and was treated as if they was men and not just dumb cattle at the mercy of a brutal driver but them dagoes has a way of talkin about one man being as good as another that makes ignorant men feel dissatisfied with things the way they are just so i returned ive been shipmate with that class of man before today and i know from experience what mischief socialistic doctrines can work in a ships forecastleand elsewhere now you can go forard and explain to the men that if i am to remain in this ship to navigate her and to find the spot where the treasure is supposed to be i will have no socialism aboard her the conditions i insist on are that i am to be skipper that i am to issue such orders as i may deem necessary for the safety of the ship and the welfare of all hands and that i am to be obeyed without question or argument of any kind if the men agree to those conditions well and good if not i shape a course for the nearest port and leave the ship there right ye are sir returned enderby ye may trust me to put the matter to the chaps in a way that theyll understand and i dont think as therell be any trouble to speak of and if there is i fancy that me and chips ll be able to deal with it with that the boatswain walked away forward to convey my ultimatum to the men who were all gathered on the forecastlehead evidently waiting for him while i turned to billy who was standing close by and said when your father took his sights billy who used to note the chronometer times mr barber always answered billy and then he and father used to work out the calculations together but if you want anybody to note the times when you are taking your sights mr blackburn i can do it for you are you sure you can do it quite accurately i asked quite sure asserted billy just you try me sir very well i will said i come below and let me see what you can do billy soon demonstrated that he was to be implicitly trusted in the matter of noting the chronometer times while i took my sights and the morning being gloriously fine i had no difficulty in determining the longitude of the ship which i found to be degrees minutes seconds east while a meridian altitude of the sun taken two hours later gave our latitude as degrees minutes seconds south then i got out the chart of the indian ocean pricked off the ships position on it and sat down to consider what should be the next step for whether i decided to remain in the ship or to leave her her position as now laid down on the chart showed that a shift of helm would be necessary it did not take me very long to decide that in any case i would take the ship into port louis harbour mauritius which might be reached in a week or less if the weather held favourable thence i could report to the owners the loss of the saturn also if i decided to quit the yorkshire lass there i should have the choice of two routes home namely by messageries maritimes via madagascar and the suez canal or by the unioncastle line via cape town and the atlantic if on the other hand the crew acceded to my conditions and i was to remain in the ship to call at port louis would be deviating but a mere trifle from a straight course for the east end of sandalwood island whence i would pass through maurissa strait and go over as nearly as might be the ground that barber was said to have travelled before he struck the spot where he was supposed to have found the treasure when at length i went up on deck again enderby was waiting for me well i said have the people forard made up their minds what they are going to do i am rather anxious to know because upon their decision will depend my final plans its all right mr blackburn answered the boatswain them two chaps svorenssen and van ryn seemed to have quite made up their minds to have things all their own way but me and chips soon brought em up with a round turn by tellin all hands what youd said says i now look here you chaps weve got the navigator we wants and if this here treasure place is to be found you may all bet your boots hell find it but he wont have no socialism no runnin the ship by committees nor no nonsense of that sort hell be mister skipper and dont none of you forget it now you was all quite satisfied when capn stenson commanded the ship what difference do it make to any of you whether its stenson or mr blackburn what gives the orders it dont make a haporth of difference to eer a one of ye very well then me and chips has been talkin things over together and weve decided that havin been lucky enough to get hold of mr blackburn we aint goin to lose im because of any socialistic tommyrot so if theres anybody here as objects to mr blackburns conditions let im say so and well ask the new skipper to put in somewheres and well shove the dissatisfied ones ashore there was a fine old rumpus when i said that the four dagoes swore as they wasnt goin to be done out of their share of the treasure for nobody nor nobody wasnt goin to put em out of the ship and for a minute or two it looked as though we was goin to have a mutiny but we englishmen all stuck together the others backin up me and chips and at last when the dagoes seen which way the wind was blowin they give in and said all right we might ave our own way since we seemed so stuck upon it so there you are sir youre our new skipper and if the dagoes gets obstropolous well just shove em ashore even if we has to maroon em i scarcely think it will be necessary to adopt any such extremely drastic step as that said i if the foreigners are made to understand that the rest of you will stand no nonsense from them they will probably settle down quietly enough if they do notif they manifest the least inclination to be troublesomei will put them ashore at port louis mauritius at which port i intend to call in any case that i may report the loss of the saturn and send certain letters home it will take us very little out of our way and if the dagoes learn that we are going to call in at a british port on our way it may steady them a bit and help them to see that their wisest plan will be to settle down and behave themselves now i am going to shift the helm haul up to nornoreast and take a pull upon the lee braces during the ensuing six days we made excellent progress the brigantine revealing a quite unexpected and most welcome turn of speed which carried us to port louis exactly a week after i had boarded her we remained there four days to enable me to dispatch a cablegram home and receive a reply after which having meanwhile laid in a good supply of fruit and a little fresh meat we sailed again shaping a course for maurissa strait for the four days following our departure from port louis we did well then the breeze lessened in strength became baffling and finally died away altogether leaving us helplessly becalmed except when for a few minutes at a time some vagrant draught of air would come stealing along the glassy surface of the sea imparting to it an evanescent tint of delicate blue and then there would be a call upon the watch to man the braces and trim the yards to meet the transient breathing to the muttered disgust of the men who could see no advantage in labour that resulted in many cases in moving the ship only to the extent of a few fathoms but it had to be done for we were on the borderline between the prevailing westerly winds of the southern ocean and the southeast trades and to get into the latter the ship had to be jockeyed across the intervening belt of calms a curious fact in connection with this time of trial to our patienceand it was a fact that caused me some anxious speculationwas that the two men svorenssen and van ryn who at the outset of my connection with them seemed most likely to be a source of trouble were the two who grumbled least at the continual calls to the braces it was on the afternoon of the fourth of these trying days that as we lay becalmed in the middle of a glasssmooth sea the polished surface became touched here and there with faint evanescent patches of softest turquoiseblue appearing for a moment and then vanishing again they were the catspaws that indicated a momentary stir in the stagnant air and the appearances of which were always greeted by the foremast hands with execrations for they meant boxhauling the yardswork for what they regarded as a ludicrously inadequate result but on this occasion the catspaws instead of enduring for a few seconds and then being no more seen for hours at a time lingered for as long perhaps as two or three minutes then passing away only to be succeeded by others coming from the same quarter and enduring a little longer than their predecessors so continuing until at length we not only got way upon the ship but were able to maintain it during the lessening intervals between one puff and another finally a moment arrived when the catspaws began to merge one into another while the whole surface of the sea down in the southeastern quarter lost its hateful mirror like appearance and donned a tint of faintest most delicate blue that deepened even as we watched creeping steadily down toward us until it reached the ship and with a last gentle rustle of canvas she yielded to the impulse of the first breathing of the southeast trades when at length the true breeze reached us it came away out from about southeast by south enabling us still to lay our course on the starboard tack with the braces the merest trifle checked once fairly set in the wind rapidly freshened until when we of the afterguard went down to supper at seven oclock that evening a fiery breeze was humming through our tautened rigging and the hooker was reeling off her seven knots with the royal stowed and a rapidly rising sea foaming under her lee bow chapter five we find the treasure it was a grand evening when after supper i went on deck for my usual constitutional the salt ozoneladen breeze was just cool enough to set ones blood coursing freely through ones veins and to fill one with the joy of living the ship was making good headway and the sky over our lee quarter was a gorgeous blaze of gold and colour where the sun was sinking in the midst of a galaxy of clouds of the most wonderful forms it was like a yachting experience in those latitudes the glories of the sunset very quickly fade and with their disappearance night falls upon the scene like the drawing of a curtain so was it on the evening in question but i had grown accustomed to those rapid nightfalls and for a few minutes i immersed in my own thoughts was quite unaware of anything unusual in our surroundings as the darkness deepened around us however it suddenly occurred to me that there was something strange in the appearance of the water instead of its colour deepening under the shadow of night as usual it seemed to be becoming lighter as though it was being diluted with increasing quantities of milk until as i stood and watched it wondering it became first of all snowwhite and then as the darkness continued to deepen and the stars appeared the entire ocean from horizon to horizon became a sea of luminous molten silver the weird unearthly beauty of which there are no words to describe yet beautiful as it was the unusual almost unique character of the phenomenon invested it with an aweinspiring element that was not very far removed from terror especially for the men on the forecastle whose anxious glances aft and restless agitated movements sufficiently proclaimed their apprehension presently chips who was in charge of the watch and who had been padding fore and aft on the lee side of the afterdeck crossed over and remarked whats the matter with the water tonight mr blackburn boy and man ive used the sea a good twenty year and more and never have i seen a sight like this do it signify anything particular think ye nothing beyond a most unusual and exceedingly beautiful state of phosphorescence i replied i have not used the sea for anything like so long a time as yourself but i have seen something of the same kind once before though nothing like so brilliant and beautiful as this and it was not so very far from this spot that i saw it while making the run from cape town to melbourne it is due to the presence in quite unusual numbers of the animalculae which produce the appearance of phosphorescence in the water but while under ordinary circumstances those animalculae are only present in sufficient numbers to cause the usual appearance of stars and luminous clouds in agitated water they are present here tonight in such incalculable myriads that the light they emit instead of being more or less detached is merged into one uniform blaze of the beautiful silvery radiance which we see it may last for several hours yet but sooner or later it will become normal again my explanation seemed to afford chips considerable relief and he presently sauntered away forard with the evident intention of allaying the apprehensions of the forecastle hands while my prognostication as to the ending of the phenomenon was verified about an hour later there now ensued a full month and more during which we steadily plodded our way across the indian ocean closehauled day after day with nothing more eventful than the occasional capture of a shark or a capful of wind to break the somewhat wearisome monotony of the voyage during which i devoted an hour or two every day to the improvement of master billy stensons education also giving a considerable amount of study to the late skippers diary in the endeavour to arrive at some sort of conclusion as to the whereabouts of the spot where barbers alleged treasure was to be looked for taking barbers determination of the latitude of the place degrees minutes south as being approximately correct i ruled a pencil line representing that parallel right across the chart and noted the various islands that it crossed then marking the spot where the man had been turned adrift by the dutch skipper i strove to trace the course over which the boat had drifted taking into consideration the prevailing winds and currents as set forth in the sailing directions and in this way i ultimately arrived at the conclusion that the spot we were seeking would be found somewhere between the meridians of degrees and degrees east longitude still assuming barbers story to be true i reasoned that the fact of the stranded ship having remained so long where she was apparently unvisited and uninterfered withuntil the englishmans arrival upon the sceneargued that she was to be found on an island not only uninhabited but also very rarely visited and reasoning thus i was at length enabled to make a fairly shrewd guess as to the most likely direction in which to look for her and in that direction i accordingly headed the ship it was about a month after our passage through maurissa strait that as we were working to windward against a light and fickle breeze land was sighted about three points on the weather bow the time was close upon eight bells in the afternoon watch and the land sighted was a mere dot of faintest blue showing just clear of the horizon i had been anticipating its appearance at any moment since i had worked out my sights at noon and pricked off the ships position on the chart for the spot of which we were in search was no unknown mysterious island careful study of barbers narrative as recorded in the late skipper stensons diary had convinced me that the island was quite well known and had been more or less thoroughly surveyed and exhaustive study of the diary and the chart combined had finally led me to the conclusion that if the treasure really existed it would be found not very far from the peak that had just hove in sight but of that i should perhaps be better able to judge when i could see a little more of it i therefore took the ships telescope out of the beckets where it hung in the companion and slinging it over my shoulder made my way up to the royal yard where i seated myself comfortably and steadying the tube of the instrument against the masthead brought it to bear upon the land to windward from my elevated position this now showed as a steep cone of moderate height rising from one extremity of a long range of lofty hills running away in a southeasterly direction until they sank below the horizon so far so good the contours of the distant land as revealed by the lenses of the telescope agreed in a general way fairly accurately with a sketchmade from memory by barberin the late skippers diary illustrating a passage descriptive of the appearance of the treasure country as it had appeared to the man upon his departure from it if as we drew nearer a certain arrangement of white rocks outcropping on the hillside immediately below the cone should reveal itself i should then know beyond all possibility of doubt that i had found the spot of which we were in search but this condition of certainty could not possibly be arrived at before the morrow at the earliest for the land was quite fifty miles away it was dead to windward and the ship working up against a light breezewas approaching it at the rate of less than a knot an hour happily for our impatience matters shortly afterwards improved somewhat for with the setting of the sun the breeze freshened and by the end of the second dogwatch we were slashing away to windward at a fine rate reeling off our eight knots per hour with the royal stowed the breeze held all through the night and when i went on deck at eight oclock on the following morning the cone that i had viewed through the telescope on the previous evening was only some fifteen or sixteen miles distant broad on the weather bow and the arrangement of white rocks on the hillsidefive of them forming a vertical linewhich the diary assured me was the distinguishing mark by which i might identify the spot for which i was searchingwas clearly visible in the lenses of the telescope while the mouth of the estuary was about five miles ahead yes i said to enderby who was standing beside me as i closed the instrument we are all rightso far the opening to the norard of that curious hummock is the mouth of the estuary into which barber drifted while in a state of delirium and the stranded hulk which is supposed to contain the treasure stands according to him somewhere on the southern shore we shall have to make short boards along that southern shore keeping a sharp lookout for anything in the nature of a stranded craft anchor abreast it and go ashore and give it a careful overhaul thus far it looks as though there might be some truth in the mans story i have no longer any doubt that barber actually entered that estuary but i shall still have to see that wreck before i am finally convinced of her existence barber was admittedly crazy when he landed yonder and for all that we know to the contrary he may have remained crazy all the time that he was there and have imagined the whole thing holy moses exclaimed the boatswain in consternation you surely dont mean to say sir that after all this time you still has doubts about the truth of that there treasure yarn do ye if we dont find that wrack therell be the dickens to pay in the forecastle the men especially them dagoesll be that disappinted that theres no knowin what game they may try to play howwhat do you mean boatswain i demanded sharply well mr blackburn he returned what i means is that if we dont find the wrack the chapsll be so disappinted that in their rage they may rise upon us the afterguard and try to take the ship from us what good would that do them i demanded if they were to attempt so foolish a thing and were to succeed what could they do with the ship i suppose even theydolts as they would prove themselves in such an event as you mentionwould not be idiots enough to suppose that they could compensate for their disappointment by becoming pirates eh blest if i know what they mightnt believe if svorenssen and the two dutchmen got talkin to em asserted the boatswain theyre wonderful talkers all three of em and theyre everlastinly gassin about one man bein as good as another and freedom and the rights of manyou know sir the sort of slush that such chaps spouts and that the shellback swallers as greedily as he would a pannikin of eggflip yes i said i know i have heard it all over and over again until i have been sick and tired of listening to it and i have wondered how it is that sensible levelheaded british sailors even though they may not have had very much education can swallow and believe in such froth however i am very glad that you have mentioned the matter i will keep my weather eye lifting and at the very first sign of trouble ill act and to some purpose too thats right sir i hopes you will approved enderby and if action should ever be needful you may depend upon me and chips to back ye up in the meantime ill keep my eyes and ears open too and let you know directly i sees any signs of trouble brewin when i descended to the cabin a few minutes later in response to the stewards summons to breakfast i found billy stenson already seated at the table billy i should explain had within two days of my arrival aboard the yorkshire lass been promoted from the position of pantry boy to that of passenger in virtue of the fact that through his fathers death he had become the owner of the brigantine and the inheritor of all prospective profits which might accrue in respect of the present highly speculative voyage he had also become my pupil i having undertaken to ground him in the rudiments of navigation good morning billy i said do you happen to know whether there are any firearms or weapons of any sort aboard here yes mr blackburn replied the lad when father and mr barber agreed upon this voyage they decided that they ought to have the means of defending the ship if necessary and so father bought a dozen rifles with bayonets and three brace of navy revolvers with a good supply of ammunition for both kinds of firearms theyre in two cases down in the lazarette do the men forard know theyre aboard i asked oh no sir i dont think so answered the lad they came aboard and were stored away a week or more before the crew was shipped good i commented then turning to enderby who also was present i said what you said on deck a little while ago suggests to me that it will be a wise thing to have those cases up out of the lazarette without further delay well open them give their contents an overhaul and clean and oil them ready for immediate use if need be we may not require them but if on the other hand we should the need will probably be so urgent that there will then be no time for preparation we will have them up immediately after breakfast upon my return to the deck i found that we were just entering the estuary the mouth of which was about three miles wide the shore on either side being quite low with here and there narrow strips of beach composed of sand and gravel the low flat shore on either side of the inlet was backed by ranges of hills extending inland as far as the eye could see but whereas the low flat country between the shore and the base of the hills was less than a mile wide on the northern bank it ranged from five to twelve miles wide on the southern side the soil was everywhere grassclad the grass seeming to be very luxuriant and about three feet high while dotted about pretty thickly all over the plains were clumps of palmetto palms trees of various kindssome of which would probably be the fruittrees that had restored barber to lifeand big clumps of bamboo and scrub i anticipated that it would be among those clumps of scrub that we should eventually find the treasure hulk if indeed the craft actually existed and was not the figment of a madmans imagination and i also foresaw that our search for the hulk might easily be a very much more arduous and protracted affair than i had anticipated for it appeared to me that every one of those clumps big enough to conceal the hull of a fivehundredton hulk ought to be examined there was no need however for us to begin our search quite at once for we were only entering the estuary whereas according to barbers account the hulk lay some six or eight miles from the entrance this assumed distance was of course a very vague and unreliable guide and i therefore determined to take the ship up the inlet about five miles anchor her and commence our search at that point gradually working our way upward meanwhile the wind had come away far enough out from the southward to enable us to hug the southern shore as closely as we pleased consequently although the breeze was light we made good progress and within an hour had reached a point at which i decided our quest might very well begin we therefore anchored furled all canvas hoisted out the jollyboat and making up a searchparty consisting of the four foreigners enderby and myself went ashore and began our hunt for a craft in the existence of which i had little or no belief our chief difficulty was that we had no bearings to guide us i concluded that at the time of barbers visit he was destitute of all means to make notes or records of any kind for his story was set down entirely from memory and was singularly barren of all information but that of the most general character there were no little illuminating details to tell us whether we were or were not nearing our goal the one solitary fact from which i could draw a useful deduction was that at the time of barbers arrival in the estuary he was very ill and weak yet despite his feeble condition he was able to reach certain trees the fruit of which restored him to health now from that fact i deduced the inference that the particular fruittrees to which barber owed his restoration must of necessity be at no great distance from the beach otherwise the man would not have had strength to reach them hence to find the spot at or near which barber landed we must look for a part of the plain where trees were growing within say two or three hundred yards of the waters edge there was just one such clump abreast the spot where we had anchored apart from which i could see no others anything like so near the beach for a distance of fully a mile to the eastward i confess that i entered upon this treasurehunt hampered by a very strong feeling of doubt of course i had ocular evidence of the existence of such a place as barber had described as that where the treasure was to be found for there it was visibly before me i was also prepared to lend credence to the story of the stranded hulk strange as that story might seem for i actually had personal knowledge of even stranger happenings than that but it was the existence of the treasure itselfthose steelbound chests packed with gold silver and gemsthat i doubted according to barbers own story he was crazy when he drifted into the estuary and although he may not have known it he perhaps remained crazy all the time he was there and if it was indeed true that he had stumbled upon a stranded ancient hulk that very fact may have so excited his disordered brain as to cause him to imagine the treasure looking back at the episode now after the lapse of years that it appears to me was very much my mental attitude with regard to it yet my doubts notwithstanding i was determined to leave no stone unturned to test barbers story to the uttermost consequently when late in the afternoon of the following day we actually came upon the hulk my chief feeling was one of surprise there was nothing whatever of an exciting or dramatic character in the circumstances connected with our discovery it was all absolutely commonplace we were not even molested by natives of whom we saw no sign from first to last having thoroughly searched without result the entire area of the flat country for a space of eight or nine square miles immediately opposite the spot where the brigantine was first anchored we got under way again and under foreandaft canvas only moved the ship some three miles farther up the estuary intently studying the country on our starboard hand meanwhile through the ships telescope on the lookout for any object suggestive of a stranded hulk overgrown with creepers and it was in this way that we found her the telescope enabling us to identify her at a distance of fully a mile arrived abreast of her we again anchored the brigantine and the same searchparty under my command once more landed and walked straight to the hulk she lay high and dry at a distance of about a quarter of a mile from the beach a dismasted craft of some seven hundred tons burden built on the lines of the old spanish galleon with a low bow and forecastle and a lofty stern and aftercastle the great flat stern embellished with much carving and the remains of a gallery and surmounted by the iron frames of three big poop lanterns no doubt she had once presented a very gallant picture of paintwork and gilding traces of which were discoverable about her here and there but apart from these her whole exterior had been reduced by sun and rain to a uniform tint of neutral grey except where moss and fungus had taken hold of her we boarded her without difficulty but no sooner had we arrived below than we found ample confirmation of barbers statement as to her rottenness for what with dryrot and white ants her deck planking and beams had become the merest shells of wood yielding freely in places to the pressure of a mans weight so that in order to avoid accidents we had to move about aboard her with the utmost circumspection what was very much more to the point however was that we found not only the ship but also the eight big chests of treasure exactly as described by barber in the yarn given in the late skippers diary they had all been broken open but their contents appeared to be intact and as i very carefully examined them i arrived at the conclusion that they had never been touched since barber himself had left them to go in search of the assistance he needed in order to secure possession of their contents the discovery of the chests and still more the sight of their contents was naturally productive of the utmost excitement and also quite naturally it at once roused all the greed that was latent in our natures so far as enderby and i were concerned we were quite able to control ourselves but no sooner did the four dagoes set eyes upon the gold coins with which one of the chests was filled than they threw themselves upon that chest as starving wolves might throw themselves upon a carcass and proceeded to stuff their pockets with coin this of course could not possibly be permitted and enderby and i drawing our revolvers compelled the quartette to replace in the chest every coin they had snatched but they yielded only under compulsion and with snarls growlings and muttered menaces which were only silenced by my threat to maroon them on the spot if they showed the least sign of a disposition to give further trouble the transfer of those eight heavy steelbound chests with their contents was a trying job but nothing would induce the men to leave a single one of them where they were for another night they insisted on being allowed to stick to their task until it was completed and by dint of such strenuous effort as probably none of them had ever before exerted the task was completed a few minutes after sunset following upon which i caused the whole to be securely fastened up and struck down into the lazarette the forenoon of the next day was spent ashore gathering an abundant stock of such fruits as the place afforded and immediately after dinner the jollyboat was hoisted in the anchor hove up and the yorkshire lass stood out to sea chapter six caught in a typhoon those who have never enjoyed the experience of suddenly coming upon a treasure of enormous value a substantial share of which one knows will one day be ones own will naturally suppose that the crew of the yorkshire lass would be one of the happiest and most contented little communities on the face of the earth and assuredly they ought to have been in so far at least as the prospective possession of great wealth can confer happiness for little as any of us knew of the actual value of the treasure we had so easily obtained we knew enough to feel assured that when the time for division should arrive we should each be rich enough to be independent for the rest of our lives of any need to work for a living but on the contrary as a matter of fact the acquisition of the treasure gave rise to a condition of restiveness and discontent that caused me grave uneasiness not that i was greatly surprised from the moment when i first climbed in over the brigantines rail from the saturns lifeboat i recognised that the presence of the four dagoes in the ships company was likely to breed discord but it was not until i witnessed the mad covetousness with which they flung themselves upon the chest containing coin and proceeded to help themselves regardless of the rights of us others that i actually began to scent real serious trouble for i then foresaw that having once glimpsed the treasure those men would never more be content until it was actually theirs to squander in the debauchery that they called pleasure the trouble which i anticipated developed within twentyfour hours of our departure from the estuary first taking the form of a demand on the part of the six seamen in the forecastle that the division of the treasure should be effected forthwith and when i pointed out that owing to the impossibility of justly valuing such articles as gold and silver candlesticks salvers bowls cups caskets jewelled crosses articles of jewellery and gems such a division as they desired was out of the question they insisted that the ship should forthwith be taken to the nearest civilised port in order that the treasure might be turned into money and the division effected to this i replied that only in london would it be possible to obtain anything approaching fair value for so enormous a treasure as ours therefore to london i intended to take it whereupon the dagoes became so violently insubordinate that forcible measures had to be resorted to and a very pretty fight ensued between them on the one hand and the boatswain carpenter and myself on the other before we succeeded in putting the quartette in irons and dumping them down upon the ballast in the main hold where i informed them they would remain until they should show unmistakable signs of having come to their senses such resolute action coupled with the fact that during their confinement their food consisted solely of coarse ship biscuit and water soon brought the insubordinate ones to their bearings a message of unconditional surrender being brought from them to me within thirtysix hours of their confinement promising good behaviour in the future if i would release them and permit them to return to duty naturally i was more than willing to accept the olive branch thus held out for the absence from duty of four able seamen out of our little company left the ship perilously undermanned and would have involved us in serious difficulties might indeed have imperilled the safety of the ship had we fallen in with bad weather fortunately however the weather for the first week after our departure from the estuary proved to be almost too fine for our liking consisting as it did of light baffling contrary airs interspersed with spells of calm thus the temporary confinement below of the four foreigners proved of no disadvantage to us although i was heartily glad to have them back on duty again nevertheless it soon became apparent that their reformation was like beauty only skindeep and that at heart they were as ready as ever to give trouble the exceptionally fine weather to which i have just referred continued for nearly a month during which with much pulling and hauling at tacks sheets and braces we contrived to jockey the brigantine fairly into the pacific where i intended to hunt up a cargo of copra sandalwood and shell on the way home but such an extraordinarily long spell of fine weather as we had been experiencing was bound to break sooner or later and the break came during the afternoon of our twentyseventh day out the barometer which for nearly three weeks had been standing well above thirty inches gave us the first warning of the coming change by an ominously rapid decline of the mercury which was quickly succeeded by a subtle veiling of the sky the clear rich blue of which gradually changed to a uniform tint of dirty white in the midst of which the sun hung a mere shapeless blotch the light breeze that during the earlier part of the day had been fanning us along at a scant three knots died away leaving the surface of the sea oilsmooth and colourless while the stagnant air grew so hot that we literally felt the heat of it in our nostrils with every breath we drew the quality of the air seemed to change too rendering it difficult to breathe so that we found ourselves gasping for breath at frequent intervals while perspiration poured from us in streams that we could distinctly feel trickling down our bodies and limbs so enervating were the conditions that none of us cared to make the slightest unnecessary movement yet the steady decline of the mercury was a warning that i dared not ignore accordingly at eight bells in the afternoon watch when enderby took charge of the deck i showed him the barometer expressed the conviction that we were in for a typhoon and instructed him to set all hands to the task of stripping the ship to a closereefed topsail reefed fore topmaststaysail and closereefed main trysail when the boatswain went forard and gave the necessary orders the men received them as i had quite expected with black looks muttered curses and inarticulate growls but the sight of chips and me lowering and stowing the big mainsail while they surlily slouched about the deck letting go halliards clewing up and hauling down and perhaps more than all the aspect of the heavens conveying a message that no man could misinterpret caused them somewhat to modify their attitude and by four bells the ship was as nearly ready for what might come as we could make her but our preparations were completed not a moment too soon for we were in a latitude where twilight is unknown and with the disappearance of the sun below the horizon there closed down upon us a darkness that might literally be felt for any attempt to move about the decks well as we believed ourselves to be acquainted with them resulted in constant collisions with unexpected obstacles this bewildering state of affairs continued until shortly after five bells in the first watch when we became aware that the atmosphere was being subtly and gradually suffused with ruddy light coming from we knew not where the change was so gradual that it was impossible to say just when it began but within half an hour of our first perception of it the light had grown so strong that not only were we able to move about freely without running foul of things but standing aft by the useless wheel and looking forward every detail of the ships hull spars sails and rigging stood out clearly and sharply like a silhouette cut out of black paper against a background of shining oil smooth water and dense masses of twisting and writhing cloudshapes all reflecting the weird mysterious ruddy light it was an aweinspiring phenomenon strongly suggestive of the supernatural and from the uneasy glances that were directed aft from the forecastle it was not difficult to surmise that none of the men had ever before beheld anything like it neither had we of the afterguard for that matter and i have no doubt that i should have been very much more seriously alarmed than i was at the spectacle had i not read somewhere the description of a hurricane that had been similarly heralded as it was i was by no means happy at the prospect of what was in store for us asking myself uneasily whether quite all had been done that it was possible to do to prepare the ship for the impending ordeal there was but one thing i could think of and that was to order all the scuttles to be securely closed and this was at once done although it rendered the cabins insupportably hot and close of course i should have liked to send down the royal and topgallant yards and to have housed the fore topgallant mast and main topmast and i would have attempted it had we had a decently willing crew but i doubted whether the dagoes would have undertaken the job except under compulsion and i was unwilling to engage in a tussle with a crowd of insubordinates with a hurricane threatening to burst upon us at any moment naturally under the circumstances i never dreamed of turning in nor did any of the others for that matter the boatswain and chips keeping me company aft while a glance forard showed that even the forecastle bunch jealous as they were of their rights preferred for once in a way to spend their watch below on deck shortly after midnight the weird ruddy light began to fade indicating that the crisis was approaching i accordingly sent the boy billy below secured the companion doors and closed the slide knowing this to be one of the ships most vulnerable points in a heavy sea such as one might expect when the gale should burst upon us and thereafter there was nothing more to be done but to abide events it was about half an hour later and the light had almost entirely faded when we got our first distinct warning to stand by it came in the form of a sudden scurry of wind apparently from nowhere in particular that swept whining and moaning over the ship causing the canvas to flap violentlyand then it was gone this occurred perhaps half a dozen times each gust lasting a few seconds longer and being perceptibly stronger than the one which preceded it smiting the canvas with such violence that i quite expected to see it fly out of the bolt ropes while the brigantine being only in ballast rocked and staggered like a drunken man fortunately there remained just light enough to enable us to trace the direction from which those tornadoes came with their help therefore chips and i who at once sprang to the wheel managed to get the ships head round before the hurricane itself struck us enderby going forard to stand by on the forecastle it announced its approach by a low weird unearthly moaning that with terrifying rapidity swelled to a deafening compound of the shrieking yell of the swooping wind and the hiss of the tempestlashed sea as it rushed in the form of a wall of ghastly heapedup phosphorescent foam stretching from horizon to horizon straight down upon the ship the spectacle of that unbridled outburst of elemental fury was aweinspiring beyond the power of words to describe but it was terrifying too as was evidenced by chips remark a moment before the gale struck us leaning over toward me as we stood on opposite sides of the wheel he yelled goodbye sir this is the finish the ship aint built that could weather such an outfly as this and i felt very much inclined to agree with him to me it seemed impossible that any combination of wood and metal the work of mens hands however cunningly fashioned and deftly put together could withstand such a frenzied onslaught as that which was about to burst upon us another instant and we were within the hurricanes clutches with a yell of indescribable fury the blast struck us and as the stormwave boiled in over our taffrail and swept along the deck filling it to the level of the rail and taking with it in its rush forard every movable thing in its way i saw the storm trysail fill with a terrific jerk of the doubled sheets and then go flying away out of the boltropes like a sheet of tissue paper whether or not the remainder of our canvas had withstood the strain i could not for the moment determine for i was up to the armpits in the surging water pinned by it and the pressure of the wind so hard up against the wheel that i momentarily expected to feel my breastbone collapse under the pressure luckily the gale came up square astern and hit us endon luckily also we were in ballast and the ship was therefore quite lively nevertheless i felt the hull under my feet tremble perceptibly under the tremendous strain to which it was subjected as the wind and sea smote her and for a few breathless moments i believed she was foundering under us then as she gradually freed herself of the water that flooded her decks she gathered way and went foaming off before the gale like a mad thing the next occurrence of which i was clearly conscious was that chips was again leaning over toward me and shouting my god mr blackburn that was a narrer squeak if ever there was one if anybody had told me that the old hooker would have stood it i wouldnt ha believed em but i think were all right now so long as we can keep her runnin afore it if only the spars and riggin ll stand the strain but what about whats ahead of us sir is there anything that were likely to run foul of nothing so far as i know answered i the chart shows a clear sea for some hundreds of miles to the eastward and before we have run that distance the gale will have blown itself out but there is enderby trying to claw his way aft i wonder what news he has for us the unnatural ruddy light in the sky had by this time quite died out but it was replaced by a faint ghostly sheen emitted by the foaming surface of the windscourged sea and by this feeble radiance it was just possible to discern the burly form of the boatswain laboriously clawing aft along the port bulwarks against the tremendous pressure of the wind presently he reached us and seated himself upon the wheel grating at my feet gasping and panting for breath well enderby i shouted whats the news from the fore end of the ship did the sea that pooped us do any damage not so much as might ha been expected returned the boatswain the jollyboats clean gone the lifeboats a wreck the togallant bulwark both sides is gone forard of the fore riggin the staysail blowed out of the boltropes directly the gale struck us andworst of allweve lost three of our little crowd lost i ejaculated what dye mean man just what i says mr blackburn answered the boatswain weve lost three handsvan haalst mendal and manning the sea that broke aboard us must have took em unawares and swept em over the bows for they was on deck before we was swept and when she cleared herself they was gone jove thats bad news indeed said i we were shorthanded enough before but we shall be worse off than ever now and they were all good men too we can ill spare them ay agreed enderby theres others that we could better have spared if some of em had to go but as to them bein good menwell they was good enough sailormen i wont deny but if wed lost em any other way than bein drowndedif theyd cut and run for instancei wouldnt ha grieved overmuch at the loss of the two dagoes thereupon we fell silent for to outshout the yell of the wind and the roar of the sea was no easy matter moreover the loss of those three men set me thinking and on top of that the ship needed most careful watching for in light trim as she was there were moments when the rudder seemed to lose control of her and then it taxed our skill and strength to the utmost to prevent her broaching to which would have meant the end of her and of all hands i shall never forget that night so long as i live never before had i known it blow anything like so hard the wind smote one like something solid and with such tremendous force that to have stood up unsupported against the pressure of it would have been impossible if it had been blowing say half as hard as it actually was there would have been a terrific sea running but far from this being the case the surface of the ocean was as flat as a billiardtable the slightest roughness being instantly seized by the wind and swept away to leeward in the form of scudwater then there was the appalling unnatural darkness through which the ship was rushing at a speed which i am certain she had never before attained the only mitigating circumstance was that the windlashed sea emitted a certain ghostly radiance that despite the deluge of spindrift and scud water with which the air was saturated enabled one dimly to discern objects as far forward as the foremast but to rush at the speed at which we were travelling into the heart of that pitchy blackness was nerveracking work for although the chart assured us that we had a clear sea for some hundreds of miles ahead there were still such possibilities as derelicts to be reckoned with and under such circumstances as i have been endeavouring to describe if an obstacle of any sort should happen to be in our way to avoid it would be a sheer impossibility while to strike it would mean for us simplydestruction i was anxiously considering the chance of such an eventuality when another terrific gust swooped down upon us the ship trembled and lurched forward as though she were about to plunge to the bottom and have done with it i heard a loud crack behind me and simultaneously received a terrible blow on the back of the head thenoblivion a dull aching throbbing pain at the back of my head was the sensation of which i was first conscious upon awaking from what seemed to have been a sleep haunted by innumerable harrowing nightmares then before i had time to fully realise that i was once more awake and free from the torment of those dreadful nightmares i became aware of two things first that a soft warm saltladen breeze was gently fanning my face and affording me much refreshment and next that the air was vibrant with the deep booming thunder of heavily breaking surf i was aware also that i was in bed and that apart from my throbbing headache i was quite comfortable and for perhaps two or three minutes i remained as i was quiescent enjoying the sensation of comfort quite oblivious of everything else then it suddenly occurred to me to wonder where i was what was the matter with my headand back came the memory of that awful night of hurricanethat terrible blow on the back of my head and opening my eyes i started up with an inarticulate cry that is to say i attempted to start upbut failed my body felt like lead i had no strength to move it and after a moments ineffectual struggle i abandoned the attempt and let my head sink back upon the pillow as i did so i became aware of a slight movement at my side and glancing in that direction i saw the boy billy bending over me with an expression of deep anxiety in his eyes as he continued to gaze the expression of anxiety gave place to one of satisfaction and he said ah thats better mr blackburn i believe youre not going to die yet after all going to die i reiterated have i been ill then you have and no mistake emphatically asserted the boy for four days and nights you have been just raving and all the while you refused to take anything but an occasional drink of water no wonder you found yourself too weak to rise just now by jove ejaculated i you amaze me billy buti am puzzled i am in my own bunk in my own cabin there is a nice breeze blowing for i can feel it coming through the open scuttle and i hear the seething of water along the ships side yet ill swear she is not moving an inch what is the explanation ill tell you in a minute or two answered billy but first let me get you some broth for i can see that youre about done up and need something to strengthen you i thought this morning that you seemed a bit different and when you stopped raving and dropped off to sleep i seized the chance to get something ready for you against the time when you woke up ill fetch it in half a jiffy so saying billy disappeared into the main cabin returning a minute or two later with a bowl of steaminghot savourysmelling soup with which after propping me up with cushions he cautiously fed me a little at a time until he thought i had taken as much as was good for me then removing the cushions he lowered me gently back into a reclining position made me comfortable and seating himself by my bedside proceeded to make me acquainted with the happenings succeeding my accident chapter seven billy tells how we became wrecked my word began billy i shant forget in a hurry the awful look of the sky that night when you ordered me to come below and i heard you slam the companion doors behind me and draw over the slide i felt certain that with a sky blazing like that when it was gettin on toward the middle of the night something dreadful was goin to happen andit did didnt it i was frightened enough to start with but when you battened me down i tell you mr blackburn i was fairly terrified and two or three times i climbed halfway up the companion stairs intendin to shout to you to let me out then i thought again that you wouldnt have sent me below if you hadnt known it was the best place for me so i crept back again and curled up on the locker cushions and then came the hurricane i heard it even before it struck the ship and when it hit her and i felt her shiver i made sure that it was all up with us and i knelt down on the cabin floor and kept on sayin my prayers over and over again i was still sayin em when i suddenly heard the slide pushed back and the companion doors flung open there was a scuffling of feet on the stairs and i heard enderby and chips warnin one another to be careful then they came into the cabin carryin you between em and they laid you on the cabin table and said youd met with an accident and i saw that your head was bleedin they undressed you all in a hurry put you in your bunk told me to look after you and then rushed up on deck again shuttin me in just as you did you were insensible then so i got to work and hunted up some stuff to make bandages with then i opened the medicinechest and got out the book of instructions and while i was trying to find out what was the proper thing to do i heard the bosun and chips shoutin something i listened tryin to hear what they were shoutin about and then above the noise of the wind i heard another sound likewell i can hardly describe it but you can hear it now the roar of the surf on the reef it grew louder and louder still until it waswell just deafenin then i felt the ship hove first up and then down then she touched something but didnt seem to hit it very hard i felt a blow like a heavy sea hittin her i heard the fall and rush of water on her deck and a crash that sounded as if the mainmast had gone over the side then she struck againharderthree or four times heeling over until she seemed to be on her beamends and flinging me right across the cabin floor and all the time i could hear that she was bein swept by awfully heavy seas but after a bit things got rather more quiet i felt that we were aground but still rolling heavily and i could hear at every roll a sort of crunching sound as though the planking of the ships bottom was grinding upon something but the seas werent coming aboard now nearly so heavy nor so often as they were and after a time they didnt come aboard at all the rocking motion eased up and i thought from the sound that it didnt seem to be blowin quite so hard all this time you were in your bunk insensible but as soon as i was able to stand without bein flung down again i got some water from the pantry filter and bathed your head there was a nasty cut in it and it was still bleedin but i washed it as well as i could and made a pad that i bound tightly over it accordin to the directions i found in the book and then i think i must have fallen asleep for i dont remember anything more happenin until i awoke and saw the sun shinin through your scuttle and the cabin skylight you were still insensible so i bathed your head afresh put a new dressing on it and then went on deck to have a look round my word mr blackburn i was astonished when i pushed open the companion slide and looked out the ship is ashore on a reef a total wreck both masts gone by the board bulwarks carried away decks swept and everything but the galley goneand you and i are all that are left of the crew good heavens billy you surely dont mean to say that all hands except ourselves are lost i exclaimed in horrified tones yes i do mr blackburn protested the boy and you wouldnt be surprised if you had heardas i didthe tremendous seas that swept the ship when she first hit the reef i shouldnt have been a bit surprised if she had gone to pieces right then its no wonder that the decks were clean swept no wonder indeed i agreed you say that we are ashore on a reef billy what sort of a reef is it just ordinary rocks or no answered billy its not just jagged seaweedcovered rocks but all white almost like marble a little bit rough and uneven but not like the rocks we get at home this reef seems to be all in a piece like a great tremendously thick wall yes i interrupted i think i understand it is probably a coral reef how far does it extend how far reiterated billy whypointingit comes from away over there as far as you can see and stretches right across to as far as you can see on the other side ay i agreed a coral reef without a doubt and how much water is there alongside not more than two or three feet at most answered billy were standin a lot higher out of the water than we were when afloat when i first noticed it i thought it was because it happened to be low water when i looked but it isnt that because its always pretty nearly the same i dont think theres a difference of more than just a few inches between high and low water in that case i commented as much to myself as to my companion the explanation probably is that when we hit the reef the sea was heaped up by the gale considerably above its usual level and that it has now subsided again leaving us nearly high and dry now billy is there any land in sight if so what does it look like billy considered for a moment or two evidently conjuring up a mental picture then he answered first about two miles off theres a beach of very white sand then theres a lot of treespalm trees i think they must begrowing all along the inner edge of the beach and behind them bushes and more treesthousandsmillions of em of all sorts of colourswhite yellow green red purplebut i dont remember seein any that were really black is there a mountain on the island i asked wellno not exactly what youd call a mountain i think but there are plenty of fairly high hills answered billy and how big do you suppose the island to be i asked how big repeated billy oh really i dont know quite a big place id say it stretches athwart our bows as far as you can see both ways the dickens it does i exclaimed that is very extraordinary i cannot understand it at that rate the island must be at least thirty miles long yet there is no such island shown on the chart no island of any sort indeed large or small just where we are yet i have been under the impression that these seas have been thoroughly surveyed the main fact however and the one most important to us is that we are here with very little prospect i fear of getting away again for some time i must turn out and begin to get busy there is evidently no time to waste billy please find me my clothes billy regarded me gravely then shook his head thats all very well mr blackburn he said but whats the good of talkin about turnin out when you havent even got strength enough to lift yourself up in bed no sir please dont attempt to do anything so foolish youd only fall and hurt yourself worse what youve got to do is to get well as quick as ever you can and the best way to do that is to stay where you are until youve got your strength again and ill help you all i can ill feed you up and look after you and tell you everything that happens but pleaseplease dont be in too great a hurry this is a case of the more hurry the less speed im sure of it only trust yourself to me mr blackburn and ill get you well as quick as ever i can by jove billy said i i believe you will you have done marvellously well thus far why boy you must have been born to become a great physician and you talk more wisely than many lads of twice your age yes i will trust myself absolutely to you but now that i come to look at you your eyes are so heavy with sleeplessness that you seem scarcely able to keep them open how have you managed for sleep while i have been ill oh answered billy ive done pretty well when youve been quiet for a bit ive stretched myself out on the sofa and slept until you woke me with your ravin but now that youve come to your senses i expect i shall be able to get a really good rest i hope you will said i and theres no time like the present so as i am feeling very comfortable just now and much inclined to sleep go and turn in and get that really good rest that you spoke of leave open the door of my stateroom and that of your own and if i need anything ill call out for you thanks to the tireless attention with which billy tended me and the meticulous care with which he followed the instructions set forth in the book of directions attached to the ships medicinechest for such a case as mine i was not again troubled with delirium nor did i experience any other setback of any kind on the contrary i made such excellent progress that within the fortnight i was able to be up and about again although it was something of a task to climb the companion stairway to the deck even with the help of billy but that task once achieved i made rapid headway and was soon my old self again upon my first visit to the deck after my illness i sustained something of a shock my last view of the brigantine had shown her all ataunto and although what billy had told me ought to have prepared me for the change that met my gaze i must confess that i was distinctly taken aback when upon my first emergence from the companion i beheld both masts gone by the board all the bulwarks swept away and the deck hampered by a confused mass of raffle consisting of the mainmast with all attached stretched fore and aft while the foremast had gone over the bows its head resting upon the coral while its splintered lower extremity projected some ten feet above the knightheads the fore topmast had carried away close to the cap and with the yards was afloat under the bows fast to the wreck by the standing and running rigging the life boat that had served me so well had practically disappeared only the keel and a fragment of the sternpost remaining but by a miracle the galley remained intact and was in regular use by billy for the preparation of our meals almost my first care was to sound the well in the hope that by some stroke of marvellous good fortune the hull might have so far escaped serious damage and be capable of being floated again but of course that was too much to expect i found nearly two and a half feet of water in the well which was about the depth alongside the inference therefore was that upon striking the reef the ship had been bilged or some of her planks had been started and that therefore if it depended upon my efforts alone she would never float again i next turned my attention to externals helped by billy i tottered to the skylight and seated myself upon the cover from which i obtained a clear view of the whole reef from horizon to horizon it appeared to be a typical example of a coral barrier reef running roughly parallel to the shore of the island from north to south but it seemed to vary greatly in width for while in some places i judged it to be not more than five or six yards wide it was nearly or quite three hundred yards wide where the brigantine lay and most fortunate was it for us that it was so for if after striking the ship had been driven over the inner edge of the reef to the comparatively deep water of the lagoon she would assuredly have gone down taking us with her as it was there was a space of only about a fathom between our forefoot and the inner edge of the reef as i ascertained later the great wall of surf fifty feet high breaking perpetually upon the outer face of the reef and stretching mile after mile to north and south of us was a wonderful sight especially in the early morning when the suns rays struck the great cloud of spray creating a most beautiful and perfect rainbow that same wall of spray by the way effectually excluded all view of the ocean outside so that even if a whole navy happened to be passing we should never catch the smallest glimpse of it so long as we remained aboard the wreck it was evident therefore that the first step toward an escape from our present predicament must be the transfer of ourselves and everything of value to the island by a natural transition of thought i next turned my attention to the land which stretched north and south athwart the bows of the wreck a great belt of smooth water averaging some two miles in width lay between the reef and the beach of dazzling white sand both extending to right and left as far as the eye could see to the south the land seemed to dip out of sight below the horizon but northward it appeared to terminate in a high headland which i estimated to be about eighteen miles distant i considered therefore that the island must measure from north to south at least forty miles what it might measure from east to west was not to be easily determined but the summits of the most distant range of hills appeared to be nearly or quite twenty miles distant and how much land lay beyond them it was of course impossible to guess the description of the island which billy had given me several days earlier was quite a good one there was the far stretching ribbon of white beach bordered on its inshore margin by innumerable cocoanut palms beyond which the land rose gently in irregular folds to the hills in the rear every inch of soil apparently being clothed with vegetation of some sort chiefly trees many of which seemedas seen through the ships telescopeto be smothered in blossoms of varied and most beautiful hues i subjected every foot of the land in sight to a most rigorous scrutiny through the lenses of the telescope in search of some indication of inhabitants but could find nothing no cleared and cultivated land no smoke suggestive of dwellings no canoes on the beach no moving figures to all appearances indeed the gulls pelicans and other aquatic birds that wheeled and screamed over the lagoon and dived into its waters might be the only life on the island well mr blackburn what do you think of it demanded billy when at length i lowered the telescope from my eye it is wonderful i declared i am amazed i simply cannot understand it that island is quite a big place there is nothing in the least like it shown on the chart anywhere near the spot which it actually occupies yet how it has so far escaped the notice of the hydrographers is a puzzle to me the matter however which most concerns us is that viewed from here at least it appears to be a sufficiently desirable place on which we ought without difficulty to find ample means of subsistence how does the idea of living ashore there for a time appeal to you oh i say exclaimed billy that will be splendid just think of the jolly times we shall be able to have huntin wild beasts fightin the savages and havin all sorts of splendid adventures well i said some of those things may possibly come our way but we really want no excitements of that sort billy boy of course we are all right where we are so long as the wreck holds together and remains habitable but the trouble is that we dont know how long that may be another such gale as placed us here might send such a tremendous sea pouring in over the reef as to wash the old hooker off the reef into the lagoon where she would quickly founderwhich is the reason why i consider that we must establish ourselves ashore as soon as possible oh exclaimed billy i never thought of that do you really think mr blackburn that theres a chance of the wreck sinking it is quite possible i replied although i have known cases where stranded wrecks have remained for years undisturbed still the possibility must be recognised and provided against wherefore it is of the utmost importance that we lose no time in getting ourselves safely settled ashore then what do you propose to do sir demanded billy the moment that i am strong enough to do any work said i i shall start to build some sort of a craft in which we can ferry ourselves across the lagoon and explore the island in search of a suitable spot upon which to pitch our camp after that everything will depend upon the conditions on which we find it possible to live but one condition is of paramount importance we must establish ourselves where a clear view of the open sea can be obtained and from which it will be possible to signal to any ship that may heave in sight and now billy do you happen to know whether there is any timber aboard out of which it would be possible for me to build a boat without the preliminary necessity to start breaking up the yorkshire lass whyyesii believethere is answered billy hesitatingly i cant say for certain but i seem to remember hearin dad say something about buyin some planks as a standby in case of repairs of any sort bein needed and i believe i saw some planks and scantlin down in the fore hold a bit later while the ship was still in dock if the timbers aboard anywhere thats where youll find it mr blackburn thanks billy said i as soon as i am strong enough to lift a hatch we will explore the fore hold and see what is to be found there nearly a fortnight elapsed before i was strong enough to open the fore hatchway even with billys help but when at length we managed it we were amply rewarded for our labour an abundant supply of planks and scantling for our utmost need being found i took careful stock of it all recording the nature and dimensions of each piece of scantling and plank and then providing myself with paper pencil and scale i set to work to scheme out a craft that should be easy to build fast stiff and weatherly under canvas a fairly good seaboat and of light draught it was a decidedly ambitious scheme for an individual who up to then had attempted nothing bigger than a threefoot model but even that experience was i soon found of great value to me and ultimately i evolved a design that i believed would approach within a reasonable distance of my requirements this done i routed out the carpenters chest of tools from the forecastle cleaned and sharpened them got up on deck such timber as i immediately required and started work with billy as an enthusiastic helpmate chapter eight we go exploring and meet with an adventure it cost billy and me nearly three months of strenuous labour to build our boat rig her and get her afloat then upon a certain day the boy and i provided with a rifle apiece a brace of revolvers and an abundant supply of cartridges for each kind of weapon climbed down the side of the wreck into our completed craft set her sails and pushed off upon our first voyage of exploration the wind was as usual blowing a moderate breeze from the eastward when we started consequently the island lay dead to windward a beat of two miles to the nearest point of the beach thus affording an excellent opportunity to test the weatherly qualities of the boat and i was agreeably surprised not only at the style in which she turned to windward but also at the speed with which she slipped through the water and the certainty and celerity with which she stayed she made the distance in a few minutes over the halfhour which considering that as we drew in under the land the wind grew ever more scanty i regarded as a very creditable performance as we shortened the distance between ourselves and the land the prospect grew ever more attractive eliciting frequent exclamations of delight from billy the ground now revealed itself as finely broken into a range of lofty hills of gracefully flowing outline with suggestions of picturesque valleys winding between them affording an infinite variety of glowing light and soft shadow while the variegated and brilliant hues of the foliage completed a picture of indescribable beauty but all this beauty by no means exhausted the charm of the place for as we drew still closer to the beach we were able to distinguish that the woods were the habitat of countless thousands of birds of strange and most gorgeous plumage among which i identified what i believed to be three or four species of birds of paradise as well as a great variety of sun birds flitting from flower to flower like living gems it is to be admitted that the cries of those birds were not always in accord with the splendour of their plumage being for the most part distinctly harsh and unmusical but there was one exception that startled us not a little when we first heard it its cry was an exact reproduction of the sound of a sweettoned bell so exact indeed that for the moment i felt fully persuaded that hidden somewhere in the heart of that vast ocean of greenery there must be a monastery or some such institution and it was not until we marked the irregular intermittent character of the sounds and the fact that they emanated from frequently changing localities that we at length arrived at an explanation of the apparent mystery while we were still discussing the matter the boat gently grounded upon the dazzlingly white beach of coral sand and we stepped out securing the boat by means of a grapnel attached to the end of a long painter digging the flukes of the former deeply into the sand then billy and i each carrying the weapons with which we had provided ourselves set out to explore the new territory the beach was of varying width ranging from two or three yards to in places nothing at all indeed many of the cocoanut trees were actually rooted in soil that was at the moment being laved by the salt water due to the fact that we happened to land about the time of full tide it happened also that the fruit was at that season just ripening so many of the nuts falling to the ground with a thud even as we stood staring about us that we were able without difficulty to collect and place in the boat as many as we pleased this done we attempted to make our way inland but so dense was the undergrowth at that point that we were soon compelled to abandon our efforts it being clearly evident that the only way in which we could penetrate would be by hewing a path for ourselves but it did not follow that because we failed here we must necessarily fail everywhere we therefore reembarked and again getting under way headed northward keeping close to the beach and maintaining a good lookout for a spot affording a reasonable prospect of successful penetration several times we believed we had found what we were seeking but on each occasion our hopes were speedily dashed our most successful effort resulting merely in penetration for a distance of less than half a mile but even so our attempts were not unmitigated failures for while our clothing suffered somewhat in our encounters with the thorns that persistently barred our passage we were fortunate enough to secure a few bunches of delicious wild grapes a large bunch of very delicately flavoured bananas and six splendid pineapples upon our return to the beach i took the precaution to mark the spot by cutting a good big branch and inserting it upright in the sand so that it could easily be seen at some distance and then we resumed our voyage of exploration lunching luxuriously upon bananas meanwhile at length after working northward for a distance of some fourteen miles along the western shore we quite suddenly opened out the mouth of what i at first supposed to be an important river running in a southeasterly direction toward the interior of the island but which subsequently proved to be one of several channels dividing what i originally imagined to be only one island into a group of no less than seven naturally i at once decided to abandon for the moment the further exploration of the lagoon in favour of a survey of this waterway and the boat was accordingly put about and headed into it at its entrance it measured about half a mile wide but as we proceeded it gradually widened out until at a point about eight miles inward from the lagoon it was quite two and a half miles wide here the channel trended a point or two farther to the eastward and some four miles farther on it forked one branch continuing to the southeastward while the other trended away toward the northeast i decided to follow the latter the land on both sides was still distinctly hilly and densely covered with forest but on our left the hills sloped rapidly downward until they died away in a plateau the level of which was only two or three feet above the surface of the water as the boat glided slowly onward under the influence of a breeze that had steadily grown more languid and fitful as we progressed we subjected this plateau to a rigorous scrutiny through the ships telescope which we carried with us but the place looked so uninviting that we decided against landing there nor did the land to the southward look any more inviting for it consisted of cliffs ranging from two hundred to five or six hundred feet high rising almost vertically from the water we therefore pushed on all the more impelled thereto because the channel now ran almost directly to windward and we were therefore obliged to beat up through it moreover the afternoon was progressing and i wanted if possible to find some spot where we could pass the night in comfort at a point some eight miles farther on the channel again forked one branch heading away to the northeast while the other trended off in a southeasterly direction as we reached this point the wind suddenly freshened and there was a salt tang in it quite distinctive from the odour of earth and vegetation that we had now been breathing for several hours also there came to our ears subdued by distance the low continuous booming thunder of surf from which i surmisedcorrectly as it subsequently provedthat we were nearing the eastern extremity of the group heading the boat into the southeastern channel with the long range of vertical rocky cliffs still stretching away on our starboard bow we presently came abreast of an island measuring some six miles from east to west by about seven miles from north to south roughly triangular in plan the surface sloping upward on all sides from the waters edge to a peak which i estimated to be about two thousand feet high standing close inshore to get as near a view as possible of this island we found its appearance most delectable like much of what we had already seen the entire island was forestclad but the country was much more parklike in character the trees grew less thickly together they were not matted together by an impenetrable jungle of undergrowth although many of them were almost smothered in what appeared to be innumerable varieties of orchids and the soil was clothed with what looked like short greygreen grass down to the inner edge of the narrow beach which was lined with cocoanut palms taken altogether the place wore so exceedingly attractive an appearance that finding ourselves rather unexpectedly standing into a nice snug little bay i headed straightway for the beach determined to push our explorations no farther for that day securely mooring the boat as before we landed and fully armed made our way inland over the southern shoulder of the hill observing as we went that among the forest giants that towered about us on every hand there were fruittrees in abundance among which i identified the bread fruit the mango the custardapple the shaddock or grapefruit grape vines twining about many of the bigger trees and yielding large clusters of richly flavoured fruit while bananas and plantains were to be seen wherever one turned ones eyes birds also seemed to regard this island as a desirable dwellingplace for they were everywhere their beautiful plumage adding a further charm to the little island paradise from the beach to the ridge of the hill for which we were making the distance was about a mile the ground rising gently all the way but the going was comparatively easy for by making slight detours here and there we were able to progress without the need to force our way through dense undergrowth a gentle saunter of about half an hours duration therefore took us to the point for which i was aiming arrived there we were afforded a clear view eastward when we discovered as i had suspected that we had practically reached the eastern extremity of the group immediately before us the ground sloped down to the eastern shore its distance being about a mile that shore was washed by the waters of the lagoon which was at this point some six or seven miles wide its outer margin being marked by a continuous wall of spray thrown up by the long lines of pacific swell that eternally hurled themselves upon the barrier reef and midway between that reef and the island on which we stood there was a smaller island which in all essentials appeared to be a replica of the one we were on for it too was park like in the arrangement of the trees that grew upon it while it also boasted a central peak rising to a height of some six or seven hundred feet this small island it was evident was the easternmost of the whole group and i at once determined to pay it a visit early on the morrow for if it should prove upon inspection to be as desirable as it looked it would certainly be the place on which we ought to take up our abode since from it we should best be able to signal any ship that might heave in sight and from which alsoif an opening in the reef happened to be anywhere handywe could slip out to sea in our boat and if need be intercept that ship south of us and on the opposite side of a channel about threequarters of a mile wide lay the curious island of the vertical cliffs already referred to from the viewpoint which we occupied we could see the entire length of this island which i estimated at about sixteen miles its eastern extremity being a low cliff some eight miles southeast of us i resolved that on the morrow after visiting the small island to the eastward of us which i already began to speak of as ours i would pay a visit to this other island which somehow seemed to have invested itself in my eyes with an air of mystery we spent that night encamped on the grass close to the beach occupying a tent formed of an old sail and three oars which i had brought along for the purpose and we slept soundly the night air on the eastern side of the group being as we discovered very much fresher and cooler than on the western side where the wreck lay we were astir by sunrise next morning treating ourselves to a swim in the bay after which we proceeded to prepare breakfast when we had finished the meal we struck the tent packed it away in the boat and started upon another days exploration our first call was at the small island forming the easternmost extremity of the group which i had practically determined upon as our place of abode during such time as fate might keep us prisoners on the group and we found it almost ideal for our purpose in the first place there was on its southwestern side a snug little cove just large enough to accommodate our boat and wherein she might ride safely in all weathers next discharging into this cove there was a brook of deliciously cool sweet water springing from the side of the cove affording us an ample supply for every purpose the island was rich in fruittrees of great variety and finally a rigorous examination of it failed to disclose the existence upon it of anything noxious or inimical to human life although like the other islands visited the place swarmed with birds to crown all and complete my satisfaction we found that there was a passage through the reef immediately to the eastward of the island through which in our boat we might reach the open sea we spent the entire morning on our island and partook of our midday meal there leaving it rather reluctantly to continue our survey of the group the island which i next intended to visit was the one with the vertical cliffs along which we had coasted on the previous day those rugged precipitous cliffs formed the northern coastline of the island but from certain observations which i had made from our own island i came to the conclusion that the southern side of the island would reveal very dissimilar characteristics and so it proved for when after a sail of some six miles in a southerly direction we rounded its southeastern extremity we discovered that its southern shore rose only a few feet above the level of the water being bounded as seemed usual in the group by a narrow beach of coral sand liberally fringed with cocoanut trees the ground sloping gently up from the beach for a distance ranging from two to four miles when it abruptly ended against the southern face of the cliffs to which i have so frequently referred but this was by no means its most surprising characteristic to us explorers for having thus far failed to discover any sign of inhabitants i had perhaps rather hastily jumped to the conclusion that the group was uninhabited whereas we now saw that the whole surface of this particular island from its southern shore right up to the base of its range of northern cliffs was under cultivation wide areas of indian corn were interspersed with spacious fields of sugarcane varied here and there by great orchards of what i assumed to be fruittrees of various kinds and what appeared to be garden plots devoted to the cultivation of vegetables occasionally we caught glimpses of the natives working either singly or in small groups in the fields orchards and gardens and from their gestures of amazement and from the manner in which they stood transfixed and staring when our boat swept within their range of vision i conjectured that it was the first time in their lives that they had ever beheld such a sight they were almost coalblack in colour and inspection of them through the telescope showed them to be absolutely naked wherefore i decided not to pay them a visit until some future occasion when billy should not be with me although apart from their state of nudity they impressed me as being perfectly harmless my resolve to abstain from landing there on that occasion was however broken down within the next halfhour and that too in a sufficiently remarkable and tragic manner we were skimming briskly along before the pleasant easterly breeze billy being at the helm while i sat in the bottom of the boat taking peeps through the telescope at interesting objects in the landscape that seemed to be gliding past us when suddenly we heard from some distance ahead of us a sound as of a horn being blown the sound being taken up and repeated at various points both ahead and astern of us what do you think is the meaning of that rumpus mr blackburn asked billy do you think theyre scared at the sight of us it looks a bit like it doesnt it for see sir theyve all started to run i directed the telescope toward the shore it was as billy had said everybody within sight was running and at remarkable speed too but whether or not it was the apparition of the boat that had startled them i could not tell for about half of them seemed to be hastening at breakneck speed toward a part of the beach about half a mile ahead where a group of some forty or fifty blacks had already gathered close to the waters edge and seemed to be engaged in feverish haste in collecting stones or lumps of coral other groups which i believed to be composed of women were running with equal speed toward the cliffs at the back of the island turning my telescope again upon the rapidly gathering natives on the beach i saw that it could not be the boat that was causing their excitement for a number of them having collected as many stones as could be conveniently held in the hollow of the left arm were now excitedly pointing and directing their companions attention to some object in the channel immediately before them turning the telescope in the direction toward which they were pointing i presently sighted three objects that i believed to be the heads of animals making rapid progress through the water toward that point on the beach where the still rapidly swelling crowd had collected and as i watched little jets of water began to spout up round the foremost of those heads the blacks were stoning it with the evident object of driving it off or at least of preventing its approach and remarkably good marksmen they appeared to be too for as i continued to watch i observed four or five direct hits evoking from the target a most appalling shrieking roar while its progress through the water perceptibly speeded up that the three swimming creatures had been recognised by the blacks as enemies possibly of long standingwas clear enough and here it appeared to me was an excellent opportunity for me to establish good relations between ourselves and the savages by taking a hand in the game that was evidently toward i accordingly laid down the telescope and as i reached for the rifles directed billy to luff and head the boat straight for the spot where the blacks were gathered as i rapidly threw open the breeches of the rifles to assure myself that the weapons were loaded the leading swimmer reached shallow water and rising to its feet revealed itself as a gigantic anthropoid ape probably a species of gorilla the creature towered a clear head and shoulders in stature above the natives it had a comparatively small head with a flat receding forehead very wide nostrils a long enormously muscular body immensely wide across its massive shoulders disproportionately short legs and huge arms so long that even when the brute stood upright its clenched fists reached to within a foot of the ground as it started to wade ashore its advance was momentarily checked by a terrific volley of stones hurled with amazing force and precision then emitting a series of those dreadful shrieking roars it dashed forward with outstretched arms seized the nearest native and without apparent effort literally tore the unfortunate mans head from his body it was evident that if i meant to intervene to any good purpose there was not a moment to lose the boat was now within a hundred yards of the spot where the battle between the ape and the natives was raging but i dared not risk a shot in that quarter for the great brute still roaring horribly was completely hemmed in by a crowd of natives all battering the huge hairy body with big lumps of coral and the movements of the combatants were so quick that i was more likely to hit a black than the beast but the second ape was now in shallow water and on the point of rising to its feet i therefore levelled the rifle i held and pressed the trigger as the two sights of the weapon came into line with the centre of the head just above the ear a harrowing shriek pealed out on the hot air and as the little puff of smoke from the rifle blew away i had the satisfaction of seeing the creature throw up its great hands and sink back into the water dead dropping the empty weapon i snatched up the loaded one and threw a quick glance around to decide which should be my next mark the third ape was now less than twenty yards distant and as my gaze fell upon him i saw him change his course and head for the boat this afforded me the opportunity i wanted and levelling my weapon i aimed for the centre of the forehead and fired i distinctly heard the thud of the bullet as it crashed into the massive skull but there was no shriek this time the beast simply collapsed and sank meanwhile the aspect of affairs ashore had undergone a remarkable change whether it was the sharp crack of the rifles and the coincident deaths of the two apes or the fact that the brute which had effected a landing had already put some seven or eight of the natives hors de combat i could not guess but the natives had apparently with one accord and as though at a preconcerted signal suddenly abandoned the fight and were now fleeing in all directions while the ape perhaps taken by surprise at the quickchange tactics or possibly dazed by the severe blows that he had received stood staring about him as though undecided what to do next but only for a moment for just then the boat with good way on grounded and slid well up on the beach while i rose to my feet and leaping lightly over the bows advanced toward the brute glancing quickly about him the enormous beast instantly noted my movement and with a deep savage roar turned to meet me his little eyes blazing with fury his lips drawn back in a snarl that exposed his formidable teeth and a pair of great tusks protruding from his lower jaw with bloodstained foam dripping from his champing jaws and blood from numerous wounds streaking his great hairy hide he presented a most formidable spectacle as he approached me with his body bent and crouching ready to spring and his long sinewy arms outstretched the great hands opening and closing as though eager to clutch my throat we were now within half a dozen yards of each other and as though by mutual consent we each halted at the same instant glaring into each others eyes i saw the beast crouch still lower and noted the ripple of the muscles of the great loins as he gathered himself together for the spring that was to settle the dispute offhand and quickly levelling the revolver which i had drawn from my belt as i sprang ashore i pointed the weapon straight for his head and pulled the trigger there was a sharp click as the hammer fell but no explosion the cartridge had missed fireand at that precise moment the brute made his leap as he came hurtling at me through the air iby instinct i suppose for there was no time for reasoningagain pointed the revolver this time straight at his wideopen mouth and again pressed the trigger on this occasion the explosion came off all right then while the report still rang in my ears the huge body of the ape with a curious writhing motion crashed down upon me and dashed me violently to the ground we fell side by side i upon my back and the ape face downward a convulsive shudder shook the body for a moment and then it lay still as for me i remained where i had fallen breathless dazed and half stunned until i was aroused by billy who springing ashore rushed up to ask anxiously whether i was very much hurt fortunately i was not i was scarcely even bruised by my fall and i scrambled to my feet not a penny the worse for my rather grim encounter i lingered on the beach for nearly half an hour in the expectation that some of the natives might possibly return and thus afford me an opportunity to establish something in the nature of amicable relations with them but none of them did eventually therefore i got the boat afloat again and made sail on our way back to the wreck abandoning for the moment all idea of further exploration chapter nine we settle down on eden we found the wreck as of course we had quite expected in precisely the same condition as we had left her as i stowed the boats sails and made her securely fast to the wreck it was my fixed intention to continue our exploration on the following day but as i sat on deck that night smoking a final pipe before turning in my plans underwent a certain amount of modification i had quite come to the conclusion that the tiny islet that formed the easternmost extremity of the group was the spot on which we ought to take up our abode in view of our hope of eventual rescue and while considering the matter it also occurred to me that since it was impossible to forecast the duration of our detention upon the groupit might run to months for aught that i could tella reasonably comfortable dwelling of some sortsomething less susceptible to the vicissitudes of weather than a mere tent for instancewas an absolute necessity i therefore spent the ensuing four days in planning such a house as billy and i might between us be able to construct and by the end of that time i had got it satisfactorily planned out on paper i determined to build it entirely of wood first because the wreck afforded us abundance of material and next because i could do all the cuttingout the sawing planing mortising and fitting aboard the ship where such tools and conveniences as we possessed were at immediate command and where i could work from early morn to dewy eve without fear of interruption of any kind then when all my timbers were cut shaped and fitted it would be a comparatively simple matter to transfer them to the islet by means of the boat and there erect them and fit them together from such observations as i had already been able to make i had come to the conclusion that the barrier reef upon which the yorkshire lass lay stranded would probably be found to encircle the group completelywith perhaps a breach or two in it somewhere and as the determination of this point seemed to me a matter of some importance i decided that our next exploration should be conducted with that object accordingly upon the morning of the fifth day after our first expedition we again left the wreck the boat being well stocked with everything we could think of as likely to be required during a weeks cruise as before we started by steering a northerly course and in due time arrived off the entrance of the channel which we had explored on our first trip and which had proved to lead to the centre of the group but on this occasion instead of entering the channel as before i continued to push northward the barrier reef still holding intact on our port hand while to starboard lay what proved to be the most northerly island of the group as we coasted along its northwesterly shore we were able to see that while the southern portion of it was low and flat a range of hills occupied its eastern side while another less lofty and less extensive range marked its northwestern extremity but the land looked savage unattractive uninviting we therefore made no attempt to land contenting ourselves with the maintenance of a strict and continuous scrutiny of the country through the telescope uninviting however as was the aspect of the island it became markedly more so when we were presently favoured with a glimpse of some of its inhabitants of which thus far we had seen nothing we had just rounded the headland that was the most northerly point of the group visible from the deck of the yorkshire lass and had hauled up close to the wind to fetch another point some four miles distant to the northeastward when scrutinising the shore through the telescope i saw two creatures suddenly burst through the dense scrub that seemed to be the only form of vegetation growing thereabout and beginor possibly it might have been continuewhat had all the appearance of a desperate fight on the open beach we were at that moment not more than a quarter of a mile from the shore and but little farther than that from the spot where the fight was taking place the creatures were therefore within plain view of us while the telescope clearly revealed every detail of what was happening and of the creatures themselves but so incredibly agile were they in their movements that several minutes elapsed before i was able to do more than just form a rough estimate of their size but presently the boat drew up fairly abreast of them and then i directed billy who was steering to haul the foresheet to windward to deaden the boats way for i was curious to see what would be the outcome of the struggle the combatants were well matched as to size and activity there appearing to be not a pin to choose between them in those respects i set them down to be about the same size as an ordinary donkey but they did not in the least resemble donkeys as to shape indeed at first sight they seemed to be more like gigantic frogs that however was merely a first impression for there presently occurred a momentary pause in the fightpresumably to enable them to get their second windand then i was enabled to note details accurately their hind legs were proportionately as long as those of frogs but much more muscular while their fore legs appeared to be not more than a foot long all four extremities being armed with exceedingly stout and formidable claws unlike frogs however they boasted powerful tails that seemed to serve very much the same purpose as that of the kangaroo both as a weapon and a propellant at the base it was the same thickness as the body tapering away to a point and it appeared to be about the same length as the body the head was however the most remarkable feature of the animal when seen in profile it was not unlike those of the apes we had encountered but it was evidently even more formidable for projecting from its nose was a stout sharp horn similar to that of a rhinoceros while a pair of long tusks projected from its upper jaw in colour the animal was a greyish brown dark on the upper part of the body fading to a dirty white on the lower a serrated ridge of what might be loose skin ran along its back from the nape of the neck to the extremity of the tail and the body appeared to be thickly dotted with wartlike excrescences altogether it had very much more the appearance of a reptile than of any other class of the animal kingdom these details i was able to observe during the short pause in the fight to which i have already alluded but in less than a minute the struggle was resumed with apparently greater ferocity than ever their method of fighting was as remarkable as their general appearance facing his opponent and crouching low at a distance of some three or four yards apart one of them would suddenly spring high in the air and land upon the body of his adversary striking furiously with claws tusks and tail while the other throwing himself on his back would lash out as vigorously with his own weapons then the two would grip rolling over and over each other and for a few minutes it would be impossible to see what was happening so quick were their movements and dense the cloud of dust that they raised then would occur a brief pause to be followed by a further renewal of the fight but after about a quarter of an hour it became evident that the struggle was nearly over the end came with dramatic suddenness the one which happened to be lying upon his back made a lucky upward stroke with his hind claws disembowelling his antagonist as the latter descended upon him and a moment later he was tearing great morsels of flesh from the still writhing body of his late adversary let draw the foresheet billy i exclaimed well get away from here as quickly as the wind will take us for the sight was a horrible and disgusting one an hour later we arrived off a gap about a mile wide between two headlands this gap forming the entrance of a noble bay some eight miles long by five miles wide at its widest part and curiously enough immediately opposite that gap there occurred a corresponding gap or break about two miles wide in the barrier reef so that had the place been known to mariners a ship in distress might have passed through this break in the reef and sailed straight into the bay even in the hardest gale that ever blew naturally i at once headed the boat into the bay and we sailed to its farther extremity hugging the western shore all the way and still maintaining a close watch upon the country generally through the telescope it was very rugged and broken until we reached the bottom of the bay where the hills from a height of some eight hundred feet sank into the plain the hillsides inside as outside the bay nourished a fairly dense growth of low coarse scrub that i searched with the glass in vain for any sign of life but i noticed very early after our passage between the two headlands that for some reason which i was quite unable to guess at the waters of the bay were swarming with sharksthe first that we had seen since the occurrence of the wreck wherefore i at once christened the great sheet of water shark bay while to the island itself i gave the name of north island the headlands that guarded the entrance to shark bay were a pair of lofty promontories rising to a height of some four or five hundred feet forming part of the range of hills that engirdled the bay on either hand but while the range on the western side sloped down to the waters edge sinking into a plain at a distance of about ten miles from the entrance the range on the eastern side some sixteen miles long gradually receded from the shore line as it swept southwards the space between its foot and the beach being occupied by a swamp lying so low that it was difficult to judge in places the precise line of demarcation between land and water the southern half of the island consisted entirely of low flat ground sparsely covered with coarse grass and isolated clumps of scrub across which at a distance of some eight miles the high precipitous cliffs of the island where we encountered the apes could be distinctly seen by the time that we arrived at the inner or southern extremity of the bay the sun had declined to within a fingers width of the ridge of the western range of hills it was clear therefore that there could be no further exploration for us until the morrow and i began to look about in search of a suitable spot whereon to pitch our camp for the night and to choose seemed difficult the western shore of the bay with its broken ground and scrubby vegetation looked uninviting to say the least of it in addition to which it was on the other side of those same hills at a spot only a few miles distant that we had that afternoon witnessed the terrific fight between those two horrible unknown creatures and i had no inclination to place ourselves where we might perchance make closer acquaintance with other creatures of a similar or perhaps even more ferocious kind the eastern shore of the bay was a swamp and consequently out of the question i therefore turned my attention to the plain that formed the southern part of the island when looking in that direction i saw an animal of some sort squatting on its hindquarters on the beach staring at us it was only about a quarter of a mile distant and bringing the telescope to bear upon it i at once identified it as either the victorious fighter of the afternoon or a creature similar in every respect it was hardly likely to be the same beast however for i thought it doubtful whether the long arm of coincidence would bring the same creature within our ken again so soon moreover the animal at that moment focused by the lenses of the telescope showed no wounds or other signs of recent battle ill have a shot at the beggar if he will only remain as he is half a minute longer i exclaimed take the telescope billy and watch ill aim for his heart and you will be able to see whether or not i score a hit and thrusting the telescope into billys hands i snatched up a rifle four hundred and fifty yards should be about right i muttered as i adjusted the back sight of the weapon to that range then raising the rifle to my shoulder and bringing the sights into line on that part of the still motionless beasts body where i supposed its heart to be i pressed the trigger the plop of the bullet upon the creatures hide distinctly reached my ear a second or two after the crack of the rifle but instead of toppling over dead as i fully expected the beast simply wheeled about and in a sequence of enormous bounds quickly vanished in the distance by jove i exclaimed in amazement what an extraordinary thing ill swear i hit him i had him as neatly covered as possible my hands were as steady as rocks and there is not enough wind to deflect the bullet furthermore i heard it strike yes so did i agreed billy i am certain that you hit the brute mr blackburn i cant say for certain that i actually saw the bullet hit but i believe that a second or two after you fired and an instant before the beast turned and bounded away i saw a tiny dark spot on the dirty white skin of its breast i wonder whether you really did or whether it was merely imagination said i anyway the beggar must be a tough one to kill for while i feel as certain as you do that i hit him the fact remains that he was very far from being dead when we last saw him furthermore that yonder plain harbours such creatures is a strong argument against our camping there tonight the only thing therefore that i can see for it is to stand offshore for a mile or two anchor the boat and rough it aboard her for the night which we did and ample reason had we to congratulate ourselves upon our decision for shortly after nightfall and all through the hours of darkness our ears were assailed by an almost continuous succession of such hairraising shrieks and howls roars and bellowings as thoroughly convinced me that north island was no sort of dwellingplace for human beings with a penchant for peace and quietness furthermore there was a moon that night well advanced in her second quarter and at frequent intervals during a particularly restless night i caught glimpses of shadowy forms moving restlessly hither and thither ashore with the arrival of dawn next morning we were astir and after an early breakfast the anchor was hove up and we got under way to resume our voyage of exploration on the previous afternoon we pretty closely skirted the western shore of the bay now on our way out we as closely hugged the eastern shore which i kept under continuous scrutiny with the help of the telescope but nothing worthy of record was seen and that days voyage might be dismissed with the mere mention of it but for the fact that when we were about halfway down the bay we reached a spot where the water and the swamp were so intermingled that we actually ran right into a vast bed of rushes without grounding there was perhaps nothing very remarkable about that but there was a peculiarity about those rushes that billy was the first to observe and remark upon namely their absolutely perfect straightness this inspired me with an idea our stock of ammunition was limited and when it should become exhausted what were we to do so long as we remained upon the group we must have weapons of some sort and the only substitute for the rifle and revolver that i could think of was the bow and arrow i cut one of the rushes and found it to consist of an exceedingly hard outer casing filled with soft pith it was remarkably light and it instantly occurred to me that the smaller thinner rushesthey ranged from about an eighth of an inch up to quite two inches in diameterwould make ideal arrows we therefore set to work there and then and cut about two hundred reeds of suitable diameter each of them being long enough to make at least two arrows when toward sunset that evening we again reached the little islet that i had resolved to make our homeand which i named eden because it was so like a gardenthe first thing we did was to spread our reeds out on the grass to dry next we rigged the tent for we intended to spend the night on the islandand then billy and i took a walk up as far as the shoulder of the hill from which was to be obtained a view of the sea upon the offchance of there being a sail of some sort in sight but as i more than half expected the ocean was bare we met with no adventures unpleasant or otherwise that night but enjoyed several hours of sound dreamless sleep and awoke refreshed the next morning to pursue our voyage of exploration nor did we meet with any adventures worth recording on the third day of our voyage we sailed past the eastern end of the island inhabited by the natives leaving it about two miles on our starboard hand as we steered south then we sailed past another and much bigger island which i estimated to measure some sixteen miles long by about fourteen miles wide it was in the form of a doubleconed hill sloping on all sides down to the waters edge the higher of the two cones being about nine hundred feet high and the other perhaps two hundred feet less it was thickly wooded from beach to summit and i had no doubt that many of the trees we saw bore edible fruits but we did not land to test the matter rather late in the afternoon we arrived abreast another and much smaller island that proved to be the southernmost of the group this we named south island and about sunset we ran into a tiny bay close to its western extremity and anchoring the boat passed the night in her this time without disturbance of any kind continuing our circumnavigation of the group we reached the wreck again about an hour before sunset on the fourth day of our travels keeping within the lagoon all the time and thus confirming my theory that the reef completely encircled the whole group i estimated that in the course of those four days we sailed a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles but it was well worth it for i now had considerable knowledge of the general characteristics of the entire group to which i could add when i set out to traverse the intersecting channels the matter about which i was now most anxious was the erection of our projected house on our little islet of eden and to the cutting and shaping of the timber that was to be employed in its construction billy and i at once devoted ourselves energetically making remorseless inroads upon the wreck for the required materials but maintaining the cabins and after part of the ship intact that we might not deprive ourselves of the one dwellingplace until the other was ready to receive us and i was all the more anxious to get this important piece of work completed without loss of time because i had a suspicion that in those latitudes there is what is known as a hurricane season during which extremely violent gales are prevalent and i knew that the very first of thesewhen it camemight destroy the wreck and so turn us out of house and home no sooner had we begun our work than i recognised the wisdom that had prompted me to prepare a carefully drawn detailed plan of our future house beforehand for now i was able to determine by reference to my plan the exact dimensions and shape of every piece of timber required thus saving a vast amount of time and labour that must otherwise have been spent in consideration and in the tentative fitting together of the several pieces there is no need to tax the patience of the reader by describing in detail our daily progress let it suffice to say that we worked all day and every day from dawn to sunset until at length after five weeks of strenuous but uneventful labour punctuated at intervals by thunderstorms of terrific violence accompanied by torrential downpours of rainwhich we thankfully utilised for the replenishment of our freshwater supplythe carpenter work of our projected house was finished and then came the still more formidable task of erection we began by loading our boat with as much as she would carry of the building materials and the requisites for a few days stay upon the islet and then we left the wreck arriving at our destination rather late the same evening taking the short cut through those parts of the intersecting channels that we had already traversed upon the occasion of our discovery of the islet the choice of a site for the house and the unloading and conveyance of the tools and building materials to that site occupied the whole of another day for the site chosen was on the eastern slope of the hill about a mile distant from the cove where the boat lay involving the carrying of several heavy loads of timber all that distance uphill but it was well worth the labour for the situation afforded a magnificent and uninterrupted view of the open sea to the eastward while toward the west and southwest we had a view of a considerable portion of the island with the remarkable precipitous cliffs and a broad stretch of lagoon to the south of it spending the night of that very fatiguing day on eden we returned to the wreck on the day following a fair wind the whole way enabling us to accomplish the trip in time to load up the boat that same evening in readiness for an early start next day this mode of procedure was followed for nearly a month by the end of which period we had transported from the wreck to our islet the whole of the material for our house the chests of treasure the ships medicinechest all the tools of every description that were to be found in the ship all the arms and ammunition the chronometer and other navigating instruments the charts and a considerable quantity of the most valuable contents of the lazarette after which we were practically independent of the wreck for as soon as we had built our house we should be in possession of everything absolutely necessary to the maintenance of life and health the house however still remained to be built and this task kept billy and me busy for another six weeks but when it was finished we found ourselves relatively speaking in clover for our house consisted of a stronglybuilt weatherproof bungalow containing livingroom store room two bedrooms kitchen scullery fuel house and other outbuildings with a stoep and veranda extending all round it and it was roofed with deck planking caulked thoroughly well tarred and then coated with sand the furniture was of course a bit rough but it served its purpose and it was eked out by the addition of a couple of comfortable armchairs and six deckchairs from the wreck with of course beds and bedding table linen crockery cutlery and all the cooking gear this great task accomplished my next business was to run the boat singlehanded to and fro between the islet and the wreck removing from the latter everything that might by any chance be of the slightest value to us while billy having developed an ambition to lay out a considerable expanse of the slope in front of the house as a garden put in his time in the realisation of that ambition after a time i was able to lend a hand at this job and i finished up by setting on end in front of the house the brigantines spare main topmast which made a fine flagstaff upon which i proposed to hoist the ships ensign union down if ever a ship should heave in sight chapter ten a spiders web my next task was one which i felt i had already neglected too long namely the provision of weapons to supplement our firearms and so save our ammunition for cases of extreme emergency this i proposed to do by the manufacture of bows and arrows if i could find materials suitable for the purpose so far as the arrows were concerned i had already found perfect material for the shafts in the bundle of rushes i had cut in the shark bay swamp and which had by this time dried and hardened in the air until they had become all that i could wish for but i still required wood from which to make bows and i spent a whole day unsuccessfully searching the woods of eden for suitable trees but it did not follow that because there were no suitable trees on our own islet there were none on any of the other islands of the group therefore on a certain evening i announced my intention of starting next morning upon a further voyage of exploration and discovery in pursuance of this intention immediately after breakfast on the following morning i put two rifles in the boat with an ample supply of cartridges while we each carried a brace of revolvers in a belt strapped round our waists in addition to which i took along with me a ships cutlass to serve instead of an axe with which to cut any suitable boughs we might chance to find for prospecting purposes i chose the western island of the group not only because it was the largest and most densely wooded but also because i seemed to remember vaguely having seen when sailing past it on my way to and from the wreck certain trees resembling yews than which of course nothing could be better for my purpose we got under way with a fine fair wind and headed for east channel entering which we ran close in under the precipitous cliffs that formed the northern coastline of the island inhabited by the natives thence we passed into north island channel with the mysterious north island on our starboard hand and as the boat buzzed merrily along i kept the telescope focused upon the wide flat plain that formed the southerly half of the island upon the offchance of catching another glimpse of some of its weird inhabitants but we saw nothing then rounding the southern extremity of north island we entered the northwest channel and with west island close aboard on our port hand hauled up to the northward keeping a sharp lookout for the trees of which i was in search it was about noon when i spotted a clump of those trees growing all together at no great distance from the shore and we at once headed for them and grounded the boat upon the beach looking well to our weapons to ensure that they were in working order billy and i each shouldered a rifle and made our way toward the clump of trees the grass was waist high and very matted rendering the going rather difficult but the distance was a mere trifle and in about ten minutes we were at the trees i looked well at them and came to the conclusion that if they were not actually yews they were of very similar character sufficiently so at least to justify me in testing their quality i accordingly climbed into one of them and with some care selected about a dozen suitable branches which i hacked off with my cutlass and threw to the ground where billy retrieved them from the long grass this done we decided that the next thing in order was to pipe to lunch which meal we discussed in comfort and at leisure aboard the boat luncheon over we agreed that a little fruit would be acceptable and leaving the boat we set out to hunt for some the vegetation on this eastern side of the island was not nearly so dense and impenetrable as we had found it on the west side where we landed upon the occasion of our first boat excursion the undergrowth here being almost entirely absent consequently apart from the trouble of forcing a passage through the long matted grass we experienced little difficulty in penetrating the woods but where the timber grew thickly it was comparatively speaking very dark and the sudden transition from brilliant sunlight in the open spaces to the deep shadow of the thickly wooded parts was distinctly trying to our eyes we went warily halting at frequent intervals and listening for any sounds that might warn us of approaching dangerfor we were now upon the biggest island of the group and we knew not what dangerous forms of life might be lurking within the recesses of the forestwhen as we were looking about us for fruitbearing trees of some kind quite suddenly the woodland silence was broken by a rapid succession of piercing cries that somehow suggested to us the idea of a cat in a state of acute terror and physical distress hark what is that exclaimed billy laying his hand upon my arm it sounds as though there was a cat somewhere quite near in the grip of an enemy lets look for and rescue the poor thing if we can mr blackburn a cat is just the one thing needed to complete the homelike look of our bungalow the poor thing is over there somewhere and im sure it is in terrible distress we hurried in the direction indicated by billys pointing hand and a few seconds later saw at a distance of a yard or two ahead of us a commotion in the long grass as though some creature or creatures buried in it were engaged in a violent struggle the spot happened to be in deep shadow and the thought came to me that hidden in the thick masses of that tangled grass some small animal might be fighting for its life possibly in the embrace of a snake that as likely as not might be of a deadly venomous species therefore i put forth a restraining hand and said sharply to billy stay here and do not come until i call you i will go alone and see what all the trouble is about with a couple of strides i reached the scene of the commotion the cries meanwhile pealing out as piercingly as ever and as i stooped to investigate my cap came into contact with something that yielded slightly to the touch and was snatched off my head surprised and a little startled by the unexpectedness of the happening i straightened up to see my cap apparently suspended in mid air still more surprised i stretched forth my hand and seized the cap to replace it upon my head when i found that it strongly resisted my efforts and looking closely to discover the reason i saw that it had become entangled in a spiders web yes a spiders web but such a web as i venture to say very few men save myself have ever seen it hung suspended from a branch quite ten feet above the ground it was tightly strained between the trunks of two trees at least eight feet apart and it reached right down to the ground where it was strongly interwoven with the long grass but that web was not spun to catch flies the meshes were from two to four inches wide and although the thread was so fine as to be invisible in the subdued light until closely looked for it was enormously strong so strong indeed that it required quite a powerful tug on my part to disengage my cap my efforts to do so caused the web to vibrate strongly and that i suppose irritated the owner for while i was still tugging the brute suddenly appeared from nowhere in particular running swiftly over the web in the direction of the still entangled cap and that spider was in perfect keeping with the web that he had spun there are homestaying people who in their wonderful wisdom will doubtless shake their heads and smile incredulously at what i am about to say but possibly there may be among my more widely travelled readers one or two who will know from experience that i am not exaggerating when i say that the body of the creatureof a deep ruby colourwas as big as the head of an average sized man its head was about the size of an orange it had a pair of wickedlooking eyes that fairly blazed with fury as catching sight of me it suddenly halted glaring at me emitting a low angry hissing sound and clashing its formidable jaws together in what looked like an access of perfectly demoniac ferocity struck motionless for the moment in sheer amazement i quickly recovered myself and believing that the thing was about to spring at my face and inflict a possibly fatal bite i raised my cutlass and with a slashing blow clove the creature through leaving the severed parts of the body still clinging tenaciously to the web i next turned my attention to the screaming frantically struggling creature at my feet a single glance sufficed to show that it was obviously feline about as big as a fullgrown cat and it had somehow become entangled in the bottom meshes of the web it was fighting desperately but ineffectually to free itself indeed its struggles seemed to have but the more hopelessly involved it for although it had torn a hole several feet long in the bottom of the web it was still held fast by a dozen or more of the threads while its body was completely enveloped in layer upon layer of the tough tenaciously glutinous web the unfortunate animal was evidently near to the point of exhaustion from its violent efforts to break loose and when i bent over it the poor thing looked up at me and whined piteously as though appealing for help it was an appeal that i could by no means resist therefore taking the creature in my hands i tore it free by main force parting thread after thread until all were severed whether it was that the poor little beggar was too completely exhausted to struggle further or whether it instinctively understood that i meant well by it i cannot say but the fact remains that from the moment it felt itself in my grasp it ceased to struggle and when it was completely freed from the web lay quite passively in my arms i carried it to where billy still stood awaiting my return and showing it to him said here is your cat billy but you mustnt touch it yet for it is in a filthy state having been tangled up in the most amazing spiders web i ever saw of course the boy immediately fired a whole broadside of questions at me relative to my recent adventure also he must needs be taken to see the web and the defunct spider after which forgetting all about the fruit which we had started to seek we reentered the boat and set out upon our return to eden which we reached shortly before sunset as we worked our way back through the winding channels billy beguiled the time by taking our newest acquisition upon his lap and endeavouring to free it from the clinging tangle of web in which it had enveloped itself and so agreeable did the operation appear to be to the animal that it lay quite passive permitting itself to be handled freely and eventually to billys great delight it started to purr for my own part however reflection caused me to question whether i had been wise in introducing this new member to our family circle had it been a dog i should have had no doubts a dog would have been a delightful companion for both of us but this creaturewhat was it as i have already said it was about the size of a fullgrown cat and it undoubtedly belonged to the cat tribe but despite its size i judged it to be a mere kitten and quite a young one at that its legs were much thicker and more muscular and its fur was shorter and not so fine as that of the domestic cat and although i had seen a good many domestic cats i had never seen one marked like this creature a rich ruddy brown on the head shoulders and forequarters shading off to a light tawny colour at the hindquarters and the tail with just a suggestion of darker spots here and there white on the throat breast belly and the inside of the legs it occurred to me that if my suspicions were correct we might eventually find that we had introduced a decidedly awkward member into our domestic circle but meanwhile i kept my suspicions to myself billy displayed the utmost interest in his new pet apparently he was unable for the moment to think of anything else he was particularly anxious that the little beast should settle down in the house and become thoroughly domesticated and with that object in view he at once proceeded to liberally smear its fore paws with part of our slender remaining stock of butter having heard that cats so treated never deserted the house in which they had received such hospitality next he set to work to make a kennel out of odds and ends of material left over from the construction of our house as for me i considered that i was far more usefully employed in stripping the bark from the branches which i had gathered and converting them into bows our respective enterprises progressed as satisfactorily as could be desired billys protegewhich in a moment of inspiration he had given the highly original name of kitfed to repletion upon broth and fish was apparently quite content to bask in the sun all day on the floor of the veranda to be petted and played with by us when we could spare the time and to take up his quarters at night in billys kennel upon a luxurious bed of sweetscented hay while the bows upon which i expended some pains promised to be everything that i could desire billy and i made another voyage to the swamp in north island and collected reeds enough to make some hundreds of arrows which we headed with hard sharp thorns embedded in about three inches of clay at the head to impart steadiness of flight to the missile an arrangement which i found to answer admirably then when our bows were completed we set up a target in front of the house and practised assiduously until within a fortnight we became sufficiently expert to hit a sixinch bullseye at two hundred yards every time having attained to this degree of skill we could get as many birds as we needed for food without the further expenditure of any ammunition we accordingly hoarded the remainder of our powder and shot against the possible moment when we should be in dire need of it striving for perfection i made twelve bows before i was quite satisfied with the result of my efforts thus allowing one bow for each of us and a second as a standby i had eight bows for which i had no particular use they did not quite come up to my standard yet i did not care to destroy them after some consideration therefore i decided that they might be used as a medium for the establishment of friendly relations between ourselves and our neighbours the natives on cliff island accordingly on a certain day placing the superfluous bows and a number of arrows in the boat and taking our rifles and revolvers with us billy and i started to pay our visit heading south a run of five miles brought us in the course of an hour to the western extremity of cliff island rounding which we presently saw that the natives appeared to be all at work in their fields of maize and sugar or tending their fruittrees the sight of our sails gliding along within a short distance of the beach caused them to drop whatever work they might be engaged upon to watch our progress although the boat must by that time have become quite a familiar object to them so often had we passed the island on our way to and from the wreck arrived at the spot where we had encountered the apes i hauled the boat to the wind ran her in upon the beach and stepped ashore this was the first time that i had landed upon the island since that memorable occasion and consequently i was not surprised to observe that my action created something of a commotion among the inhabitants the alarm trumpets were sounded and there was again a stampede on the part of the women and children toward the curious caves in the cliffface while the men came running together and rallying round an individual who appeared to be their leader or chief meanwhile i walked slowly up the narrow beach to the level ground beyond and there stood with both hands upraised in token of amity the man whom i assumed to be the chief stood intently regarding me for several minutes as though endeavouring to gather from my actions what my motive for landing on the island might be whereupon i beckoned and then again raised my hands above my head by way of response the chief raised his hands for a moment and then proceeded to discussas i surmisedthe situation with certain others who were probably minor chiefs finally after i had several times repeated my beckonings about a dozen of them including the man whom i supposed to be the chief came slowly toward me with their hands raised their approach was marked by a very considerable amount of hesitation halts being frequent and progress resumed only in response to vigorous beckonings on my part so that fully twenty minutes were consumed in traversing the distance of some five hundred yards that originally separated us but at length the party arrived within about a dozen yards of me and there finally halted the moment had evidently arrived for me to declare my intentions i therefore drew from my pocket a necklace of big turquoiseblue beads that formed part of the truck provided by the late skipper stenson for purposes of trade and holding it aloft advanced with a friendly smile toward the chief who seemed more than half inclined to turn tail and run as i purposely moved very slowly and deliberately however he stood his ground and when i halted before him and placed the necklace round my own neck a low murmur of admiration escaped the party then removing the beads from my own neck i stepped slowly forward again and lightly dropped them round the neck of the chief who i thought seemed to find some difficulty in deciding whether he was the more frightened or delighted but i continued smiling upon him in friendly fashion and offered my right hand in token of amity a sign which he seemed to understand for after a moment of hesitation he placed his hand in mine and gave a friendly squeeze which i instantly returned i now turned toward the boat and saying come with me i have something to show you beckoned the party to follow me of course they did not understand my words but they must have correctly interpreted the tones of my voice for they followed me without hesitation halting at the top of the bank however to take a good look at the boat and exchange excited remarks concerning heras i easily conjectured from their animated gestures meanwhile advancing to the boat i took from billy a small wooden target that i had prepared together with a bow and sheaf of arrows the target i fixed up on the beach and stationing myself at about a hundred yards from it directed the attention of my little audience first to the bow then to an arrow which i drew from the quiver and finally to the target then fitting the arrow to the string i drew the bow to its full extent and the next moment the arrow was quivering in the bullseye to the amazement and audible admiration of my new friends this feat i performed a second and a third time and then led the party to the target that they might see for themselves how firmly were the arrows embedded in it and this evidently provoked in them further admiration for they at once plunged into an animated discussion of the matter some at least of them already appreciating the value of the bow as a lethal weapon for one of the party admirably mimicking the action of an ape coming up the beach then drew an imaginary bow and instantly clapping his hand over his heart fell back in an imitation of the deathagony i patted him approvingly on the shoulder nodded and said yes that is the idea old chap that is precisely what i want you fellows to understand and again they seemed to comprehend me for they all nodded vigorously then wrenching the arrows from the target i conducted the party back to the hundredyard mark and placing the bow and an arrow in the hands of the chief signed to him to try his hand of course he made a terrible bungle of it to start with first he failed to put enough strength into the pull and the arrow flew only a few yards by dint of patient coaching on my part however he gradually improved and when after practising diligently for about an hour he succeeded in sending an arrow as far as the targetalthough several yards widehis delight and pride knew no bounds i then showed him that it was possible to hit the target at double the distance after which i took him to the boat and presented to him the remaining seven bows with their sheaves of arrows which filled the simple fellows cup of joy to the brim he insisted on conducting billy and me through the plantations of maize and sugarcane directed our attention to the orchards of fruittrees and finally led us to the cliffs which i now saw were honeycombed with rockdwellings and introduced us to his own particular mansion which was a cave of some twelve feet wide by twenty feet deep very stuffy and malodorous here we were entertained to a luncheon of boiled green maize cobs and several varieties of delicious fruits his household consisted of an elderly woman whom i conjectured to be his mother two young men who i understood were his sons and five girls who might be either his wives or his daughters when at length we were able to effect our escape from his rather pressing hospitality and returned to the boat i found that during our absence somebodypresumably my recent hosthad sent down several baskets containing green heads of indian corn sugarcane and fruit which we took back with us to eden i for my part feeling well satisfied with the result of my visit chapter eleven a raid by the apes having thus successfully established friendly relations with the natives i determined to maintain them and with this object made frequent calls upon the chief who was most anxious to display the increasing skill of himself and his subordinates in the use of the bow and indeed the progress made was exceedingly creditable and quite sufficient to enable them to put up a good defence against the apes which i with some difficulty gathered were prone to swim across the channel from time to time for the purpose of plundering the natives fields and orchards but if i understood my new friends aright these raids though not perhaps very frequent were occasionally of a far more formidable and disastrous character than i had thus far imagined not infrequently resulting in a quite serious loss of life on the part of those natives who were courageous enough to defend their possessions i accordingly decided to make and present to the plucky blacks twelve more bows with a sufficient supply of arrows to enable them to resist successfully the incursions of their formidable enemies the work of procuring the materials necessary for the manufacture of those weapons and the making of them together with the performance of sundry odd jobs in the garden kept me busy for nearly a month during which i was afforded ample opportunity to note the progress which billy was making in the domestication of his cat the beast was growing fast and it was also developing certain markings which tended to confirm my original suspicion that it was some species of leopard or panther a circumstance that not only occasioned me considerable uneasiness but also led me to impart my fears to billy and even to hint tentatively at the advisability of shooting the creature before the full development of its natural proclivities should render it actually dangerous but billy indignantly scouted the suggestion that his pet could possibly develop dangerous tendencies directing my attention to the affection which it displayed for both of us and i was compelled to admit that so far his contention was sound for the beast followed us about like a dog it could scarcely endure to be separated from either of us for any great length of time and it seemed never so happy as when lying at full length on the floor of the veranda before my chair with my feet lightly resting upon its body as upon a footstool and upon the now comparatively rare occasions when we took a trip in the boat kit was invariably to be found on the beach waiting and watching for our return and it was amusing to observe the delighted gambols in which he indulged as we stepped ashore the new bows and arrows being at length ready billy and i started for cliff island on a certain morning for the purpose of presenting the weapons to their prospective owners upon our arrival we were received by the natives with their accustomed cordiality and i at once handed over our gift to bowata the chief who was profuse in his expressions of gratitude i had by this time acquired a sufficient grasp of their very simple language to enable me to make a pretty shrewd guess at their meaning when they spoke to me and also to make myself fairly well understood by them and i gathered from bowata that the gift was singularly opportune inasmuch as that the apes had of late for some inexplicable reason been unusually pertinacious in their raids upon the island but that thanks to my original gift their attacks had been successfully withstood without loss of life on the part of the natives the invading apes having all been slain before it was possible for them to effect a landing the little fellow was immensely proud of those achievementsas indeed he might well be considering that before the bowandarrow era every raid by the apes had resulted in the death of one or two natives and the more or less serious maiming of others and so proud was he of the skill which he and his people had developed that he must needs set up a target there and then that i might witness a display of that skill it now became apparent that bowata was by no means devoid of shrewdness for not only had he personally practised assiduously at the target but he had insisted that the petty chiefs who had been entrusted with bows should do the same and not content with that he had chosen some two dozen other men all of whom he had personally trained so that when i turned up with my gift he had already about thirty men every one of them a quite fairly expert bowman i could not forbear a smile at this intelligence imparted with the most perfect naivete for it almost appeared as though the man had divined my intention to make this second gift and now occurred a rather remarkable coincidence for while the display of native skill was in full swing the trumpets were sounded giving warning of another approaching raid the apes it appeared were heading for a point about half a mile to the westward of the spot where we were assembled and toward that spot the archers twenty in number including those who had been entrusted with the new bows set off at top speed followed by their unarmed comrades who merely delayed long enough to collect such blocks of coral and rock of suitable size as happened to be in their way as for me i announced my intention to attack the brutes from the boat if i should be in time to intercept them but bowata delayed his departure long enough to beg me to allow him and his men to deal unaided with the enemy as every victory gained by his people increased their confidence in themselves but he added if any of the apes should escape and attempt to swim back to their own island i should be rendering good service by destroying them on the way the sound common sense of both these contentions i instantly recognised keeping well offshore that we might be safely out of range of stray arrows billy and i arrived in the boat off the scene of the impending struggle while the leading ape was still a good three hundred yards from the beach and i was glad to see that the blacks were keeping cool and withholding their fire instead of wasting their arrows by discharging them prematurely the apes were swimming easily and keeping so well together that it was only with difficulty i was able to count them billy and i were agreed that they totalled sixteen which if i had understood bowata aright was far and away the most formidable number that had ever been encountered and i looked to our rifles and edged the boat in a little nearer the shore to be ready for possible eventualities then as the first arrow was discharged i brought the boat to the wind and hove her to that first shot was a miss but the second shot scored for i saw the leading ape shake his head angrily and go through the motion of plucking an arrow from his neck he swam a few yards farther however then he suddenly flung up his arms and rolled over in the water motionless i was glad to see that the natives had assimilated the advice i had endeavoured somewhat laboriously to impart to them to shoot singly at a selected mark thus economising arrows and promoting good shooting they were adopting those tactics now and the soundness of them was demonstrated by the fact that no less than five of the apes were put hors de combat before the feet of any of them touched bottom and they started to wade ashore then indeed as some halfdozen of the huge creatures upreared themselves simultaneously revealing the whole of their bodies above the hips the blacks betrayed signs of panic a whole flight of arrows greeting the brutes but if that indiscriminate discharge was indeed the result of panic it was nevertheless thoroughly effective for every one of the monsters went down either dead or too desperately wounded to be capable of further effort the fate of their comrades however seemed in no wise to dismay or act as a deterrent to the survivors who five in number pressed resolutely on and finding bottom rose in quick succession to their feet and proceeded to scramble ashore actually passing between the bodies of their dead and dying companions and noticing them only to thrust them roughly aside in their eagerness to get to grips with their enemies but the latter were quite ready for them the success of bowata and his fellow archers thus far had inspired them with such confidence in themselves and their weapons that i believe not a man of them would have turned tail so long as a single arrow remained to them and as the surviving apes advanced they were met by such a withering flight of arrows that not one of them lived actually to emerge from the water and then with yells of triumph the victors rushed into the water and gave the coup de grace to such of the apes as betrayed any signs of lingering life let draw the foresheet billy said i we must go ashore and congratulate our friends upon their victory as the boat grounded on the beach i saw that several of the natives were still in the water busily engaged in retrieving arrows from the bodies of their victims but i had a shrewd suspicion that many of the arrows shot had been hopelessly lost and the suspicion suggested an idea upon which i acted later on but for the moment my attention was fully occupied by bowata and his people who crowded round us all talking at once some of them excitedly relating particular incidents of the adventure while others were striving to express their gratitude to me for putting into their hands the means to defend themselves successfully against the most formidable raid that had ever been attempted by the apes on our way back to eden i gave some consideration to the idea referred to above it was this long as we had been on the group without sighting so much as the most distant glimpse of a sail the hope was ever present that the day would eventually dawn when we should be rescued from our imprisonment mild and even agreeable as it was in some respects and when that day should arrive what would happen to bowata and his people who would continue to supply them with weapons of defence against their ferocious enemies it was obvious that from the moment of our departure from the group they would be left entirely to their own resources and to me it seemed that it would be only humane if not my actual duty to supply the means whereby it might be possible for them to replenish for themselves their supply of bows and arrows now how was this to be done i could see nothing for it but to provide them with something in the nature of a boat wherein to navigate the channels then to show bowata where the wood for the bows and the shafts for the arrows could be obtained and finally teach him and his people how to make bows and arrows for themselves i fully realised that to present the savages with a boat might be a proceeding not altogether devoid of danger for savageseven such apparently harmless savages as our neighbourswere apt to develop treacherous tendencies and once provided with a boat it would be difficult to prevent them visiting our own particular island of eden when if any of our possessions should chance to excite their cupidity who could say what might happen there was of course a way whereby this danger might be reduced to a minimum and that was by so reducing the dimensions of the boat that she should be incapable of carrying more than two men at a time and this i determined to do as to material there was plenty of such as i required to be obtained from the wreck for i meant the boat to be of the simplest construction being in fact nothing more than a miniature flatbottomed thames punt to be propelled by a pair of paddles having settled this matter to my satisfaction i explained my intention to billy that evening as we sat together under the veranda discussing the events of the day by the light of a glorious full moon with kit sprawling as usual at my feet my intention was to start next day with billy for a trip to the wreck where i proposed to remain until i had constructed the punt which i believed could be done in something less than a week starting immediately after breakfast taking with us the carpenters toolchest an ample supply of fruit and food and of course kitwho could not possibly be permitted to roam eden at large and be deprived of our company for a whole weekthe voyage was accomplished without incident and we arrived at the wreck early in the afternoon we found the old craft in every respect just as we had left her excepting that her cabins having been securely closed during our absence were distinctly stuffy this was soon remedied however by throwing back the companion slide and opening the skylight and all the scuttles after which we filled in the remainder of the afternoon in making up the beds in the staterooms and preparing generally for our weeks sojourn when all was done an hour or two of daylight still remained which i utilised by preparing a sketch of my proposed punt she was to be five feet long on her bottom with a rising floor two feet long at each end making her nine feet long over all with a beam of four feet and sufficient freeboard to enable her to carry two men safely in the tranquil waters of the inner channels being flatbottomed flatsided and square ended she was an easy model to build there were no planks to be bent and as the wreck afforded abundant material and as we did not aim at such refinement of finish as was included in a coat of paint we completed our task during the afternoon of the fifth day even to putting her over the side into the water to take up leaving the wreck immediately after breakfast the next morning with the punt in tow we arrived at our anchorage in eden cove about half an hour before sunset almost the whole of the passage being a beat to windward while the towage of the punt further retarded our progress we however found everything just as we had left it and although i think we enjoyed the little change involved in living on the wreck we were glad to find ourselves once more at home particularly kit whose rambles had been restricted to the deck of the ship and who displayed his delight at returning to the wider spaces of eden by starting off at full gallop the moment his pads touched the sand rushing out of sight and appearing no more until we reached the house where we discovered the beggar squatted on the top steps of the veranda awaiting our arrival on the following morning after breakfast billy and i got the boat under way and with the punt in tow sailed for cliff island running the boat in on the beach we were quickly joined by bowata who informed us that four days earlier the apes to the number of nine had attempted another raid which he proudly added had been successfully repulsed but at the expense of many lost arrows and he hinted pretty broadly that a further gift of those very useful missiles would be highly appreciated whereupon i informed him that i intended to do even better than continue to furnish him and his people with bows and arrowsi was going to present them with means whereby they might procure the materials wherewith to make for themselves as many of those weapons as they pleased and therewith i led him down to the beach and directed his attention to the punt bowata looked at the craft and grunted his approval of her but it was evident that he had not the remotest notion of how she was to be the means of providing him with bows and arrows so casting off her painter billy and i stepped into her and paddling along close to the beach showed the savage in a very practical manner how to handle her next landing billy and taking bowata into the punt with me i handed him a paddle and first directing his attention to the manner in which i manipulated my own invited him to try his hand he proved an apt pupil and within the hour was able to manoeuvre the punt singlehanded then beaching the punt and securing her to a stake firmly driven into the beach i invited bowata and his son to enter the sailing boat informing them that having given them the means to navigate the channels i now proposed to show them where to obtain the wherewithal from which to make as many bows and arrows as they desired the pair entered the boat with a distinct suggestion of trepidation they could understand the punt apparently but they had evidently not yet grasped the fact that it was the wind that endowed the boat with mobility and they seemed to regard her with distrust as a magical craft that might as likely as not fly away with them never to return they were under the impression it presently appeared that we intended to turn them adrift to shift for themselves as best they could but when i explained that billy and i intended to go with them their fears vanished and they seated themselves contentedly enough in the bottom of the boat in the places which i indicated it was perfectly clear that not only they but also their fellowsavages regarded the expedition upon which we were embarking as a quite notable adventure for they assembled in force to witness our departure admiration and apprehension in about equal proportions being the dominant expressions upon the countenances of those we left behind us as the boat glided smoothly and rapidly away from the shore i took our guests first of all to west island upon which grew the trees from which i had obtained the wood found to be suitable for the making of bows and having directed bowatas attention to the characteristic peculiarities of the trees as distinguishing them from others i shinned aloft into one of them carrying with me a small hatchet that had come from the wreck and proceeded to lop off about a dozen suitable branches which with an ample supply of thorns to form arrowheads were duly placed aboard the boat then shoving off again we proceeded by way of the northwest channel round to shark bay in north island where running the boat into the swamp we cut a goodly stock of reeds from which to make shafts for the arrows these two tasks including the time occupied in sailing from place to place and returning occupied the entire day so that it was already dusk when having landed bowata and his son and our cargo of branches and reeds we arrived back at our own island of eden the next day billy and i again sailed for cliff island where with an old sheath knife as a tool i showed bowata how to make bows and arrows at the same time presenting him with the hatchet the knife and a quantity of cord from which to make bowstrings we spent three days with the natives supervising their work of making bows and arrows and by the time that they had used up all the material with which i had supplied them they had attained to a degree of proficiency that i felt would justify me in leaving them henceforth to their own devices chapter twelve islands of fire we had by this time been on the group eight months and although with brief intervals spent in visits to the wreck a sharp lookout for the appearance of a sail in the offing had been maintained nothing had been sighted and the disconcerting possibility now began to impress itself upon me that if i continued to trust only to such an occurrence for our deliverance we might spend years waiting for that event most fortunately we had both thus far been blessed with perfect health but it seemed too much to expect that this immunity from sickness or accident should continue indefinitely and if both of us should chance to fall sick at the same time what would be the result something very like panic seized me at the thought of such a possibility i felt that i had been culpably foolish in relying so implicitly and for so long a time upon extraneous help and the conviction forced itself upon me that i must at once take steps to effect our own deliverance yet what could i do the first idea that had suggested itself to me after the wreck of the brigantine was to build some sort of a craft in which we could effect our escape to civilisation but after considering the matter i had come to the conclusion that such an undertaking would be altogether beyond my powers with only billy to assist me no doubt i was helped to this conclusion by the conviction i then felt that something would certainly heave in sight within the next month or two to take us off but with the lapse of time my confidence had insensibly waned and i had accordingly set to work to make our stay upon the group as comfortable as might be now however i felt constrained to reconsider my original conclusion and as a preliminary i took pencil and paper drawinginstruments and scale and proceeded to make tentative sketches of such a craft as i considered essential to enable us to make the voyage in safety and with a reasonable amount of comfort to insure these requirements i decided that the boat whatever her dimensions must be fully decked and that she must be powerful enough to face and successfully battle with a whole gale of wind also she must be capable of being handled by billy and myself taking these requirements as a basis i set to work upon my sketches the relative dimensions of the boat would be governed to a considerable extent by her rig a cutterrigged craft is more powerful than any other but it is open to the objection that the mainsailthe cutters most important sailis an awkward sail to handle in a sudden emergency if the craft happens to be shorthanded as we should be i believed however that this difficulty might be overcome by watchfulness and the taking of timely precautions therefore after weighing the matter carefully i decided in favour of the cutter rig bearing all the above requirements in mind i set to work and ultimately evolved a design for a craft thirty feet long on the waterline by ten feet beam and six feet draught of water aft to build a boat of these dimensions with only billy to help me was a sufficiently ambitious project but i had learned a good deal while building our existing boat and after all i felt sure that if i should need more manpower bowata would willingly lend me some of his people also realising that henceforth billy and i would be fully occupied in building the new boat the thought occurred to me that it was high time to secure such domestic help as would enable us to give our whole time and thought to our work without troubling about such matters as cooking housecleaning and so on such help could only be obtained through bowata i therefore decided to seize an early opportunity to interview him upon the whole matter meanwhile however now that i had at last determined to attempt the building of a seagoing boat i was all impatience to make a beginning and as i further came to the conclusion that the beginningso far as the framing of the keel stem and sternpost was concernedmust be made aboard the wreck where all the materials were at hand we lost no time in again removing ourselves with all necessary goods and chattels to what remained of the yorkshire lass here i made a start by laying out fullsize in chalk upon the afterdeck an accurate outline of the keel stem and sternpost which greatly facilitated my work my chief difficulty i discovered was to find bolts at once of the required length and the necessary strength since i could not possibly make them and this difficulty absorbed so much time that we spent nearly a month on the wreck before the keel stem and sternpost were framed together in readiness to be set up on the beach at eden where i intended to do the remainder of the work the framework was much too big and heavy to be conveyed to eden otherwise than by towing and as the whole trip was more or less a beat to windward the transport of it cost us two days our arrival home occurring so late in the afternoon that there was no time to attempt anything further that day but on the day following i sailed over to bowatas island and explained to him my requirements finding him more than eager to do anything and everything he could to oblige me the domestic question was very easily arranged bowata suggesting that i should employ a man whom he could especially recommend and who with his two wives would be able to do everything required in that particular direction while as for labour for the building of the cutter he assured me i might have as many men as i wished for as long a time as i needed them nothing could be more satisfactory than this the only point i felt doubtful about being the domestic part of the arrangement but billy settled this by undertaking to supervise the work until the man and his wives should be trained to efficiency and the plan when put into operation worked excellently the keel of the new boat being now ready the next thing was to set it up accurately plumb longitudinally and transversely upon the building blocks and to do this i obtained the loan of twenty natives for a day for the keel with stem and sternpost attached was much too heavy a mass of timber for billy and me to manipulate without assistance and with their help the work was most satisfactorily accomplished they doing the manual work under billys guidance while i supervised and directed the adjustments that were frequently necessary i next set up five stout moulds one at the midship section of the boat with two aft and two forward of it giving the exact shape of the boat at those points and to the moulds i firmly attached several temporary wales and stringers thus obtaining a kind of skeleton giving an accurate idea of the form of the finished boat and when i had got thus far with my work and inspected the result from various viewpoints i was as much amazed at my own audacity in attempting so ambitious an undertaking as i was gratified at the appearance which it presented for i saw before me the outline of a very shapely yachtlike little ship that if i knew anything of such matters promised to be fast weatherly and a very fine seaboat quite capable of taking care of herself when hoveto even in a heavy gale of wind it was my intention to plank her upon the diagonal principle using three thicknesses of comparatively thin plank for i had no means by which to steam a single layer of planking of the necessary thickness and so render it pliable enough to bend to the correct shape while i believed that by using thin plank i could bend it to shape unsteamed i am getting somewhat ahead of my yarn however for the progress outlined above represented nearly three months hard work an appreciable proportion of which had to be done a second time owing to my inexperience with the accession of our black helpers our domestic arrangements flourished exceedingly the only difficulty we experienced in connection with them occurring during the first fortnight or three weeks after their arrival the trouble arising with kit who violently resented their intrusion and had to be kept strictly tied up until he had learned to understand that he must in nowise interfere with them but even after reaching this stage the natives had to be exceedingly careful how they conducted themselves in his presence for he never advanced farther than the merest toleration of them while when any of the other blacks were on eden assisting me to build the cutter it was absolutely necessary to keep the beast closely confined to the house until they had left i very soon made the discovery that had i been obliged to depend solely upon the efforts of billy and myself i should have been compelled to abandon the idea of building the cutter at a very early stage of the operations it was not so much that we found the work beyond our strengthalthough in that respect we were often glad enough to have a little additional helpbut it was often necessary to have a plank or a waling or some such matter held firmly in position at half a dozen points or more at the same moment while i fixed it and it was on such occasions that i welcomed the assistance of the natives and as such occasions occurred pretty frequently it happened that i was kept au courant with everything of importanceand with a great deal that was exceedingly unimportantthat occurred on cliff island thus i came to know that contrary to hope and expectation the arming of the natives with bows and arrows with the resulting destruction of the raiding apes had been absolutely ineffective in checking the raids which were now occurring more frequently and in greater force than ever it appeared almost as though the brutes were possessed of sufficient intelligence to understand that something had happened rendering it no longer possible for attacks by small numbers to be successful and that they were strengthening their attacking forces accordingly with the evident determination to succeed ultimately at whatever cost i was greatly vexed to hear this for it was evident that the existence of such formidable beasts in the group constituted a growing menace to the human life in it and i was wondering how this menace was to be fought when bowata and his people without consulting me made an attempt to solve the problem which for a short time at least seemed to be crowned with success it was the height of summer and there had been a spell of some six weeks of very hot dry weather when on a certain morning as billy and i with some natives were at work upon the cutter the lad directed my attention to a thin cloud of light brownishblue smoke rising in the air beyond cliff island there was a gentle easterly breeze blowing at the time sweeping the smoke away in the direction of west island and as we watched the cloud rapidly increased in density its colour darkened and somewhat to my astonishment it seemed to spread in an easterly direction or against the wind it soon became clear that it was the forest on apes island that had caught fire and it was equally evident that thanks to the long dry spell and to the fanning of the easterly breeze the fire was spreading with great rapidity for within twenty minutes of the appearance of the first light film of smoke we were able to see over the eastern extremity of cliff island the flames speeding up the hillside toward the conical summit of the island preceded by so vast a volume of smoke that it completely veiled the hills of west island from our sight while billy and i stood watching the rapid march of the flames one of the natives noticing our interest in the spectacle approached and informed us that bowata and one of his sons determined to drive the apes off apes island had that morning crossed apes channel in the punt which i had given them with the avowed intention of setting the entire island on fire beginning at its northern extremityin order to drive the apes away from that part of the island from whence they were wont to start to swim the channeland thence working round the shore to the eastern extremity of the island hoping thus to drive the anthropoids in a westerly and southerly direction right away from cliff island as apes island was everywhere densely covered with forest and undergrowth it was exceedingly probable that unless something unforeseen occurred to extinguish the fire every living thing upon it would be destroyed except such creatures as might essay to swim the middle channel and take refuge upon west island but as the day progressed and the fire advanced spreading ever more rapidly as great volumes of sparks were borne by the wind on ahead of the main body of flame kindling subsidiary fires in advance i began to doubt whether west island would escape remembering as i did that there was a stretch of the middle channel which was little more than half a mile wide across which such a tremendous volume of sparks as now filled the air might easily be wafted toward evening my anticipation in this respect was verified for upon ascending to the summit of our own peak on eden at the conclusion of our days work we saw that not only was the surface of apes island an unbroken expanse of black smoking ashes and charred treestumps but that the fire had leaped middle channel and practically the whole eastern side of west island was a mass of flame the destruction of life would of course be enormous but such glimpses as had thus far been afforded us of the animal life upon the group seemed to indicate that it was inimical to mankind and if its destruction involved that of the apes it was not to be greatly regretted i waited three days to allow the ashes to cool and then taking billy with me sailed for the middle channel running the boat ashore on apes island at a spot where a stream of fresh water discharged into the narrowest part of the channel here we landed and started to walk eastward over and through ashes that were ankledeep and in places still unpleasantly hot i was quite prepared to find evidences that the destruction of animal life had been tremendous but even so i was amazed at the innumerable scorched and shrivelled carcasses of creatures that had made their way to the waters edge and had there perished probably suffocated by the smoke because they had feared to take to the water they lay thick upon the ground huddled together as far as the eye could reach to the right and left of the spot where we landed and the odour of burnt flesh was almost overpowering while flies and birds swarmed about them in legions the remains were mostly so far consumed as to be impossible of identification but here and there we came upon what judging from the skull and teeth had once been a creature of the cat tribe probably a leopard while the skeletons of snakessome of them from their dimensions evidently pythonswere numerous we also came upon several carcasses of what i thought might have been boars but if they were the creatures must have been huge specimens of their kind there were also a few calcined skeletons of animals that must have been as big as or bigger than a british drayhorse but of very different build they did not suggest any animal with which i was acquainted and i was quite unable to put a name to them we walked two miles or more inland before turning back but nowhere did i see anything suggesting the destruction of so much as a solitary ape at which i was in nowise surprised for i felt sure that the apes at least would be able to keep well ahead of the fire and make good their escape to west island but west island was like apes island a fireblackened ruin as far as the eye could see toward both the north and the south and if the fire had swept clean across the island to its western shore it would mean another holocaust in which the apes also would be involved for there was no retreat no sanctuary beyond west island it was too late to push our investigations farther that day but i resolved that on the morrow i would see what the western side of west island looked like accordingly eight oclock in the morning of the following day found billy and me emerging from the northwest channel into the lagoon and hauling round to the southward to skirt the western shore of west island we needed not to travel so far as this however to discover that at least part of west island had escaped the ravages of fire for upon our arrival off the southwestern extremity of cliff island we saw that owing to the greatly increased width of the middle channel at that point the direction of the wind and the peculiar configuration of the island itself an area which i roughly estimated at about a hundred square miles at its northern extremity had been untouched by the flames and this area of forest although probably little more than a quarter of that of the whole island would still afford cover for a good many animals had they the senseor the instinctto escape to it it was not until we had rounded the northern extremity of west island and had followed the west coast southward for a distance of about eleven miles that we again came upon the ruin wrought by the flames which we found had swept right across the island leaving the area above referred to untouched while to the southward as far as the eye could see all was black ruin and desolation at this point too signs of the devastation wrought upon the animal life of the island began to reveal themselves in the shape first of isolated carcasses and then of groups of the same rapidly becoming more numerous and more crowded as the boat glided along southward within a stones throw of the beach as i was exceedingly anxious to discover whether or not the apes had escaped the destruction that had overtaken the other creatures inhabiting the two firestricken islands we landed at various points along the beach and made short investigating excursions inland coming upon the remains of animals and reptiles of several different kindsthe variety indeed was astonishingincluding i regretted to see two or three varieties of deer and at length we found the halfconsumed carcasses of three apes close together but we found no more that day it was by this time drawing on toward sunset accordingly we made sail for the wreck of the brigantine and took up our quarters aboard her for the night early on the following morning we resumed our inspection of west island starting at the point where we had left off on the previous evening and on this day we came upon the remains of two more apes several miles apart but although those five carcasses of apes were all that we found it was of course quite possible that there might have been many more for our excursions inland were necessarily of very limited extent to have made anything approaching a complete examination of the burnt area would have been the work of weeks rather than of days and i was indisposed to devote very much time to such an undertaking moreover the effluvium arising from so many rapidly decomposing carcasses was of itself a sufficient deterrent but slight and limited as was our examination it sufficed to prove that the island must have literally swarmed with animal life several species of which were as in the case of those found on apes island quite new to me and late in the day having extended our walk to the crest of a hill we discovered that there was a little south of the middle of the island a triangularshaped lake about six miles long by about five miles broad at its western end that had served to protect and preserve a clump of forest about two miles long and the sounds that proceeded from it indicated that many animals had found sanctuary there by the time that we had completed our survey it was too late to think of returning to eden that day so we again bore up for the wreck spending that night aboard her and returning to our own island on the day following on our way back i touched at cliff island and had a chat with bowata relating to him the result of our trip of inspection i told him that we had seen very few dead apes and hazarded the conjecture that the brutes retreating before the flames on their own island had swum the middle channel to west island on the northern and unburnt portion of which they might have established themselves but when he suggested that this portion also of the island should be set on fire to make assurance doubly sure i very strongly demurred pointing out that even if my conjecture should be correct the unburned forest would doubtless be swarming with animal life other than that of the apes and that it would be a very great pity to destroy it all in order to effect the extermination of the apes unless such a drastic measure should prove to be imperatively necessary after the little break following upon the firing of apes island i returned with enthusiasm to work upon the cutter and in the course of a month used up all the available material which i had thus far accumulated necessitating another visit to the wreck to obtain more i collected as large a quantity as i believed i could conveniently handle and forming it into a raft took it in tow for transport to eden the passage that under ordinary conditions could easily be accomplished in a single day occupied five days and was i think the toughest job i had ever undertaken in my life the raft being so deadly sluggish in movement that it was impossible to tow it to windward and finally i found myself compelled to kedge it more than half the way but i was glad when i had at length brought it safely into the cove and anchored it there for i now had enough material to carry on with for at least four months i estimated that another raft of equal size would suffice to complete the cutter and notwithstanding the difficulties that i had just encountered i felt strongly inclined to return forthwith to the wreck and procure a sufficiency for all future needs but i was very tired after my labours and i finally persuaded myself to postpone the task for a whileto my subsequent intense regret the anniversary of the wreck of the yorkshire lass arrived and passed we had been a whole year on the group and so far as we knew not a solitary sail of any description had come within sight of the islands during the whole of those twelve months it was an astounding incomprehensible fact i had never really anticipated such a possibility with the passage of each day each week each month i had said to myselfwith gradually waning assurance certainlyit cannot be long now before a craft of some sort comes along to take us off until the moment when it suddenly dawned upon me that if we were ever to escape it must be through our own effortsmy own especially this conviction now came upon me with overwhelming force my hopes of deliverance by means of some extraneous agency suddenly sank to zero and i began to work with such febrile energy that it presently drew from billy a steadily growing flood of remonstrance i had by this time expended so much of my material that i was in the very act of preparing for another visit to the wreck to obtain more when poor billy fell sick of some sort of a fever within three hours of his seizure he became delirious and was so extremely violent thathe being by this time a strong sturdy boyi was obliged to at once drop everything else to look after him and see that he did not injure himself during the more severe paroxysms of course i had long ago taken the precaution to secure possession of the ships medicinechest with its accompanying book of instructions but the latter afforded me little help for i could find in it no case the symptoms of which quite corresponded with those of my patient and i was therefore compelled to rely very much upon my own judgment and upon the instructions for the treatment of fevers in general a liberal administration of quinine seemed to constitute the most hopeful form of treatment and luckily we possessed an ample supply of the drug i accordingly dosed billy with it for close upon sixty hours when the delirium ceased and the poor boy sank into a semistupor of exhaustion which enabled one of the native women to relieve me by watching at the patients bedside i had by this time been without sleep for two nights and more than three days and i was therefore glad enough to be free to retire to my own room to rest for an hour or two arrived there i removed my boots and then without troubling to remove further clothing flung myself upon my bed and instantly sank into complete oblivion chapter thirteen we exterminate the apes i was aroused to consciousness by the flash of a dazzling light upon my closed eyelids accompanied by the crash of a terrific clap of thunder opening my eyes i discovered that the room was in opaque darkness showing that i must have been allowed to sleep at least eight hours but even as i swung my feet to the floor and started to grope for my boots while the reverberations of the thunderclap still rumbled and echoed in the distance there came another blinding flash of lightning instantly followed by a deafening crash of thunder and getting my bearings by the illumination of the lightning i started to my feet and forgetting my boots rushed to billys bedside apprehensive of what might be the effect of the storm upon him i found the patient not only awake but also in his right mind well billy my boy how are you by this time i demanded i believe im better thank you mr blackburn replied the boy but i feel very weak andoh goodness isnt it hot it was i had just found time to become aware of the excessive heat and closeness of the atmosphere the perspiration was simply streaming from every pore of my body and i felt suffocating for want of sufficient air all the doors and windows of the bungalow were wide open but the atmosphere was absolutely stagnant the naked flame of a newly ignited lamp burning without the faintest flicker one of our native domestics was now busying herself arranging the table in what we called the diningroom and in laying out the materials for a supper for mefor it now appeared that i had slept for nearly fourteen hours on end and the good woman insisted that i must have a meal at once while these preparations were in progress i went out and stood under the veranda to take a look at the weather the thunderclap that had broken in upon my slumbers proved to be the prelude to a terrific electrical disturbance which was now in full action the centre of the disturbance appeared to be almost immediately overhead for flash after flash of lightning was striking all round the house while the detonations of the thunder were continuous and so violent that i felt the floor literally tremble beneath my feet but the lightning was not confined to discharges from the cloud overhead it was darting earthward all round us and practically at all distances from zenith to horizon and so frequent were the discharges that the illumination from them was continuous revealing a vault packed with enormous masses of heavy black writhing cloud i stood for perhaps five minutes fascinated by the spectacle of the vivid lightningplay and then just as the native woman came out to announce that my supper was ready down came the rain in a perfect deluge and in a moment the eaves of the house the foliage of the trees and the earth itself poured with soft warm water it was too good an opportunity to be wasted so i hurried to my own room threw off my clothes seized a morsel of soap and dashing out to the midst of the downpour treated myself to a most delightful and refreshing bath as a preliminary to supper the rain continued for about half an hour and then it ceased with that abruptness which seems so characteristic of the tropics but it had scarcely come to an end when there arose a loud rustling of leaves among the trees in the garden and round about the house a blast of hot wind poured in through the open doors and windows violently slamming the former and causing the latter to rattle furiously and i had barely time to rush and close them all when a terrific squall came roaring down upon the bungalow this squall was only the precursor of several that followed each other at rapidly decreasing intervals until those intervals became so brief as to be no longer distinguishable and the wind settled into a roaring gale from the westward that blew all night and did not break until close upon noon next day as luck would have it i had chosen the eastern slope of the peak as the site upon which to erect the bungalow consequently the structure was to a very great extent sheltered from the gale by the hill behind it but even so the building quivered and shook under the stroke of the blasts and my heart sank as i thought of the wreck for i felt that she had not one chance in a thousand of weathering it out she was on what was now the windward reefas it had been when she struck upon it the surf would pile up on the reef again raising the level of the water by perhaps three or four feet and in that case the poor old yorkshire lass would be washed off the coral into the lagoon and would there sink and with her would go all the material that i needed for the completion of the cutter then there was the cutter herself or at least as much of her as had thus far been put together how would she stand the buffeting to which she was being subjected i was hopeful for she was at this time merely a skeleton and a very imperfect skeleton at that consequently there would not be much for the wind to take hold of yet i was anxious too for i feared lest the heavy rain might have displaced some of the keel blocks and so let the craft down and perhaps strained her out of shape so anxious indeed was i that i would have gone down to the cove at once despite the fury of the wind but the night was so pitch dark that i could have seen nothing nor singlehanded could i have done anything whatever might have happened so i was perforce obliged to defer my visit until daylight but when daylight came i fought my way down to the cove against the gale that was still blowing and there found to my inexpressible relief that nothing had happened but what could be put right in an hour or two i was naturally most anxious to ascertain what if anything had happened to the wreck but it was not until nearly a week after the gale that billy had progressed so far toward recovery that i was able to leave him entirely to the care of the natives when however that moment arrived i took immediate advantage of it starting for the scene of the wreck immediately after an early breakfast and enjoining billy not to be anxious should i be detained until the next day with a fair wind all the way the boat made short miles of the trip and i reached the scene of the wreck fairly early in the afternoon but at least an hour before my arrival my worst fears were realised for where the wreck had once been there was now no sign of her but i knew pretty well where to look for her and coasting along the inner edge of the reef i ultimately came upon her within a few fathoms of the reef sunk in six fathoms of water and of course irrevocably lost to us i thought however that possibly some useful wreckage might be floating about in the lagoon i therefore worked the boat over to west island beach near to which i did indeed find a few planks and some small odds and ends that had broken adrift or floated off when the wreck went down and these i formed into a small raft which i towed round to eden on the following day but when i looked from the skeleton of the cutter to the small quantity of material available for her completion my heart sank within me and i felt utterly discouraged for what i had was ridiculously inadequate it was not enough even to complete the shell of the craft and where on earth was i to get more there were of course thousands of trees on the group and i had an axe with which to fell them but when they were felled how was i to convert them into plank and scantling it was a problem which i puzzled over during the whole day succeeding my return to eden seeking in vain for a solution until at last it seemed that we were really doomed to remain where we were until taken off by a ship even though we should grow old while awaiting her arrival such a conclusion would doubtless have been terribly discouraging to many people but after the first shock its effect upon me was on the contrary so provocative that i resumed work upon the cutter with more resolution than ever if that were possible until some six weeks later i had used up all my available material and my work was perforce brought to a standstill but when this happened i had made such progress that the cutter was planked up to the gunwale with the first thickness of planking and so thoroughly satisfied was i with my work that i was determined nothing should prevent its completion even though to provide the necessary material i should be compelled to pull down the bungalow and break up our sailing boat such forcible measures as those however demanded the most careful consideration before adoption meanwhile the rank luxuriance of tropical plantgrowth had already changed the fireblackened areas of apes and west islands to varying tints of delicate green the several varieties of new vegetation seeming to find congenial conditions in the thick coat of ashes resulting from the fire but i learned from bowata whose people had been maintaining a close watch upon both islands that thus far no signs of animal life had been detected upon either of them although the chief agreed with me that whatever might be the case with apes island west islandor at least the unburnt part of itmust be simply swarming with living creatures and the conviction that this was so was causing him and his people so much uneasiness that a permanent watch had been established at the western end of cliff island and the natives resident there to the number of forty had all been armed with bows and arrows that they might be prepared to repel possible incursions of apes from that part of west island the channel at that point being but little wider than that which the apes were wont to swim when crossing from their own island the liability to incursions by the apes seemed to be the only source of anxiety on the part of bowata and his people in all other respects they appeared to be perfectly happy for their wants were few and so fertile was the soil of their own island that it amply supplied all those wants with very little exertion on the part of the easygoing inhabitants the trouble was that the products of their industry unfortunately appealed so strongly to the appetite of the anthropoids that to gratify it the brutes were willing to swim a channel a mile wide and the trouble was serious enough in all conscience foras i gradually learned in the course of frequent conversations with the chiefthe apes not only destroyed far more than they ate but until my introduction of the bow and arrow as a weapon they were only driven off with the utmost difficulty and frequently with serious loss of life on the part of the savages it was indeed to put an effectual end to those frequent raids upon their property that the natives in desperation had finally resorted to the drastic measure of setting fire to the island that harboured the monsters the longer i meditated upon the problem of how to meet the shortage of material for the completion of the cutter the more reluctant did i become to resort to so extreme a measure as the breaking up of the sailing boat still more the bungalow to supply the deficiency in my perplexity i visited east island and here a possible way out of the difficulty was suggested to me by the discoveryas i then for the first time particularly noticedthat certain of the trees flourishing on that island appeared to be if not actually cedars at least a species very nearly akin thereto and if upon closer investigation this should prove to be the case here was a supply of timber admirably suited to my requirements and ample beyond my utmost needs it was a matter worthy of my most particular attention and accordingly i selected a group of the supposed cedars and forthwith proceeded to operate upon them they were three in number of just about the right size for my requirements and they were within a quarter of a mile of the cove i began my investigation by hacking off a good stout branch stripping off its bark and testing its working qualities i found that the wood gave off the characteristic odour of cedar that it was closegrained that it was easily workable and that it was in short everything i could possibly desire i therefore started work in earnest by felling the tree that i had already attacked and trimming off its branches this brought my days work to a close and i returned to eden with a mind relieved of a heavy load of anxiety for there was now no longer any need to contemplate the breaking up of either the boat or the bungalow true i had found the wood i required but what i needed was thin planks not heavy balks of timber such as one might be able to hew out of a tree trunk with an axe and how was i to obtain those planks i considered the matter and suddenly remembered that cedar splits easily i therefore determined to ascertain by actual experiment whether it would be possible to procure the planks i required by splitting the felled trunk the experiment was on the whole successful for although i wasted more timber than i anticipated i nevertheless succeeded in securing several very fine planks that when operated upon with the plane could be reduced to the exact thickness required thus encouraged i made an estimate of the quantity of planking required to complete the hull of the cutter and then proceeded to fell as many trees as were needed to furnish that quantity it was while i was thus engaged that i one day received an urgent visit from bowata and his son who came in great distress to inform me that the watchers posted at the western extremity of cliff island to guard against a surprise attack on the part of the apes believed to have retreated to west island had that morning reported that the anthropoids were recrossing the middle channel to apes island and that from observation of the creatures movements it was strongly suspected that they meditated an attack in force upon cliff island and its inhabitants bowata concluded his communication with an entreaty that i would lend my aid to repel the threatened attack i at once acceded to this request and with the two natives aboard the sailing boat and their punt in tow proceeded to eden where i collected all the arms and ammunition we possessed and taking billy with me made sail for cliff island as we approached the northern extremity of apes island from which point the brutes usually started on their swim across the channel to cliff island my telescope revealed numerous apes clustered together upon the beach while many others could be seen wending their way toward the same spot but i could see none in the water so concluded that the threatened raid had not yet started i inquired of bowata how many of his people were now armed with bows and arrows and was gratified to learn that every male above the age of fifteen had been so armed this meant that there were more than a hundred archers to defend the island learning which i came to the conclusion that the best form of defence was attack and made my plans accordingly landing bowata and his son to conduct the defence of their island i took aboard the boat seven natives who the chief assured me were among his most expert bowmen and headed across the channel toward apes island my plan being to cruise to and fro opposite the spot where the apes were mustering and to pick off as many of the brutes as possible while passing at this point the channel was only about a mile wide ten minutes therefore sufficed us to accomplish the passage and to round to at a distance of twenty yards from the beach where some fifty or sixty of the gigantic brutes were now assembled most of them squatting upon their haunches as though awaiting a signal of some sort while others were joining them at the rate of two or three per minute as the boat approached the monsters eyed her malignantly while several rose to their feet as though preparing to repel an attack this suited our purpose well and as the boat under billys skilful handling rounding to into the wind with her sails ashiver glided slowly past the spot where the apes were congregated we each deliberately selected our target and drawing our bows to the full length of our arrows let fly with deadly effect every arrow went home many of them finding the heart and with screams of mingled pain and rage eight of the apes crashed to the ground a few of them writhing convulsively in their deathagony but most of them dead there was time for a second discharge before the boat drifted too far away and three more of the brutes went down while five of their comrades screaming and bellowing with pain and rage wrenched the arrows from their wounds some of them in their blind fury turning upon and savagely attacking their fellows the manoeuvre was so successful that it was repeated with equally satisfactory results thus far the unwounded apes appeared to take little or no notice of the havoc we were working among them and i feel certain that none of them connected that havoc with the appearance of the boat upon the scene but when the manoeuvre was repeated a third time and still more of their number fell dead or wounded it seemed at last to dawn upon their imperfect intelligence that the strange object with white sails which glided to and fro upon the water opposite them must be somehow associated with the casualties occurring among their companions and with yells of concentrated fury and eyes ablaze with deadly malice about a dozen of them shambled down the beach into the water and striking out started to swim in pursuit of the boat nothing could have better suited us than this senseless act of the great anthropoids for although they swam fast the boat could easily out distance them in the breeze then blowing and i signed to billy to edge away toward a wider part of the channel so that when they should discover how impossible it was to overtake the boat they might have the farther to swim should any of them escape us and attempt to make their way across to cliff island but the precaution was unnecessary for when they were in the water and swimming we could do as we would with them and within a few minutes every ape that had started in pursuit of the boat was slain by this time however others had also taken to the water there being now at least thirty of them swimming some in pursuit of the boat while others headed directly across the channel toward cliff island this necessitated an alteration of our plans yet we still contrived to keep the boat between the apes and the island crossing and recrossing in front of the brutes at a distance of five to ten yards so that it was impossible for us to miss them thus the slaughter went on until my very soul revolted at such terrible destruction for the brutes continued to come on by dozens and scores until there seemed to be no end of them most creatures would have had intelligence enough to recognise eventually that their persistence meant death to them and would have turned back either discouraged or terrified but the apes seemed to be incapable of either emotion and pressed resolutely on so that their destruction became imperative if the natives of cliff island were not to be abandoned to their tender mercies but that sort of thing could not go on for ever the number of the brutes gradually decreased and at the end of about three hours the last ape in sight succumbed to our attack and it then appeared probable that we had exterminated the entire tribe of the dangerous and formidable creatures chapter fourteen attacked by chinese pirates the destruction of the apes accomplished i returned with avidity to the task of felling the cedar trees on east island and splitting the trunks into planks for the completion of the cutterfor i had by this time entirely abandoned the hope of rescue by a passing ship it was about three weeks later that emerging on a certain morning from my bedroom and stepping out to the veranda to scan the offing according to custom before beginning the regular routine of the day my gaze was instantly arrested by an object poised on the very verge of the horizon some twelve miles distant showing up almost black against the vivid hues of the early morning eastern sky it was yet too small to be capable of identification by the unassisted eye i therefore darted back into the house and procuring the telescope brought it to bear upon the stranger and as i focused the image of that distant object in the lenses of the instrument i experienced a moment of most bitter disappointment for when my gaze first fell upon that tiny speck the thought instantly leapt to my mind that at long last the moment of our deliverance had arrived whereas a moment or two later my telescope revealed to me the disconcerting fact that the craft in sight and heading straight for the group was a chinese junk it may be that certain of my readers will wonder why the approach of a chinese junk to the group should cause me such acute disappointment and they may perhaps ask the question is not a chinese junk as capable as any other vessel of rescuing shipwrecked people and conveying them back to civilisation to this question i would reply yes undoubtedly under certain circumstances but let me explain the proviso implied in that reply had the boy billy and i only been concerned i would have trusted ourselves aboard the junk butthere was the treasure to be considered and i was not altogether ignorant concerning the character and reputation of chinese sailors there may be and probably are chinamen who are as honourable upright and honest as the average englishman but my experience such as it has been is that they are not to be found aboard a junk the chinese seaman is as a rule drawn from the lowest stratum of his people and among such men the moral sense if not absolutely lacking is very nearly so they are barbarian and all their instincts are primitive honour and honesty are words that have no meaning for them they are before all things else intensely acquisitive and if they want a thing they will take it if they can and woe betide the owner if he resists them in a word the chinese seaman is by instinct a pirate and a cruel bloodthirsty one at that hence my feeling of disappointment at the sight of that junk for how could i hope that our treasure would remain inviolate if placed in the power of such men as i have endeavoured to describe they would cut our throats without scruple in order to possess themselves of the contents of our chests the very appearance of which was irresistibly suggestive of treasure it took me not a moment to determine that rather than expose ourselves to such possible risks we would have nothing whatever to do with the junk if we could avoid it but could we the junk was heading straight for the group running before a light easterly breeze which would probably give her a speed of about three knots and in the course of the next three hours she would be close enough to enable her crew to see the bungalow the existence of which it was impossible to conceal built as it was high up on the hill side with a passage through the reef immediately opposite it was it at all reasonable to suppose that any craft would sail past the group without calling to investigate there was of course the possibility that the junk in sight might be perfectly harmless and that if she entered the lagoon it would be merely to satisfy curiosity and perhaps to obtain a little fruit or to replenish her stock of fresh water and if so well and good but if notif her crew happened to be composed of such ruffians as i have endeavoured to picture what then could i hope that they would be satisfied merely to come up to the bungalow ask a few questions in pidgin english and depart leaving us unscathed to suppose any such thing would beto say the least of itfoolishness the probability was that they would attack us sack the place carrying away everything that took their fancy including the treasurechests murder billy and me and burn down the house out of sheer love of destruction these reflections which have taken me so long to record flashed through my mind upon the instant following my recognition of the character of the stranger and realisation of the danger that possibly threatened us naturally led up to the question how was that danger to be averted could billy and i alone hope to put up a successful defence against an attack by perhaps thirty or forty determined men for let chinamen be what they may in other respects they are not easily daunted by a sense of personal danger especially if animated by the hope of plunder then in a moment there came to me the memory of bowata and the natives of cliff island they had been most profuse in their expressions of gratitude for the help which we had afforded them from time to time and had repeatedly declared their eagerness to find an opportunity to give practical demonstration of that gratitude here was their opportunity and all that was needed was to make them aware of it i took another long look at the junk and came to the conclusion that she could not reach the lagoon in much less than four hours which would allow me time to make a single trip in the boat to cliff island get into touch with bowata secure his assistance and return to eden with my dusky reinforcements i decided to do so and without waiting for breakfast at once started for the coveand the boat the wind being fair i made a quick run across to cliff island and a swiftfooted native boy soon brought bowata down to the landingplace where we usually met explaining the circumstances to him i found him as i had quite anticipated more than ready to render me every possible assistance and departing to muster his men he returned in a very short time with nineteen of his most reliable fightersthe boats utmost capacity was twenty in addition to myself and the chief naturally elected to accompany and head his party those men bowata assured me were the pick of the entire tribe and i quite believed him for although small and slight compared with the average englishman they were lithe wiry active and resolutelooking men with an eager gleam in their eyes which seemed to suggest that the prospect of a fight was the reverse of distasteful to them they were each armed with a bow a quiver full of arrows and a most formidablelooking war club the head of which was thickly studded with bone spikes and which promised to be terribly effective at close quartersthe latter being a quite recent addition to their armoury invented by bowatas son whose imagination had at last been stimulated by the persistent attacks of the apes the return passage to edenhalf of which was a dead beat to windward with the boat loaded to her utmost capacityoccupied so long a time that i was in a perfect fever of anxiety lest the junk should arrive before us but upon rounding the southeast point of cliff island i was somewhat relieved to see that she had so far not entered the lagoon nor did i see any sign of her during the remainder of the passage for low down in the water as we were the spray of the surf breaking upon the reef effectually veiled from our view everything outside there was still no sign of the junk when at length the boat entered the little cove that was our usual landingplace and grounded on the beach ten minutes later we surmounted the crest of the ridge on the far side of which stood the bungalow and i once more got a view of the open sea outside over the curtain of everlasting spray that had obstructed my view from the boat the junk was visible clearly enough hoveto at a distance of about a mile to windward of the reef and i hurried to the house for the telescope that i might obtain a nearer view of what was happening aboard her seizing the telescope i proceeded to the veranda from which i brought the instrument to bear upon the craft i now saw that she had lowered a boat that manned by a crew of five was heading for the opening in the reef immediately opposite our island this boat i watched keeping the telescope bearing upon her as she alternately topped and disappeared behind the long ridges of swell until at length she passed through the opening and entered the lagoon once through the reef she headed straight for eden and it looked as though the men in her contemplated landing on the beach at the foot of the slope upon which the bungalow was built whereupon i thought it well to hoist the brigantines ensign upon the flagstaff i had set up in front of the bungalow as a hint to the intruders that the island was british territory and that its inhabitants expected that territory to be respected the boat approaching cautiously at length reached a point about a quarter of a mile from the beach when the crew lay upon their oars while the man in the sternsheets rose to his feet and proceeded to subject eden and as much of the rest of the group as was visible from his point of view to a prolonged scrutiny after which at a sign from him the oars again dipped in the water and turning the boat recrossed the lagoon and made her way back to the junk there was now a pause in the proceedings during which i conjectured the man who had been in charge of the boat was making his report to his skipper the pause however was not of long duration for as i continued to watch signs of a sudden stir aboard the junk became perceptible and a few minutes later i saw that her crew were lowering two more boats much larger than the first and that a considerable number of menwho so far as it was possible to see at that distance were all armedwere swarming down the junks side into them this seemed to indicate that my worst suspicions regarding the character of the vessel were only too well founded and that a pretty stiff fight was in prospect for us if this should be so it was time to see about making my dispositions for the conflict i accordingly reentered the house and girding on my cutlass thrust a brace of fully loaded revolvers into my belt seized my own pet rifle and filling my jacket pockets with cartridges sallied forth and joining bowata and his party led them down to the beach this particular strip of beach it should be explained was quite unlike the other beaches of the group the latter composed of white coral sand were continuous smooth unencumbered averaged from thirty feet wide in some cases to as much as a hundred feet wide in others and usually sloped steeply enough to enable our boat with good way on her to run herself high enough on them to permit us to land dryfooted on the other hand the beach toward which we were now heading was a strip of coral sand not more than a quarter of a mile long perfectly smooth but sloping so very gently that i much doubted whether the boats i had seen preparing to leave the junk could approach within fifty yards of the shore without grounding but the circumstance most greatly in our favour was that this comparatively short length of beach while inviting enough in appearance as a landingplace was backed on its shore side by an outcrop of black rocks that offered splendid cover for a defending force while leaving attackers from the sea completely exposed these peculiarities of the shore rendered it morally certain that the beach itself would be the actual battleground in the coming conflict and it was with the view to its decision there that i made my final arrangements and posted bowata and his men having done this to my satisfaction i took my rifle and advanced to the open beach where i seated myself upon a detached fragment of rock and patiently awaited developments these proved to be somewhat slow in arriving and the period of waiting was rendered all the more tedious from the fact that low down on the beach as i now was the continuous veil of spray flying over the reef effectually hid everything that might be happening to seaward but at length after waiting for fully an hour for something to happen one of the chinese boats appeared in the gap in the reef closely followed by a second and a third the two leading boats were largish craft pulling eight oars each and they appeared to be carrying some fourteen or sixteen men each while the third was the much smaller craft that had already once entered the lagoon the crew of which seemed now to be augmented by three or four extra men once clear of the passage they formed in line abreast the smaller boat between the two big ones while one man doubtless the leader of the expedition stood in the stern sheets directing the movements of his little flotilla from time to time by a wave of his hand the distance across the lagoon at this point from the reef to the beach of eden was about a mile the boats were therefore not long in traversing the distance but i did not intend to allow our unwelcome visitors to land without a protest of some sort and at the same time giving them something in the nature of a warning i therefore waited until the boats had arrived within about two hundred yards of the beach when rising to my feet i discharged my rifle aiming to send the shot a few yards above the head of the leader who was still standing in the sternsheets of the smaller boat as though my rifleshot had been a signal the oarsmen of all three of the boats instantly ceased rowing and a tremendous jabbering arose among them which the leader silenced by raising his hand at the same time shouting what i took to be a sharp command the oarsmen dipped their starboard oars sweeping the three boats broadsideon to the beach and the next moment i was saluted by a shower of bullets and slugs from some twenty jingals for an instant the air all about me seemed to be full of lead but i was untouched and knowing that it would take them a minute or two to reload i wheeled about and crossing some halfdozen yards of open ground took cover behind a convenient rock as i did so the boats again wheeled into line abreast and with their crews excitedly jabbering and shouting to each other dashed toward the beach at full speed the leader drawing a most formidablelooking sword and waving it above his head with shouts of encouragement to his men but as i had foreseen the boats advanced but a few lengths farther when the two bigger ones stopped dead having grounded and several of their occupants unprepared for the sudden stoppage toppled over backward causing great confusion among their comrades at this moment i whistled shrilly whereupon bowata and his merry men arose from behind their ambush among the rocks and taking deliberate aim poured into the boats a flight of arrows every one of which must have told so short was the range and so great was the confusion that ensued among the chinese meanwhile the smaller boat being of lighter draught continued to come stemon for the beach i was covering her with my rifle nicely resting in a notch of the rock in front of me and as she came fair endon i pressed the trigger and the two foremost oarsmen collapsed on their oars both of them evidently shot by the one bullet this naturally added to the confusion but the leader who appeared to exercise great influence over his men soon restored order and shouting a command to his followers caused those in the grounded boats to leap overboard where with the water nearly up to their waists they paused for a moment to discharge a second volley from their jingals then tossing their cumbersome firearms back into the boats they uttered a yell drew their swords and came charging helterskelter through the water toward the beach this was the opportunity for bowata and his party who with arrows ready fitted to their bowstrings again rose from behind the covering rocks and let fly at the enemy some of the arrows missed their mark but about threequarters of them were effectiveone man i observed receiving no less than three shafts in his bodyand five of the enemy fell while others came staggering forward with arrows sunk deep in various parts of their anatomy the leader of the band however remained unhurt and he continued by shouts to urge his men forward to the attack it was evident that his followers derived great encouragement from his words and actions and that to put him hors de combat would practically be to win the battle therefore leaving my now empty rifle leaning against the rock behind which i had been crouching i drew my cutlass and advanced to meet the fellow determined to personally tackle him and put him out of action without loss of time he was a sufficiently formidable antagonist it must be admitted two inches taller than myself broad in proportion with an enormously massive chest and shoulders and great muscles that stood out like cables under the skin of his bare arms his features were typically tartar and his small eyes blazed with ferocity as waving his sword above his head he advanced with a shout of defiance to meet me meanwhile bowata and his followers poured in still another flight of arrows and then flinging down their bows they gripped their formidable war clubs and uttering weird yells charged across the sand and fell upon the chinamen as they emerged from the water i quite anticipated that the fight between the leader and myself would be a long and exceedingly tough one but to my amazement it was begun and finished in a breath the man came charging upon me with uplifted sword his evident intention being to make a cut at my head that should finish me out of hand and indeed he very nearly accomplished his purpose for as i raised my cutlass to guard my head his blade descended upon it with terrific forceand shore my weapon clean in two and if i had not at the same moment stepped nimbly aside i should assuredly have been cloven to the eyes as it was the descending weapon missed me by a hairbreadth shearing a large hole in the sleeve of my shirt but not touching the skin scarcely realising what i was about but acting upon instinct or the impulse of the moment i suppose before my antagonist could again raise his weapon i violently thrust my severed blade into his face and as he staggered back with the force of the blow i whipped out my revolver and shot him through the head that ended the fight for as the man fell dead at my feet a shout of mingled horror and consternation arose from those chinese who happened to witness the incident and who thereupon incontinently turned and fled to their boats an example immediately followed by their comrades hotly pursued by the blacks who plied their war clubs with terrible effect it was a disastrous adventure for the chinamen for of the total number engagedwhich i estimated to be between thirty and fortyonly eleven escaped for i counted them on the other hand the casualties on our side were remarkably small numbering only seven wounded the wounds consisting entirely of sword cuts none of which was serious of those seven bowata happened to be one his wound consisting of a sword thrust through the upper part of the left arm i therefore took him and his six companions in misfortune up to the house to dress their wounds leaving the remainder of the party on the beach to collect the weapons and their spent arrows and to clear up generally my surgical duties occupied about an hour and a half and when all my patients had been attended to i sent them with billy down to the cove to be ferried across in the sailing boat to cliff island where no doubt their own people would look after them then remembering that there were wounded chinamen among those abandoned upon the beach i started down to see what could be done for them for although a party of wounded and no doubt treacherous and vindictive chinks would be a most embarrassing charge to have on my hands common humanity demanded that they should not be left to perish miserably where they had fallen before however i had covered half the distance between the bungalow and the beach i met the remaining blacks marching triumphantly up the hill singing a song of victory and carrying not only their own recovered weapons but also several swords that they had taken from the fallen enemy they also brought the rifle that i had left on the beach and the sword scabbard and belt of the chinese leader which they solemnly handed over to me as the victor seeing that they had evidently been busy among the fallen i asked whether there were many wounded among the latter to which the man whom i was questioning replied no they were all dead pointing significantly to his blood smeared war club by way of explanation well it may perhaps seem inhuman to say it but i was not altogether sorry the men were undoubtedly pirates if not by profession pirates at least when opportunity seemed to be favourable they had attacked me deliberately and without provocation and but for the help of the blacks billy and i would unquestionably have been wiped out ten or a dozen of such men wounded would have been a terribly embarrassing charge for me to have assumed and it would have been still more embarrassing to have had them about the place when they were again hale and strong no taking everything into consideration i was not altogether sorry that they had been put beyond the possibility of perpetrating further mischief meanwhile what had become of the junk i had looked for her just before leaving the bungalow on my way back to the beach and had sighted her some six miles off in the southeastern quarter heading to the southward closehauled by which i judged that no further trouble need be looked for from her but there were the dead on the beach to be disposed of without loss of time how could this disposal be best effected i considered the matter and presently hit upon a plan the chinese in their precipitate flight had abandoned two of their boats namely the small one and one of the bigger ones those two would be sufficient to contain the whole of the dead and having now decided upon my mode of procedure i led my little band of black warriors back to the beach and with their assistance transferred the dead chinamen to the two abandoned boats we had barely completed this gruesome task when billy returned with the sailing boat whereupon i boarded her sailed her round from the cove to the east beach took the chinese boats in tow and anchored them for the night under the lee of the northern extremity of eden the next day i again took the boats in tow and with a party of eight natives to help me towed them to the beach of north island where we buried the dead chinamen the smaller of the two boats i then presented to bowata in recognition of the assistance he had rendered me in repelling the attack by the chinese while the bigger one i kept for the sake of her materials which would be valuable to me in the completion of the cutter it was while clearing up and putting matters generally straight after the chinamens unwelcome visit that the sword of the leader again came under my notice and impelled by curiosity i drew the weapon from its sheath and subjected it to a somewhat critical examination for if that should prove satisfactory i intended to make use of it in future in place of the cutlass the blade of which it had shorn through with such perfect ease i found it to be somewhat heavier than the cutlass the blade being considerably thicker than that of the other weapon though not quite so wide it was however perfectly balanced and i was able to wield it with the utmost ease while it was literally as keenedged as a razor and so exquisite was its temper that there was no sign of a notch or indentation of any description on its edge along its entire length from point to hilt i returned it to its sheath with much satisfaction feeling that i had effected a most profitable exchange chapter fifteen a surprising reappearance it was about three weeks later that as billy and i foregathered in the livingroom of the bungalow early on a certain morning discussing our biscuit and early cup of coffee prior to setting out for the matutinal bath that always preceded the work of the day billy asked by the way mr blackburn did kit disturb you at all last night he was so uneasy that i had to turn out twice and go to him and both times i found him standing at the top of the veranda steps straining at his leash latterly we always tied him up at night switching his tail fiercely and uttering halfsuppressed growls as though he scented or heard something unusual prowling near the house it was only by staying with him for about half an hour that i at last succeeded in quieting him down you see i was afraid he would awake you and i knew how frightfully tired you must be after your long days work at the cutter under the broiling sun i hope no apes or other unpleasant creatures have found their way to eden and are lurking to frighten the life out of me i think you need not greatly fear said i all the same there was probably a cause for kits uneasinesswhich by the way did not in the least disturb me for i never heard himand we may as well try to discover what it was therefore after breakfast i will take the rifle and give a look round it was however unnecessary to wait until after breakfast for the elucidation of the mystery for when billy and i reached the beach upon which stood the nearly complete hull of the cutter two ragged unkempt sunburnt scarecrows emerged from the shadow of the craft and approached me mornin mister remarked the taller of the pair in a wouldbe hearty tone of voice that nevertheless somehow suggested cringing as did his manner well here we are again turned up like bad pennies just in time by the looks of it to help ye finish this dandy yacht and sail her towherever you thinks of goin what i exclaimed in inexpressible amazement can it be possible that you are svorenssen andand van ryn why i believed that you and all the rest of the crew of the yorkshire lass were drowned when she was wrecked more than a year ago so we was mistervery nigh replied svorenssen there was only three of usbesides you and billythat escaped and that was me dirk here and a chap named fleminpete we used to call im when the ship struck we was all washed overboard by the first sea as broke aboard and natrally those of us as could swim struck out as soon as our heads rose above water andbut i say mister aint there no breakfast knockin about we havent ate nothin since yesterday aternoon and were feelin pretty sharp set i can tell ye breakfast i reiterated why of course it will be ready in about an hours time but you cannot come up to the house as you are you knowby the way were you by any chance prowling about in the neighbourhood of the house last night ay we was answered svorenssen we landed on the beach below it and made it out at once in the moonlight we guessed as it was yours and we was for rousin you out to give us a bite o supper but that dog o yours growled so vicious and seemed so savage that we decided to wait till this mornin it was extremely fortunate for you that you did said i the dog as you call him happens to be a leopard and if you had persisted in your attempt to approach the house the pair of you would assuredly have been killed i tell you this at once by way of warning the beast will ave to be shained oop else how are we to go in an out of der ouse demanded van ryn you will not go in and out of the house i retorted there is no room for you there then just look at yourselves you are as indecent in the matter of your clothing as you are filthy in your persons before anything else you will have to cleanse yourselves and be clothed decently the condition of your clothes you cannot help i suppose being castaways for more than a year but you might at least have kept your bodies clean you are disgustingly verminous both of you and after you have had a meal your first business must be to get yourselves clean you will remain here while billy and i go up to the house and bring you down some breakfast after which i must see what can be done to make you reasonably presentable all right mister answered svorenssen well keep clear of the ouse never fear we dont want to be tore to pieces by no leopards after tryin our utmost for over a year to get to ye and lend a hand in whatever you might be doin to get away from this ruddy hole were just as anxious as you can be to get away from it you may bet on that well said i to billy as we turned away to retrace our steps to the house our bath completely forgotten this reappearance of svorenssen and van ryn is a surprise and not altogether an agreeable one at that i never particularly liked either of them they impressed me from the very beginning as being insubordinate of disposition and impatient of discipline and i have not forgotten the character that the boatswain and chips gave them how did they behave before i joined the yorkshire lass billy had your father ever any trouble with them yes in some ways a good deal answered billy what the boatswain and chips said about them was quite true they and the other two foreigners were always quarrelling with the rest of the forecastle hands they wanted to do only just what work suited them and not what father wanted them to do and from what the other men said i believe that the dagoes would have mutinied if it had not been for the chance of getting hold of and sharing the treasure returning to the house billy and i snatched a hasty meal and then we started back for the beach bearing with us food two suits of the lightest clothing the slopchest afforded two bluestriped shirts two cloth caps soap towels a comb and a pair of scissors the two seamen were too hungry to talk much while discussing their meal nor did i attempt to question them just then curbing my curiosity until a more favourable opportunity to satisfy it should present itself and when the pair had finished eating i marched them off to the river where handing them the soap and towels i bade them strip enter the water and thoroughly cleanse themselves from the accumulated grime of a years neglect this at length done i set them to cut each others hair and beard and generally render themselves as decent looking and respectable as was possible after which i handed them their new clothes and bade them burn their old rags they seemed to consider me quite unreasonably particular and grumbled a good deal at what they appeared to regard as the wholly unnecessary trouble i was imposing upon them but i would take no denial and when at length they realised that i intended to have my way they surlily submitted in the end i believe that in despite of themselves they were rather glad that i had been so insistent for when they once more stood fully clothed their appearance was improved almost beyond recognition and they seemed quite pleased with themselves they were by no means so pleased however when in response to a remark by one of them i gave them to clearly understand that i would not house them in the bungalow and that during the comparatively short period of our further stay on the group they would have to be content with such accommodation as a tent would afford they argued hotly that being castaways and survivors from the same shipwreck we all stood upon a perfectly equal footing and were alike entitled to share equally in everything to which i replied that the bungalow the sailing boat and the cutter were all mine built with my own hands out of material salved by me from the wreck that they had not participated or helped in the slightest degree in any of the salving or building operations therefore i considered they were not entitled to claim any share in the comforts or advantages arising from those operations but that as an act of grace i was prepared to allow them a reasonable share of those comforts and advantages while if they would help me to complete the cutter make her ready for sea and assist me on the voyage they should be welcome to a passage in her for a heated five minutes i believed i was in for very serious trouble with the two men but in the midst of the argumentwhich was chiefly between van ryn and myselfsvorenssen intervened drawing his companion away and saying a few hasty words that seemed to have the effect of wonderfully calming the dutchmans excitement and the dispute ended by their admittingrather lamely i thoughtthat since i was evidently master of the situation they supposed they must make the best of it and accept what i chose to give them as to helping with the completion of the cutter they expressed themselves as only too willing to do so since they had had more than enough of robinson crusoeing it now said i to them as their toilet at length completed we moved away from the stream i must again warn you both to keep well clear of the house i have already told you that the animal which you last night mistook for a dog is a leopard now that you have arrived on the island i shall be obliged to keep him tied up but if you approach the house it will be at your peril for if kit sees or scents either of you he will probably break adrift and you will simply be torn limb from limb he is a most ferocious creature and will not tolerate strangers so bear in mind what i say and give him a wide berth bud i vants to see the house protested van ryn how am i to do that you will have to forgo that pleasure so thats all there is about it i replied dryly if the brute interveres mit me i vill kill im threatened the dutchman will you said i why man you would stand no more chance with that leopard than if you were the merest baby butenough of this you had better pitch your tent on the beach close to the cutter go down there now and choose a spot to suit yourselves and billy and i will come down later on with a sail pole and what other gear is necessary and help you to rig it up by midafternoon the tentconsisting of the brigantines forecourse which i had salvedwas satisfactorily rigged up a trench dug round it to carry off water in the event of rain and a sufficiency of rude but efficient furniture stored within it and somewhat to my surprise the pair who were to occupy it expressed themselves as quite satisfied then since it was too late in the day to do much work upon the cutter i invited the seamen to give me a detailed account of how they had fared since the wreck it was svorenssen who undertook to tell the story and he told it in the coarse uncouth language of the forecastle embellishing and emphasising it here and there after the manner of the shellback by the introduction of words and phrases comprehensible enough to me but confusing and quite unintelligible to a landsman i shall therefore take the liberty of translating the narrative into plain simple english for the benefit of my readers thus translated it ran as follows it must have been about half an hour after chips came forard with the news that you had met with an accident and had been carried down into your cabin and the gale was still blowing as heavy as ever when some of us on the forecastle thought we heard another sound above the shriek of the wind and the hiss of the sea and looking ahead we presently saw stretching away on both bows as far as we could see an unbroken line of wildly leaping breakers and flying spray we at once hailed the quarterdeck shouting breakers ahead and on both bows but it is exceedingly doubtful whether or not we were heard and if we had been it would have made no difference for before anything could be done the ship was among the breakers and a second later she struck not very hard but just sufficiently so to cant us broadsideon then she struck again and hung until a tremendous sea broke aboard sweeping her decks and doubtless washing all hands on deck overboardat all events that sea took me and swept me helplessly over the bows as also van ryn and another man named fleming but i knew nothing about them until the next morning being a swimmer i instinctively struck out and i had not made more than a dozen strokes before my hands struck something that i at once seized and clung to it proved to be a bit of topgallant bulwark about six feet long and it afforded me a most welcome support especially as the seas were still breaking over me so furiously that it was only with the utmost difficulty i contrived to snatch a breath between whiles but the breaking seas that came near to smothering me were also sweeping me away fast to leeward and after a time i found myself in smoother water the seas no longer broke over me and the water being quite warm i experienced no discomfort apart from the uncertainty as to what was to eventually happen to me and i just kept paddling along to leeward following the run of the seas i might have been overboard about half an hour when clearing the salt water out of my eyes i caught the loom of land ahead through the darkness the sight of which greatly cheered me for i had no doubt of my ability to hold out until i could reach the shore and i had the comforting conviction that where there was land there was also safety about an hour later i found myself again among breakers but they were a mere trifle compared with those that i had already encountered and shortly afterward my feet touched bottom and abandoning the fragment of wreckage to which i had been clinging i crawled up the beach to above highwater mark flung myself down upon the warm sand and instantly fell asleep when i awoke the sun was shining brilliantly and the gale had broken although it was still blowing a strong breeze i looked out to seaward and at once sighted the wreck about two miles away dismasted and hard and fast upon the reef then glancing at my surroundings i perceived that i had landed upon a beach of fine white sand backed by country densely wooded with hills stretching away to north and south the sight of the trees suggested possibilities of fruit the thought of which reminded me that i was hungry and i was about to make a plunge into the woods in search of something to eat when i heard a voice hailing and looking in the direction from which the hail had come i saw to my great satisfaction van ryn and fleming about a quarter of a mile along the beach naturally we at once joined forces and they being like myself hungry we forthwith proceeded to hunt for food speedily finding an abundance of cocoanuts that had fallen ripe from the trees that lined the inner edge of the beach we ate and drank our fill of the fruit and milk of the nuts and then having meanwhile discussed our plans for the future we began our quest for a practicable path inland for the idea of camping on the beach night after night had few attractions for us but the undergrowth was so dense and impenetrable that it was not until we had traversed quite a mile of the beach under the rays of a scorching sun that we at length found a spot where by cutting and hacking the monkeyrope and creepers with our knives we finally succeeded in working our way into a valley enclosed between two ranges of hills running practically parallel my word that was hot work i assure you mr blackburn of course there was no lack of shade but on the other hand there was no air the atmosphere was simply stifling and what with that and the labour of hewing a way through the dense undergrowthmuch of it consisting of bushes covered with tough sharp thorns that got hold of our clothes and not infrequently our skins and refused to let gothe perspiration poured from us like water and simply drenched our clothes but the monkeyrope the creepers the thorns and the heat were not the worst of our troubles the whole place was swarming with mosquitoes that hovered about us in clouds and bit us savagely in a hundred places at once and as though these were not enough there were myriads of small black ants that penetrated our clothing and bit us even more savagely than the mosquitoes luckily we did not encounter the ants until we were very nearly through the belt of bush or we should have been compelled to abandon our attempt ultimately however we effected the passage of the bush and found ourselves fairly in the valley with long dry grass waisthigh plenty of trees big and little but not much bush or creeper and then we encountered potential trouble of a fresh kind for although we were no longer attacked by ants we too frequently heard rustlings in the long grass that we presently discovered to be caused by snakes and we were compelled to walk very warily lest we should perchance unwittingly tread upon one of the creatures and be bitten perhaps fatally as a punishment i confess thatwell to put it plainly i did not half like it but what were we to do we were searching for a cave or shelter of some sort that would serve us for a lodging and a place of protection in the event of a recurrence of bad weather and we were not likely to find it by standing still also we were looking for food with a view to the future but the question of supplies afforded us little anxiety for banana and plantain trees were abundant in that valley to say nothing of grapes and several other kinds of fruit coming to a banana tree the fruit of which was fully ripe we made a good meal and then feeling rather tired we trampled down a smooth place in the grass under the shade of a big tree stretched ourselves thereon and were soon fast asleep judging from the position of the sun in the heavens it might be about five oclock in the afternoon when i was awakened by somebody shaking me by the shoulder and as i opened my eyes i heard a voice i at once recognised as that belonging to dirk here who was saying in a sort of whisper hush dont make a noise but just lift your head cautious and look look where i returned also in a sort of whisper and what am i to hush for look to your right at petewhich is the name by which we usually addressed fleminglying fast asleep there and see what youll see replied dirk i turned my head very cautiously and looked and there within less than a fathom of me was pete fleming lying flat on his back fast asleep with a snake coiled up like a cable right in the middle of his chest the snakes head was resting upon the top flake of his coils with his cold cruel eyes gazing straight at us and his long black forked tongue flickering in and out of his mouth in a most suggestively threatening manner whats the best thing to do murmured dirk in low tones we must do something quickly for if pete awakes and stirs as much as an eyelid the beggar will bite him and then it will be all up with poor pete there was a small branch with a few twigs and a bunch of leaves on the end of it lying on the ground within reach of my right hand i contrived to get hold of this without disturbing the snake then sitting up suddenly i thrust the bunch of leaves on the end of the branch straight and hard at the reptile andit vanished that is the only way in which i can convey any idea of the rapidity with which it retreated the next instant pete was sitting up rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and demanding with many choice forecastle embellishments what i meant by my fool tricks when we explained to him the danger that he had so narrowly escaped he had the grace to thank me for my intervention but we all agreed that the spot had no longer any charm for us and that it was high time for us to resume our search for a place where we might pass the night in safety such a place was by no means easy to find but ultimately within a few minutes of sunset we came upon a sort of shelter among some rocks of which we at once took possessionfor our need was by this time urgent total darkness being due in about ten minutes pete was strongly of opinion that wherever our shelter might be we ought to light a fire in front of it to scare away wild beasts and possessing a burningglass he took the precaution to make fire with it before the sun sank too low and to kindle a torch with it for the purpose of lighting our fire so having at length found our shelter we forthwith proceeded to gather materials light our protective fire and dispose of ourselves for the night having found a refuge of sorts we anticipated a good nights rest but no sooner had darkness closed down upon us than from all quarters there arose a chorus of the most terrifying soundsroars barks bellowings savage growls grunts shrieksnever in my life before had i heard anything like the pandemonium that raged around us we heard the branches of trees being broken great stones came rattling and crashing down the steep hillside behind us missing our shelter by only what seemed a series of miracles there were heavy thuds accompanied by bloodcurdling snarls that suggested the progress of lifeanddeath fights between ferocious beasts and at frequent intervals we caught through the smoke of our fire glimpses of great eyes glaring at us such was our first experience of night life in the wild at length however toward morning the racket gradually quieted down and we snatched a short spell of sleep until sunrise when we turned out and proceeded to hunt for breakfast luck was with us that morning for we had not gone far when we found the partly eaten carcass of a fine fat deer the creature had not been dead very long for the blood about it was scarcely dry and the meat was quite fresh we were hungry and not too squeamish so we got to work upon that deer and cut some fine steaks off a part of him that had not been touched by the thing that had killed him and carrying the meat back to our shelter we made up the fire and cooked ourselves a fine breakfast finishing off with fruit as a substitute for the water that we failed to find while partaking of breakfast we discussed our future as castaways with our experiences of the past night fresh in his mind fleming proposed a return to the beach and the construction of a raft upon which he suggested we should paddle off to the wreck with the view of giving her an overhaul in the hope of finding something that would repay us for our trouble but when it came to consideration of details dirk and i came to the conclusion that with nothing but our sheath knives to serve as tools the scheme was impracticable what we might have attempted had we known that you and billy were alive and still aboard is perhaps another matter several other schemes of an equally impracticable character were suggested only to be abandoned after discussion until finally failing any more satisfactory plan we decided that if we could find a nice comfortable cave to serve as a dwelling we would experiment a bit upon robinson crusoe lines and see how we liked it we found several caves of one sort and another that day but the most suitable of them were already tenanted as we could tell immediately that we put our noses inside them moreover many of the tenants happened to be at home when we called and seemed to resent our presence upon their doorsteps therefore to avoid unpleasantness we retired in many cases rather precipitately ultimately however we came upon a cave that for some inexplicable reason was untenanted and seemed to be everything that could reasonably be desired it was situated high up on the side of the hill and the entrance was so small that we were obliged to bend almost double in order to pass through but once past the entrance the cave widened out until its interior was as spacious as that of half a dozen forecastles knocked into one with headroom of ten or twelve feet it had a beautiful dry soft sandy floor andbest of allthere was a pool of deliciously cool sweet water at the far end of itthe first fresh water that we had found and the air was as clean and sweet as the water no zoological gardens odour or taint of rotting bones you understand we took possession at once vividly remembering our experiences of the night before our first business was to go out again and collect enough dry stuff to make a fire at the entrance to last all night we next cut a sufficient quantity of the long dry grass to provide each of us with a comfortable bed and we completed our arrangements by cutting and conveying to the cave a bunch of bananas big enough to furnish us with a supper that night and breakfast the next morning then having supped we built and lighted our fire turned in and slept soundly all night notwithstanding that even in our sleep we were conscious of a repetition of all the weird sounds of the previous night i suppose you will scarcely be anxious to hear the full details of every adventure that befell us during our sojourn in that valley and indeed if you did i am afraid i could not relate them with much pretence to accuracy adventures enough and to spare there were of one sort and another but i seem to have got them all mixed up together so that i am unable to say just exactly when any one in particular happened the wild beasts did not very seriously trouble or interfere with us during the daytime but the snakes more than compensated for this they constituted a perfect terror we grew so fearful of them at last especially after our boots gave out that we scarcely dared to put one foot before the other indeed it was a snake that finally drove us out of the valley chapter sixteen svorenssen relates an interesting story it was while we were seeking fruit that the thing happened we had crossed the valley and plunged into the forest on the other side dirk and i being together while pete was a few yards away when suddenly as we were passing under the boughs of a big tree i heard a kind of plop and at the same instant dirk gave a yell that very nearly scared me stiff glancing round to ascertain the cause of the disturbance i was horrified to see dirk enveloped in the coils of an enormous snake whose ugly head was poised within a few inches of my shipmates face the creatures forked tongue flickering in and out of its widely opened jaws i suppose i shall never be able to explain or account for the impulse that actuated me at this horrid sight but the fact remains that without pausing an instant to reflect i thrust forward my left hand and gripped the snake just behind the head while with my right i drew my sheath knife across the reptiles throat pretty nearly severing the head from the body at one stroke instantly it became a case of stand clear the snake uncoiled itself from about dirks body and proceeded to fling itself about on the ground with such terrific violence that the air round about us was presently full of bits of grass broken twigs and flying leaves while dirk yelling like a madman flung himself upon the writhing body of the reptile stabbing furiously here and there with his knifebut never touching the snake so far as i could see while pete came running up to ascertain what was the matter we got dirk away from the snake eventually and helped him back to the cave and when we got him there we stripped him to learn the extent of his injuries to our great relief we found that there was very little the matter with him he was much bruised about the body from his waist to his shoulders but that was all it was however enough we agreed that robinson crusoeing was not quite all that in our boyhoods days we had believed it to be and we resolved to return to the beach on the following morning and endeavour to swim off to the wreck when we started to work our way back to the beach we discovered to our annoyance that the path which we had cut for ourselves through the scrub had become completely overgrown again consequently we had all our former work to do over again with the ants and mosquitoes even more pertinacious in their attentions than before thus the afternoon was well advanced when at length we once more caught a glimpse of blue water by that time we were so utterly fagged that we felt it would be folly to attempt a long swim under such conditions we therefore postponed our attempt until the next day we saw that the wreck was still on the reef apparently in no worse condition than when we had last viewed her and with our experiences of life ashore still fresh in our memories we told each other what fools we had been in making no attempt to get off to her again as soon as the weather had settled after our first landing pete fleming was far and away the keenest of our little party to get aboard again he directed us to observe how high she was standing out of the water and expressed the opinion that for that reason it might be possible for us to penetrate to her lazarette where we should doubtless find a quantity of tinned stuff that would be infinitely more palatable than the fruit diet upon which we had so long been subsisting and of which we were all now thoroughly tired and he was particularly eloquent upon the subject of drink of which he seemed confident that we should find a considerable quantity so keen indeed was he that he was stripped and in the water four or five minutes before dirk or myself and was already swimming when we two started to wade in and then a dreadful thing happened we were little more than ankledeep when we heard him utter an awful shriek and saw him throw up his hands and disappear in the midst of a violent swirl of water in an instant the terrible truth burst upon us that the poor chap had been seized by sharksthe existence of which in the lagoon we had never suspectedand on the instant dirk and i moved by the same impulse turned and fled back to the beach the incident effectually cured us of any further desire to reach the wreck and we never again ventured to attempt any swimming until a few days ago dirk and i camped on the beach again that night building a fire round our campingplace as a protection against wild beasts but some time during the night i happened to awake to discover that our fire had burned perilously low and that some seven or eight great brutes were hungrily prowling round us their eyes gleaming like green lamps and themselves apparently waiting only until the fire had burned a little lower or their courage had grown sufficiently to enable them to leap in and seize us i sprang up awaking dirk and together we heaped fresh brushwood upon the smouldering ashes until the flames leaped up again and then our visitors left us but our narrow escape brought home to us realisation of the extreme danger of sleeping in exposed situations and after breakfast on the following morning we set out to return to our cave in the valley how long we remained there on this occasion i cannot tell you for we soon lost count of time but it must have been several months certainly for some time we lived exclusively upon fruit but later on we contrived to secure a morsel of meat now and then upon one occasioni am afraid you will not believe me but i assure you it is truewe found a young deer tangled up in the biggest and toughest spiders web you ever saw and of course we killed and ate the little creature that spiders web suggested to us the idea of setting traps which we made of monkeyrope and in which we sometimes caught small game of one sort or another we should probably have been living in that cave to this day but for another bad scareand in that case we should never have known that you and billy had survived the wreck and should have made no attempt to join you so perhaps it is just as well for all of us that we had that scare i was by no means certain that i fully agreed with svorenssens view of this matter but i said nothing and the man continued his story there was something very curious and uncanny about that scare though just exactly what was the nature of it i cannot tell you for we never found the explanation of the mystery it was a long time before we observed anything in the least degree strange connected with our surroundings at first not only when pete was with us but later when dirk and i returned alone we slept soundly all night and every night but eventually there arrived a time whenwhen now how am i to say it so that you will understand me ve had disturbin dreams prompted van ryn yes agreed svorenssen that was it we had disturbing dreamsat least sometimes we thought they were dreams while at other times we were convinced that they were real a curious circumstance in connection with it was that the experiences began for both of us on the same night it was our practice to build a big fire in front of the cave every night to prevent the entrance of wild beasts while we slept and on the night about which i am now going to speak we did it as usual we were never long in dropping off to sleep after we had composed ourselves to rest for the night and this particular night was no exception to the rule i dont know how long i had been asleepbut it could not have been long for our fire outside was still burning brightly and the interior of the cave was brilliantly illuminated by itwhen i suddenly started up broad awake with my hair on end and the sweat of terror literally streaming from my every pore for i was feeling more thoroughly scared than i had ever before been and i was trembling like a leaf and my teeth were chattering although at the moment i had not the slightest notion what it was that had frightened me then i heard dirk muttering to himself and looking round i saw that he too was sitting up looking as terrified as i felt whawhat is it mate he stammered whats happened that is exactly what i want to know said i how come you to be awake hush whispered dirk in a trembling voice listen and he held up his hand for silence i listened andbelieve me or not as you please it is the solemn truth im telling youthat cave was full of queer little mysterious noises like people whispering and the soft tread of feet all about us i looked and dirk looked but we could see nothing yet the sounds continued now seeming to come from the back of the cave and then all about us i believe i should have been far less terrified if i could have seen anything to account for the sounds but there was nothing panic seized me i sprang to my feet and rushed shrieking out of the cave dashing headlong right through our fire and coming a terrible cropper on the rough sloping ground in front of the cave in falling i must have stunned myself for i remember nothing more of what happened that night butand this i consider the most extraordinary part of the whole adventurewhen i awoke next morning i found myself back in the cave again lying upon my grass bed with dirk close alongside ah i commented quite a queer dream what had van ryn to say about it i suppose you mentioned it to him i said dot it vas no dream for shoost vot happened to svorenssen the same thing happened to me answered van ryn speaking for himself well of course that was very remarkable i agreed still it could have been only a dream since you found yourselves i understand in the cave and on your own beds in the morning yah dot vas so assented van ryn but vhen ve comes to overhaul ourselfs ve found dot our hands and faces vas badly skinned by our fall outside dot cave und our hair and beards as vell as our clothes vas singed vhere ve had shoomped through the fire indeed said i that was certainly remarkableif you are both quite sure you did not imagine those very peculiar happenings if you mean about our skinned hands and faces and our singed hair and clothes there was no imagination about that asserted svorenssen but about the otherwell when we came to talk about it in broad daylight we were unable to decide whether we had actually heard the sounds or whether we had dreamed them you see it was not as though the thing happened once only it happened several nights running and at length it got upon our nerves to such an extent that we could endure it no longer so we agreed to return to the beach and work our way along shore on the lookout for a break in the reef abreast of which we proposed to camp in the hope that sooner or later a ship might come along enter the lagoon and take us off a most sensible plan said i and the only thing i am surprised at is that to a couple of sailormen like yourselves the idea did not come much earlier ay agreed svorenssen it is a pity that it did not had it done so we should no doubt have discovered that you were still alive much earlier than we did and found means to signal to you no doubt said i well what happened to you after you left the cave the second time the first thing replied svorenssen was that we had the misfortune to lose petes burningglass which left us without the means to light a fire that was a terrible loss for it left us defenceless against the attacks of wild beasts at night so that we dared not camp anywhere in the open dirk remembered having heard that the natives of certain countries made fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together and we tried the same plan over and over again indeed we spent the better part of several days trying to get fire in that way but without success we could not even raise a whiff of smoke that was about the worst misfortune that happened to us for without fire to protect us at night or to cook food during the day we were continually in difficulties but it was not long before we discovered a method of cooking after a fashion without fire of course you will understand that the only cooking we had to do was when we were able to obtain a morsel of meat which was by no means every day when we succeeded we used to look about for a rock that had been exposed to the suns rays for several hours and when we had succeeded in our search we cut our meat into thin slices and laid it upon the rock which was hot enough to so far broil our meat as to render it quite eatable we dared not camp out at night even on the open beach the beasts were certain to discover us somehow and came prowling round giving us not a minutes peace and many a narrow escape we had from them thus we were compelled to get what sleep we could during the daytime keeping watch and watch while at night we did such travelling as was possible but that was not much for more often than not we were driven to take refuge in trees or to retreat into the water sitting in it up to our necks with sharks cruising round within a few fathoms of us and occasionally making dashes into the shallow water and running themselves aground in their efforts to reach us ah those were lively times and no mistake and often enough we used to tell each other that life was not worth living yet we spared no pains to preserve it then as though we had not already enough trouble dirk must needs fall sick of a fever of some sort and became violently delirious for three nights and four days i could do nothing with him he was simply stark staring mad he would not permit me to approach him but threatened me with his knife whenever he saw me the only thing i could do was to keep him just in sight and a pretty dance he led me following him into the woods and all over the placeexcepting into the water luckily for us both he had sense enough to keep clear of that or the sharks would assuredly have had him but of course that sort of thing could not long continue and toward the evening of the fourth day the poor chap collapsed and as luck would have it i found a comparatively safe refuge for him among some rocks where i looked after and attended to him until he was well enough to be up and about again but the fatigue anxiety and loss of rest told upon me so severely that no sooner was dirk able to look after himself than i fell ill and then it was his turn to look after me for about a fortnight then one day when i was beginning to pull round a bit dirkwho had been out foraging for foodreturned to our refuge in a great state of excitement with the intelligence that he had just seen a sailing boat alongside the wreck the statement greatly alarmed me for of course i did not believe a word of it and my fear was that my chum was suffering a relapse and was again experiencing delusions but when i suggested this idea to him he indignantly scouted the idea repeating his statement and bidding me crawl to the opening of the shelter and see for myself if i did not believe him i took his adviceit was of course the obvious thing to doand there to my amazement was the boat unmistakably enough with her mast stepped rigging set up and sails stowed what was more after looking intently for several minutes i had the impression that i caught glimpses of one or two people moving about aboard the wreck we watched all that day and the next and the next every moment expecting to see the boat leave the wreck and all that time we were trying desperately hard to make a fire and thus create a smoke so that whoever was aboard the wreck would see it and come across to ascertain what it meant but try as we would we were unable to manage it then one day dirk went out to look at a trap which he had set in the woods and upon his return he reported that the boat had left the wreck and was heading along the lagoon in a northerly direction and that there were two people in her a man and a boy so we naturally concluded that it must be you and billy and that you had somehow escaped drowning after all then said i to van ryn if you saw us as distinctly as that why did you not show yourself on the beach and wave to attract our attention i did replied the dutchman dye think im such a fool as to miss a chance but you vas not look my vay not neither of you und though i shout and yell und run along the beach you take no notice but sail on until at last you sails out of sight that is very strange said i for whenever i was cruising in the lagoon i always kept an eye on the shore then you moost ave been lookin out abeam or ahead not astarn vhere i appened to be declared van ryn possibly i agreed for i saw that the man was in an aggressively disputatious humour and i wanted to have no words with him well what happened after that go on with your yarn svorenssen we saw you three or four times after that resumed svorenssen and once you passed so close that we easily recognised both of you unfortunately we were both up a tree at the time and were unable to descend for the reason that there was a savage brute of a wild pig that had driven us up aloft and was waiting below for us to come down again of course we shouted our loudest and as long as there seemed any possibility that you might hear but it was no good i suspect it was the roar of the surf on the reef that drowned our voices but every time we saw you if you were not going alongside the wreck you were steering north so at length we came to the conclusion that you had probably rigged up some sort of a shelter in that direction and we accordingly agreed to work alongshore in a northerly direction and try to find out where you had bestowed yourselves to you sailing along easily and comfortably in your boat i dare say it would seem no very arduous job to work your way along a few miles of open beach but to us two circumstanced as we were in a place swarming with savage brutes that seemed to be for ever lurking on the watch for us without the means of kindling a fire as a protection and with only our sheathknives as weapons obliged to enter the woods at the peril of our lives to obtain foodand as often as not driven out again without the food able to sleep only during the daytimeand very often not even then compelled to seek shelter in trees for hours at a timeay and often enough for a whole dayto save our lives it was simply well there are no words strong enough to describe it why there were daysplenty of themwhen we did not make so much as a mile of progress when from one cause or another we did not make a fathom much less a mile no wonder that we were so long a time working our way round to you indeed now that i look back upon the innumerable difficulties that we had to contend with my only surprise is that we ever managed to get here at all then as an appropriate climax of all our difficulties the forest one day caught fireperhaps you saw the blazeand almost the whole of the island was swept clean of every green thing phew that was an experience with a vengeance if i had not beheld the scene with my own eyes i could never have believed there were so many wild creatures in all the world as we then saw great fierce monkeys bigger than a man little monkeys in thousands leopards wild pigs as savage as lions deer of all sorts and sizes and creatures the like of which we had never seen or heard of beforethey all came swarming down to the beach to escape the flames anda very curious circumstance i thought it they were all so thoroughly terrified that none of them interfered with the others or with us but all stood huddled together by the waters edge bleating squealing roaring howlingno i cannot attempt to describe it it is the kind of thing that has to be seen to be understood naturally we all edged away as far as we could from the flames and the flying sparks and eventually it began to dawn upon us allbeasts as well as menthat the extreme north end of the island might possibly be spared and we all with one accord set off in that direction and for a little whiletwentyfour hours or thereaboutwe men did very well the creatures all stood huddled together trembling and making queer moaning noises too terrified to take notice of anybody or anything and when we needed food all that was necessary was to lay hold of a deer haul him out of the crowd and cut his throatand there was all the food we required but that condition of affairs was of course quite temporary no sooner had the fire burned itself out than the creatures recovered their courage and turned upon each other likewell like wild beasts dirk and i quickly recognised that the north end of the island was too perilous a place for us there was therefore nothing for us but to escape from our dangerous neighbours while we could and this could only be done by bearing away south again which we did there was no cause for further fear of wild beasts as we pursued our journey southward there was not a living thing to be seen anywhere ashore even the birds had all vanished that condition of affairs was of course all in our favour so far as it went but the unfortunate part of it was that the fruit was also destroyed so that while we could now rest undisturbed at night our only food consisted of such raw shell fish as we could find at the margin of the beach and we could find no fresh water wherewith to quench our thirst for two days and nights we were in that predicament our thirst being terrible and the only relief we could obtainand it was very partial was to enter the sea and lie down in it for about ten minutes allowing the ripples to wash over us and taking care not to go far enough in to give the sharks a chance to get at us then when we felt sufficiently relieved we staggered along for a few yards repeating the process about thirty or forty times a day at length however we found a stream of fresh water and camped beside it but so terrible had been our suffering from thirst that having at length found fresh water we could not summon the courage to leave it again one day however as we were seeking shellfish on the beach near the mouth of the stream dirk suddenly remarked olaf my son just run your eye along the ridge of that hill yonder and tell me what you see i did so and presently saw what had attracted his attention there was a little patch of green that looked as though it might be trees while all below it was black where the fire had been it certainly looks very like a clump of trees said i and where there are trees there will also probably be fruit let us take a walk up there and investigate and what about leaving this fresh water asked dirk no need to do that said i the stream comes down from that direction and we can probably follow it for a good part of the way surely it is worth while to risk it so we started following the course of the stream until we had arrived very near to our destination and when that was reached we found it to be a nice little patch of forest rising to the top of the hill and dipping down on the other side of it for a distance of about two miles and the reason why it had not been burnt with the rest was because it stood on the lee side of a lake big enough to cut off the flames from that little patch there were plenty of birds there and when we proceeded to investigate we soon found that there were animals alsosmall monkeys creatures very like hares but with short ears a few deer but nothing dangerous so far as we could discover and there was an abundance of fruit of several kinds also we therefore quickly determined to settle down there and rest a bit before going any farther there was a great patch of reeds along the western end of the lake and here thousands of wild duck used to settle every night and we soon found that it was an easy matter to get a few by simply waiting for them among the reeds and catching them as they swam past we built ourselves a hut of wattles thatched with palm leaves that kept us dry and comfortable when it rained so happy and easy in our minds were we that we almost forgot your existence and when we happened to remember we used to say to each other never mind we are every bit as comfortable as they are we will stop on here a bit longer and so we did deferring our departure day after day and week after week until finally the ducks grew shy of us and the other creatures seemed to recognise our traps and avoid them so that at length a time came when we were pretty hard put to it to make a living then too we began to feel lonesome and to get snappy and shorttempered with each other to dream and think and talk about home and its comforts until we grew thoroughly dissatisfied with the life we were living and one day after we had had one of our now frequent quarrels i said to dirk look here mate we appear to have quite forgotten those other two do you think that a man of brains like mr blackburn is going to settle down and be satisfied to pass the remainder of his life among a group of desert islands like these because if you do i dont just consider the facts there is he and the boy and you may safely bet that whatever else they may have done or left undone they will have taken care to save the treasure that we found aboard that old galleon and what good will it do them so long as they remain here no good at all therefore i think we may take it for granted that he will set his wits to work to get away from here by hook or by crook taking the treasure with them and then where do we come in and what becomes of our share of it let us cut adrift from this spotwhich anyhow is of no further use to usand join them and when they go we will go with them and take our share of the treasure dirk quite saw the force of my reasoning and eagerly agreed to my proposal so we made a start there and then andand here we are chapter seventeen is trouble brewing exactly i concurred here you are but how did you know where billy and i had located ourselves and how did you contrive to make your way here from the southern end of west island west islandis that the name of the place oh we managed pretty well returned svorenssen from the ridge of the hill where the forest was all burned away we were able to get a very fair idea of the geography of the group in general we counted six islands in addition to the one we were already on and we observed that the one to the eastward of us was like our own fireswept also that at one point it was separated from our island by a channel only about half a mile wide to the northward of that island we saw another with small groups of trees dotted about here and there upon it while the remainder of its surface appeared to be covered with cornfields or something similar so it is not to be wondered at if we jumped to the conclusion that we should find you established there so we made a start by heading for the narrowest part of the channel between our own island and the next one carrying with us as much fruit as we could handle for we knew not when or where we should find more upon reaching the channel the question that confronted us was how were we going to get across we could see but one way and that was to swim it but what about sharks we had already lost one of our number through them and we had no desire that a similar fate should befall either of us therefore we camped alongside that channel two days and while one of us foraged for food the other just sat and intently watched the water and when the evening of the second day arrived without disclosing any sign of sharks in the channel we agreed to risk the passage so we stripped off our clothesor what remained of them made them into a bundle secured them upon our heads and waded in we got across safely and were lucky enough to land just where a little stream of fresh water came down from the hill that rose in the middle of the island we camped alongside the stream that night and made our supper of melons and groundnuts that had grown since the passage of the fire over the land on the following day we proceeded inland following the course of the stream and heading toward the top of the hill from which we hoped to obtain a little further knowledge of the geography of the group and also it might be some more definite information as to your own whereabouts and we were successful in both particulars for while we were on the top of that hill we saw your sailing boat coming round the eastern end of the island across the channel northward of us watching you we saw you land on that island stay there a while and then sail away again in a northeasterly direction upon seeing this dirk and i came to the conclusion that the proper thing for us to do would be to descend to the beach and there await your next appearance when we would signal you we had already detected a little stream flowing down the hillside and discharging into the channel quite near the spot where we decided to await your reappearance so we followed it down to the waters edge where we camped then that same evening your boat again hove in sight and we saw you land a party of niggers just opposite where we were watching having done which you again made sail to the northward and eastward which led us to the conclusion that after all you had not settled upon that cultivated islandas we had at first supposedbut somewhere else of course we showed ourselves upon the beach and hailed but the channel was too wide for our voices to carry across and probably you never looked in our direction so we failed to attract your attention but we knew now that you were still on the group and that we were on your track so we did not trouble overmuch then before your boat had passed out of sight and while we were still watching we saw a nigger paddling across the channel from the island you had touched at to the one that we were upon he was heading to land at a spot rather more than a mile to the eastward of where we were so we got back into the young growth that had sprung up after the fire and pushed along toward the spot for which he was making we arrived a few minutes before he did and crouching down we saw him haul up his tub of a canoe on the beach and make his way inland we allowed him to get well away from the beach and then we crept down to the canoe launched her and proceeded to paddle in the track of your boat it fell dark almost before we had got fairly under way but there was a fine moon so it did not greatly matter we paddled down the channel and across it to the point round which you had recently vanisheda good eight miles we reckoned it to beand hot work it was for two men who had been on short commons for more than a month but we forgot all about that when upon rounding the point we saw at a distance of not more than five or six miles a light and we knew that now you could not be very far away while we were in possession of the means to reach you but it was a tough job to get that little tub of the niggers along when once we had rounded the point for at once we felt the full strength of the easterly breeze and it and the popple it raised were together just as much as we could barely stem it must have taken us hours to get across that five or six miles of water and long before we landed you had put all lights out and turned in but there was the house plain enough to be seen in the bright moonlight so we headed straight for it and landed at last on the beach just below and what became of the punt that you stole from that unfortunate native i demanded why i reckon shes still there on the beach where we left her was the reply still there i exclaimed whyyesi suppose she is this must be looked to at once billy take this man van ryn with you and get him to show you where they left the punt then you and he will paddle her round to the cove here and make her fast astern of the sailing boat then get the sailing boat under way and van ryn will point out to you the spot on apes island from which he and svorenssen took her nod me misder dond you think id suddenly stormed the dutchman youre nod my schibber now and i dond dake orders from you or anybody else vere all equal now are we said i slipping my hand into my jacket pocket thats where you are making a big mistake my man i mean to be just as much skipper here as i was aboard the yorkshire lass and if you men wish to share in the comforts of life that i am able to give you and to go home with me when i go you will have to submit to discipline and obey my orders ah vell see about dot interrupted van ryn springing to his feet olaf mine zon haf ve comed all dis vay from over yonder to be ordered about mit dis man lets show im dot ve means to do as ve likes here come on and whipping out the remains of his sheath knife he gathered himself together for a spring upon me with one eye on svorenssen meanwhile in full expectation that the latter would back him up but i was fully prepared there had been from the moment when i first encountered these two men early that morning a certain truculence of speech and demeanour that warned me against trusting them too implicitly and i had been on my guard with them all day so now as the dutchman sprang to his feet i sprang to mine and leaping back from them out of arms reach i whipped out the revolver that i had been carrying all day in my jacket pocket and shouted hands up both of you dont so much as think of trying conclusions with me for if either of you advance a single step i shootto kill i remember the reputation you two menand you especially van ryn earned for yourselves aboard the brigantine you were perpetually instigating trouble but dont for a moment imagine that you will be permitted to make trouble here for i simply wont have it at the first hint of anything of that sort ill hand you over to my friends the natives of yonder island and ask them to take charge of you indeed i believe it would only be an act of ordinary prudence to turn you over to them at once no no mister interposed svorenssen hurriedly dont think of it there aint goin to be any trouble i assure ye dont take any notice o what dirk says mister is barks always a lot worse n is bite he dont mean a half nor a quarter of what e sayssit down you thunderin fool and put away that knife of yours he continued turning suddenly upon the dutchman and forcing him back on the packing case upon which they had both been sitting and seating himself beside him then he leaned over his companion and began whispering hurriedly and excitedly in his ear stop that svorenssen i exclaimed if you have any advice to give that man speak it aloud so that i may hear if it is good advice there is no need to whisper it all right mister returned the finn i was only tellin him not to make a bloomin fool of hisself and now come on dirk and lets do what mr blackburn orders what e says is right hes skipper still and we mays well recernise it first as last you knows as well as i do that we cant do nothin without im come along billy thereupon the two men rose to their feet and proceeded to slouch along the shore in the direction of the spot where they had left the punt on second thoughts said i go you two men and bring the punt round here to the cove and billy and i will come out in the sailing boat to meet you svorenssen waved his hand to indicate that he understood and the two men continued on their way the finn i observed talking very earnestly to his companion as soon as they were out of sight billy and i walked down to the boat boarded her got under way and worked her round to the south beach off which we fell in with and took the punt in tow the breeze was blowing moderately fresh which enabled us to make the trip to apes island in a trifle over two hours at the end of which we found the unfortunate native squatted on his haunches anxiously awaiting deliverance from the former haunt of his enemies where i perceived the young vegetation was already flourishing vigorously we at once took the man aboard where during our passage across to cliff island i explained to him as best i could the episode of the stolen puntto the amazement of the two seaman who seemed to regard as wonderful the fact that in the course of a year i had acquired a fairly fluent command of the natives language i observed with satisfaction that when bowata and a considerable company of the natives came down to the beach to greet us upon seeing our boat heading for the landingplace the two seamen looked more than a trifle uneasy fearing perhaps that i would seize the opportunity to fulfil my threat to hand them over to the charge of the blacks and i was not sorry to let them see thus early what a powerful force of auxiliaries i had behind me should they be meditating anything in the nature of an undue assertion of independence i designedly directed the particular attention of bowata and his followers to my new companions explaining who and what they were but of course the shellbacks understood nothing of what i was saying and they made little or no attempt to conceal their relief when i at length bade farewell to the blacks and we made sail again upon our return to eden on the following morning i resumed work upon the cutter and i thought that van ryn and svorenssen looked somewhat disconcerted when in accordance with my arrangement with bowata a party of ten sturdy natives arrived at the shipyard about am in the chinese boat i had given them to lend us a hand as and when required but the two seamen turned to without demur and i soon had reason to congratulate myself upon my acquisition of them for while svorenssen revealed an almost professional skill in the use of carpenters tools the dutchman explained that if i would cut out the cutters sails he would undertake to make them to my entire satisfaction both men did much more and far better work than i in the least anticipated and when at length we knocked off work for the day and i surveyed the result of that one days work i felt that i might now at last begin to calculate with some approach to accuracy the date at which our labours might be expected to come to a successful conclusion two days later van ryn who was working at the new sails under the shade of a tree at some distance from the shipyardrequested that if possible i would spare billy to assist him and as the request seemed reasonable i acceded to it without demur thereafter matters went so smoothly for a fortnight or more that in my satisfaction at the progress we were making i almost forgot the suspicions which the attitude and utterances of the two seamen had aroused when they so unexpectedly reappeared upon the scene with their assistance work upon the cutter had progressed so speedily that the planking of her was completed the laying of her deck about half done her mast and bowsprit finished and her mainsail and gafftopsail sewn and in process of roping i therefore estimated that another month would see my ambitious project complete and possibly ourselves at sea but my complacency was somewhat disturbed when on a certain evening i was instructing billy in the problem of the reduction of the suns altitude to the meridian i had concluded my explanation of the problem when the boy glancing up at me with a smile remarked that chap van ryn is awfully inquisitive mr blackburn he was chaffing me today upon the difference in my manner of speaking now from what it was when he first knew me and i said yes i had to thank you for it for you had insisted i should study and improve my education every evening since we had been cast away then he wanted to know all about what you had taught me and how much i knew and i told him that you had been teaching me arithmetic geometry algebra trigonometry geography and navigation and that last word surprised him i can tell you it was amusing to see how interested he at once became he wanted to know just how much i knew about navigation and he would hardly believe me when i told him that i knew enough to enable me to determine a ships position day or night provided that the sky was clear and i could get a sight of certain heavenly bodies but when i insisted that i could do all i had said he seemed no end pleased ah he said i must tell svorenssen what you say he will be glad to hear it it was only a few nights ago that we were talking about the time when we should leave these islands and saying what a fix we should all be in if mr blackburn should meet with another accident or fall ill while we were at sea and so you really believe billy that if such a thing should happen you could navigate the cutter i said i was quite sure i could and then the conversation dropped but he kept harking back to it time after time showing that he was still thinking about it yes said i i can quite believe it and i can understand too his amazement at your assurance that youa mere boycould if put to it navigate the cutter or any other craft for that matter there is probably not one boy in ten thousand of your age billy who could truthfully claim such ability but two circumstances have been in your favour in the first place you are naturally a sharp intelligent lad with a strong predilection for study and in the next place there was little else for you to do on this group but learn until we started to build the cutter now billy what you have told me relative to van ryns inquisitiveness and his crossquestioning of you has greatly interested me for a reason which i will explain later on therefore while i am not as a rule inquisitive i will ask you to make a point of reporting to me the substance of any further conversations which the man may hold with you and to take very particular notice of any questions he may ask you and now let us return to the consideration of our nautical problem at the moment it seemed strange that billys story should so powerfully have affected me but the fact remains that it did after we had turned in that night i lay restlessly tossing upon my bed wonderingwondering whether van ryns questioning of billy was the natural result of pure unadulterated inquisitiveness or whether it had a deeper significance the conversation appeared to have arisen naturally enough i could not detect in the relation of it any indication of a deliberate attempt on the part of the man to lead up to the subject of billys educational acquirements what reason indeed could he have for doing so apart from the lads more refined mode of speech the matter that most powerfully exercised me was the dutchmans eager curiosity to discover the full extent of billys qualifications as a navigator yet even as to this there seemed little enough reason for uneasiness the man had given a quite plausible reason for such curiosity a reason that i could perfectly understand and appreciate but i wondered whether it was the true the actual reason or was there another and more sinister one at the back of his evil mind in any case what i wondered could have put the thought in the dutchmans head that something might possibly happen to me while we were at sea certainly the experience had already befallen him once since the commencement of the voyage but with men of such limited intelligence as that of van ryn and svorenssen even such an experience as that usually makes so very transitory an impression that it soon fades moreover the difficulty had been surmounted and they would naturally believe that should it again arise it could again be surmounted in the same way the only reason that i could think of why such an idea should have taken so strong a hold upon the dutchmans mind was that under certain circumstances the eventuality of which he had spoken might be very much more than possible it might be inevitable reasoning thus i next asked myself the question should anything happen to meshould i for instance die either aboard the cutter or before leaving the islandshow would my death affect the fortunes of those two men svorenssen and van ryn to say nothing of that of billy and why should it be desired to get rid of me those were not difficult questions to answer in either of the above hypothetical cases the boy would be absolutely in the power and at the mercy of the two men and i shuddered to think of what would happen to him with me out of the way svorenssen and van ryn were both big powerful men and should they resort to violence what could a boy do by way of resisting them then the cutter was now so far advanced that at a pinch the two seamen could complete her launch her and make her ready for sea without my assistance their escape from the group was therefore in any case assured while so far as the navigation of the craft was concerned they had already wormed out of billy the information that he was competent to undertake that but if the two seamen were actually conspiring against me as i now began to think was at least probable their primary object would doubtless be to secure the whole of the treasure for themselves they doubtless recognised that so long as ia man as powerful as either of them with a mind already tinctured with suspicion of themlived to attempt to secure more than their fair share of the treasure might be both difficult and dangerous and possibly even result in failure but with me effectually disposed of the enterprise would wear a totally different aspect they would complete the cutter sail away in her with the treasure on board and billy as navigator willing or unwilling and upon arriving within sight of their destination they would murder the poor boy and the rest would be easyor so they would probably believe yes knowing the men so well as i did i felt that there was ground for suspicion of them and i resolved that without appearing to do so i would henceforth keep a wary eye upon them both and be constantly day and night on my guard against any act of treachery on their part now it was not often that billy did anything foolish but boys will always be boys to the end of time i expect and about a week after the lads conversation with me on the subject of van ryns inquisitiveness the spirit of mischief suddenly seized him and just for a lark as he subsequently admitted to me he must needs leave the dutchman upon some pretence run up to the house and then pay us a visit at the shipyard bringing kit with him on a leash that he might enjoy the consternation of the natives at the sight of the leopard it was fortunate that i spotted the pair when i did for the beast was already beyond billys control and dragging the lad helplessly after him with the evident determination to interview the strangers more closely the animal although not yet fully grown had developed into a magnificent specimen of his kind as big as a mastiff and about twice as powerful to hold him when i hurriedly relieved billy of his charge taxed my strength to such an extent that i was obliged to shout to the workers to quit work and get into hiding at a safe distance but even so the scent of the men excited kit to such an extent that it was only with the utmost difficulty i was able to drag him back to the bungalow and safely lash him up i was therefore not very greatly surprised when after work was over that evening svorenssen approached me and said see here mister did ye happen to salve the arms chest from the wreck before she washed off the reef and foundered yes i said what about it why just this he blustered me and dirk wants a brace of revolvers cartridges and a cutlash apiece out of that chest thats what about it really said i a very modest request very modestly put is it permissible to ask why you want those things and in what way you purpose to use them oh yes certnly was the reply theres no objections to you astin as many questions as you bloomin well likes we wants em to purtect ourselves again that snarlin savage leopard o yours it aint safe to be on the same hisland with the brute he will not interfere with you or molest you in any way if you give him a wide berth i retorted as to giving you the weapons you demand i wont do it so thats flat you wont eh returned the finn glowering at me savagely then all i can say mister is that me and dirk ll have to see what can be done about purtectin ourselves i for one aint goin to take the risk of bein tore to pieces no not for another day and so i gives you warnin now see here svorenssen said i i can make allowanceand dofor your very natural fear of the leopard but as i have already told you the animal will not hurt either of you men if you keep clear of him and dont let me hear any more of such talk as you have been indulging in during the last few minutes you forget yourself my man and you seem to forget also that you came to this island of your own free will i did not invite you i did not even want you i was doing quite well without your assistance as i can again if necessary so let me have no more threats of any sort or i shall be compelled for peace and quietness sake to request my friend bowata and his people to take charge of you this is not the first time that you have obliged me to say this i shall not again repeat it let there be no more bickering between us the cutter is very nearly completed and please god we shall soon be at sea in her and on our way back to civilisation and home the man stared at me for several seconds with i thought murder in his eyes then he turned away remarking all right mister youre top dog now and what you says goes but i affected not to catch that final word but proceeded to indicate to the natives the several jobs upon which i wished them to employ themselves on the morrow but what i wondered was the explanation of this fresh outburst of turbulence on svorenssens partfor fresh it was only once before had he displayed such insolence of manner to me and i wondered whether perchance it had any connection with the suspicions that had been bred in my mind by billys report of the dutchmans recent conversation with him but i argued those suspicions might be wholly unfounded and be the result of a certain unsuspected mental disorder brought about by the long series of unusual experiences through which i had passed beginning with the destruction of the saturn in any case whether my suspicions were well founded or otherwise there could be no disputing the fact that the two seamen were turbulent unruly violent characters liable at any moment to become dangerous and therefore they must be carefully watched as for voluntarily furnishing them with weapons and so rendering them ten times more dangerous than they already were if svorenssen really imagined i would do such a thing he must surely have set me down for a fool from this time forward without appearing to do so i maintained a close watch upon both men noting and weighing their every word and endeavouring to deduce from their general conduct and especially from their demeanour toward myself whether or not they were really hatching a plot against me but for rather more than a week i was unable to detect anything to justify the least apprehension on my part of course it was impossible for me to observe the pair when they were alone together after the days work was done but although svorenssen maintained his usual surly demeanour i attached little importance to that for i believed it to be natural to him while there was no doubt that both men were working steadily and well chapter eighteen a tragic end to our troubles on a certain evening some eight or ten days after that outburst on the part of the finn in connection with his demand for weapons billy remarked to me apropos of nothing in particular as we sat together studying as usual that dutchman is a queer chap and no mistake mr blackburn he will sit for hours saying never a word but billy pass me that or billy take hold of this and then all of a sudden hell begin to chatter like a parrot really said i and what does he chatter about oh all sorts of things answered billy chiefly about what he and svorenssen went through before they joined us here and he likes to hear how we managed too before we settled down on eden do you know im beginning to think hes not such a bad sort of chap after all he seems to admire you immensely does he indeed i commented dryly in what particular way does he reveal his admiration well said billy he thinks you are perfectly wonderful every way wonderfully clever as a navigator you know clever to have been able to build the sailing boat still more clever to have designed and very nearly built such a beautiful craft as the cutter and most clever of all to have built this bungalow he said that he could understand that a clever sailor like you might be able to build a boat but he could not understand how any sailoreven youcould build such a fine house he wanted to know how long it took us to build it and how we set about it whether you invented it as we went on or whether you drew it out on paper beforehand and when i said that you had drawn it all out before we began to build he said that hed dearly like to see the drawing because it would give him some wrinkles if he should ever again be shipwrecked and what did you say to that i asked well said billy you see i thought it was perhaps his roundabout way of asking me to show him the plan so i said i didnt know where it was that i rather thought you had destroyed it and when i said that the poor chap looked so disappointed that i showed him what it was like by sketching it out on the ground with the point of a sail needle that is very interesting i said here is paper and a pencil just reproduce on it as nearly as you can the sketch you made on the ground the boy took the pencil and paper and in a few minutes completed a rough but quite accurate plan of the bungalow showing the relative positions of the several rooms in the front and rear portions of the house i observed also that he indicated with scrupulous fidelity the position of every window and door showing the possibility of passing from any one room to any other through the passages and the living room this sketch does you credit i said it gives an excellent idea of the general arrangement of the house but i really do not see how the information it affords is in the least degree likely to be of use to van ryn even should he be shipwrecked a dozen times over to speak quite frankly i would very much rather that you had not made that sketch on the ground for his information do you think he understood it no confessed billy i dont believe he did for he asked all sorts of silly questions about it that he wouldnt have asked if he had understood the plan ah indeed said i do you happen to remember any of those questions no i dont think i do replied billy they were so awfully stupid that i didnt pay much attention to them i explained that those markspointing to the drawingrepresented doors yet the silly ass couldnt understand how the servants got from their room to the kitchen nor how they brought our meals from the kitchen to the livingroom without going outside and walking round the house and he couldnt understand how you and i got from our rooms to the livingroom without going outside thats too bad said i it seems to reflect upon your powers of description doesnt it billy it does rather admitted the boy yet i did my best to make him understand but he didnt seem able to grasp that we were supposed to be looking down upon the bungalow with the roof off he persisted in thinking that we were looking square at it and that the rooms in the rear were above those in the front of the house stupid fellow i commented and was the house the only thing he manifested curiosity about oh no answered billy there were lots of other things he asked about he wanted to know where we got kit from and how it is that he is so tame with us and so savage with everybody else he asked if we werent afraid that some day he would turn upon us and do us an injury he said that if he was boss hed shoot the beast right away and he grumbled a bit because you wouldnt give him and svorenssen any firearms to defend themselves with not only from the leopard but also from the natives whom he said he didnt trust a little bit and who might come across any night and massacre us all in our sleep then he wanted to know how we are going to get the cutter into the water when she is ready for launching and thenlet me seeoh yes we got on about the natives againand the apes he said it was all very well for us who could bolt ourselves securely in the house at night but what about him and svorenssen if an ape should come across and surprise them in their tent some night how were they to defend themselves without weapons of any kind i laughed at that and told him that there was so little likelihood of anything of that sort happening that we never closed our doors or windows except when it rained but he said that didnt matter we could defend ourselves if such a thing happened because we had plenty of arms and they ought to have some too he said that what with the leopard the apes and the savages life was none too safe for unarmed men like him and the finn did his terror seem quite real or do you think it was at all exaggerated i asked oh no asserted billy with conviction it was real enough and it wasnt exaggerated either he was in a regular funk you see he and svorenssen had a pretty bad time one way and another all the time they were on west island but it was the apes that frightened them worst of all yes i agreed i can quite understand that butas an idea suggested itself to medo you think van ryn suspects that you repeat these conversations of his to me no i dont think so answered the boy why should he i dont believe such a thought ever enters his head i did not feel by any means so sure of that as billy seemed to be if the man suspected that his remarks and questionings were repeated to me his assumption of extreme stupidity might be explained as designed to disarm any suspicion aroused in my mind by the queer character of some of his questions take those relating to the arrangement of the house for example the pretence that the information would be valuable to him should he ever again be cast away was altogether too puerile for consideration he required the informationand very cleverly extracted it from the unsuspecting billy toofor some entirely different reason but what was that reason i wondered i was not long kept wondering the second night after the aboverecorded conversation between billy and myself brought with it the threat of a change of weather it had been exceptionally hot all day with less wind than usual and there was a languorous quality in the atmosphere that seemed to portend thunder a portent that was strengthened toward nightfall when the wind died away to the merest zephyr while a great bank of heavy lowering cloud piled itself up slowly along the eastern horizon so that the rising full moon had no chance to show herself as the evening progressed what little air of wind there was died completely away and we were left with all doors and windows flung wide open gasping for breath and sweltering as in a turkish bath i endured it as long as i could and then tossing aside the book i was attempting to read announced my determination to go down to the cove and have a swim billy declared that he would like a swim too if he could take a header off the veranda into deep water but as to walking down to the cove in that heatno much as he would enjoy a dip he wasnt prepared to undergo that amount of exertion to get it as the gathering storm seemed unlikely to break suddenly i did not unduly hurry over my dip but remained in the water about an hour emerging at last delightfully cool and quite ready for bed upon my return to the house i found billy still up and poring over a book but he confessed to feeling sleepy upon which i ordered the boy off to bed forthwith and extinguishing the lamp in the livingroom retired to my own apartment and straightway turned in being quickly lulled to sleep by the sound of pouring rain that began just as i stretched myself upon my bed it seemed as though i had only just fallen asleep when i awoke with startling suddenness the rain was pelting down on the roof in torrents making quite noise enough to account for my sudden awakening through which i could just hear poor kit whining and fidgeting restlessly under the veranda outside my french window imagining that it was these combined sounds that had awakened me i rose thinking i must fetch that animal indoors i expect the poor beggar is getting pretty wet hence his restlessness one of the doors of my room opened into the livingroom while the other gave on to the veranda both of them being wide open as i passed through the latter a vivid flash of lightning revealed the rain coming straight down in sheets and rebounding in glittering spray off the already streaming earth with kit straining at his leash which billy had made fast as usual to one of the veranda posts the beast had withdrawn himself as far under the veranda as his leash would permit and he did not appear to be very wet but he seemed anxious to enjoy the more complete shelter of the livingroom so i stepped out and cast him adrift to my amazement the instant that i released him from his leash he tore himself away from my hold upon his collar and with a savage snarl bounded through the livingroom door the next instant there issued from the interior of the room a yell of consternation immediately followed by a shriek of terror the fall of a heavy body on the floor screams execrations and the dreadful sound of kit worrying somebody or something and before i could draw another breath the figure of a yelling screaming frantic man dashed from the room cleared the veranda steps at a bound landed heavily on the ground some five feet below and still screaming disappeared through the curtain of pouring rain but the sounds from the livingroom still continued with increasing violence augmented now by cries from billy whose form i dimly descried outlined against the dark background of the open door and a perception of what had happened and was still happening leapt to my brain with sudden enlightenment bring a light billy quick i shouted as i sprang through into the livingroom and instinctively avoiding the table that stood in the middle of the room flung myself upon the struggling group on the floor my hands at once came into contact with kits hairy hide and slid along it until they closed upon the collar round his neck when exerting all my strength i dragged the beast still savagely snarling and resisting off the writhing and groaning form at my feet somehow to this day i know not howi managed to drag the fiercely struggling creature out of the room and back to the veranda where i securely tied him up again then i returned to the livingroom as billy entered it with a lighted lamp i took the lamp from him and said light the lamp in my room boy and then lend me a hand to put this man on my bed i next turned to the writhing groaning figure on the floor and saw that as i had already surmised it was that ofsvorenssen he was dressed only in shirt and trousers both of which rainsodden and drenched with blood were torn to rags by the teeth and claws of the leopard which was still raving outside and doing his utmost to break adrift from his moorings the mans injuries especially about the throat shoulders arms and chest were shocking and i felt that with the limited appliances at our command there was but very small hope of saving his life he still grasped in his right hand a formidable bludgeon and a similar weapon lay on the floor near him i had only time to take in these details when billy returned and between us we contrived to half carry half drag the writhing and groaning finn into my room and deposit him on my bed i then sent billy to the natives room the occupants of which had been roused by the disturbance bidding him set them to work providing warm water and such other matters as i thought i might require guided by the book of instructions attached to the medicinechest i did the best i could for the injured man but his wounds were of so ghastly a nature and his suffering so acute that i recognised from the very outset not only that it was impossible he should recover but that death must ensue in a very few hours and it was dreadful to sit there by his side listening to his moans liberally interspersed with curses of the leopard of me and not infrequently of mankind in general and to reflect that that flood of blasphemy was issuing from the lips of a man hovering on the brink of eternity at length i could endure it no longer and i said to him rather sharply i am afraid stop that blasphemy svorenssen for pitys sake and rather turn your thoughts to prayerif you know how to pray i fear that your life has been a deplorably misspent one and it can last but a few hours longer before tomorrows sun sets you will be face to face with god therefore i urge you to devote the few remaining hours at your disposal to making your peace with him instead of cursing those who have never knowingly wronged you whatdyemean he gaspingly demanded iaint gointodieam i yes i said you are and it is well that you should know it therefore forget all your wrongs real or imaginary and but here i was interrupted by an outburst of such vile and savage profanity that it literally rendered me speechless it lasted i suppose fully ten minutes and left its utterer gasping and in a state of collapse i administered stimulant and at length the colour came slowly back to the sufferers cheeks and lips and he opened his eyes for several minutes he lay there gazing up at me steadfastly questioningly then he muttered thank e mister if it hadnt been for you id have slipped my cable that time and so you think im goin to die well im beginnin to think so myself now my god its awful to think that a few hours more and i shall be face to face with my maker and bein called to account for a whole lifetime of wickedness and theres no way out oh but there is i said eagerly and thereupon i began to expound with all the earnestness at my command and as lucidly as i could the wonderful story of mans redemption i got my bible and read passage after passage suited to the dying mans needs until the expression of terror and anxiety gradually faded from his features and ultimately his eyes closed and he seemed to fall asleep then the day dawned and billy entering softly took my place as watcher while i snatched a brief hour or two of sleep on his bed i was aroused by the clatter of crockery in the livingroom where the native women were making ready to serve breakfastfor even when the shadow of death hovers over a house its inmates must needs eat and drink and then one of the natives who every day came over to help with the work on the cutter brought the news that the sailing boat had disappeared the inference being that van ryn had taken her nevertheless i gave orders that eden should be thoroughly searched for him but he was never found nor was the boat and that was the end of him so far as we were concerned for we never again heard of him when breakfast was ready i tiptoed to the door of my bedroom and beckoned billy who crept softly out closing the door behind him he is asleep again now the boy whispered but he is dying in peace and he wants to see you mr blackburn before he passes away that he may repeat to you the terrible confession that he has made to me we took breakfast in silence for our minds were full of thoughts too deep for utterance and when we had finished i resumed my post beside the dying mans bed svorenssen was still asleepthe sleep of utter exhaustion but he was very uneasy and moaning occasionally about half an hour later however he awoke and after i had again given him a stimulant he stammered and gasped the confession he desired to make there is no need to repeat it here word for word in substance it was to the effect that van ryn had proposed and he had agreed that they two obtaining entry through the back of the house should murder mein my sleep if possiblearm themselves from the arms chest and thereafter impose their will upon poor billy the cutter was to be completed and launched the treasure shipped aboard her and the conspirators with billy as forced navigator were to make their way to some civilised port arrived in sight of which billy was to be knocked on the head and hove overboardexactly as i had suspectedwhile the two men were to divide the treasure equally between them it was a dreadful confession for a man to make and i found it bitterly hard to utter the words of forgiveness that were so piteously pleaded for but i forced myself to do so at last and shortly after noon of that day the man happy now and i believe at peace with his maker passed away we buried his body an hour or two later with the death of one and the disappearance of the other of the two men who had come into our lives only to act as a disturbing element from almost the first moment of our acquaintance with them all my worries and anxieties passed away like the memory of an evil dream and upon the day following that of svorenssens death i turned with renewed zest to the completion of the cutter the hull was by this time practically finished her deck was laid her companion and tiny selfemptying cockpit completed and all that was now needed was to run a low bulwark around her rig and step the completed mast and bowsprit bend the sails ballast and launch her get the stores water and treasure aboard and up anchor and away taken as it stands that list of work still remaining to be done looks simple enough yet it took me a full month to complete it for the greater part of it was of so technical a character that the natives were of little assistance to me and i had to do most of it with my own hands also i found that van ryn had by no means completed the task he had undertaken to perform the two topsailssquareheader and jib headerstill needed roping as did the jib and that work cost me several days labour to complete to my satisfaction then there were the launching ways and the cradle to be built and this task taxed my ingenuity to its utmost limit but at length all was done except the actual launching of the boat the finishing touches to my final preparations were completed too late in the afternoon for us to do anything more that day immediately after breakfast on the following morning therefore billy and i climbed aboard the cutter hoisted the yorkshire lasss ensign to her topmast head suspended a bottle of wineone of the very few that we had left from her stem head and then leaving billy aboard i descended to the ground removing the ladder by which we had ascended the wedgingup having already been accomplished i next took a maul and shouting to billy to stand by proceeded to knock away the spur shores there was now a moments hesitation on the part of the cutter of which i took advantage to jump clear and then she began to move slowly at first but with rapidly increasing velocity while i dashed the bottle of wine against the crafts cutwater and named her the dolphin in accordance with billys earnestly expressed wish two seconds later the craft took the water plunging deeply with the foam brimming to her taffrail then rising buoyantly she shot far out toward the middle of the cove until in obedience to my hail billy let go her anchor and brought her up i then saw that i had underestimated the amount of ballast required and that she needed about half a ton more and a slight readjustment of it to put her in correct trim that however was an error that could be easily rectified and meanwhile i was highly gratified by the graceful appearance she presented now that she was afloat next in order came a cold collation that i had caused to be prepared for the delectation of bowata and his petty chiefs the whole of whom i had invited over to eden to witness the launch andbilly having been brought ashore in the islanders boatwe forthwith fell to all hands doing full justice to the feast at its conclusion i formally presented the bungalow and all that we were leaving in it to bowata with a strict injunction to him and his to show the utmost kindness to any shipwrecked persons who might hereafter be so unfortunate as to be cast away on the group an injunction which they all promised to obey most faithfully then followed our mutual farewells to the accompaniment of much howling and weeping on the part of our black friends after which the remainder of the day was devoted to the completion of the ballasting of the cutter and its correct adjustment there was but one other duty now to be done before we started for home and that was the disposal of kit the leopard since the night when he so fearfully mauled svorenssen the nature of the beast had undergone a material change for the worse he had developed an uncertainty and ferocity of temper that rendered him distinctly unsafe and altogether unsuitable as a pet for anyone with grief and many tears poor billy was obliged to admit that such was the case therefore it was at length agreed that he should be transported to west island where he could hurt no one and where he would find ample prey for his sustenance accordingly on the following morning we weighed anchor and bade a final goodbye to our pacific eden sailing through the east and north island channels to west island where without mishap we landed kit and turned him adrift to shift for himself not by any means without regret for the beast had stood us in good stead on one memorable occasion then sailing up northwest channel we entered the lagoon and heading to the northward passed through the wide gap in the reef abreast of shark bay and once more found ourselves riding buoyantly on the long swell of the open pacific of course i had long ago given most careful consideration to the question of where i should steer for in the event of the cutters completion and after much study of the charts at my command i had decided to shape a course for sydney australia it meant a voyage of some two thousand three hundred and fifty miles across the open ocean in a tenton cutter but i felt sure the dolphin could do it especially as we should have the southeast trade wind and the prospect of reasonably fine weather with us nearly all the way accordingly as soon as we were fairly clear of the reef i bore up and headed away to the southward along the west side of the group of which we finally lost sight about an hour before sunset to say that our voyage was unadventurous would be untrue on the contrary we had many thrilling adventures and several hairbreadth escapes from destruction but lack of space forbids more than the bare mention of them here let it suffice to say that after a voyage packed with sufficiently exciting incidents we arrived safely in sydney harbour on the twentythird day after our departure from the group arrived there my first business was to negotiate with a firm of bankers for the exchange of some of the gold coinage which formed part of our treasure for a sufficient number of british sovereigns to carry both of us comfortably home and this done we set about providing ourselves with outfits suitable for the voyage it was of course impossible for us to keep our adventures entirely secret a hint of them somehow got abroad possibly from the people in the hotel at which we put up and the enterprising reporters of the sydney papers did the rest one result of which was that i soon got from a local yachtsman so advantageous an offer for the dolphin that i unhesitatingly accepted it we spent a very pleasant fortnight in sydney many of its leading citizens vying with each other to show us hospitality finally on a certain day in the month of april we both embarked for england in an orient liner which after a most delightful voyage landed us in london on a glorious day in the month of may

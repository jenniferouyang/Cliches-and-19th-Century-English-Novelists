overdue the story of a missing ship by harry collingwood another very wellwritten book by collingwood as he was a naval architect you can rely upon his descriptions of the deck and sails of a vessel of the mid nineteenth century the period of which he writes our hero the yearold midshipman of the salamis is suddenly given the job of going aboard and taking command of the mercury an emigrant ship that they find drifting in midocean all her officers having died in various accidents and the illiterate bosun and the ships carpenter knowing full well that they had no idea how to navigate he takes charge and all appears to be going well when but i will not spoil a good story for you full of events and seamens humour this books makes a good audiobook and you will enjoy it overdue the story of a missing ship by harry collingwood chapter one the mercury appears this is a yarn of the days when the clipper sailingship was at the zenith of her glory and renown when she was the recognised medium for the transport of passengersay and very frequently of mails between great britain and the colonies and when steamers were comparatively speaking rare objects on the high seas true a few of the great steamship lines such as the cunard and the peninsular and oriental were already in existence but their fleets were only just beginning to compete and with but a very limited measure of success against the superb specimens of marine architecture owned by the black ball and other famous lines of sailing clippers for the suez canal had not yet been dug andapart from the overland journeys to indiatravellers bound to the east were compelled to go southabout round the cape of good hope whether they journeyed by steamer or by sailingship and it was no very uncommon thing for the latter to beat the former on the passage to india china or australia moreover the marine steam engine was at that period a very expensive piece of machinery to operate developing only a very moderate amount of power upon an exceedingly heavy consumption of coal hence it was only the nabobs who could afford to indulge in the then costly luxury of ocean travel by steam the occurrence which i regard as the startingpoint of my extraordinary yarn happened on the th day of october in the year of grace the salamiswhich was the ship in which it originatedbeing at noon of that day in latitude degrees south and longitude degrees west or thereabout thirty days out from london on a voyage to melbourne the salamis i may explain was a fullrigged clipper ship of tons register classed a being one of the crack vessels of the celebrated gold star line outward bound to melbourne as i have said with a full complement of saloon and steerage passengers and a general cargo that while it filled her to the hatches was so largely composed of light merchandise that it only sank her in the water to her very finest sailing trim of which circumstance captain martin her commander was taking the fullest possible advantage by carrying on day and night in the hope of making a record passage i philip troubridge was one of her midshipmanapprentices of whom she carried six and i was seventeen years of age on the day when the occurrence happened which i have alluded to above and which i will now relate the salamis carried three mates chief second and third and the accident happened in the first watch when mr moore the second mate had charge of the deck the wind was out from about nornorwest and had been blowing very fresh all day notwithstanding which the ship was under all three royals and fore and main topgallant studdingsails her course being southeast there was a heavy and steep sea following the ship on her port quarter which not only made her motions exceedingly uneasy but also caused her to yaw wildly from time to time despite the utmost efforts of two men at the wheel to keep her true to her course it was during one of these wild sheers that the main topgallant studdingsailboom snapped short off by the boomiron and there was immediately a tremendous hullabaloo aloft of madly slatting canvas and threshing boom as the studdingsail flapped furiously in the freshening breeze momentarily threatening to spring the topgallant yard if indeed it did not whip the topgallantmast out of the ship then something fouled aloft rendering it impossible to take in the sail and the skipper being on deck and manifesting some impatience at what he conceived to be the clumsiness of the men who had gone up on the topsail yard mr moore the second mate sprang into the main rigging and went aloft to lend a hand just precisely what happened nobody ever knew one of the men aloft said that the broken boom in its wild threshing struck the mate and knocked him off the yard but be that as it may one thing certain is that the poor fellow suddenly went whirling down and without a cry fell into the boiling smother raised by the bow wave and was never seen again i happened to be on the poop at the moment and despite the darkness saw the falling body of the mate just as it flashed down into the water and guessed what had happened even before the thrilling cry of man overboard came pealing down from aloft i therefore made a dash for one of the lifebuoys that were stopped to the poop rail cut it adrift and hove it as nearly as i could guess at the spot where the mate had disappeared while one of the men on the forecastle anticipating the skippers order called all hands to shorten sail the whole ship was of course instantly in a tremendous commotion fore and aft the rest of the studdingsails were taken in as quickly as possible the royals and topgallantsails were clewed up a reef was taken in the topsails and the ship was brought to the wind and worked back as nearly as could be to the spot where the accident had happened and a boat was lowered although the skipper had displayed such nice judgment in determining the precise spot where the search should begin that the crew of the boat dispatched to search for the mate actually found and recovered the lifebuoy that i had thrown no sign of the lost man was ever discovered the assumption was that he had been stunned by the blow that had knocked him overboard and had sunk at once this occurrence cast a gloom over the ship for several days for poor moore was probably the most popular man in the ship highly esteemed by the passengers and as nearly beloved by the crew as one of the afterguard can ever reasonably hope to be the skipper in particular took the loss of this very promising officer deeply to heart not only because of the esteem in which he held him but also i fancy because he was worried by the conviction that the accident was very largely due to his own propensity to carry on rather too recklessly on the ninth day after this unfortunate occurrence and on our thirty ninth day out from london we found ourselves in the longitude of the cape of good hope and in latitude degrees minutes south with a whole gale of wind chasing us which blew us into latitude degrees south and longitude degrees east before it left us ten days later stark becalmed the calm however lasted but a few hours and was succeeded by a light northerly breeze under the impulse of which with all plain sail set the salamis could barely log six knots to the hour this lasted all night and all the next day but before that day had sped the second incident occurred that resulted in plumping me into the adventure which is the subject of this yarn the heavy sea which had been kicked up by the gale subsided with extraordinary rapidity and when i went on duty at eight bells eight oclock on this particular morning the weather was everything that the most fastidious person could possibly desire saving that the sun struck along the weather side of the deckwhen he squinted at us past the weather leach of the mainsail as the ship rolled gently to the heave of the swellwith a fierceness that threatened a roasting hot day what time he should have worked his way a point or two farther round to the norard the swell which lingered to remind us of the recent breeze was subsiding fast and the ocean presented one vast surface of long solemnsweeping undulations of the deepest purest sapphire gently ruffled by the breathing of the languid breeze and ablaze in the wake of the sun with a dazzle that brought tears to the eye that attempted to gaze upon it the ships morning toilet had been completed and the decks darkened by the sluicing to which they had been lavishly subjected by the acting second mate and his watch were drying fast and recovering their sandwhite colour in the process the brasswork freshly scoured and polished and the glass of the skylights shot out a thousand flashes of white fire where the suns rays searched out the glittering surfaces as the ship rolled the awning had already been spread upon the poop in readiness for the advent of those energetic occupants of the cuddy who made a point of promenading for half an hour in order to generate an appetite for breakfast the running gear had all been bowsed taut and neatly coiled down and the canvas from which the dew had already evaporated soared aloft toward the deep rich azure of the zenith in great gleaming milkwhite cloths of so soft so tender so ethereal an aspect that one would scarcely have been surprised to see the skysails dissolve in vapour and go drifting away to leeward upon the languid breeze the main deck was lively with the coming and going of the steerage passengers as they went to the galley to fetch their breakfast and there must have been between twenty and thirty children chasing each other fore and aft and dodging round their elders in their play filling the rich sweet morning air with the music of their voices there was a soft seething sound over the side as the ship slid gently along accompanied by a constant iridescent gleam and flash of the tiny bubbles that slipped along the bends and vanished at last in the smooth oillike wake with its tiny whirlpools and at frequent intervals a shoal of flyingfish would spark out from under the bows and go skimming and glittering away to port or starboard like a shower of brandnew silver dollars hove broadcast by the hand of old father neptune himself the cuddy breakfast was fairly under way and a great clattering of cups and saucers knives and forks and the hum of lively conversation accompanied by sundry savoury odours came floating up through the open skylights when the chief mates eye happened to be attracted toward a gasket streaming loose like an irish pennant from the fore topgallant yard and he sang out to one of the ordinary seamen to jump aloft and put it right the fellow made his way up the ratlines with extreme deliberationfor indeed a journey aloft in such scorching heat was no jokemade up the loose gasket and was in the very act of swinging himself off the yard when happening to be watching him i saw him suddenly pause and stiffen into an attitude of attention as holding on to the jackstay with one hand he flung the other up to his forehead and peered ahead under the sharp of it for a full minute he stood thus then twisting his body until he faced aft he hailed on deck there hillo answered the mate theres a biggish ship away out yonder sir reported the man under her three taupsls and fore topmast staysail and by the way that she comes to and falls off again id say that she was hoveto how far off is she demanded the mate bout a dozen mile i reckon sir answered the man um remarked the mate as much to himself as to me it seemed she is probably a whaler on the lookout for fish i believe they sometimes meet with rare streaks of luck just about here all right he added hailing the man aloft you can come down shortly afterward we made out the strangers upper spars from the deck and from the rapidity with which we raised them it soon became apparent that if she had really been hoveto when first seen she had soon filled away and was now standing in our direction by five bells she was hullup and while the skipper and mate were standing together eyeing her from the break of the poopthe latter with the ships telescope at his eyei saw the ensign of the stranger float out over her rail and go creeping up to her gaffend there goes her ensign sir i shouted to the mate who responded by remarking dryly yes i see it then turning to the skipper he said theres something wrong aboard that craft sir theyve just hoisted their ensign jack downward this it may be explained to the uninitiated is a signal of distress the dickens they have exclaimed the skipper just let me have a look at her mr bryce the mate handed over the telescope and the skipper raised it to his eye adjusting the focus to his sight ay you are quite right he agreed with his eye still peering through the tube the jacks downward right enough wonder whats wrong aboard of her her hull and spars seem to be all right and i dont see any water pouring from her scuppers as there would be if she had sprung a leak and the hands were working at the pumps well we shall soon know i suppose let our own ensign be hoisted in acknowledgment mr bryce ay ay sir answered the mate troubridgeto mejump aft and run our ensign up to the peak will ye i went aft to the flag locker drew out the big ensign bent it on to the halyards and ran it up to the gaffend where there was just wind enough to blow it out and make it distinguishable for what it was the news that the stranger in sight was flying a signal of distress soon spread among the passengers and in a few minutes every telescope in the cuddy was upon the poop and being eagerly focused upon the approaching vessel which had by this time revealed herself as a fullrigged ship of some tons measurement of wholesome motherly build but certainly not a whaler as could be seen by the model of the boats which she carried and by the absence of certain characteristics which proclaim the whaler and are apparent almost from the moment when she heaves into full view there was naturally a vast amount of speculation not only on the part of the skipper and mate but also among our passengers as to the precise character of her distress but probably not one of us came anywhere near guessing at its extraordinary nature approaching each other as the two vessels were it did not take us very long to close with the stranger and as we drew near to her it became apparent that her people were preparing to lower a boat at the proper moment therefore our mainyard was laid aback the stranger followed suit and a minute or two later the two craft came to a stand abreast of each other the stranger about a hundred fathoms to windward of us near enough indeed for us to read with the unaided eye the name mercury upon her headboards then one of her two port quarter boats was lowered and hauled to the gangway and with three men pulling and one in the sternsheets grasping the yoke lines she shoved off and pulled away towards us the mate hailing them to come to the lee gangway where a side ladder had been dropped over for their use her main deck was crowded with peoplemen and womenall hanging over the rail and staring at us with that idle curiosity which is so characteristic of the uneducated classes mr bryce at once unhesitatingly pronounced them to be emigrants an opinion which the skipper as unhesitatingly endorsed the men in the approaching boat were all forecastle hands the one steering having the appearance of being either the boatswain or the carpenter of the ship and this it was that gave meand no doubt the skipper and mate alsothe first specific hint of what was actually wrong aboard the stranger nothing however was said and presently when the boat came rounding under our stern captain martin and mr bryce descended to the main deck and awaited our visitors at the gangway our own steerage passengers who had crowded the lee rail to see the strange boat come alongside respectfully making way for them one only of the boats crewthe man in the sternsheetsventured to come on deck the other three staring up at the heads peering down at them from our rail without saying a word in reply to the multitude of questions that were fired into them beyond remarking that the bosun will tell your skipper all about it the boatswain of the mercuryfor such the newcomer proved to be passed through our gangway pulled off the knitted woollen cap which decorated his head and at once addressed himself to the skipper mornin sir he remarked my names polsonjames polson and im bosun of the mercury which ship you see hoveto yonderwith a flourish of his hand in the direction of the vessel named yes said the skipper enquiringly as the man paused apparently waiting to be questioned after this introduction of himself i see you have a signal of distress flying whats wrong with you well the fact is sir as weve lost our capn and both mates answered the man when the skipper struck in amazedly lost your captain and both mates how in the name of fortune did that happen well sir you see it was this way was the reply when wed been out about a weekwere from liverpool bound to sydney new south wales with a general cargo and two hundred emigrantsninetyseven days outwhen wed been out about a week or thereaboutsi aint certain to a day or two but its all wrote down in the logcapn somers were found dead in his bunk by the steward what took him in a cup o coffee every mornin at six bells and mr townsendthat were our chief mate he took command o the ship then nothin particlar happened until we was well this side o the line when one day when all hands of us was shortenin sail to a heavy squall as had bust upon us jim tarbutt a hordinary seaman comin down off the main topsl yard by way o the backstays lets go his hold and drops slap on top o mr townsend what happened to be standin underneath and instead of hurtin of hisself broke tother mans neck and killed him dead on the spot then continued polson regardless of the ejaculations of astonishment and commiseration evoked by the recital of this extraordinary accident then mr masterman what were originlly our second mate he up and took charge and navigated us to somewheres about where we are now but four nights ago come last nightyes thats right it were four nights agobout three bells in the middle watch while it were blowin hard from the westard and we were runnin under singlereefed topsails with a very heavy sea chasin of us the night bein dark and thick with rain somebody comes rushin out of the poop cabin yellin like mad and afore anybody could stop him sprang on to the lee rail just the fore side of the main riggin and takes a header overboard more exclamations of astonishment from the listeners amid which polson triumphantly concluded his gruesome narrative by adding of course we couldnt do nothin and so the poor feller were lost and when chips and i comed to investigate we found that the unfortunit man were mr masterman he bein the only one that was missin well ejaculated the skipper addressing himself to mr moore our chief mate ive heard a good many queer yarns in my time of maritime accident and disaster but this one tops the lot the captain and both mates lost in the same voyage and so far as the two last are concerned by such queer accidents too did youturning to polsonfind anything in mrwhats his namemastermans cabin to account for his extraordinary behaviour in rushing out on deck and jumping overboard in the middle of the night no sir answered polson with much simplicity hed been drinkin a goodish bit and there were a halfempty bottle of rum under his piller but aah ejaculated the skipper with a whole world of emphasis that may account for a good deal well what happened next oh nothin else havent happened thank god exclaimed the boatswain piously but aint that what ive already told ye quite enough sir whats made it so terrible awkard for all hands of us is that were now without a navigator and have lost our reckonin so after chips and i had confabulated a bit we comed to the conclusion that knowin as we was well in the track of ships bound to the eastard the best thing we could do was to heaveto and wait until somethin comed along that could spare us somebody to navigate the ship for us to sydney chips and i are men enough to take care of herto know when to make and when to shorten sailbut we dont know nothin about navigation ye see sir ay i see answered the skipper well i think you acted very wisely boatswain in heavingto i dont know that you could have done anything better under the circumstances but as to sparing an officer to navigate youi have had the misfortune to lose one of my own mates this voyage andhere his eye happened to fall on me and he considered me attentively for several seconds as though he felt he had seen me before somewhere and was trying to remember who i was then his countenance lit up as an idea seemed to strike him and he addressed me briskly what dye say troubridge youve heard this mans yarn and understand the fix that theyre in aboard the ship yonder you are a perfectly reliable navigator and a very fair seaman moreover the boatswain says that he and the carpenter are seamen enough to take care of the ship which i do not for a moment doubt do you feel inclined to undertake the job of navigating the mercury from here to sydney it ought to be a very good thing for you you know i have no doubt that the owners i did not wait for him to finish i knew enough to understand perfectly well what a splendid thing it would be for me from a professional point of view if i should succeed in safely navigating such a ship as the mercury to sydney and i had no shadow of doubt of my ability to do so i therefore cut in by eagerly expressing my readiness to undertake the task then that is all right remarked the skipper turning to polson he said this young gentleman is mr philip troubridge one of my midshipmanapprentices he has been with me for a matter of three years and he is as you just now heard me say an excellent navigator and a very good seaman i have not the least doubt that he will serve your purpose quite as well as anyone else that you are at all likely to pick up and if you care to have him i shall be pleased to spare him to you but that is the best that i can do for you as i told you a little while ago i have lost one of my mates say no more sir say no more interrupted polson your recommendations quite sufficient to satisfy me that mrer troubridgell do very well an since hes willin to come with us well have him most gratefully sir and with many thanks to you for sparin of him to us very well then that is settled exclaimed the skipper briskly then turning to me he said cut away at once troubridge and get your chest over the side as quickly as possible if you are smart you may get aboard your new ship in time to take an observation at noon and check your own reckoning by ours then as i rushed off to the afterhouse where we apprentices were berthed he turned to polson and proceeded to question him further relative to the extraordinary series of fatalities that had occurred on board the mercury chapter two the shadow of coming events it took me less than ten minutes to bundle my traps into the waiting boat alongside and then having already said goodbye to my shipmates in the apprentices berth i stepped up to the skipper and chief mate to say the same and to thank the former for giving me this splendid chance he was very kind in bidding me farewell told me i had given him every satisfaction while i had been with him gave me a few words of caution and advice and wound up by saying the boatswain here tells me that the chronometer aboard the mercury has unfortunately been allowed to run down when therefore you get aboard and have taken your meridian altitude you had better wind the chronometer and then set it to greenwich time which i will give you after which you should experience no difficulty in finding your way to sydney to which port i wish you a prosperous and pleasant voyage of course i quite reckon upon arriving two or three weeks ahead of you but unless you have an exceptionally protracted passage you ought to arrive in good time to return home with us unless therefore the mercurys agent in sydney wishes you to return to england in the ship you had better make your way to melbourne as soon as you have settled up and go back with us i thanked him for the kindly sendoff that he was giving me and then after a final shake of the hand followed polson down the side seated myself in the sternsheets andthe boatswain pulling stroke while the other three oarsmen shifted one thwart forwardshoved off the crew and passengers of the salamis giving me a little cheer to speed me on my way the cheer was at once vociferously responded to by the people crowding the mercurys rail no doubt they were greatly relieved at the thought that there was to be no more aimless drifting about the ocean for them but that at last they were to find themselves again heading intelligently toward their port of destination by the time that i had arrived alongside the mercury and mounted to her deck it was getting so close toward noon that i had only barely time enough to get my traps out of the boat before the moment arrived when i must get to work with my sextant to secure the suns meridian altitude from which to deduce the ships latitude then there was an even more important job to be done namely to start and set the chronometer therefore as soon as i had secured my meridian altitude and made it noon aboard the mercury we wore ship and coming up alongside the salamisthat lay patiently waiting for us with her main topsail abackobtained the correct greenwich time and set our chronometer to it this done captain martin swung his mainyard and made sail and we followed suit as quickly as we could then i worked out my observations pricked off the ships position on the chart wrote up the log and took possession of the late captains stateroom by which time dinner was on the cabin table and i sat down to my first meal on board the mercury the food of course was not quite so luxurious as that served up on the cuddy tables aboard the salamis but it was a long way better than what i had been accustomed to get in the apprentices berth and i appreciated the change accordingly at the conclusion of the meal at which polson joined me uninvited while the carpenter stumped the poop as officer of the watch i went on deck to have a good look at my first command and on the whole was very pleased with her she was a big ship for her tonnage having evidently been constructed with an eye to ample cargo stowage rather than speed consequently she was inclined to be bluff in the bows and full in the run yet when i looked ahead and saw that the salamis had only drawn ahead of us by about a mile during the halfhour or so that i had been below i was by no means dissatisfied she was evidently an elderly ship for everything about her in the way of fittings and equipment was oldfashioned but she was as strong as oak and iron could make her her scantling being nearly twice as heavy as that of the salamis her bulwarks were almost as high and solid as those of a frigate and she was pierced to mount seven guns of a side but no longer carried any artillery on her decks excepting two brass six pounders for the purpose of signalling she was very loftily and solidly rigged and it did not take me long to ascertain that she had been most liberally maintained much of her rigging both standing and running being new while her ground tackle was ponderous enough to hold a ship of double her size not much chance thought i of this old barkie dragging her anchors home and driving ashore in anything short of a hurricane she carried a full poop the break of which came so far forward that there was scarcely room to pass comfortably between the foot of the poop ladders and the combing of the after hatch the poop cabin was a very spacious affair extending for the greater part of its length to the full width of the ship and it was most comfortably fitted up although as might be expected it lacked the luxurious finish of the salamis cuddy it looked as though it might at one time have been fitted with staterooms on either side for the accommodation of saloon passengers but if so they had all been removed save two at the fore and two at the after end of the cabin and even these were now unoccupied the boatswain and carpenter occupying the staterooms at the fore end of the structure in which the chief and second mate had originally been berthed the captains cabin was abaft the saloon in the extreme after end of the ship and was an unusually commodious and airy apartment extending the entire width of the ship and splendidly lighted and ventilated by a whole range of large stern windows there was a fine roomy standing bedplace on the starboard side with a splendid chest of drawers under it a washstand and dressingtable at the foot of it a large and well stocked bookcase on the port side a chart rack occupied the whole of the fore bulkhead the floor or deck of the cabin was covered with a handsome turkey carpet and a mahogany table big enough to accommodate a large chart stood in the middle of the apartment this was where i was to sleep and to spend in privacy as much of my waking time as i chose truly thought i this is an agreeable change from my cramped quarters aboard the salamis having completed the establishment of myself in this luxurious cabin by turning out my chest and hanging up such of my clothes as i was likely to want immediately and so on i went on deck again where the carpenter who told me that his name was tudsberyjosiah tudsbery your honour sirwas on duty and requested him to conduct me below to the emigrants quarters which i found occupied the whole of the tweendecks here again the liberality of the ships owners became manifest for the whole fitting up of the place was vastly superior to what was at that time considered good enough accommodation for emigrants the married quarters consisting of a number of quite comfortable and roomy cabins while the spaces allotted to the accommodation of the single men and women ensured to their occupants such complete privacy as was deemed quite unnecessary in those days i found that it was the duty of the emigrants to keep their own quarters clean and this seemed to have been somewhat neglected of late i therefore gave orders that all hands should at once turnto and give the tweendecks a thorough cleansing in readiness for another inspection by myself at eight bells in the afternoon watch the emigrants aboard the mercury numbered two hundred all told namely thirtythree married couples twentyeight unmarried women fortytwo unmarried men and sixtyfour children of whom onea sweet good tempered baby girlhad been born during the voyage they the emigrants seemed to be a very mixed lot ranging from clodhopping agricultural labourers whose intelligence seemed insufficient to enable them to appreciate the wonder of a flyingfish or the beauty of a golden crimson and purple sunset to individuals of so refined and intellectual an appearance and so polished a behaviour that the fact of their being tweendeck passengers seemed nothing short of a grotesque incongruity when i went below again at eight bells to inspect the emigrants quarters i found them sweet clean and altogether very much more wholesome than they had been upon the occasion of my first visit and i expressed my gratification at the change hinting pretty strongly that i should expect the place to be maintained in that condition for the remainder of the voyage at which remark one of the occupantsa pale delicatelooking girlexclaimed oh sir i only hope that you will insist upon that some of the people hereespecially the menare shockingly lazy and would never do a hands turn of work if they were not made to i am much obliged to you for the hint said i i will find out the identity of those especially lazy ones and see if i cannot imbue them with a good wholesome hatred of idleness before we arrive in the land where those who wont work must starve by sunset that night the salamis had slid so far ahead of us that only the heads of her courses were visible above the horizon and with nightfall we saw the last of her that we were destined to see during that voyage i suppose it was only natural that i a lad of barely seventeen years of age should be full of business and importance and anxiety for a few hours at least upon finding myself thus unexpectedly placed in a position of such tremendous responsibility as was involved in the navigation and therefore to a large extent the safety of this fine wholesome old ship with her two hundred passengers her crew of thirty and her valuable cargo at all events that was the condition of mind in which i found myself as i paced the spacious poop hour after hour sometimes accompanied by polson sometimes conversing with tudsbery and occasionally alone as i walked my glances travelled with the regularity of clockwork first to windward then ahead then aloft and finallyas i reached the binnacleinto the compass bowl then away out to windward again and so on ad infinitum until i was fairly bone weary and had completely walked off all my anxietyto say nothing of my importanceand had convinced myself that i really might venture to leave the ship for a few hours to the care of the boatswain and the carpenter i have mentioned that when bidding me farewell prior to my change over from the salamis to the mercury captain martin was kind enough to give me a word or two of caution and advice and one of the bits of advice which he most forcibly impressed upon me was that i should make a point of sighting either saint paul or amsterdam island on my way to the eastward and thus verify my reckoning i recognised this as being a counsel of wisdom and determined to shape a course that would enable me to sight both they being only about fifty miles apart and both standing high i therefore very carefully laid off the compass course upon the chart and found it to be southeast by east threequarters east the distance being eight hundred and forty miles and this course i gave to the helmsman as soon as i had pricked it off and very carefully verified it while he passed it on to his relief and so on but when i turned out at six bells the next morning i found to my disgust that the wind had drawn round from the eastward and broken us some four points off our course while to add to my vexation the boatswain and the carpenterboth of them illiterate menhad entered up the log slate in such an extraordinary manner that so far as the dead reckoning was concerned the information was not of the slightest use to me fortunately for my peace of mind the atmosphere was clear and i was able to get sights during the forenoon which gave me the ships longitude while a little later on a meridian altitude of the sun fixed our latitude for us then for nearly thirty hours we found ourselves enveloped in one of the densest fogs i ever experienced with light baffling variable winds that made of our wake a continual zigzag winding up with three days of thoroughly foul weathera whole gale of wind from the northeastduring the greater part of which we lay hove to under closereefed fore and main topsails with our head to the southeast then the weather cleared and moderated the wind gradually worked round first to east and then to southeast and at length i found the ship laying up closehauled under all plain sail for the spot where according to my reckoning saint paul ought to be i was now especially anxious to make that island for the weather of the past three or four days had been of such a character as to baffle the most experienced of navigators and i confess that i was beginning to feel rather more than a trifle nervous the island however hove into view at the precise moment and in the precise quarter that it ought to do if my reckoning happened to be correct and this test and verification of the accuracy of my working served to completely reestablish my confidence in myself so that from that time onward i never experienced the least anxiety i felt that so long as i could get tolerably regular sights of the sun moon or stars i was not at all likely to go wrong but before the island of saint paul had climbed up over the horizon that stretched athwart our bows i had become aware of a certain matter that while it struck me as being somewhat peculiar seemed to bear no further significance for me one of the first persons among the emigrant passengers aboard the mercury to attract my attention was a tall thin longhaired sickly looking man of about thirty years of age clad in a suit of rusty black whose appearance and manner generally suggested to me the idea that he must be by profession a schoolmaster there was a certain air of exaggerated earnestness of demeanour about him and a wildness of expression in his flashing coalblack eyes that caused me to set him down as being somewhat crackbrained his name i soon ascertained was algernon marcus wilde and he was among the first of the emigrants to speak to me he came to me on the morning after i joined the ship with a complaint as to the quality and quantity of the food served out to the occupants of the tweendecks and i was as much struck by the correctness of his speech as by the excessive indignation which he infused into his manner when stating the nature of his alleged grievance i pointed out to him the fact that whatever the quality of the food might be i was certainly not responsible for it nor in the event of its proving to be unsuitable could i remedy the matter away out there in midocean but i promised to investigate the affair and to do what might be possible to remove the grievance should i find such to existof which i had my doubts after my brief but highly satisfactory experience of the viands served up in the cabin i accordingly requested the steward to produce the dietary list which formed the basis of the agreement between the owners and the emigrants and upon going through it was certainly unable to find any just cause for complaint so far as quantity was concerned the question of quality was of course a different matter but here again when a day or two later i unexpectedly examined the food as it was being served out at the galley i was quite unable to discover any legitimate cause for complaint on the contrary the food although plain was as good as it was possible to obtain in those times aboard a ship that had been at sea a hundred days and it was excellently prepared when i sent for wilde and asked him to state specifically what he found wrong with the food that i had just examined all he could say was that it was not so good or so varied in character as that which he had seen from time to time carried aft for use in the cabin and that in his opinion no distinction whatever ought to be made in the treatment of persons occupying different parts of the ship also that he considered i ought to give instructions for the emigrants to be fed henceforth from the stores provided for cabin use nor would he be satisfied although i pointed out that he was getting the food that the owners had undertaken to provide him with in exchange for his passage money of course to attempt to argue with so unreasonable an individual was obviously absurd and i therefore dismissed him and thought nothing more about his complaints this however was not the matter of which i have spoken as gradually obtruding itself upon my attention although had i only been able to guess it the two were not unconnected what i noticed almost from the first moment of boarding the mercury without attaching any particular importance to it was that this man wilde and a few of the other male emigrants were in the habit of spending practically the whole of the second dogwatchwhich in fine weather at all events is usually a period of idleness and recreation for a ships crewon the forecastle head smoking and chatting animatedly with the forecastle hands while at other times the exschoolmasteras wilde actually proved to be seemed eternally engaged in earnest discussion with his fellow emigrants i often wondered idly what the man could possibly find to talk about so incessantly but usually found a sufficiently satisfactory explanation in the reflection that being a man of education he would naturally take pleasure in extracting the ideas of others and also probably in correcting them according to his own notions he was evidently very fond of talking and i frequently amused myself by watching the impassioned earnestness and the eloquent gestures with which he would hold forth upon the subjectwhatever it might bethat happened to be under discussion i soon found that polson and tudsbery the boatswain and carpenter of the ship apparently found more pleasure in spending the second dogwatch on the forecastle with their shipmates and the emigrants than they did in promenading the poop with me but this was not surprising for not only were they both very illiterate men but it quickly became apparent that they and i had scarcely a single interest or idea in common and we were consequently often hard put to it to find a topic of congenial conversation indeed in the course of a few days without the slightest illfeeling on either side our communications became almost exclusively restricted to matters connected with the business of the ship looking back from the summit of a matured experience as i now can upon that first fortnight aboard the mercury i often feel astonished that i never for a single instant caught the faintest premonition of what was looming ahead for i can recall plenty of hints and suggestions had i only been keensighted enough to observe them and smart enough to read their significance but i believe the fact to be that at that time i had no room in my mind for any other thought than that of the navigation of the ship it is true that for more than a year it had been part of my daily duty as a midshipmanapprentice qualifying for the position of officer to take observations of the various heavenly bodies simultaneously with those of captain martin and the mates to work them out independently and to submit my calculations to the skipperwho examined and returned them with such written comments as he deemed called forwith the result that i had long since become proficient in the science of navigation but this was a very different thing if on board the salamis i had chanced to make a mistake the worst that could have happened would have been a sharp rebuke from the skipper for my carelessness and an equally sharp injunction to be more careful in future whereas now aboard the mercury if i happened to make a miscalculation there was nobody to correct it and although subsequent observations might reveal the error and no actual harm arise from its committal so long as the ship was in midocean a comparatively trivial mistake committed when the ship happened to be in the vicinity of rocks or shoals or approaching land might easily make all the difference between perfect safety and her total loss together with that of all hands hence during those early days when the sense of grave responsibility lay heavy upon my young shoulders i could think of nothing but more or less abstruse astronomical problems chapter three an unpleasant surprise the revelation came upon me with the stunning effect of a thunderclap on the day upon which we made the island of saint paul the weather during the whole of the preceding day had been brilliantly fine with a light air of wind that breathing out from the southeast at daybreak had gradually hauled round until by noon it had settled at south so that when i took my meridian altitude of the sun for the determination of our latitude the mercury was heading straight for the spot where my calculations declared the island to be with all plain sail set to her royals and with the weather bracer slightly checked upon working out my meridian altitude i found the ships latitude to be degrees minutes south and we were steering true east consequently if my calculations were accurate we were at that moment on the exact parallel of saint paul whichalso according to my calculationsthen lay in line with our jibboom eighty miles distant this result was confirmed by a further observation of the sun taken in the course of the afternoon watch and a very simple calculation then informed me that if i had made no mistake and there occurred no change in the direction or strength of the wind the island ought to be sighted directly ahead fourteen miles distant at dawn of the next day this anticipation i communicated in my anxiety to polson and tudsbery the former of whom remarked well mr troubridge we shant have very long to wait afore were able to prove the haccuracy of your calculations but let me tell ye this sirif youre able to hit off that there bit of a hiland anywhere near as close as you hopes to ater all the boxhaulin about breakin off heavinto and driftin to leeward that weve had these here last few dayswell all i can say is that youre a good enough navigator to take a ship anywhere ay if twas round the world and back yees said i flattered a bit off my balance by the fulsome character of the compliment there will not be much fault to find i fancy after the traverse that we have been working by the way polson have you ever sighted saint paul i never have although this is my fifth trip in these seas well no sir i cant say as i have answered the boatswain but he continued peering through the skylight at the cabin clock its eight bells ill call chips i fancies i heard him say that he ad sighted it once or twice ill ask him when he comes on deck so saying polson walked to the bell where it hung mounted on the rail that guarded the fore end of the poop struck eight bells upon it and then descended to call the carpenter with whom he presently returned to the poop yes mr troubridge continued the boatswain as he preceded the carpenter up the weather poop ladder chips here says heve sighted the hiland twice in his time but only at a distance ah said i do you think you would recognise it again tudsbery oh yes sir no fear of that answered the carpenter confidently its a peculiarlookin spot not to be very easily mistook i remembers that when we last sighted it i heard the mate say to the skipper that it looked pretty much like a dead whale floatin high out o the water and he was right it did oh yes ill reckernize it again fast enough if i claps my eyes upon it never fear well said i i expect it to heave in sight tomorrow at dawn under the jibboomend some fourteen or fifteen miles distant if the wind and weather last as they are nowwhich i believe will be the case since the barometer remains steady it is your morning watch isnt it yes sir my eight hours out tonight answered chips then said i turning to the boatswain when you call the carpenter tomorrow morning at the end of the middle watch please give me a call also for never yet having sighted the island i should like to be on deck when it heaves into view and get a good look at it all right sir answered polson ill rouse ye out never fear the weather held fine all through that night with the breeze light but steady at south when having been duly called by the boatswain at four oclock the next morning i turned out and went on deck the ship with her spars almost upright was sliding very gently along over a sea so smooth that her mastheads seemed scarcely to sway at all among the brilliant stars that thickly jewelled the deep indigo vault overhead the silence of night lay heavy upon the breast of the placid deep and seemed to be emphasised rather than broken by the faint sigh of the breeze through the maze of spars and rigging that towered aloft the soft seething and plash of water along the bends the light creak or cheep of some parral or sheave up in the velvet darkness and the occasional clank of the tiller chains as the watchful helmsman with his eye upon some star peering past the weather leach of the mainroyal found it necessary to give the ship a spoke of the wheel one way or the other the watch had stowed themselves away somewhere about the fore deck doubtless taking a quiet catnap somewhere out of reach of the heavy dew and were not to be seen but the figure of the lookout on the topgallant forecastle could be just made out momentarily eclipsing first one lowlying star and then another as he paced monotonously to and fro athwartships to keep himself awake as i stood there at the head of the weather poop ladder abstractedly watching this mans movements it suddenly struck me that there was one point upon the horizon straight ahead where the night gloom seemed to be the merest trifle deeper and more opaque than elsewhere and i wondered whether it might perchance be the loom of the island the highest point of which being according to the chart eight hundred and twenty feet above the sea level should now be visible above the horizon if it were only daylightand my reckoning happened to be correct i fetched the ships nightglass and took a good look through it at this spot but at first could make nothing certain of it however while i still looked a bright star suddenly swam into view above the spot and my heart gave a great leap and a heavy sigh escaped me for i knew from the sweep of the horizon and the height of other stars about it in the immediate neighbourhood that the celestial body which had so suddenly sprung into the field of the telescope must have just risen above the topmost ridge of something solid blotting out a small space of sky in that quarter and the something solid could only be the island of saint paul the island is in sight tudsbery as straight ahead as it is possible for a man to aim for it i exclaimed exultantly for my feeling of relief from doubt and anxiety and the swift conviction that i might henceforward confidently rely upon myself were so great that i felt impelled to give audible expression to my satisfaction you dont say so mr troubridge exclaimed the carpenter coming to my side whereabouts do she lie sir come and stand where i am and i will show you answered i there now do you see that bright star low down in the sky just over the spot where the cathead passes out through the bulwarks certainly sir i see it quite plainly answered the carpenter then look immediately beneath it and you will see the loom of the land said i you can make it out more clearly with the naked eye than through the telescope dye see it well exclaimed chips doubtfully now that you comes to mention it i admit that the gloom away down there do look a bit thicker than it do anywheres else but i should never ha noticed it if you hadnt drawed my attention to it and even now i dont know as i should care to swear as to it bein land no said i and neither should i if i did not know it to be there but wait until the day breaks and you will see that i am right i dont doubt it sir i dont doubt it at all answered chips soothingly but its a wonder to me how youve been able to find your way to it for its only a little bit of a rock after alla hextinc volcano ive heard some people say how far dye reckon we are off from it now mr troubridge probably about seventeen or eighteen miles said i ah observed chips then we ought to be abreast of it soon ater breakfast and therewith he fell into a reverie it was about an hour later that preceded by a slight chilling of the air the first faint pallor of dawn came filtering through the velvet darkness ahead stealing imperceptibly higher and higher into the eastern sky and causing the stars thereaway to dwindle and grow dim until one after another they vanished in the cold colourless light that now stretched along the horizon beneath our jibboomend spreading right and left even as one stood and watched it then a faint flush of palest primrose stole into the pallor against which the horizon line ran black as ebony with here and there a suspicion of a gleam coming and going between it and the ship as the growing light fell upon the gently heaving swell a moment later a great shaft of white light shot perpendicularly from the horizon far ahead toward the zenith where the indigo was swiftly paling to purest ultramarine the primrose hue became more pronounced and there in the very midst of it where the colour was strongest rose a hummock of softest most delicate and ethereal amethyst cleancut as a cameo and shapedas the carpenter had said like the back of a gigantic whale with three wellmarked protuberances growing out of it while others showed just clear of the water toward what might be supposed to be the tail end there you are chips i exclaimed in a fever of exultation there is the island land ho straight ahead shouted the lookout at this moment as he faced aft pointing with his right hand over the bows ay ay jimmy my hearty we sees it plain enough answered the carpenter then he turned to me and continued yes sir there it is as you says ay and its saint paul too neer a doubt of it i reckernizes them there hummicks astickin up out of the back of it and i reckon that its just about fourteen mile awaywhich brings your calcilations right to a hapigraphy well well hedications a most wonderful thing and no mistake the bosun and i might ha searched for that there rock till all was blue and never ha found it but you comes along and gets aboard of us eight hunderd mile away andsays youwell sight saint paul as we runs down our eastin and although weve been headin all round the compass since then theres the hiland right enough and just where you said it would be ay to the very hinch i was vastly tickled at the mans enthusiastic admiration of my little twopennyhalfpenny feat of navigation andsecretlyvery proud of it myself but of course in reality it was an exceedingly commonplace exploit which any other navigator worthy of being socalled could have accomplished without the slightest difficulty the only essentials to success being good instruments clear skies and correct arithmetic all of which i fortunately possessed but i was nevertheless highly elated at my success chiefly i think because it being my first independent attempt to navigate a ship i had demonstrated to myself my ability to do so the day now grew fast in the east the primrose hue softened away right and left into a tint of warm grey with a faint suggestion of rose in it the stars had all vanished save one solitary gem that hung low in the western sky like a silver lamp the zenith was a rich pure ultramarine that was fast spreading toward the western horizon and chasing the last lingering shadow of night before it great spokes of radiant light were darting aloft from behind the island and touching into gold a few small scattered flakes of fleecy cloud that floated high over our mastheads then all in a moment the small faintly gleaming bit of land ahead became transformed as it might be with a magicians wand into a block of deepest richest purple bristling with rays of burning gold a throbbing rim of molten gold swept into view from behind it and in an instant it vanished amid a blinding blaze of sunlight that flashed across the ocean toward us transfiguring its erstwhile surface of ebony into a tremble of turquoise and gold outlining every spar and sail and rope in the ship with thin golden wires and causing every bit of glass and polished metalwork to blaze and scintillate with golden fire the watch appeared yawning and stretching as they emerged from their hiding places blinking like owls as they stared over the bows endeavouring to pick out from the dazzle ahead the shape of land that the lookout was pointing to and the carpenter emerged from his reverie to shout rig the headpump there forard and lay along with your buckets and brushes at two bells in the forenoon watch when i mounted the poop after breakfast we were square abreast and within a mile of the island i having instructed the boatswain to pass as close to it as was prudent for i had heard of shipwrecked people having found refuge there and on the neighbouring island of amsterdam and was desirous to see whether perchance there might be anyone there at the moment but there was no one to be seen at which i was not surprised for our approach had been slow affording ample opportunity to anyone on the island to observe it and make his presence known yet no signal or sign of any kind indicating human occupation had been descried true as we drew nearer a faint wreath of smoke here and there was occasionally seen but our telescopes showed us that these issued from the soil itself and not from fires kindled by human agency being no doubt the result of volcanic action also there were a few goats dotted about browsing in groups of two or three and their perfect placidity of demeanour was convincing evidence of the absence of man on the island having satisfied ourselves of the nonexistence of human beings upon saint paul i gave the order to bear away for amsterdam which lies due north and fifty miles distant from the smaller island intending to subject it also to a similar inquisition five minutes later we were running off square before the flagging breeze with the elusive filmy shadow which was as much as we could see of the island at that distance and under the existing atmospheric conditions hovering on the horizon over our figurehead i had just completed the making of a sketch of and the jotting down of a few notes concerning saint paul which i thought might possibly be useful to me some time later on in life when somewhat to my surprise the man wilde of whom i have already spoken came up on to the poop and informed me that he had somewhat to say to me if i could spare the time to listen to him imagining that he might have some fresh complaint to make regarding the food supplied to the emigrants i closed my notebook returned it to my pocket and requested him to say on thank you he said the fact is mr troubridge that i come to you this morning as the representative and spokesman of all on board this ship crew as well as passengers and it will perhaps simplify matters a great deal if i tell you at the outset that we are all absolutely of one mind regarding the matter which i have been deputed to lay before you i understand said i pray proceed mr wilde for the man had paused as though to afford me an opportunity to speak he bowed slightly in acknowledgment of my permission to continue and resumed when polson the boatswain of this ship boarded the salamis he informed your captain that the mercury was bound from liverpool to sydney new south wales and in a sense the statement was true inasmuch as that when the ship sailed from liverpool her captain had instructions to navigate her to australia but since then many things have happened as you are aware one very important happening however of which as yet you know nothing is this after most carefully weighing every point for and against we have arrived with absolute unanimity at the determination that instead of continuing our voyage to australia we will proceed to the pacific ocean where on some suitable islandfor which we will search until we find itwe will establish ourselves as a little community to be governed upon the simple oldfashioned patriarchal system of perfect equality and my object in explaining this scheme of ours to you is to request that you will have the goodness to change the course of the ship accordingly this extraordinary statement with its concluding request was made in so perfectly calm and matteroffact a manner and in a tone of such absolute finality that for a space of several seconds i was rendered literally speechless with amazement the colossal impudence and audacity of the proposal took my breath away but i soon collected my scattered faculties and forthwith proceeded vigorously to remonstrate with the visionary enthusiast who i instantly recognised must be the originator of the scheme sit down mr wilde said i seating myself upon a hencoop and signing to him to place himself beside me you have sprung upon me a matter that is not to be dealt with and dismissed in a breath indeed it involves so many momentous questions that i scarcely know where to begin but by way of a starter let me ask you whether you are aware that you have no right whatever to make use of this ship for such a purpose as that which you have outlined to me the contract of the owners was to convey you to sydney and land you there and you can claim no more from them in the next place pardon me for interrupting you broke in my companion with an indulgent smile and uplifted protesting hand but i believe i know and could repeat to you every one of the somewhat musty arguments which are crowding each other upon the tip of your tongue and it will perhaps save timeand possibly a certain amount of unpleasant frictionif i inform you at onceas indeed i have hinted to you alreadythat we have given them all our most careful and exhaustive consideration and have quite settled among ourselves that none of them is anything like weighty enough to divert us from our purpose we know for example that the appropriation of this ship and her cargo in the carrying out of our plans will involve a certain amount of hardship and loss to the owners but no revolutionary scheme of any sort great or small was ever yet carried into effect without inflicting loss and hardship upon somebody it would pass the wit of man to devise one that did not and we are therefore prepared to regard that phase of the question with perfect complacency i wonder whether you understand that what you contemplate is called piracy and is punishable with death said i of course we do my dear young friend answered wilde with a smile but perhaps i ought to have explained to you that the very root and foundation of our plan is to escape from manmade laws which are compounded of tyranny and injustice of the grossest kind and to revert to the old simple patriarchal family ideathe idea of holding all things in common of abolishing individualism and inequality of every description and of submitting only to such simple laws as are manifestly for the benefit and advantage of all besides who will there be to punish us for our socalled act of piracy you may rest assured said i that there is no spot on this globe so remote so hidden away that a british cruiser will not find it sooner or later and when she happens to visit your islandif ever you reach ither captain will insist upon an explanation of how you come to be there and in short of having your whole story told to him and then mr wilde the days of the originator of this mad scheme will be numbered my dear boy said wilde laying his hand soothingly upon my arm the originator of this mad scheme as you are pleased to put it is more than willing to take his chance of such a happening as you suggest so we need not discuss that point any farther but may pass on to the next the question now is will you or will you not help us to find the sort of island that we have in mind no noas he saw that i was about to refuse hotlydo not decide in the negative too hurriedly take time to consider the matter because it is a rather important one both to you and to us it is important to us because if you should decide in the negative it will put us to all the trouble and inconvenience of finding another navigator and it is important to you because if you should refuse it will mean that being opposed to us you must be got rid of for we will have no enemies secret or open among us and i think that the best way to get rid of you and at the same time to guard against the possibility of your doing us a bad turn in the future will be to tie your hands and heels together attach a good heavy weight to your neck and drop you overboard sometime in the small hours when all the women and children are asleep and cannot be shocked or distressed at the sight you see we have considered this matter so thoroughly and have so completely made up our minds what we intend to do that we cannot dream of allowing the qualms of conscience of a mere lad like yourself to stand in our way if you had not been an expert navigator it would have been a different affair altogether we should have said nothing to you but should have put you ashore on one of these islands had we chanced to find them or have exchanged you with some ship for a better navigator but you have proved your ability and now you must either throw in your lot with us oraccept the alternative think it over my dear boy and let me know your decision when you have fully made up your mind you will be able to do this all the more easily since as the originator of this mad scheme and the accepted leader of all on board it is my intention to take up my quarters in the cabin for the remainder of our voyage so saying wilde rose and bestowing upon me a friendly smile made his way down the poop ladder to the main deck and a few minutes later i saw the stewards helping him to transfer his belongings from the steerage to the cabin chapter four wilde explains the boatswain whose watch it now was and who had been making a pretence of superintending some job on the forecastle while wilde was talking to me presently slouched along the deck and came up on to the poop arrived at the head of the weather poop ladder he paused and facing forward appeared to be regarding the set of the canvas attentively then with a very sheepish air he joined me and took the seat which wilde had not long vacated i saw that the fellow was dying of curiosity to learn what had passed between the exschoolmaster and myself but was determined not to help him by opening the conversation the result being a longand apparently on the part of the boatswain an embarrassing pause however at length he broke ground by remarking with a conciliating smile so i sees youve been havin a yarn with mr wilde eh mr troubridge have he told ye sir of the plan that weve made up among us for startin a new country he has told meto my intense astonishmentthat i have become shipmates with a round hundred or so of consummate idiotsleaving the women and children out of the question i answered sharply aah returned the boatswain with a sorrowful shake of the head i felt somehow as you wouldnt see the thing as we sees it all the same sir i hopesyes i most fervently hopesas heve been able to persuade ye to jine in with us he tells me that if i refuse to do so i am to be lashed up neck and heels and hove overboard with a sinker attached to my neck some fine night when the women and children are all below do you approve of that arrangement polson i demanded wellnoi cant say as i do not altogether answered the boatswain fidgeting uneasily where he sat but i hopes it wont come to that mr troubridge i dont hold with forcin anybody to do what they dont want to do but i dont see as itd do you no very serious harm for to agree to navigate this here ship to the spot where we wants her took to and thats all as youre to be asked to do and if i should choose to refuse i suppose you would stand by and see me drowned if indeed you did not lend a hand to lash me up i asked infusing all the sarcasm i could into the question no no mr troubridge exclaimed polson justly indignant that i should bring such a monstrous charge against him i wouldnt lift a finger to hurt ye siri shouldnt have no need to for theres lots o chaps among them emigrants ready enough to do any mortal thing that mr wilde tells em to i should just go below and have nothin to do with the job by which simple means you would secure the acquittal of the thing you call your conscience against the charge of murdering me i ejaculated scornfully do you know polson that the man who consents to a murder is every whit as guilty as he who actually does the deed well i dunno answered polson i dont see how that can be mr troubridge if another man chooses to murder ye whats that got to do wi me besides what can we do all hands of us has already signed a paper agreein to obey mr wildes orders tut i exclaimed impatiently do you seriously wish me to believe polson that you are such an utter fool that you are unable to discriminate between right and wrong with one breath you give me to understand that you would have no conscientious objection to permitting a man to murder me and with the next you intimate that having as i understand it blindly pledged yourself to obey all wildes orders whatever their nature may beyour conscience will not permit you to break your pledge let me tell you man that such a pledge as that is in nowise binding and the law will hold you blameless if you choose to break it ayyesthe law retorted the boatswain spitting over the rail the more strongly to mark his contempt of that system which was once tersely denounced as being a hass i dont take no account of the law mr troubridge mr wilde have showed us that the law aint justice it have been made by rich men to grind down the poor and keep em down and there aint goin to be no law in this here new country what were goin to make everybodys goin to be just as good as everybody else and is goin to do just what he jolly well likes just so i said i have heard that yarn before and if i knew of a country where such a state of things existed i would take precious good care to steer clear of it cant you picture to yourself the joy of living in a place where if a stronger man than you happened to take a fancy to your clothes or your house or anything else that belonged to you he could compel you to give them up and nobody would interfere to say him nay that is the kind of thing that is to be expected in a country where there are no laws and where everybody is at liberty to do just what he jolly well likes i am astonished to hear you talking such utter tomfoolery i set you down as having more common sense the poor man stared at me in silence agape with perplexity well ill be jiggered he exclaimed at last thumping the hencoop with his fist in his bewilderment whats a man to do heres that chap wildea man of eddication mind ye mr troubridgecomes along and spins us a yarn of how we poor sailormen are illtreated and kep down overworked and underpaid by rich owners and of how the law wont do nothin for us and he shows us a plan how we can live in peace and happiness and enjyment all the rest of our lives and then you turns up and knocks the whole bag o tricks into a cocked hat which of ye is right if youre right i stays as i am all my life a poor miserable shellback endin my days by sellin matches in the streets when im too old and too stiff wi the rheumatics to go to sea any longer that bein the case ill give mr wildes plan a trial for a spell right or wrong very well said i go your own way if you will but you will most certainly regret it some day when it is too late to retrace your steps and let me tell you this polson you are attributing your position and its accompanying hardships to the wrong cause altogether the true state of the case is that you are an ignorant and unintelligent man through lack of education did you ever go to school no never mr troubridge answered my companion what little i knows i larned myself my father who was supposed to be a wharfinger was too fond of the drink ever to be able to hold a job the consekence bein that my poor mother had to keep things goin by takin in washin and since there was seven of us young uns it took her all her time to find us in grub and cloes she hadnt no money to spare for eddication consekence was i didnt have none and when i was bout leven year old things got to such a pitch at home that i cut and run goin to sea as cabinboy in a geordie to start with and gradually workin my way up to bein a bosun as i am now ah said i well you have done a good deal better polson than many others in like circumstances butand this is my pointif your father instead of stupefying his brains with drink had been a sober steady hardworking man and had done his duty by you to the extent of sending you to school you would have gained a vast amount of valuable knowledge you would have cultivated your intellect you would have learned to discriminate between right and wrong you would have been able to reason and to perceive that certain causes invariably produce certain effects you would have discovered that knowledge is power and that the more knowledge a man possesses the higher he is able to rise in the world instead of stopping at being a boatswain you would have risen to be first a mate and then a masterand possibly an owner some day as other men have done now put that in your pipe and smoke it and i jumped up and went below to fetch my sextant up on deck for by this time it was drawing well on toward noon as the day wore on the wind fell lighter until by sunset the ship scarcely had steerageway consequently it was not until the next morning that we found ourselves off the island of amsterdam past which we drifted so slowly that had there been anyone on the island they would have had ample time to make their presence known but we saw no one nor anything in the least resembling a signal after skirting the western side of the island to its northern extremity i gave the order to bring the ship to the wind and gave the officer of the watch a compass course of eastsoutheast for cape otway i was not going to yield to wilde at the first demand and not at all if i could possibly help it although my talk with the boatswain was of anything but an encouraging character there was still the carpenter however and i thought i would sound him as to his views on this visionary scheme of wildes the very first step toward the realisation of which involved an act of piracy but when i came to talk to him i soon found that he was even worse to deal with than the boatswain for although perhaps not quite so ignorant as the latter he was still ignorant enough to be convinced by the specious arguments of the socialist to readily accept the doctrine of perfect equality between all men andlike most of those whose labour is of an arduous character and whose life is one of almost constant hardship and privationto be dazzled by the alluring prospect of being able to live out the rest of his days on an island whereaccording to wildenature would do all the work and man would only need to stretch forth his hand to gather in her bounties i will do wilde the justice to say that he manifested no impatience while awaiting the announcement of my decision relative to the proposal which he had made to me on the contrary when i met him at the cabin table at mealtimes he was very chatty and friendly with a certain subtle suggestion of patronage in his tone however that rather went against the grain with me but he asked me no questions until i had set the course for cape otway and the island of amsterdam was melting into the haze astern of us then being on the poop at the moment when i gave the course to the helmsman and hearing its direction he came up to me and said are you aiming for any point in particular in directing the helmsman to steer eastsoutheast mr troubridge yes said i if the wind will permit us to steer that course long enough it will eventually bring us within sight of cape otway cape otway he repeated um the name seems not altogether unfamiliar to me and as a man who has been for some years a schoolmaster i suppose i ought to be able to say offhand exactly where it is but my memory upon such matters is a trifle weak i am afraid perhaps you will kindly tell me where cape otway is cape otway lies some sixty milesmore or lesssouthwest of port philip heads said i and excepting wilson promontory is the most southerly headland of australia of course of course he exclaimed with a little air of vexation dear me how marvellously easy it seems to forget such details i am afraid our system of education does not attach nearly as much importance as it ought to the study of geography ah well what matters it i have done with such trifles i hope for the remainder of my days does cape otway happen to be on our road to the pacific mr troubridge yes i said that is to say if one elects to go southabout but the pacific is a big sheet of water and there are two or three ways of getting to it from here all depends of course upon the particular part of the pacific to which one is bound yes of course agreed wilde then he turned suddenly and looking me keenly in the face remarked really you know troubridge you impress me very favourablyvery favourably indeed i shall be profoundly sorry if we are obliged to part with you for you seem to me to be a lad of considerably more than average intelligence that remark of yours touching the particular part of the pacific to which one is boundby the way have you a tolerably intimate knowledge of the pacific no said i i know nothing whatever of it except the part which lies between australia and cape horn which i take it comprises a very small portion of the whole questioned he a very small portion indeed i agreed ah he commented can you tell me whether there happens to be a map of the pacific on board this ship it is quite possible i said she is pretty wellstocked with charts and now that you come to mention it i believe there is a chart of the pacific in the rack let us go down and ascertain shall we said he and placing his hand within my arm he gently but firmly led me off the poop it may of course have been pure imagination on my part but his manner seemed to say as distinctly as wordsdont mistake my politeness and geniality for weakness i believe in putting things pleasantly but when i make a suggestion i intend it to be accepted as a command we descended together to the captains cabinwhich i now occupiedand he entered it with me laughingly explaining that he was sure i would excuse the liberty he was taking in doing so and at once fell to examining the labels of the charts in the rack ah here we are he exclaimed laying his hand upon a roll labelled pacific ocean let us take it into the main cabin and study it together he laid it out flat upon the cabin table and placed four weights at the corners to hold them down then he bent over the sheet and studied it with extraordinary interest so this is what you call a chart is it he exclaimed i see that it varies very materially from an ordinary map in that it gives a great deal of information about the sea and not much about the land beyond its outline and he began his study of it by asking the meaning of certain mysterious lines and markings upon it then he asked a number of questions respecting the various small islands dotted about more or less in patches upon it to answer which i had to hunt for a pacific directory which i fortunately found in the bookcase and finally after we had thus been engaged for an hour or more he said it is perfectly clear to me that it would be idle for us to determine at this distance in what particular part of the pacific we will search for our future home that search must be conducted methodically and after studying this chart very carefully i have come to the conclusion that our best course will be to begin our search hereindicating with his finger a point about midway between the northwestern extremity of new guinea and the pelew islandsand work our way in an easterly direction have you read those notes i asked drawing his attention to certain notes on the chart explaining that the caroline marshall and solomon groups are almost entirely unknown and are believed to have many dangers in their neighbourhood not marked upon the charts navigators are therefore cautioned to exercise the most extreme vigilance when approaching or sailing among them certainly i have my boy he answered and it is to them that my choice of that part of the ocean is chiefly due those islands you see are almost entirely unknown which means that if we can find one among them of a suitable character for our new settlement we are not likely to be disturbed by the intrusion of curious and inquisitive visitors therefore kindly take measures to navigate the ship to the spot that i have indicated it was on the tip of my tongue flatly to refuse to have anything whatever to do with him or his scheme and to defy him to do his worst when the germ of an idea came floating into my mind and i said instead do you leave the choice of route to me because if so i shall certainly go southabout past australia as being much the safer route safer possibly but not nearly so direct replied wilde therefore since we are all anxious to begin our new life as early as possible let us take the shorter and more direct route past the northwest of australia and through the banda sea and molucca passage that route positively bristles with dangers as you might see if you understood a chart i exclaimed in tones of exasperation i do not doubt your word for a moment my dear boy answered wilde soothingly but we shall bear in mind the warning of the chart we shall exercise the most extreme vigilance in the midst of those dangers and i have not the slightest doubt that everything will be all right and now to change the subject have you made a choice between the two alternatives that i submitted to you yesterday you mean the alternative of joining you or of being drowned i asked with vindictive emphasis precisely he answered with a smile of the utmost suavity and understand me youngster he continued with a sudden change to sternness in his manner that disconcerted me a great deal more than i should have cared for him to know if you decide to join us you must do so wholeheartedly and with no mental reservations those who are not with us must inevitably be against us and the issues at stake with us are of far too grave a character to allow of our running any risk from secret enemies no mercy will be shown to traitors i assure you so do not permit your mind to dwell upon any plan in which submission that is to be only apparent has a place you do not leave me very much choice i remarked if i refuse to throw in my lot with you you drown me and if i accept your alternative and should be unlucky enough to incur the suspicion that i am not acting honestly with you what happens we hang you answered wilde tersely i see i said the choice you offer me appears to lie between the certainty of drowning and the risk of hanging i am by no means certain that it would not wiser on my part to choose the former and get it over and done with at once but i will think it over and let you know yes pray do so returned wilde in the same exasperating tone of suavity and before we dismiss the subject he continued let me give you a word of genuinely friendly advice get rid of that idiotic idea of choosing the alternative of being drowned and getting it over and done with as soon as possible because so long as you allow your imagination to dwell upon it it will simply warp your judgment and prevent you from arriving at a sound sensible conclusion no young man possessing a sound mind in a sound bodyas you appear to do deliberately chooses death and the annihilation which follows it rather than the long years of ease happiness and comfort which will be yours if you join us so why should you eh i will think it over and let you know as soon as i have arrived at a decision i repeated but dont you make any mistake about the annihilation that comes after death that is the atheists notion but if you are reckoning upon anything of that kind to save you from punishment for your misdeeds in this present life you are going to be badly undeceived make no mistake about that my boy he said laying his hand upon my shoulder if you possess any religious convictions retain them by all means and much good may they do you but do not try to convert me no scruples of what they term a religious character will ever be permitted to deter me from taking any steps that may appear necessary to further and ensure the success of my schemes such for instance as committing murder i retorted all right but let me tell you that the hintor threat call it which you like will not influence me a hairbreadth one way or the other very well my dear boy he returned be it so at least we thoroughly understand each other dont we anddont be a fool with which parting shot he left me and proceeding to the main deck entered into conversation with some of the emigrants who were leaning over the bulwarks idly watching the water as the ship drove slowly through it dont be a fool it was excellent advice although given by a man whose folly i regarded as stupendous and i determined to follow it then i proceeded to reason out the matter with myself for it was evident that i should very soon have to come to a decision and it appeared to me that there was nothing to be gained by delay in the first place i was compelled inwardly to admit that intensely as i disliked wilde and stupendous as i considered his folly there was sound sense in his suggestion that i should abandon the idea of throwing away my life but when it came to his insisting that if i decided to afford him that help i must do so with no mental reservations that was altogether a different affair he was compelling me to do something to which i very strongly objected leaving me no choice between that and death and since he had no scruples about employing all the power he possessed to thus constrain me i felt that i too must throw my scruples overboard in my endeavour to defeat him he had the power to compel me to help him and that being the case it seemed to me that it would be sound policy on my part to afford that help with as good a grace as i could muster but so far as mental reservations were concerned i resolved that if i could find means to make known what had happened to the mercury and thus bring a british manowar out to rescue the ship and cargo from the scoundrel who was so determinedly bent upon stealing them to carry out his own mad visionary scheme i would do so and risk the consequences chapter five a conditional surrender i had just definitely arrived at the above conclusion when the boatswain joined me i see mr wilde have been havin another yarn with ye mr troubridge he remarked as he seated himself at my side yes i answered shortly and is there any chance of his bein able to persuade ye to give us the help we wants he enquired in conciliatory tones there might be perhaps if all hands of you were willing to agree to my terms i answered stubbornly determined to drive the best bargain possible ah he exclaimed with an air of satisfaction that sounds better yes a good deal better it do you say what them terms of yours be mr troubridge and i dare say i could very soon give ye a hidea whether wed be willin to agree to em you wont find us noways unreasonable sir i promise ye because we wants your help badly and theres no use in pretendin that we dont youve proved yourself to be a hefficient navigator and me and chips has quite made up our minds that we might go farther and fare a precious sight worse in the way of findin somebody to take your place besides we dont want no murder if we can anyways help it and i know that all hands in the focsled be willin to agree to amost anything in reason to dodge that sort of thing do you really mean that polson i demanded because if so it is a very great pity that you did not frankly say so when this matter was first broached besides although you sailors may be inclined to listen to reason you must remember that you cannot answer for wilde and the rest of the emigrants oh but i think we can mr troubridge interrupted the boatswain ye see sir its this way he continued we sailormen are the masters of the sittyation as the sayin is wilde and his lot cant do nothin without our help they cant navigate the ship and they cant handle her there aint one of em knows enough to be able so much as clew up a ryal or take in the flyin jib so if they wants to carry out their plan theyll have to agree to the same as what we does dye see and were willin to agree to anything reasonable as you may want to propose this sudden complaisance on the part of the boatswain put a very different complexion upon the whole affair and was infinitely better than i had dared to hope with the entire crew at my back i ought to have no difficulty in keeping wilde and his lot in their proper places andwell the sea has many surprises for those who follow it and who could know what might happen but it was no part of my policy to betray to this man the extreme satisfaction which his words had given me and thus perhaps subtly suggest to him the idea that he had displayed more flexibility than was actually necessary to secure my cooperation i therefore said well whichever way the affair goes i am at least glad to hear you say that the ships crew are willing to agree to any reasonable proposition that i may make but that still remains to be seen you and i may differ in our ideas as to what is reasonable you know ay of course we may but i dont think its at all likely as we shall sir answered the boatswain you state your conditions mr troubridge and ill soon tell ye whether they seems reasonable or not very well said i i will if i understand the ins and outs of this affair wilde has persuaded all hands aboard this ship seamen and emigrants alike to seek out some suitable island whereon you can try the experiment of living the ideal life of the socialist you are one and all absolutely determined to give this fantastic experiment a trial and you desire me to help you to the extent of finding the island for you is that it thats it sir yes thats it youve got it hit off to a happigraphy agreed the boatswain then listen to the conditions upon which i am willing to do what you require of me said i the sort of island that you people desire is only to be foundif found at allin an ocean that is at present comparatively unknown and is full of dangers in the shape of rocks shoals and islands the position of which is doubtful as shown by the charts while there are doubtless many others that have never yet been sighted and which a ship bound upon such an errand as ours is liable to blunder up against at any hour of the day or night to navigate successfully a ship among such dangers as these it is imperative that there should be one personand one onlyas the supreme head to whom all the rest shall render the most implicit unquestioning obedience and i demand to be that one with you and the carpenter as first and second mates i must command the ship and nobody must presume to interfere with or dictate to me in any way secondly the crew must undertake to observe and maintain strict discipline both among themselves and also among the emigrants if need be and thirdly i declinenay i absolutely refuseto acknowledge wildes authority he may be your king or president or whatever he chooses to call himself as soon as your island is found and all hands are ashore but until thenso far at least as i am concernedhe is only a passenger now those are the terms upon which i am willing to undertake the service you require of me and you may take them or leave them just as you please they seems reasonable enough i wont deny it admitted polson and i dare say as everybodyll be willin enough to agree to em all except wilde i mean i know he wont like the hidea of not bein allowed to hinterfere until we arrives at the hiland cant ye make that there part a trifle easier mr troubridge no said i resolutely on no account whatever on the contrary that is the proviso upon which i shall insist most strongly wilde may be an excellent schoolmaster for aught i know to the contrary but he is neither a seaman nor a navigator and i will never consent to his being allowed to interfere either directly or indirectly with matters of which he possesses no knowledge you cannot have two captains to one ship you know if he is to be captain you will have no need of me but if i am to be captain i will not allow anyoneand least of all a landsmanto interfere with me ay ay mr troubridge yes i can see now as you are quite right agreed the boatswain it wouldnt never do to have him hinterferin and givin horders about things he dont understand if he was allowed to do it theres others as would soon want to do the same and then we should soon all be in a pretty mess dye mind writin them conditions of yours down upon a sheet of paper so as i can read em out to all hands sir and if they agree to em ill get em to sign the paper and then ill hand it back to you very well said i that arrangement will do excellently and see here polson if all you seamen are willing to sign i dont care a brass button whether the emigrants do or not if you men forard are all agreed that those conditions of mine are just and reasonable we need not trouble ourselves as to what the emigrants think of them because you know they cant take the ship from us however dissatisfied they may be no no in course they cant mr troubridge agreed the boatswain grinning appreciatively as though the helplessness of the emigrants was a fact that had not hitherto occurred to him we had now thrashed the matter out and i had succeeded in bringing polson into a far more pliant frame of mind than i had ever dared to hope for i therefore determined to clinch the matter at once by putting my demands into blackandwhite and securing the signatures of the crew to them before the boatswain who was evidently a man of influence among them should find time to alter his view of the affair i consequently sprang to my feet and bidding my companion await my return descended to my own cabin and carefully wording the document drew up a form of agreement between myself on the one part and the crew and passengers of the mercury on the other then returning with it to the poop i placed the paper in polsons hand after reading it over to him and requested him to obtain first the signatures of the crew to it beginning with himself and the carpenter and then those of the emigrants afterwards returning the document to me it cost him nearly three hours strenuous work to secure the signatures of the entire crew and the emigrants to the agreement for in the first place he found the occupants of the forecastle one and all very unwillingas is the case with most illiterate peopleto pledge themselves by attaching their signatures or marks to my memorandum although it was read over and explained to them at least half a dozen times so that they thoroughly understood the nature of it and verbally expressed themselves as fully approving of each of the conditions at length however by dint of much persuasion the boatswain secured the signature or mark of every occupant of the forecastle after which he entered the tweendecks and summoning the whole of the emigrants to meet him fully explained the situation to them read over the agreement and then laying the document upon the table demanded their signatures to it but here again he encountered a quite unexpected amount of opposition wilde stepping forward and not only refusing to attach his own signature to the paper but also forbidding any of the other emigrants to do so polson argued pleaded and cajoled but all in vain nothing that he could say appeared to have the slightest effect upon his audience although several declared their perfect readiness to sign if their leader would but accord his permission it was not until at length with his patience completely exhausted he suddenly determined upon the adoption of what to him seemed a thoroughly desperate expedient that he achieved even a partial success dashing the paper down with vehemence upon the table he exclaimed wrathfully now listen to me the lot of ye chips and me and all hands in the focsle has signed this here doccyment because havin thought it all over were agreed that mr troubridge is quite right in demandin what he do mr wilde there objects to it because he aint allowed to interfere with and dictate to mr troubridge and none of you wont sign because mr wilde wont let ye now ill give ye all ten minutes longer to make up your minds and if you havent signed by that time we sailormen wont have no more truck with ye butll go to mr troubridge and tell im he can take the ship to sydney where shes bound to this announcement coming quite unexpectedly fell like a bombshell among polsons audience who had dwelt upon the idea of life in an island where perpetual summer reigns and where nature offers many of her choicest gifts almost unsolicited until it had taken such complete possession of them that it had come to represent to them the one desirable thing in the whole world to lose which would be to lose everything in a perfect passion of consternation they turned upon wilde and not only claimed their right to sign but also insisted that he should conform to polsons demand and be the first among them to affix his signature subjected to such pressure as this there was of course but one thing for him to do and he did it but the next moment he dashed up on deck sprang up the poop ladder and approaching me shook his clenched fist in my face as he exclaimed almost foaming at the mouth you young scoundrel i have signed that precious document of yours because that fool polson left me no option but wait until we arrive at the island and my power begins and then ill make you hold your tongue sir and go down off this poop i exclaimed springing to my feet in a rage for the fellow at the helm was grinning broadly at the scene and if you dare to come up here again without being sent for ill kick you down on to the main deck and then have you put in irons ay and ill do so now if you dare to answer me be off with you now quick i never in all my life saw a man so completely taken aback as was this crazy schoolmaster when i tackled him amazement incredulity wounded vanity indignation and bodily fear seemed all to be struggling together to assert themselves in his countenance and to find articulate expression upon his tongue but fear was the strongest of them allthe fear that he might be actually subjected to the unspeakable indignity of personal violence and when as i uttered the final words i advanced a step toward him as though about to carry out my threat he suddenly turned tail and slunk off like a whipped cur some time later when polson having at length accomplished his mission brought me the signed agreementwhich of course i knew was as a binding document not worth the paper upon which it was written although i still hoped that it might be to some extent effectivei related to him the little incident that had occurred between wilde and myself at which he expressed some concern although he fully agreed with me that the schoolmasterat all events while aboard ship and at seamust be held as amenable to discipline as anyone else and that it would never do to give him the least bit more liberty than we were prepared to accord to every one of the other emigrants having secured which admission from the boatswain i sent there and then for the steward and ordered him at once to bundle wildes belongings out of the cabin back to the tweendecks during the second dogwatch that same evening wilde sought out the boatswain and carpenter and complained to them of what he termed my tyrannical conduct which he represented to his two listeners was of so grossly humiliating a character that it was calculated very seriously to detract from his influence with his followers so serious a grievance did he make of it that at length polson and tudsbery approached me with something in the nature of a remonstrance accompanied by a mildly offered suggestion that i should concede something to enable wilde to preserve his dignity probably i should have been wiser to have accepted and acted upon this suggestion but i had got the idea into my head that the matter had resolved itself into a struggle for supremacy between wilde and myself and i obstinately refused to yield a hairbreadth thereby exciting the permanent hostility not only of wilde himself but alsoas i afterward foundof several of his followers the boatswain and carpenter were at first disposed to regard me as unnecessarily firm but this feeling soon yielded to one of quiet gratification that they had as leader one who young as he was would not submit to dictation from anybody and i feel convinced that whatever i may have lost in popularity i more than regained in the shape of power and authority thereby avertingas i soon had reason to believemany a serious dispute and quarrel between the widely conflicting elements that were confined so closely together in the ship the terms upon which i was to command the mercury having at length been arranged upon as satisfactory a basis as i could reasonably expect i now found time to give consideration to my plans for the future as my hope that the wild scheme of the conspirators might be frustrated and the ship and her cargo restored to their lawful owners rested almost entirely upon the possibility that we might fall in with a british manowar the first question to which i devoted my attention was that of the route which i should choose by which to reach the pacific there were two alternative routes open to me oneand that perhaps rather the safer of the two from the navigators point of viewto the south and east of australia then northward between the solomon and admiralty groups to the waters wherein our search for a sort of earthly paradise was to be prosecuted and the rather shorter but more dangerous route up the western coast of australia then through the ombay passage into the banda sea and thence through the boeroe strait into the molucca or the gillolo passage the successful negotiation of either of which would bring us to the spot where our search was to commence if the question of ease and safety of navigation had alone been concerned i should have unhesitatingly chosen the former but when i came to weigh the comparative chances of falling in with a british manowar it did not take me long to make up my mind that the closer i could hug the philippines and the longer i could remain in their neighbourhood the more likely should i be to encounter something belonging to the china station and i accordingly settled upon the second alternative this choice had the further advantage that being the shorter of the two routes it gratified all hands none of whom was intelligent enough to understand and appreciate the question of the comparative dangers of the two routes or to consider that by adopting the one which met with their approval the risk of encountering a man owarand thus having all their plans knocked on the headwas very greatly increased naturally i did not enlighten them it was the season of the northeast monsoon in the indian ocean and a careful study of the chart and directory made it clear to me that the proper course to pursue was to run down our easting until degrees east longitude should be reached and then still availing ourselves to the utmost of such westerly wind as might be met with haul gradually up to the northward in the west australian current which has a northerly set accordingly i kept the ships bowsprit pointing steadily to the eastward despite the violent remonstrances which wilde addressed to the boatswain and the carpenterhe had never spoken to me since i had ordered him off the poop and turned him out of the cabin for the first few days i was rather afraid that i was going to have a little trouble with these two men for whenever wilde complained to them that i was unnecessarily prolonging the voyage by steering east instead of north eastwhich according to his crude notions i ought to have donethey came to me reiterating the mans complaints and evincing so much curiosity and suspicion that it was perfectly evident they did not trust me but i quickly arrived at the conviction that let my relations with wilde be what they might it was absolutely necessary that i should possess the full confidence of the boatswain and the carpenterand through them of the whole crew i therefore took considerable pains to make them clearly understand my reasons for acting as i did after which i had no further trouble with them i very soon had reason to congratulate myself upon the adoption of this policy for while my relations with the crew daily grew more satisfactoryso that had it not been for the ridiculous hopes of a life of perfect liberty equality and immunity from hard work with which wilde had addled their brains i might easily have won their consent to take the ship to her legitimate destinationwilde was devoting his entire energies to the task of stirring up and fomenting a spirit of lawlessness and insubordination among his fellow emigrants chieflyas it seemed to mewith the object of causing me as much annoyance and trouble as possible at length however matters came to such a pass that i perceived it would be absolutely necessary for me to seize the first opportunity that offered to assert myself and put an end to a state of affairs that was fast becoming utterly unendurable and that opportunity was not long in coming it arose in this wise there was among the passengers a girl named grace hartley about twentythree years of age of considerable personal attractions welleducated and of a very gentle and amiable disposition she had been a governess in england and had been engaged by an agent to proceed to australia to take a similar position in a family out there and it was perhaps the indifferent treatment which she had received at the hands of her former employers that had caused her tacitly to accept the alternative which wildes scheme offered her be that as it may she had apparently raised no protest when the scheme was first mooted nor subsequently what sort of life she was really looking forward to upon the island for which we were about to search i do not believe that even she herself could have explained probably her philosophy might have been expressed in the phrase sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof she soon discovered however that the future would not permit itself to be shelved in this offhand fashion there were certain problems that persisted in thrusting themselves upon her notice with increasing frequency and one of them wasmarriage the idea of creating a utopia necessarily included that of establishing the home life and domestic happiness there were two men in particular who forced her to give some thought to this detail one of whom was wilde and the other an able seaman named gurneythe latter quite as remarkable a man in his way as was wilde in his though the ways of the two men were totally dissimilar for gurney while wonderfully popular with his mates in the forecastle was so entirely different from them in every respect that they admiringly nicknamed him the swell which will perhaps enable the reader to make a mental sketch of him he and wilde had both made formal proposals of marriage to miss hartleythe ceremony to be performed as speedily as might be after our arrival at utopia but she had thus far accepted neither although as might be expected of the two men she was rather disposed to favour gurney wilde however was not at all the sort of man to accept a rebuff tamely indeed his vanity was so stupendous that he could not understand another being preferred before himself he consequently plagued the poor girl so persistently that at length in desperation she came aft to me laying all the circumstances before me and begging my protection i answered by directing her to remove herself bag and baggage to the after cabin assigning to her one of the spare staterooms therein and permitting her to take her meals at the cabin table whereby i greatly strengthened wildes enmity toward me but at the same time secured two devoted adherents namely the girl and gurney and a time cameas i sometimes suspected it wouldwhen i was more than glad to have them on my side instead of against me chapter six the derelict dutch barque nothing further of any importance occurred until having worked our way slowly up past the west and northwest coast of australia we found ourselves to the northward of the ombay passage the entrance of which or rather savou island which may be said to lie in the fairway of the southern entrancei hit off to a hair much to my own secret gratification and the admiration of the boatswain and carpenter then one night toward the end of the middle watch the wind having fallen very light the carpenter whose watch it happened to be came down below in a great state of perturbation to inform me that although nothing could be seen all hands had been terribly alarmed by the sound of a bell tolling at no great distance my first thought upon hearing this news was of a bell buoy marking the position of some dangerous rock or shoal toward which we might be drifting but i quickly dismissed that idea for bell buoys were much less numerous in those days than they are now moreover there was no mention of any such thing on the chart or in the directory i therefore came to the conclusion that there must be some other cause for the sounds and without waiting to don any of my day clothing went on deck to investigate upon stepping out on deck the reason why nothing could be seen at once became apparent for the night was as dark as a wolfs mouthso dark indeed that even after i had been up on the poop long enough for my eyes to become accustomed to the darkness nothing was visible save the feeble light of the lowturned cabin lamps shining through the skylight the faint glow of the binnacle lamps upon the helmsmans face and hands and the upper part of the wheel and the ghostly image of some twelve feet of the mainmast part of the fife rail round it and such portions of the running gear as were belayed to the pins therein all glimmering uncertainly in as much of the cabin light as made its way out on deck through the door by which i had emerged beyond these patches of dim illumination and the coming and going of a spark on the forecastle where one of the watch sucked meditatively at his pipe all was opaque darkness unrelieved by even the occasional glimpse of so much as a solitary star the night was as quiet as it was dark for the wind light all through the preceding twenty hours had at length fallen away to nothing and the ship was motionless save for the slight heave of the swell which stealing along through the blackness would occasionally take her under the counter and give her a gentle lift that would cause all her spars to creak and her canvas to rustle with a pattering of reefpoints a jerk and rattle of hemp and chain sheets and a faint click of cabin doors upon their hooks the whole accompanied perhaps with a discordant bang of the wheel chains to the kick of the rudder as the black water swirled and gurgled round it in the midst of it all there would come the clear metallic clang of a bella single stroke as though someone away out there in the offing were tolling for a funeral it was a ships bell that was being struck there could be no doubt about that but why was it being tolled that was the question that puzzled me and as i could clearly see had excited the superstitious alarm of the carpenter and the hands forward the sound was so clear and distinct that i felt convinced it must emanate from a craft at no very great distance and chips and i accordingly united our voices in a stentorian hail of ship ahoy repeating it at least half a dozen times but no reply came to us out of the darkness save the occasional ting of the bell nor was any light shown to indicate the whereabouts of our mysterious neighbour this being the case and feeling satisfied that the stranger could do us no harm so long as she came no closer to us than she was i instructed chips to report the matter to the boatswain when the latter came on deck at eight bells requesting him to keep a sharp lookout during the remaining hours of darkness and to call me at daylight and then went back to my cabin and turned in again i had scarcely closed my eyes as it seemed to me when i was awakened by polson who was shaking me by the shoulder as he reported its just gone four bells mr troubridge and theres daylight enough abroad to show us that the ringin that have been worryin us comes from a barque bout half a mile to the eastard of us her mizenmast is over the side and she looks as if she might have been afire but i dont see nobody aboard of her except the chap whats hangin over the poop rail and its him that seems to be tollin the bell all right boatswain i replied ill be on deck directly and take my bath as usual under the headpump after which we will have a good look at our neighbour springing out of my bunk i passed through the main cabin out on deck and so forward into the eyes of the ship where one of the watch having rigged the headpump in readiness for washing decks sluiced me for a couple of minutes with clear cool sparkling salt water the refreshment from this exhilarating shower bath after a night spent in a close sleepingcabin was indescribable and having given myself a good towelling i returned aft to my cabin to dress for the day taking a cursory glance at the strange barque as i went as the boatswain had said she was about half a mile distant from us and her mizenmast was over the side still fast to the hull by the rigging which had not been cut away half an hour later having given the scrubbers time to get off the poop i once more hied me on deck this time taking the ships telescope with me and now seating myself upon a convenient hencoop i proceeded to acquire as much knowledge of the stranger as was to be obtained with the aid of a reasonably good set of lenses i saw that the vessel was a craft of probably a trifle over three hundred tons her hull painted green from her rail down to her zinc sheathing she was lying in such a position that the mercury was broad on her port bow and my first glimpse of her showed that she carried a name upon her headboards which name after a while i made out to be braave she was therefore doubtless dutch for a little while after that i was unable to make out anything further about her for she lay right in the wake of the newly risen sun the dazzle of which obliterated all detail but after the lapse of about a quarter of an hour the sun crept a trifle away to the south of her while some slight movement on the part of both vessels helped me then although her port side was still in shadow a dark stain on the green paint beneath one of her scuppers attracted my attention and set me wondering what it could possibly be for there was a sinister suggestiveness about its appearance that i did not want to accept i could still see nobody about her decks although the time was now long past when her crew ought to have been stirring nor was there the faintest film of smoke issuing from her galley chimney yet it seemed that she could scarcely be abandoned for she carried two boats at her davits one on each quarter while there were two more bottomup on the gallows abaft the mainmast and unless i was greatly mistaken i could make out the longboat stowed on top of the main hatch with the jollyboat in her but i could not be certain of this for the vessels decks seemed to be lumbered up most unaccountably just in that part of her as i was looking at her she canted a bit bringing her poop into clearer view and then i was able to see that as the boatswain had said there appeared to be a solitary figure up there hanging over the rail in a most extraordinary posture close alongside the ships bell which still most persistently tolled a single stroke at irregular intervals once when the craft rolled toward us i thought i caught a glimpse of what might possibly be a hole in her poop deck just where the mizenmast had once been stepped but these imperfect glimpses which were all that i was just then able to get were so full of suggestion that as soon as the watch had finished washing the decks the weather still being fine with no sign of wind i had the smallest of our quarter boats lowered and jumping into her with a couple of hands pushed off for the stranger determined to pay her a visit and thus either confirm or banish certain suspicions that were beginning to arise within my mind ten minutes sufficed us to cover the stretch of oilsmooth sea that lay between the mercury and the braave when passing beneath the stern of the latter in order to reach her starboard side i again read her name carved in fourinch letters upon her counter with the word amsterdam her port of registry then as we cleared her stern and ranged up alongside her starboard main chains with her green side staring at us in the full blaze of the tropical sunlight my eye was again caught by a dark rustylooking stain beneath one of her scuppers similar to what i had already observed through the mercurys telescope i recognised it for what it was and what i had all along suspected but had refused to acknowledge it to beblood dried blood that had been shed so freely that it had poured out through the scupper holes the man who was pulling stroke standing up in the boat and facing forward fishermanfashion caught sight of the sinister stain almost as soon as i did and exclaimed as he laid in his oar with a clatter on the thwart jerusher see that sir see that tom smother me if it aint blood now whats been happenin aboard this here ghastly hooker i am afraid i can make a pretty shrewd guess i answered but let us wait until we can get a glimpse of what is to be seen between her bulwarks make fast your painter round one of her deadeyes and then follow me aboard so saying i sprang into her main chains and from thence made my way inboard the moment that my head rose above her rail a horrible odour of which my nostrils had already caught a faint hint smote me almost as something solid and looking down upon the main deck the waist of her seemed to be full of dead bodies their clothing smeared and splashed with blood while that part of the deck whereon they lay was deeply dyed and crusted with the same deep rusty stain as i gazed petrified with horror the bell upon the poop once more clanged loudly and glancing upward i saw that the figure which i had already observed lolling in so odd an attitude over the poop rail was that of a dead man grasping in his right hand the short length of rope attached to the clapper of the bell his attitude was such that as the ship swung upon the swell his body moved just sufficiently to cause the clapper to strike a single stroke for the first few seconds after i had found myself standing upon the ensanguined deck planks of that floating charnel house i had no eyes for anything save the spectacle of her slaughtered crew lying there at my feet in every conceivable attitude indicative of the unspeakable agony and terror that had distracted their last conscious moments then as the two seamen who had accompanied me from the mercury swung themselves in over the rail and came to my side muttering ejaculations of horror and dismay at the ghastly spectacle that met their gaze i pulled myself together with a wrench and mounting to the poop began to take in the general details of the scene standing as i now was at the head of the starboard poop ladder i commanded a complete view of the vessels deck from stem to stern and saw that my original estimate of her size was rather under than above the mark her dimensions being those of a vessel of fully three hundred and fifty tons from certain details of her build and equipment i set her down as being at least fifty years old but she was still apparently quite sound as to hull spars and rigging and had been evidently well taken care of she mounted eight twelvepounders upon her main deck four in each battery but they were all secured and i could see nothing to suggest that she had recently fought an action with another ship on the contrary all the evidence was in favour of the assumption that her people had been taken completely by surprisemost probably during the night that she had been boarded by pirates malays or chinese all hands ruthlessly massacred and the ship then plundered and set on fire these last assumptions were based upon the facts that her longboat which from the deck of the mercury had appeared to be stowed over the main hatchhad been shifted over to the port side of the deck the hatches removed and a quantity of her cargo broken out and hoisted up on deck where it now lay a confused jumble of merchandise and of torn bales and shattered packages piled high on the starboard side of the hatchway a yawning fireblackened cavity in the poop where the mizenmast had stood showed that she had been on fire in the cabin but that the fire had somehow become extinguished before it had had time to get a firm hold upon the hull the condition of the bodies of the murdered crew seemed to indicate that the tragedy must have occurred some time within the preceding fortyeight hours apparently she had been under all plain sail when the thing happened descending again to the main deck and calling upon the two seamen from the mercury to follow me i next entered the poop cabin which i found to be arranged after the manner that was very usual at that time access to the main cabin was gained by a narrow passage some nine feet in length on the port side of which and next the ships side was a stateroom which was easily identifiable as that belonging to the chief mate while on the starboard side of the passage was the stewards pantry at the inner end of the passage was a doorway the door being open and hooked back against the bulkhead and passing through this doorway one found oneself in the main cabin an apartment some thirty feet long with three staterooms on each side of it abaft that again was the sailroom wellstocked with bolts of canvas of varying degrees of coarseness and several sails many of which seemed to be quite new neatly rolled up into long bundles stopped with spunyarn and each labelled legibly with the description of the sail forward of the main cabin on the starboard side and separated by a stout bulkhead from the stewards pantry was the captains cabin a fine roomy comfortable apartment neatly and conveniently fitted up with a standing bedplace having a capacious chest of drawers beneath it a washstand at the foot of the berth and a small flap table against the foreandaft bulkhead at which the skipper could sit to write up his log or make his daily astronomical calculations there were two entrances to this stateroom one from the main cabin and one directly from the main deck and in the fore bulkhead there was a window through which while still lying in his bunk the skipper could see everything that was happening out on deck these observations occupied me nearly half an hour but the moment that i entered the main cabin my nostrils were assailed by the smell of recently extinguished fire and upon looking about me i finally came to the conclusion that the fire had not been intentional but the result of accident the miscreants who had boarded the vessel had apparently been all over her in search of anything that might be worth carrying away and among other places they had explored the lazarette which lay beneath the cabin a small hatchway just abaft the mizenmast giving access to it this hatchway we found open and the general appearance of the cabin seemed to indicate that the depredators had roused up a number of barrels and cases and broken them open for the purpose of ascertaining what they contained i conjectured that among the articles broached must have been a cask of spirits which had been accidentally set on fire the fire had burnt away a portion of the cabin deck partially destroyed the cabin table severely scorched and charred the paintwork generally and had evidently burnt the lower part of the mizenmast and the deck in which it was stepped so completely away that the mast had gone over the side to the roll of the ship why it had not spread farther and entirely destroyed the ship i could not imagine the plunderers had practically cleared the lazarette of its contents the chronometer the ships papers and the captains charts and sextant were missing but upon investigating the state of affairs out on deck it did not appear that they had taken very much if any of the ships cargo but we could not find any weapons or ammunition of any kind if therefore the ship had carried anything of the sort the pirates had cleared the whole of it out of her after giving the craft a pretty thorough overhaul fore and aft and making a number of notes of my most important discoveries i eventually came to the conclusion that the vessel had been surprised and laid aboard during the night that her crew had been mustered and secured most likely with a guard over them and that after the pirates had taken all that they cared for out of the ship they had brutally murdered all hands it now became a nice question with me whatif anythingi ought to do with this bloodstained derelict although she had lost her mizenmast there was nothing to prevent her being navigated to a port and had the circumstances been different i should have called for volunteers and made an effort to induce a crew to undertake the navigation of her to say batavia with the idea of claiming salvage but i had come to know by this time that no eloquence of mine even though it were backed up by the prospect of a handsome sum of salvage money would be powerful enough to wean the crew of the mercury from their cherished idea of a life of ease and independence upon some fair tropic island to say nothing of their fear of what would follow upon the discovery of their unlawful appropriation of the ship and cargo to their own use and service i therefore very quickly yet none the less unwillingly abandoned that idea and proceeded to consider the merits of the only alternatives left me namely those of destroying her and of leaving her just as we had found herexcepting of course that in the latter case sentiment demanded the decent and reverential burial of her murdered crew considering the latter alternative first if we left her drifting about the ocean what was likely to happen on the one hand she might be fallen in with by another ship and taken into a port but on the other hand it was equally likely that she might become a death trap to some other craft athwart whose hawse she might drift on some black and stormy night and whose bows would be stove in and destroyed by violent collision with her or she might be swamped and founder in the next gale that she encountered taking all things into consideration i at length came to the conclusion that the best thing to be done was to scuttle her and so render it impossible for her to become a menace to other craft accordingly summoning my two men who were below exploring the forecastle and fore peak i jumped into the gig and pulled back aboard the mercury where i arrived just as the steward was bringing the cabin breakfast aft as we sat at table partaking of the meal i related to polson and tudsbery all that i had seen and done aboard the dutchman and informed them of the decision at which i had arrived with regard to her directing the carpenter to take a boats crew and his auger immediately after breakfast go on board and scuttle her by boring several holes through her bottom below the water line both men fully agreed with me that this was the right and proper thing to do and at the conclusion of the meal chips set about the making of his preparations somewhat to my surprise however when a little later he came aft with his tools he was followed by four men instead of the modest two with which i had contented myself who preceded him down the side into the boat when he reached the braave instead of being absent ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the utmost which would have afforded him ample time to do all that was necessary the whole five of them vanished from sight and were not again seen until after the lapse of a full hour or more they once more showed themselves on the deck of the derelict passing a quantity of things down her side into the boat finally about half an hour later still they returned to the mercury considerably the worse for drink and with the boat loaded down to her gunwale with bolts of canvas new sails and other oddments that they had appropriated of course there was no actual harm in their bringing these things away from the dutchman because had they left them on board they must have gone to the bottom with her and thus have been wasted but i felt that chips might as well have paid me the compliment of first mentioning his intentions to me i was even more annoyed that the carpenter occupying as he did a position of authorityof however shadowy a characterhad not only permitted the men to partake pretty freely of the drink which they had found but had evidently not scrupled to partake of it with them i came to the conclusion however that my remonstrance would be likely to be a good deal more effective if addressed to him later on instead of at the moment when he was under the influence of the liquor therefore i said nothing to him beyond briefly enquiring how many holes he had bored in the ship and where and suggesting to him the advisability of retiring to his bunk to sleep for an hour or two which advice he seemed more than halfinclined to resent but ultimately followed in a somewhat belligerent mood chapter seven embayed it soon became perfectly evident that muddled with drink though he undoubtedly was chips had very effectively executed his work of destruction aboard the braave for in half an hour she had sunk to the extent of very nearly three strakes of her planking and within the hour she had brought her chainplate bolts flush with the water at which rate another three hours should suffice to see the last of her before that moment arrived however a little air of wind came along out from the westward and with our port braces slightly checked we began to creep away on a nornoreast course for boeroe strait but our progress was so slow that at noon the derelict was still hullup to the southward sunk to the level of her coveringboard and when after dinner i returned to the poop and took the glass to search for her she was nowhere to be seen although had she still been afloat her spars and canvas at least should have been visible above the horizon although the braave had vanished she had left behind her a small legacy of annoyance for me for while i was still searching the horizon for some sign of her continued existence i became aware of certain raucous sounds issuing from the forecastle which i was quickly able to identify as the maudlin singing which seamen are so prone to indulge in when they are the worse for liquor presently polson who had gone forward to turnto the watch after dinner came aft with an expression of vexation upon his weatherbeaten countenance and explained that the carpenters boats crew having smuggled aboard several bottles of schiedam from the scuttled vessel all hands forward had become just sufficiently fuddled to render them indifferent to such authority as under the peculiar circumstances of the case we were still able to exercise over them and had flatly refused to come on deck declaring with much abuse of the boatswain that they did not intend to do any more work until they had finished the drink which still remained how much have they polson i asked i dunno sir he answered i tried to find out but the scowbanks wouldnt tell me i fancies however that they havent got so very much for i dont see how four menor even five if you chooses to reckon chips in with emcould ha brought moren about a dozen bottles aboard among em without our findin out somethin about it and a dozen bottles wont go so very far among all hands i reckon that theyll finish the lot in the course of the next hour or so and then theyll all turn in and have a good sleep and be ready to come on deck in time for the first watch luckily there aint no more wind than what we knows what to do with and not much sign of it freshenin so far as i can see so prhaps there wont be such a very terrible lot o harm done ater all possibly not i agreed but i went on seizing the opportunity to point a moral that is merely a happy accident had it been blowing hard and the weather threatening it would probably not have made the slightest difference in the conduct of those men you and chips by listening to and falling in with the fantastic proposals of that madman wilde have set the men a very bad example the effect of which is bound to recoil on your own heads sooner or later by taking part in the seizure of this ship you have broken the law which is the mainstay of all authority order and discipline and in doing so you have encouraged those ignorant creatures forard to become lawless and disobedient i have pointed all this out to you before polson and now you have an examplea very mild example it is trueof what inevitably happens under such circumstances yes i sees what you mean mr troubridge answered the boatswain but lor bless yer sir i dont think nothin at all of a little spree like this here disciplines a firstrate thing i admit but a man can have too much of it and it does him good to chuck it overboard now and again them chaps forard wont be none the worse for this here little outbreak of theirs youll see we all enjys a bit o liberty occasionally you know ay answered i rather bitterly the mischief of it is polson that when men in the position of those noisy rascals in the forecastle take it upon themselves to determine when and for how long a time they shall indulge in a spell of liberty they are as likely as not to insist upon having it at a moment when it spells disaster for other people liberty is a grand thing in theory and within certain welldefined limits but when it becomes licenceas it is very apt to doit is a bad thing for all concerned well sir you may be right or you may be wrong i dont know never havin had any eddication but mr wilde hes an eddicated man and hes all for liberty and equality and i dont mind sayin as i prefers his notions to yours very well i said go your own way polson since go you will but i wouldnt mind betting the sailormans favourite wagera farthings worth of silver spoonsthat before another year has passed over your head you will alter your tune take care that you do not defer the alteration until it is too late and the mischief has become irrevocable now it happened that wilde was among a great many other things a stanch teetotaller he was also an excessively nervous person when he with the rest of the emigrants came on deck after dinner upon this particular day and heard the maudlin drunken singing in the forecastle and furthermore recognised that the ship was for the time being at least without a crew he fell into a tremendous rage and rushing forward precipitated himself into the forecastle where believing that the crew drunk would accord to him the same reverential attention that they were wont to do when sober he proceeded to reproach and revile them in no measured terms for their lapse from virtue actually going to the length before anybody could stop him of smashing half a dozen bottles of schiedam that he caught sight of snugly stowed away in a bunk so long as he confined himself to merely verbal remonstrance and abuse the men listened to him with the vacuous good humoured smile of intoxication occasionally interrupting him with an invitation to join them in their bacchanalian orgy but when he took what they deemed a base advantage of their good nature by smashing the bottles and wasting the liquor that one of the revellers had incautiously revealed to him in support of the jovial invitation their good humour suddenly evaporated and staggering to their feet in indignation they would probably have done the man a serious injury had they been capable of following him up on deck whither he precipitately fled then having learned during his brief visit to the forecastle that the carpenter was the chief culprit he rushed into the latters cabin mercilessly aroused poor chips from the profound sleep that was gradually clearing his muddled brain and tonguelashed the bewildered man until he must have scarcely known whether he was upon his head or his heels fortunately for the schoolmaster chipss indiscretion had been a mild one indeed compared with those of the forecastle hands and he therefore accepted wildes rebukes with a tolerably good grace and in silence but wilde was one of those enthusiasts who carry even their virtues to excess and his denunciations of chips were of so virulent and extravagant a character that they did more harm than good andas i discovered later onconverted tudsbery from a blindly faithful disciple into a sullen more than halfdoubting and reluctant follower the incident ended as polson had anticipated that it would in all hands coming on deck at the end of the first dogwatch and clearing their brains by plunging their heads into buckets of sea water after which the boatswain went forward and gave them all a mild and more than half goodhumoured dressingdown at the same time telling them one or two home truths in a tersely sarcastic strain that was far more effective than wildes rabidly intolerant language which lost its point with those to whom it was addressed chiefly because of its violent exaggeration through which he contrived in a few minutes to lose a measure of influence that it cost him months of strenuous endeavour to regain only partially the fact is that this incident comparatively trifling and harmless in its character as it was led some of the men to question whether they had not thrown off the mild and easy restraints of lawful discipline only to subject themselves to the grinding tyranny of a single individual of impulsive temper and overbearing disposition the sun went down that evening in a sky that glowed like molten copper and was streaked with long tatters of smokylooking cloud which seemed to presage both a windy and a dark night to my great anxiety for the ship was now navigating a comparatively restricted area of landlocked sea the chart of which was dottedmuch too thickly for my peace of mindwith dangers of various descriptions the names of many of which when they bore any names at all were coupled with that sinister caution pd warning the mariner that the position as laid down upon the chart was doubtful and that therefore an especially good lookout must be maintained lest it should be blundered upon unawares these hints as to the necessity for exceptionally careful navigation were supplemented by a further warning given in the directory to the effect that not only were the positions of many of the dangers shown upon the chart exceedingly doubtful but also that the existence of other dangers not indicated at all upon the chart was very strongly suspected the exhaustive study which i had given to both the chart and the directory had so very effectually impressed upon me the vital necessity for the exercise of the most extreme caution henceforward that being yet very young and quite new to the heavy load of responsibility imposed upon me i was perhaps more anxious than there was any actual need for under the pressure of this anxiety i went below again produced the chart and very carefully laid down upon it the course and distance as indicated by the compass and log which the ship had travelled since noon i did this chiefly because i had already ascertained that there lay in the ships path two known dangers the positions of which were doubtful and what i had just done resulted in the discovery that should the wind freshen sufficiently during the night to increase the speed of the ship to more than six knots we were likely enough to approach within perilous proximity of those dangers before daylight of the next morning accordingly i mentioned this fact to both polson and tudsbery cautioning them to shorten sail in good time and to call me should the wind freshen as it seemed likely to do during the hours of darkness as a matter of fact not only did the wind freshen during the first watch but it also hauled round over the port quarter increasing our speed so greatly that at length when the watch was called at midnight ihaving kept the deck in my anxietytook the precaution of shortening sail to the three topsails and fore topmast staysail thus ensuring as i confidently believed that we should keep well clear of those pestilent dangers while the darkness lasted then to add further to my anxieties a drizzling rain came driving down upon us thickening the atmosphere to such an extent that it became impossible to see anything beyond a ships length distant and after driving along through this at a speed of about five knots for the next four hours my nervousness became so great that i gave orders to bring the ship to the wind and heave her to determining to await the return of daylight before attempting any further progress at length a faint paling of the intense darkness astern proclaimed that the long nightwet hot steamy and altogether unpleasantwas drawing to an end and simultaneously the rain ceased enabling us to discard the oilskins and souwesters in which we had been stewing all night i took mine down on to the main deck and hung them up to drain and dry on a hook commonly used to hook back the starboard door giving access to the poop cabins then feeling exceedingly weary with my allnight vigilfor i had never been off the deck since sunseti went to my own cabin for a few minutes and filling the wash basin with cold fresh water indulged in the luxury of a good wash which had the effect of considerably refreshing me this done i returned to the poop meeting polsonwhose watch it wasat the head of the poop ladder oh here you are sir he exclaimed in accents of evident relief i was just upon the pint of goin down to ask ye to come on deck again indeed said i have there been any fresh developments then during the two or three minutes that i have been below well i dunno know much about developments mr troubridge replied the boatswain but turn your ear to windard sir and tell me if you hears anything at all out of the common why i demanded do you hear anything in particular and as requested i turned my head in a listening attitude even during my brief absence from the deck the sky away to the eastward had paled perceptibly and there was already light enough abroad to enable one not only to distinguish all the principal details of the ships hull and rigging but also to render visible the heaving surface of the sea for the distance of perhaps a couple of cables lengths which was as far as the eye could penetrate the still somewhat misty atmosphere as i glanced outboard my attention was instantly arrested by the short choppy tumble of the water and its colour which was a pale chalky blue why polson i exclaimed what has happened to the sea during the night look at the colour of it andharksurely that cannot be the sound of broken water so youve catched it mr troubridge have ye sir the man replied well you hadnt scarcely got down off the poop just now afore i thought i heard someat o the sort but i couldnt be sure and what you told us last night about them there shoals thats supposed to be somewheres ahead of us have been stickin in my mind all night and makin me ah did ye hear that sir he broke off suddenly again the peculiar shaling sound as of water breaking over some deeply submerged obstruction came floating down to me from to windward yes polson i certainly thought i did answered i in a state of considerable alarm and to tell you the honest truth i dont half like it any more than i do the movement and colour of the water let them get the hand lead and take a cast of it ay ay mr troubridge i will thats the proper thing to do responded the boatswain as he bustled away down on to the main deck and wended his way forward to bring up the leadline the ship was already hoveto there should therefore be no difficulty in obtaining absolutely accurate soundings in another couple of minutes a man was stationed in the weather fore chains with the line coiled in his hand and the lead weight its foot duly armed with tallow sweeping in long swings close over the surface of the water preparatory to being cast presently the weight shot forward and plunged into the sea a fathom or two ahead of the ship the coils of thin line leapt from the leadsmans hand and as the ship surged slowly ahead the line slackened showing that the lead had reached bottom and the leadsman bringing the sounding line up and down proclaimed the deptheighteen fathoms eighteen fathoms ejaculated i in horrified accents to polson who had rejoined me that means polson that we are already on top of one of those dangers that i was speaking about last night jump forard man at once clear away the starboard anchor ready for letting go and bend the cable to it and hurry about it my good fellow as you value your life we may need to anchor at any moment in order to save the ship the daylight was by this time coming fast and it was possible to see with tolerable distinctness all round the ship to as great a distance as the haziness of the atmosphere would permit still at intervals there seemed to float down upon the pinions of the warm steamy wind that curious suggestionfor it was scarcely moreof the sound of breaking water but if it were indeed an actual sound and not an illusion of the senses what did it mean had we already become embayed or entangled among an intricacy of reefs and shoals during the night or had we in some marvellous fashion blundered past or through them in the darkness and were already leaving them behind us as i stood on the poop asking myself these questions and sending my glances into the mist that enshrouded the ocean on all sides of me i fancied that i again caught the mysterious sound which resembled that of breaking water but this time it seemed to come from ahead and looking in that direction i presently became aware of a line of spectral whiteness stretching right athwart our hawse that seemed to come and go even as i watched it stand by to wear ship i shouted as the watch sprang to the braces i signed to the man who was tending the wheel to put it hard up the ship with her fore topsail aback slowly fell off until she was running dead before the wind then just as she was coming to on the other tack the mist lifted for a moment and i caught a glimpse of a vast expanse of white water foaming and spouting and boiling dead ahead of and as it seemed to me close aboard of us lay aft here some of you and haul out the spanker i shouted flow your fore topmast staysail sheet to help her to come to and call all hands to make sail round in upon your after lee braces board your fore and main tacks polson we are on a lee shore here and must claw off if we can the furious battering of the boatswains handspike upon the fore scuttle brought up the watch below with a rush and the sight of the white water close to leewardcaught by them the moment that they came on deckwas a hint to them stronger than any words of the necessity for haste causing them to spring about the decks with a display of activity very unusual on the part of the merchant seaman in a few minutes the ship having come to on the starboard tack and brought the breakers square off her lee beam the fore and main tacks were boarded the sheets hauled aft and half a dozen of the hands were in the weather rigging on their way aloft to loose the topgallantsails and royals while two more were laying out upon the jibbooms to loose the jibs meanwhile i had sprung into the lee mizen rigging and from that situation was anxiously scanning the sea ahead and upon the lee bow to my great relief i presently saw that the ship was looking up high enough to justify the hope that she would claw off from the danger that menaced her to leeward the sea being merely a short irregular popple with no weight in it to set us down toward the white water meanwhile the hand in the chains was continuing to take casts of the lead as fast as he could haul in the line with the result that we seemed to be maintaining our depth of about eighteen fathoms over a rocky bottomcomposed of coral as i had no doubt from the peculiar whitishblue tint of the water by the time that the topgallantsails royals jibs and staysails had been set it had become broad daylight and a few minutes later the sun rose above a heavy bank of thunderouslooking cloud that lay stretched along the eastern horizon dispersing the mist that had hitherto obscured the atmosphere and affording us an extended prospect of our surroundings the scene thus disclosed was alarming enough for when in order to obtain as wide a view as possible i ascended to the fore topmast crosstrees i discovered to my consternation that we were in a sort of lake of very irregular shape measuring about eight miles east and west by perhaps twelve miles north and south surrounded on all sides by extensive patches of broken water with narrow and more or less intricately winding channels of clear water between them how on earth we had contrived to blunder blindfold into such a trap of a place in the darkness and thickness of the past night without touching one or another of the countless reefs by which we were surrounded passed my comprehension although i believed i could make out the channel by which we had entered far away to windward if i were right in my conjecture we must have hoveto when we were about three or four miles to windward of everything and then have driven while still hoveto along the channel and finally into the lakelike expanse of comparatively deep water missing destruction a dozen times or more during the passage by a sheer miracle now being in the trap the problem to be solved was how to get out of it again glancing round me i could see nothing but broken water extending right out to the horizon look which way i would with the object of extending my view i ascended to the royal yard but even at this elevation the prospect was no more encouraging yet stay surely that dark streak away there on the northern horizon was blue water yes the longer i looked at itthat thin thread of dark colour barely visible and broken here and there by intervening white patches must be open water furthermore it was to leeward and therefore to be reached much more quickly and easily than the open water which we had left behind us sometime during the night and to return to which it would be necessary for us to beat to windward through a more or less intricate and difficult channel it was undoubtedly true that somewhere out there to windward there existed a channel carrying a sufficient depth of water to float the ship for she had already passed through it but our difficulty would be to pick that particular channel out from among the many intersecting streaks of unbroken water that showed so elusively among the breakers and if it were possible to hit off that channel or indeed any channel leading without a break into clear water was the wind sufficiently free to enable us to lay our course along it without breaking tacks i doubted it very much and if not or if at a critical moment the wind should shift a point or two the ship must inevitably go ashore and become a wreck for i could nowhere see a channel wide enough to allow the ship to work in arguing thus i soon came to the conclusion that i must look to leeward for the channel that must conduct us to open water and safety i accordingly directed my gaze northward and for some time my eyes searched that vast expanse of seething whiteness for an unbroken channel leading out into blue water from the lagoonlike sheet of water across which the mercury was then ratching but all in vain for while there were plenty of channels leading from the lagoon through the broken water to leeward not one of them seemed to be continuous all the way across the reef and right out to blue water they intersected merged into and branched off from each other in the most bewildering fashion and there were at least half a dozen that seemed to lead into open water but i quite failed to trace a connection between them and those that led out of the lagoon at length however when the ship had reached the easternmost extremity of the lagoon and the moment had arrived when it became necessary for us to go about and retrace our steps we suddenly opened out a small patch of unbroken water away to the northeastward with a clear welldefined channel leading from it to the open sea while i was still regarding this part of the reef i caught a momentary glimpse of another channel leading into the small patch of unbroken water and intently following its course i presently became convinced that it was continuous with a channel that opened out close ahead of us and broad on our lee bow this channel was exceedingly narrow and tortuous but a rapid survey of it satisfied me that the wind was free enough to allow the ship to traverse it and i at once determined to make the attempt there was no time for hesitation whatever was to be done must be done at once i therefore hailed polson to keep the ship away a couple of points and a minute later the mercury had slid into the channel and was sweeping rapidly along it to the northeast for good or for evil the die was cast for the direction of the wind and the exceeding narrowness of the channel precluded any possibility of return and a couple of hours would now decide the momentous question whether or not we were to bring the whole adventure to a premature conclusion by leaving our bones and those of the ship on that deadly coral reef chapter eight the pirate junks to con a ship into and along a narrow winding channel with no possibility of return and with the certain knowledge that the slightest mistake the smallest error of judgment meant the destruction of the vessel and the drowning of every individual on board her was nervous work for a lad of my years as i stood there on the royal yard with my arm round the masthead to steady myself upon my somewhat precarious perch and my gaze concentrated upon the thin line of unbroken water that twisted hither and thither through the seething turmoil of yeasty froth swirling and boiling on either hand i burst into a drenching perspiration for it must be remembered that i had assumed the enormous responsibility of plunging the ship into the inextricable situation which i have indicated upon the impulse of a moment generated by a conviction that in no other manner could we hope to escape from the labyrinth of shoals in which we had become involved furthermore i had been spurred to the act by the hope rather than the certainty that the channel along which we were now sweeping with what to my apprehensiveness seemed headlong speed offered us an unobstructed passage to open water yet now when retreat was impossible i began to fear that i had been fatally mistaken for at a certain spot in the channel along which i proposed to take the ship i saw that the water which happened to have been unbroken at the instant when i arrived at my momentous decision was now all aboil with foam for a space of three or four shipslengths as though an impassable obstruction existed there if this were the case but one slender hope remained for us the hope that before that obstruction should be reached we might find a part of the channel wide enough to permit the ship to roundto and anchor thus giving us time to make a more deliberate search for a way of escape this hope however was an exceedingly slender one for the channel which we were traversing was appallingly narrow averaging very little more than a couple of lengths of the ship which was considerably less than half the minimum space that i required for the contemplated manoeuvre but while i was anxiously searching the channel ahead on the lookout for such a spot i suddenly caught sight of another channel branching out of the one which we were then traversing which unquestionably ran without a break into the small patch of open water of which i have already spoken and from which a good channel led into the open sea the only question was whether there was room enough to allow the ship to take the sweep out of the one channel into the other without going ashore upon the reef for the new channel branched off at a very acute angle and there appeared to be even less width than usual at the junction of the two channels here was another momentous question for me to decide unaided in the space of a few secondsfor there was not time enough to permit of my summoning the boatswain aloft and consulting him upon the matter i had to make up my mind whether to continue along the channel which the ship was then in trusting that the appearance indicative of an obstruction was illusory or whether i would take the risk of wrecking the ship on the reef in an endeavour to pass round a very acute angle into the newlydiscovered channel which i was by this time able to see would certainly enable us to reach open water it was difficult to determine which of the two alternatives was the more desperate but as the ship went driving along toward the point once past which a choice would no longer be possible i fancied that the prospect of being able to turn into the new channel looked a trifle less hopeless than it did a few minutes earlier while the appearance of an obstruction in the original channel was still as menacing as ever i therefore determined to put all to the hazard of the die and make the attempt to get into the new channel this decision arrived at i hailed polson to send all hands to their stations in readiness to brace round the yards smartly at the word of command and for the helmsman to respond instantly to my signals for the manipulation of the wheel then as we rushed down toward the turningpoint i caused the ship to be edged gradually up to windward until her weather side was all but scraping the coral of the reef in order to secure every possible inch of turningspace at the same time narrowly watching the channel ahead that i might be able to determine accurately the precise moment when to shift the helm twice or thrice in as many seconds did my courage fail me and all but determine me to take the risk of keeping straight head but when the critical moment arrived i was once more master of myself and was able to give the order hard up with your helm brail in the spanker and shiver the mizen topsail polson recognising the necessity for prompt action at the helm had sent a second hand to the wheel and at the first sound of my voice these two men sent the wheel spinning hard over with all their united strength while at the same moment the men tending the after braces had relieved the ship of the pressure of the whole of the canvas upon her mizenmast the craft accordingly swerved away from the wind with almost the alacrity of a living thing and the next moment she was swirling round as though upon a pivot shaving the obstructive angle of the reef by a hairbreadth and coming to with the wind over the starboard quarter when the rounding of her port bow was actually dashing aside the white water while i clung to my masthead in fear and trembling waiting for the shock which should tell me that she had struck as a matter of fact she actually did very slightly graze the coral for a few feet of her length just beneath the port main chains for i afterwards saw the marks upon her sheathing but it was the merest touch the shock of which was scarcely perceptible and the next moment she had luffed fair into the centre of the new channel and was speeding away to the northward and eastward this new channel was so exceedingly narrow and tortuous that the vessel still needed the most careful watching but compared with that sharp turn the remaining portion of the navigation was simple and a trifle over two hours later i had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the mercury sweep clear of the edge of the reef into blue water and to feel her once more rising and falling upon the swell of the open ocean then i made my way down on deck and having given the officer of the watch the course retired to the cabin to enjoy a good breakfast before lying down to recover some of my arrears of rest at noon on the fifth day after this exceedingly awkward adventure our latitude as computed from the meridian altitude of the sun showed that we had fairly cleared the molucca passage and had reached the waters wherein our search for the ideal island pictured by wildes vivid imagination was to begin i therefore gave orders for the ship to be brought to the wind on the starboard tack and we plunged into the vast north pacific ocean shortly afterward sighting the tulur islands on our lee beam in the course of the next day we sighted and passed two groups of islands within twenty miles of each other standing in close enough to each to enable us to form a pretty accurate idea of their character but they were altogether too small and insignificant to meet with wildes approval so we left them without even taking the trouble to land and give them an overhaul on the following day the ship still heading to the northward we sighted a couple of junks about a mile apart steering south they were made out from the forecastlehead about three points on the lee bow at four bells of the forenoon watch and the emigrants who were all on deck manifested much interest in the quaint appearance of the craft as they approached us closehauled there was only a very moderate breeze blowingwe were carrying all three of our royalsand there was no sea to speak of yet despite these favourable conditions i must confess that i was not a little astonished to see how nimbly those two unwieldylooking craft moved over the water and how close to the wind they contrived to liethis last of course being due to the almost absolutely flat set of their mat sails the weathermost of the two looked as though she might cross our stern at a distance of not much more than a quarter of a mile i got up the glass and had a look at them when they were about two miles distant but found nothing very interesting about them after i had noted their strangeness of model and rig and the quaint decorative painting of their hulls the bows of each especially being painted to represent a human face with great staring goggle eyes and of most diabolically ferocious aspect grace hartley was standing near me and when having completed my inspection of the junks i was about to return the telescope to its beckets she asked me if she might be permitted to use it of course i at once handed the instrument to her and then walked away to attend to some business of the ship returning to the poop when the leading junk was within half a mile of us with her two masts in line what singularlooking vessels are they not mr troubridge exclaimed the girl withdrawing the instrument from her eye for a moment to speak to me of course she continued i have seen pictures of chinese junks but one really needs to see the vessels themselves sailing as those are to get the complete idea of their quaintness of appearance and what an extraordinary number of men they carry is it because of the peculiarity of their rig and the large size of their sails that they require so many men no said i doubtfully i think not i am not aware that a junk needs an exceptionally strong crew do you consider that those vessels are very heavily manned well are they not she asked of course i have no idea how many men a junk requires to manage it but i have been looking at those twoand especially the nearest onethrough the glass and it struck me that they must each have at least a hundred men on board a hundred men i repeated incredulously oh surely not you must be mistaken twenty or perhaps twentyfive at the utmost would be much nearer the mark oh but i am certain there are far more than that on board each of those vessels it was one of the peculiarities that particularly impressed me in connection with them answered the girl are you quite sure kindly let me have the glass a moment said i taking the instrument from her and levelling it at the nearest junk the junk however was by this time settling away broad on our lee beam as we drew ahead and was showing her weather side to us it was therefore difficult for me to get a view of her decks the more so as her bulwarks seemed to be unusually high one thing however i noticed namely that she carried eight brass gunsapparently about twelvepoundersof a side and as i got a glimpse through the wide ports out of which these weapons grinned it seemed to me that there were men stationed at them in a flash my thoughts reverted to the braave the dutch barque that we had fallen in with a week ago with her cargo plundered and her murdered crew cumbering her decks and i sang out for tudsbery to come aft that individual being at the moment busy upon some job on the forecastle as was frequently the case during his watch if i happened to be on the poop tudsbery said i as he joined me on the poop i think i remember having heard you say that you have seen service in the china trade i want you to take a good look at those two junksif you have not yet done soand give me your opinion of them ive had a squint at em of course mr troubridge he answered as i handed him the glass but i havent noticed anything extra particlar about em so far and he applied the instrument to his eye you dont imagine for instance that they are cruising in company or that they are other than honest trading junks i asked well i dunno he replied working away at them with the glass perhaps it is a bit strange seein two of em out here so close together and both of em steerin exactly the same course yes and by george now i comes to look at em through the glass i sees that they are both of em armedthis here nearest one mounts eight barkers of a side and ill be hanged if i dont believe her people are a trainin of em upon us yes dash me if they aint youd better look out sir they mean to slap a broadside into us in another minute or im a dutchman i turned and faced forward go below all of you i shouted down with you at once that junk is going to fire upon us and some of you may be hurt miss hartley turning to the girl who was standing close beside us go down off the poop and get under cover at once if you please bang crash eight jets of flame and smoke leapt from the port battery of the nearest junk which had by this time drawn down broad on our lee quarter some three cablelengths distant and the next instant the air all round us seemed thick with humming missiles many of which struck the hull and bulwarks of the ship making the splinters fly while others passed through our lower canvas perforating it in two or three dozen places and providing a nice little repairing job for the hands in some of their future spare moments a hurried glance along the decks however assured me that nobody had been hurt although there was a good deal of screaming among the women while several of the children in the process of being hustled below by their parents started crying vigorously meanwhile miss hartley after pausing a moment to stare in astonishment at the splintered bulwarks and the riddled sails calmly descended the poop ladder and made her way into the cabin well exclaimed chips swamp me if that aint the rummiest go as ever i seen that junks a pirate junk mr troubridge neither more nor less and in my opinion tother ones no better look at that sir there she goes in stays tell ye what sir they means to get us in between em if they can upon my word chips i believe you are right said i as the more distant of the two junks swept up into the wind preparatory to going round on the other tack and if they should succeed it will be a pretty poor lookout for all hands aboard this ship have we any arms of any description do you know with which to defend ourselves im sure i dont know mr troubridge answered the carpenter in tones of great concern i havent seen none but there may be a few muskets or someat of that sort stowed away somewheres down below for all that i knows if there is i dare say the bosunll know where to lay his hands upon em then the best thing that you can do will be to go down and call the boatswain and put the question to ah here he is as polsons head showed above the poop ladder come up here polson i exclaimed you are just the man we want that junk astern of us has just treated us to a broadside of langrage and chipss opinion of the pair of them is that they are a couple of piratical craft have we any firearms of any kind aboard with which to defend the ship or must we run for it i believe that theres a case of two dozen muskets and some ammunition down in a little bit of a magazine abaft the lazarette answered polson and i fancies that theres a few round shot for them two six pounders of ours shall i go down and have a look mr troubridge yes certainly said i and be quick about it too polson to be perfectly frank with you i dont half like the look of things that junk that has just tacked is looking up a good point higher than we are and unless we happen to have the heels of her i fancy that we are in for a warm time the boatswain waited to hear no more but scuttled away off the poop again with more alacrity than i had seen him exhibit since i had joined the mercury meanwhile the watch below awakened by the racket had come on deck and were having the situation explained to them with much gesticulation and lurid language by their comrades the watch on deck all of whom had knocked off the work upon which they happened to have been engaged and were now talking excitedly casting occasional glances from us on the poop to the junk away down on the lee bow presently the junk which had fired into us having drawn up fair into our wake distant about half a mile tacked and stood after us after an absence of some ten minutes the boatswain reappeared with the news that he had found and opened the case of muskets which were of the newfashioned percussion pattern and also a generous supply of ammunition for the same together with some fifty round shot and cartridges for the sixpounders good i exclaimed take some hands below polson and bring up that case of muskets together with some ammunition also a few rounds for the sixpounders if appearances go for anything we shall need them all before long a few minutes later the muskets each of which had been carefully wrapped in welloiled cloths were brought on deck taken out of their wrappings well wiped the nipples carefully tested with a pin and loaded the powder being measured out from a powder horn a wad rammed down on top of it with a bullet on top of that and then another wad on top of all to keep the bullet in its place then the brass sixpounders were loaded and primed and two pieces of slow match were cut off ready for lighting i must confess that i looked forward to the prospect of a fight with a considerable amount of trepidation for in the first place the odds were exceedingly heavy against usthirty of a crew of whom only twentyfour could be armed against probably two hundred moreover our lads knew nothing about fighting and as i could see had not much stomach for it while the crews of the junks were undoubtedly fighters by trade still it was clear that we were in a fix out of which there was no escape without a fight and that fact which was patent to all hands might perhaps influence them to do their best but probably there were some among them who had never handled a musket in their lives it would obviously be useless to put weapons into the hands of such men and my first business must be to ascertain how many men were capable of using firearms i therefore directed the boatswain to call all hands aft to the quarterdeck where i addressed them my lads said i your leaders plans and your own folly in abetting them have brought us into perilous waters as you may see for the two junks which are endeavouring to close with us are undoubtedly pirate craft unfortunately none of us suspected their character until it was too late and now we are in a trap from which we can only escape by fighting and we must not only fightwe must also beat them off for as i suppose you all know if we permit ourselves to fall into their hands our fate will be similar to that of the unfortunate crew of the dutch barque with which we fell in the other day now we have here two dozen muskets with plenty of ammunition and also a few rounds for the sixpounders so we are not badly off for weapons if we only have men enough who know how to use them let as many of you as know how to use a musket step to the front and if any of you know anything about working guns step forward too exactly twenty men stepped to the front sixteen of whom declared that they could use a musket while the remaining four announced that they were capable of loading and firing cannon very well said i we must all do our utmost for fight we must those of you who are unable to fight must act as sailtrimmers polson and tudsbery you must take charge of the guns steward go below and tell the emigrants that i want eight volunteers capable of handling muskets and they must preferably be single men polson you may serve out ammunition to the musketry men and hark ye lads when the time to shoot arrives do not blaze away at random but select a mark and do your best to hit it now range yourselves along the lee rail and do not fire until i give the word chapter nine we beat off the pirates a few minutes later the steward returned from the tweendecks followed by seven very decentlooking young fellows who appeared as if they might have been farm hands and announced that they knew how to handle a fowlingpiece and they supposed that a musket was not very greatly different to these men muskets and ammunition were accordingly distributed and they were put among the seamen stationed along the lee rail this left one musket unemployed at which i was by no means sorry for i rather fancied myself as a shot and was glad of a good excuse to appropriate one of the weapons our arrangements being now complete i had leisure to consider the relative positions of the two junks as regarded ourselves and it needed but a single glance to assure me that the enemys vessels unwieldy and awkward as their model seemed to be had the advantage of us in the matter of weatherliness for they looked up a good point and a half higher than the mercury and although they made more leeway than ourselves that point and a half fully compensated for it the consequence being that the junk astern was gradually working out upon our weather quarter while the junk on our lee bow was also hawsing up to windward we were slightly faster than they however and were consequently drawing away from the junk astern from which i hoped we had not much more to fear but the junk on our lee bow was certain to give us trouble for we were gaining upon her while she was edging up nearer to our track every minute with the result that by the time that we overhauled her we should be within biscuittoss of each other and i could not hope to escape her by tacking ship for she would probably be quite as quick in stays as ourselves possibly a trifle quicker such an evolution would place her broad on our weather quarter and far enough to windward to permit of her edging down on us with slack bowlines while we should be jammed close on a wind an advantage which i believed would give her the heels of us and enable her to lay us aboard this i felt must be avoided at all costs for if once her crew should gain a footing upon our decks their numbers were sufficient to overpower us instantly i therefore determined to slip past her to windward and run the gauntlet of her fire that risk terrible as it was being to my mind less than the other having thus decided i called to polson to ask him how we were off in the matter of bullets to which he replied that there were half a dozen kegs altogether this being the case i thought we might venture to be a trifle extravagant so i gave orders for a keg to be brought on deck and for the two sixpounders to be loaded with bullets practically to the muzzle on top of a round shot this was done four double handfulsamounting to about one hundred bulletsbeing dropped into the gun on top of the round shot and a wad rammed home on the top of all this done the two guns were run forward and pointed out through the two foremost ports on the lee side of the deck we were now all ready for the fight and nothing remained but to await the critical moment with such composure as we could summon to our aid in one respect we were more fortunate than many other ships would have been in the same situation for our helmsman was sheltered in a sort of little hurricane house built of stout planking over the wheel and he was therefore in some degree protected from jingal fire indeed i hoped that the planking of the structure would turn out to be absolutely proof against the missiles usually fired from such weapons which i expected would be the firearm used by the pirates thus we might hope we should avoid being thrown into confusion at the critical moment by our helmsman being killed or disabled at length we drew up within pointblank musketry range of the junk that was endeavouring to close upon our lee bow and i gave the word for those armed with that weapon while keeping carefully under cover themselves to open fire upon any of the pirates who might expose themselves almost immediately a dozen shots rang out from our decks and a few splinters flew aboard the junk but i could neither see nor hear that any further mischief had been done watch her ports lads and fire through them i ordered if you can shoot down the men at her weather battery during the few minutes that we are passing her you will have nothing more to fear at this moment a perfect giant of a man ascended the short poop of the junk and stood calmly watching us occasionally saying a word or two to those on the deck beneath him he had scarcely taken up his position however before our men began to blaze away at him and presently a bullet knocked his hat off while as he was calmly stooping to pick it up again another bullet must have struck him on the right shoulder for i saw him suddenly clap his hand to that part and hastily retreat from his exposed situation without stopping to pick up the hat hurrah lads i shouted there is first blood to us keep the pot boiling but dont shoot until you can see somebody to shoot at at this moment the weather bulwark of the junk became suddenly lined with men all armed with jingals with which they proceeded to blaze away at us and some half a dozen or more missiles went whizzing past most unpleasantly close to my head nobody was hurt however and our men returned the fire with commendable steadiness scoring a few hits if one might judge by the cries that arose on board the junk and the suddenness with which some five or six of her people sank out of sight behind her bulwarks then fresh hands appeared showing suddenly above the rail taking rapid aim pulling trigger and vanishing out of sight not always quickly enough however to dodge the bullets that our people sent whizzing about their ears thus far not one of the mercurys people had been touched but the critical moment was yet to come it was now close at hand however for our figurehead had drawn up level with the stern of the junk and there was not more than fifty fathoms of water between the two craft we might expect their broadside at any moment and i felt that it was scarcely possible for us to receive it at such very short range without receiving very severe punishment i therefore exhorted our people to maintain a hot fire upon the ports of the junk feelingconvinced that every bullet which passed through would be almost certain to find its billet in the body of a chinaman thus tending to flurry their gunners and possibly cause them to shoot wide we were now so close that i was able to see that the junk needed a trifle of lee helm to keep her close to the wind and i had no sooner noted this fact than i saw a man show his head for an instant above the break of the junks poop and sign to the helmsman to put his helm hard down i guessed in an instant what this meant they were about to throw the junk into the wind in the hope that she would fall aboard of us when they would pour their starboard broadside into us and board amidst the smoke they could not possibly have hit upon a plan more likely to succeed or to be fatal to us and recognising the deadly nature of our peril i yelled to our people at once to fling themselves flat on the deck which they did with almost laughable promptitude at the same time i seized my musket which thus far i had not fired and kneeling down with one of the poop hencoops as a rest aimed straight at the body of the junks helmsman just as he was thrusting the tiller hard down i pulled the trigger the instant that i had the man covered and down he dropped motionless the ponderous tiller escaping from his grasp and swinging heavily back amidships with the result that the junk which was already coming to at once fell off again at the precise instant when her whole starboard broadside burst into flame and smoke the missiles luckily passing just ahead of us and very considerably damaging our figurehead but doing no worse injury by a most fortunate chance i had made my lucky shot at the exact moment which alone could save us from disaster to give the pirates their due at least a dozen men instantly sprang up on the poop and rushed aft to replace the injured helmsman but our people had been watching through a number of peepholes what was happening and no sooner did they see the chinese on the poop than they leaped to their feet and opened fire upon them with such murderous effect that half of them dropped while the other half turned and fled from the poop seeking shelter under cover of their crafts bulwarks left thus to herself the junk gradually fell broad off presenting her quarter to us the opportunity thus afforded to pour into her a partially raking fire was much too good to let slip and i shouted to the boatswain and chips to send the contents of their pieces into her starboard bulwark hoping that some at least of the bullets would enter her open ports and do a certain amount of execution the two men had evidently been expecting such an order and had got their pieces ready levelled a couple of seconds later the two sixpounders barked out together and the two hundred bullets peppered the junks bulwarks most handsomely many of them penetrating the planking as i could both see and hear for the next instant a dreadful earsplitting yell arose from the deck of the craft telling a tale of very severe punishment but that was not all the two round shot likewise crashed through the bulwarks very effectively one of them dismounting a gun while the other brought the crafts mainmast down thus effectually placing her hors de combat those two shots must have wrought terrible havoc among the junks crew for not only did they not attempt to return our fire but they allowed their vessel to run broad off before the wind squaring away their foresail the better to do so and presently the junk in our wake abandoned the chase and bore up to join her consort we thus emerged marvellously well from a predicament that at one moment threatened to be exceedingly serious and that too without the slightest injury to so much as a single one of our company it was remarked that wilde had most scrupulously refrained from obtruding his presence on deck during our little brush with the junks which exhibition of pusillanimity on the part of a man who aspired to the position of head and leader of the little community provoked a great deal of adverse criticism and considerably reduced his influence and popularity on the fourth day following the above incident with the appearance of dawn we sighted land ahead which as we drew nearer resolved itself into three islands lying close together the largest of which measured about eight miles long by three miles wide while the remaining two were roughly circular in shape measuring about a mile in diameter the two smaller islands presented the appearance of low pyramids with rounded tops their highest points rising some eight hundred feet above the sea level while the biggest of the three rose somewhat abruptly from the water to a height of about fifteen hundred feet at each extremity and preserved that height pretty uniformly from end to end but with an elevation rising perhaps three hundred feet higher almost in the middle of its length all three of the islands were well wooded but the largest had been cleared to some extent of its timber the cleared ground bearing evidences of being under cultivation this of course indicated that at least the largest of the islands was already inhabited and was therefore unsuited to the requirements of wilde and his followers who wanted to find a spot where they would be reasonably free from all risk of molestation by hostile natives nevertheless it was decided to approach the islands a little nearer if only for the chance of being able to procure some fruit and a few fresh vegetables for which all hands were by this time pining however since we knew nothing of the character of the inhabitants but were under a sort of general impression that the natives of all the islands of the eastern seas were of a more or less treacherous character while some at least of them were very strongly suspected of cannibalistic tendencies we determined to adopt every possible precaution the muskets were accordingly brought on deck and loaded while every man who had not a musket served out to him took care to provide himself with a weapon of some sort even though it were no more formidable than a belaying pin i also insisted that the ship should be kept under way in order that upon the first suggestion of treacherous designs upon the part of the natives we might be able to make sail and stand out to sea again approaching the lee side of the biggest of the three islands one hand was sent aloft into the fore topmast crosstrees to keep a sharp lookout for submerged rocks while another was sent into the fore chains with the hand lead then we clewed up our courses royals and topgallantsails and hauled down our flying jib and some of the lighter staysails but furled nothing leaving all in a state to be set again from the deck at a moments notice the water in the immediate neighbourhood of these islands was deep no bottom being reached with the hand lead until we were within half a mile of the shore at which distance we brought the ship to the wind and laid the main topsail to the mast as it was seen that many natives had gathered on the beach and were making preparations to launch their canoes several of which were hauled up on the dazzlingly white sand i kept the ships telescope steadily bearing upon these craft and the numerous natives who swarmed about them and was greatly relieved to see that the latter all appeared to be busily engaged in loading the former with baskets of fruit fish and quantities of fowls while nowhere could i discover anything resembling a weapon that these people were quite accustomed to the bartering of their produce with passing ships and had been taught to understand that they would not be allowed on board was evident for although within the next halfhour we were surrounded by quite a hundred canoes of various sizes ranging from the sixteenfoot craft with two occupants up to the vessel measuring fifty feet over all manned by from twenty to thirty natives not one attempted to come alongside until specially invited to do so they simply lay off a few fathoms and held up to our view the wares that they had for disposal and then waited to be beckoned to approach these natives were for the most part fine lithe activelooking men of a deep rich bronze colour most of them were almost naked and adorned with necklaces of shells or sharks teeth their hair so arranged that it stuck out all round their heads like the thrums of a twirled mop a few of them wore necklaces or armlets of varicoloured beads of which they appeared to be inordinately proud and these adornments furnished many of our people with a hint as to the kind of article most desired in exchange a whole basket of assorted fruit as heavy as one man could conveniently lift being freely parted with for a hank containing five strings of ordinary glass beads which at home would cost about a penny next to beads copper wire appeared to be the most prized commodity nails coming next such a basket of fruit as i have just described or half a dozen fowls costing twenty twoinch nails while a dozen baskets of fruit were eagerly offered for a single sixinch spike fishhooks too commanded good prices that is to say two baskets of fruit or one dozen fowls sold for a single hook fish of which several basketfuls were brought off were to be had almost for the asking a basket containing about fifty pounds weight of delicious fresh fish being gladly given in exchange for a single ordinary pin at such prices as these the crew and emigrants would willingly have taken as much as the natives had for sale if i would have allowed it but i was afraid to let them have too much fresh fruit all at once lest they should make themselves ill but we took every fowl that we could get hold of killing enough to serve all hands for dinner that day and putting the rest into the coops which had by this time become almost empty it took us nearly two hours to complete our purchases for i would not allow more than four canoes alongside at the same moment and when we had acquired as much produce as i thought it prudent to lay in at one time the mainyard was swung the fore and main tacks boarded and we resumed our voyage parting from the natives with mutual smiles and upon the best of terms i was very much gratified at this first experience of intercourse with the pacific islanders for it seemed to me that it would be impossible to find a more quiet amiable peaceloving race of people on the face of the earth i made the mistake of judging the whole by a very few and set down the stories i had heard of treachery cruelty and bloodcurdling tragedy as malicious fables i was speedily disillusioned however for a week later we reached the caroline islands and while we found some of these islanders as friendly disposed as those abovementioned there were others who did their utmost to entice us to land and place ourselves within their power and on one occasion when they failed in this produced hidden weapons and resolutely attacked the ship giving us all that we could do to beat them off and more or less seriously injuring three seamen and two of the male emigrants this little experience taught us all a muchneeded lesson in prudence for it was more by luck than good management that we avoided capture and the general massacre that would most assuredly have followed for the next five weeks we cruised among these islands vainly seeking the earthly paradise that wilde had taught all hands to expect and with less than which none of them would be satisfied for such islands as seemed to approach wildes standard in the matter of size and fertility were already inhabited and that too for the most part by natives whose pressing invitations to land and lavishly proffered hospitality we had learned to regard with something more than suspicion while the uninhabited islands were invariably found to be wholly lacking in some essential feature then leaving the carolines behind us we passed on to the marshall group where the atollwhich we had already encountered in a somewhat modified form here and there among the carolineswas to be found in its typically perfect development here the islands such as they were were entirely of coral formation of diminutive area generally not more than six or eight feet above the surface of the ocean their vegetation consisting of a few coconut trees with maybe a patch or two of coarse grass here and there and possibly a few stunted bushes the whole constituting a more or less irregularly shaped belt enclosing a saltwater lagoon usually with an entrance from the open sea and with water enough inside to float a ship but sometimes with no entrance at all a fortnight among these atolls sufficed to convince the most optimistic among us that what we were looking for was not to be found in that neighbourhood accordingly we bade farewell to the group to my intense relief for between the shoals and the currents i was worried very nearly into a fever and scarcely dared to leave the deck day or night once clear of the marshall islands we stood away to the northward gradually hauling round as the wind favoured us to about westnor west occasionally sighting a small island but more frequently broken water until at length when we had been out from the marshall group close upon three weeks land was made at daybreak bearing two points on the lee bow it was at a considerable distance for it showed soft and delicate of tint as a cloud in the brilliant light of the newly risen sun but that it was good solid earth was clear enough from the fact that it did not in the slightest degree alter its truncated conical shape as the minutes sped true there was no land shown on the chart at that precise spot but that did not alter the fact of it being there and since it showed above the horizon from the deck at a distance which we estimated at fully fifty miles it was concluded that it must be of fairly respectable size and quite worth looking at more closely the helm was therefore shifted and we kept dead away for it the ship was slipping along at about seven knots before a nice little easterly breeze under all plain sailthat being as much canvas as i cared to show bearing in mind the fact that not infrequently of late we had been obliged to haul our wind rather suddenly in consequence of white water revealing itself unexpectedly at no great distance ahead but although we were travelling at this quite respectable pacefor the mercurywe did not appear to be decreasing our distance from the land ahead nearly so rapidly as we had anticipated which circumstance led me to the conclusion that i had considerably underestimated that distance in the first instance and this conclusion proved to be correct for at six bells in the afternoon watch we were still fully seven miles from the island but we had arrived within four miles of what from the fore topmast crosstrees i had been able to identify as a barrier reef that appeared to extend from the northern to the southern extremity of the islandand indeed might completely surround it for aught that i could tellenclosing a magnificently spacious harbour some three miles wide between itself and the island which i estimated to measure about ten miles long from north to south with a peak apparently the crater of an extinct or at all events a quiescent volcano approximating to three thousand feet high rising almost in the centre of it it was wooded from the inner margin of the somewhat narrow sandy beach that lined it to within about three hundred feet of the summit of the peak andmost promising of all from the point of view of wilde and his followersthere were no canoes on the beach or any other signs of inhabitants chapter ten we arrive at the island the surf was breaking heavily over the whole length of the barrier reef but my experience among the caroline and marshall islands led me to believe that somewhere in that reef a break might be found wide enough to allow the passage of the ship through it examining the long line of the leaping surf very carefully through the ships telescope i at length thought i detected such a passage some two or three miles to the southward of the point at which the ships bowsprit was pointing i accordingly hailed the deck directing the helmsman how to steer for it and at the same time requested polson to join me there polson i exclaimed what think you of that for an island upon which to settle it ought to be big enough to accommodate all hands of you with room to spare its soil is fertile if one may judge by its luxuriantly wooded appearance and thus far i have been unable to detect any signs of inhabitants upon it do you think it good enough to justify us in attempting to find a way through that reef in order to get a closer view of it do i repeated the boatswain feasting his eyes upon the lovely prospect the island presented in the rays of the afternoon sun which happened at that moment to fall at just the proper angle to reveal clearly the gently undulating character of the island scored here and there with ravines which seemed to promise not only a series of charming prospects but also an abundance of fresh water from the streams that had their origin in the central peakyes mr troubridge i most certainly do if a way can be found of gettin at the place why its the very kind of island as ive been picturin in my mind ever since that chap wilde began to talk about his plans except that yonder island is a good bit bigger and altogether more promisin than id ever hoped to stumble upon but how is that there line of surf goin to be passed through mr troubridge take this glass polson i said and very carefully examine the spot immediately over our jibboomend to my mind there seems to be a very narrow patch of unbroken water there which may yet prove wide enough to take the ship through with a leading wind ay sir answered polson i sees what you mean there certainly do look to be a bit of a passage there and narrer as it looks it may as you say be wide enough for the mercury to slip through and whats them two pints on the mainland just over the break with the blue shadder showin beyond it dont it look to you somethin like a bit of a cove or a harbour of some sort i looked at the spot indicated and thought i could detect something of the kind suggested by the boatswain but my unaided vision was not strong enough to enable me to be sure i therefore borrowed the glass from polson and then saw that there was indeed an indentation of some sort which had the appearance of being spacious enough to give harbourage to the ship that however was a point that did not call for immediate settlement although it was certainly to be kept in mind meanwhile the ship running off with the wind now a couple of points over the port quarter had been sliding rapidly down toward the reef and had by this time drawn so near it that i felt morally certain not only of the fact that there actually was a passage through it but also that it was wide enough for the ship to go through yet i did not altogether like the idea of pushing the ship through it without further ado for a rather unpleasant thought had flashed through my mind which i at once proceeded to communicate to the boatswain now look here polson i said that is undoubtedly a passage through the reef and as we draw nearer to it i grow the more disposed to believe that it may be possible to take the old mercury through it yet i am strongly opposed to the idea of doing anything hastily what i mean is this i continued in answer to the quick glance of half suspicious enquiry that he flashed upon me there is no sign that we can detect of natives upon that island yet there may be hundreds ay thousands of them there for all that if so what is to prevent their having us in sight all day today and hiding their canoes and otherwise obliterating all indication of their presence in the hope that by so doing we may be tempted to pass through the reef and come to an anchor under its lee and in pretty close proximity to the island once through that passage polson and with the wind as it is now we should be in a trap from which it might be difficult if not absolutely impossible to escape in the event of our being attacked by a strong body of hostile natives now my idea is this if we were to enter that lagoon this evening by the time that we had come to an anchor and rolled up our canvas it would be altogether too late to go ashore and explore satisfactorily that island and as i said just now if there happen to be hostile natives there we might find ourselves in an exceedingly awkward fix i propose therefore that instead of attempting to go inside tonight we should shorten sail to our three topsails go round under the lee of the island and either heaveto or stand off and on until daylight if we do this at once we may hug the lee side of it as closely as we please and subject that side of the island to a pretty searching scrutiny while it is still daylight and if the lee side is as bare of any sign of inhabitants as the weather side seems to be i think we may venture with tolerable safety to go through the passage tomorrow morning as soon as there is light enough when we shall have the whole day in which to explore the island what say you yes mr troubridge youre quite right sir answered the boatswain that there island looks most terrible temptin shinin there in the aternoon sunlight and i should dearly like to stretch my legs by takin a run ashore there afore i turn in tonightas i make no doubt is the case with all hands but what you say is right sir and what you propose is the proper thing to do shall i go down on deck and start shortenin sail at once sir yes if you please polson answered i meanwhile i will remain up here and see as much as i can whereupon polson descended the rigging and taking charge proceeded to clew up and haul down until the canvas was reduced to the three topsails and the fore topmast staysail afterward sending the hands aloft to make a harbour furl of everything by the time that all this was done we had run down to within a mile of the opening which i had detected in the reef and i now perceived it to be wide enough to allow of the passage of not only a single ship but of half a dozen vessels abreast of the tonnage of the mercury at this distance from the reef and at my elevation above the level of the water it was possible not only to see this but also to make out that a fringing reef stretched along almost the entire eastern face of the island to the northern and southern extremities of which the barrier reef was united with but one opening in it namely the one that i had already discovered the fringing reefthe whereabout of which was indicated by the paleblue tint of the water varied in width from two miles at the northeastern extremity of the island where the barrier reef joined it to an average of about half a mile along the rest of the shoreexcept for a break of some two miles in length at the point where polson had detected indications of a cove or an inner harbour this much determined i hailed the deck instructing the boatswain to haul up to the southward and when we had brought the passage through the reef in line with the summit of the peak i again hailed him to take the bearings of the latter to serve as a guide when running for the passage on the morrow this bearing i found to be northwest by westa quarterwest of which i made a note in my pocket book the sun was within half an hour of setting when at length having closely skirted the southern shore of the island we opened out its western side which all aglow as it was in the golden light of evening presented a picture of absolutely fairylike beauty its wooded slopes revealing in the nearer distances a thousand varied tints of verdure from brilliant yellow to deepest olive relieved here and there by great patches of white scarlet purple and other lovely tints that could only proceed from immense masses of blossom of some kind as this blaze of rich and varied colour receded from the eye into the middle and more remote distances it gradually merged into an allpervading tint of delicate exquisite ethereal grey with the gradual unfolding of the charming picture presented by the western side of the islandwhich seemed to throw all hands down on deck into ecstasies of delight judging from the continuous exclamations of rapture that reached me from below as fresh beauties swung into view with the progress of the shipit became apparent that the barrier reef existed only on the eastern side of the island but the fringing reef seemed to run all round it with a narrow margin of dazzlingly white coral sand above highwater mark the land seemed to rise everywhere from the beach at a very gentle slope and the vegetation came down right to the inner margin of the sand in fact there was a thick fringe of what i took to be coconut trees growing all along the edge of the beach and encroaching upon it so far in places that the roots of the trees must be actually washed by the salt water at the top of the spring tides but search the shore as carefully as i mightand now that we were to leeward of the island i did not hesitate to approach the ship to within a quarter of a mile of the edge of the reef in order that i might obtain the best possible viewi could discover no sign or trace of human beings there were open patches of delicious greensward here and there visible among the clumps of trees but no suggestion of cultivation there were no canoes on the beachindeed i greatly doubted whether it would have been possible for canoes to pass through the line of surf that boiled and swirled all along the edge of the reef even on the lee side of the islandnor could i detect any feather of smoke rising among the trees or other sign of human occupancy although we were now so close to the land and the evening light smote upon it so strongly that had there been any natives moving about on the beach or in the nearer open spaces i could scarcely have failed to see them the ship now under the lee of the island and moreover under short canvas did little more than barely drift to the northward along the western edge of the reef and long before we arrived off the north western extremity of the island the sun had set and it had become too dark for me to complete my survey of this lonely but lovely spot yet i had seen enough to assure me that there was only one place along that lee side at which it would be possible for the ship to anchor even there although the place in question took the form of a bay i did not altogether like the look of it for nearly half its area consisted of fringing reef upon which if a ship were to drive ashore during a sudden shift of wind she would infallibly go to pieces in a few minutes it might possibly be made to do failing a better place by riding with both anchors down but i determined to have a look at polsons cove round on the weather side of the island under the shelter of the natural breakwater formed by the barrier reef before risking the ship by taking her into such an unsatisfactory anchorage the second dogwatch had passed before we drew out clear of the island and once more felt the full strength of the breeze whereupon i gave instructions for the ship to be kept full and by on the starboard tack until four bells in the middle watch when the officer of the watch was to wear ship and come to the wind on the port tack heading to the southward for the island again the weather side of which i considered we ought to fetch by daylight in good time to allow of our passing through the reef and coming to an anchor about breakfasttime the first rays of the morning sun were flashing off the placidly heaving waters and into my cabin when chips awakened me with the news that the peak of the island was broad on our lee bow and that there was now light enough to enable us to see our way in through the reef i accordingly turned out and went forward to get my usual douche bath under the headpump prior to dressing taking note on the way of the fact that we were still some ten miles to the northward and eastward of the opening in the reef moreover the wind was blowing a very gentle breeze pushing the ship along at scarcely more than three knots i therefore so far modified my arrangements of the previous night as to give orders for breakfast to be prepared half an hour earlier in order that the meal might be disposed of before the real business of the day began but long before the cooks husky notes summoned the emigrants messmen to the galley to receive their morning allowance of cocoa and their tins of lobscouse all hands were on deck the emigrants gathered in the waist of the ship leaning over the lee rail and devouring with their eyes the beauties of the lovely island fresh green and sparkling with the dews of the past night it was rather amusing to note that many of these people especially the women and children had donned their best clothes in which to go ashore as though it were a festive occasion by the time that breakfast was over the ship had drawn well down toward the southern extremity of the island and at length the peak was brought to bear by compass northwest by westaquarterwest by which i knew that it and the passage through the reef were now in line accordingly we bore up and wore round heading straight for the peak slinging the ships telescope over my shoulder i once more wended my way aloft to the fore topmast crosstrees in order that from that commanding elevation i might perform the delicate task of conning the ship through the passage in the reef and at the same time maintain a sharp lookout for what now seemed to be the only peril to be guarded against namely the possible existence upon the island of hostile natives although we were some four miles from the reef when we bore up i had not the slightest difficulty in discovering the whereabouts of the passage through it immediately upon my arrival in the crosstrees and i now at once brought the telescope to bear upon it in search of possible dangers in the form of sunken rocks for although that apparently narrow stretch of unbroken water was the sure indication of a break in the continuity of the reef it was just possible that there might be a detached rock or two in the fairway lying deep enough to allow the swell to roll over it unbroken yet not quite deep enough to permit a ship of the size of the mercury to pass over it but a prolonged inspection with the aid of the glass failed to reveal any such danger and in the course of the next halfhour we had drawn so close in that i could see as much in that direction with the unaided eye as with the telescope i therefore diverted my attention for a few minutes to the more distant beach and the still more distant open grassy spaces of the island in search of possible indications of life and movement but here too my quest was vain for nowhere could i detect the slightest signs of life except that of birds a few gulls and pelicans being visible busily engaged in seeking a breakfast on the waters of the lagoon while it was also possible to detect the occasional flash of wings among the trees that so thickly clustered on the slopes of the island at length the moment arrived when it became necessary for me to give my undivided attention to the passage through the reef which the ship had now approached to within a distance of a couple of cablelengths while the air was vibrant with the deep hoarse thunderous roar of the surf that eternally flung itself in foam and fury upon those ten miles of submerged coral wall which i have spoken of as the reef this wall or reef i could now see was of a tolerably uniform width of about one third of a mile throughout its length and its top was so nearly level with the surface of the ocean that it constituted a very perfect breakwater excluding from the lagoon which it enclosed all surface disturbance except the trifling amount caused by the incessant beat of the surf upon it and revealed itself in the form of some eight or ten lines of miniature swell sweeping inward from the reef and losing itself in the smooth sparkling surface of the lagoon within a distance of half a mile thus far i had failed to discover any submerged dangers in the passage through the reef and we were now so close in that i must have seen them through the clear transparent water had such existed i therefore directed the helmsman how to steer so as to take the ship through the middle of the channel which now revealed itself as an opening fully sixteen hundred feet wide and a minute later we surged into it on the back of a swell which crashed down upon the reef to right and left of us with a roar that made ones very ears tingle while the spray snow white and sparkling in the dazzling sunshine like countless millions of diamonds leapt into the air as high as our maintop to fall a cables length to leeward in a glittering shower upon the seething turmoil of lacelike foam that swirled hither and thither above the reef five minutes sufficed us to accomplish the passage through the reef when we found ourselves gliding gently forward upon the placid surface of the lagoon which formed a magnificent crescentshaped natural harbour some ten miles long by about two and a half miles wide at its widest part tapering away to nothing at its northern and southern extremities where the barrier and fringing reefs united the floor of this lagoon as i could distinctly see from my elevated post of observation was composed of fine white coral sand with no sign of rock or any other obstruction upon it so far as my sight could reach we of course had a leadsman in the chains taking continual casts of the lead as we proceeded and from these it appeared that the depth of water in the lagoon close up against the inner face of the reef amounted to seven and a half fathoms shoaling very gradually and regularly as we neared the island the exceeding beauty of which evoked a continuous chorus of admiration from the delighted emigrants as its many attractions unfolded themselves at our approach upon clearing the passage through the reef i had shouted instructions down to the man at the wheel to haul up a couple of points to the northward which had brought our jibboomend pointing fair between the two headlands opening into the indentation which i have termed polsons harbour and i now judged from what i could see to be of quite respectable extent i had no intention however of attempting to take the ship into it without first subjecting it to something in the nature of a preliminary examination i therefore now called to them on deck to stand by to let go the anchor to which polson responded that they were all ready for letting go stand by to let run your topsail halyards was the next order which was obeyed with a rush as of a parcel of schoolboys eagerly anticipating a holiday i allowed the ship to drive ahead a little farther until we had arrived within half a mile of the two headlands which i now saw were about a quarter of a mile apart and then gave the order hard down with your helm and let her come head to wind closely followed by let run your topsail halyards and the next moment with a screaming of sheaves and a rattle of parrals the three topsail yards slid down the topmasts and brought up with a thud upon the caps to the accompaniment of a jubilant cheer from the crowd on deck then a minute later when the ship had lost her way followed the order let go your anchor succeeded by a yell from the carpenter of stand clear of the cable a few clinking strokes of a hammer the sudden plunging splash of the anchor into the placid waters of the lagoon and the rattling roar of the cable through the hawsepipe chips snubbed her with the twentyfive fathom shackle just inside the hawsepipe the depth of water alongside being a deep five fathoms and then the men sprang into the rigging and laid out on the bowsprit to furl the topsails and fore topmast staysail then turning myself about with my face toward the stern of the ship i seated myself comfortably in the crosstrees and once more bringing the telescope into action proceeded again to subject the island to a searching scrutiny we were now so close to it that had there been human beings upon it i could scarcely have failed to detect some indication of their presence but search as i would no sign of life save that of birds could i discover i therefore finally came to the conclusion that strange as it might be this lovely island was actually uninhabited and therefore in that respect perfectly suited to the experiment which wilde and his disciples were about to attempt upon it nor did it appear less suited in other respects its size was ample its fertility indisputable and apparently exuberant glimpses of tiny rivulets of water could be caught here and there flashing and sparkling through its glades there appeared to be no noxious animals upon it to endanger life and so far as beauty was concerned the place seemed to be a perfect eden the woods being gay with flowering shrubs and trees that everywhere diversified the innumerable shades of green with great splashes of vivid and gorgeous colour nor could much fault be found with the climate for although the island lay well within the tropics the constant sea breeze must certainly temper the heat and render it perfectly endurable the people on deck seeing how i was engaged waited with exemplary patience until i should make a move but the moment i rose to my feet and prepared to descend the rigging there was a rush to that part of the deck which i must first touch upon my return from aloft every individual in the crowd evidently charged with questions which he fully intended to fire off at me without further delay while descending the ratlines therefore i hastily prepared a little speech which i hoped would not prove disappointing to them chapter eleven an end to my responsibilities as i stepped out of the rigging on to the rail and stood there grasping a backstay there was a sudden rushing together of the crowd every eye sought mine and a few of the more eager ones stretched out their hands as though to grasp me and thus establish a sort of claim to my immediate attention but i had no inclination to subject myself to the sort of crossquestioning that might be expected from folk of the class of which the emigrants were largely composed i therefore raised my hand for silence and to command attention and when i saw that they were ready to listen to me i began i can see i said that you are all very naturally anxious to learn what i have been able to discover concerning yonder beautiful island during my long stay aloft i will therefore embrace the opportunity which you have given me by assembling yourselves together to tell you collectively the result of my observations to begin with the size of the island of which you are probably as well able to judge as i am roughly speaking it is of circular shape as you have already had the opportunity to see for yourselves and i estimate its diameter to be as nearly as may be ten miles this should give you an area of somewhere about seventyeight and a half square miles or upwards of fifty thousand acres of which probably threequarters will be found useful for any purpose to which you may wish to put it i therefore think you will agree with me that the island is amply large enough to accommodate you all and find you plenty of employment for the remainder of your lives i have seen several streams of water evidently fresh flowing down its slopes you are therefore not likely to perish of thirst on the contrary there must be an abundant supply judging from the evidences of abounding fertility that we see everywhere i have observed no signs of animals noxious or otherwise nor do i very well understand how they could get here taking into consideration the fact that there is no other land near at hand from which they could have come you are not likely therefore to experience any trouble from that source and lastly i have seen no signs of inhabitants it would therefore appear that your title to the island is as good as that of anyone else loud cheers but i continued i do not think it would be altogether wise to assume that the island is uninhabited simply because i have been unable to discover from aloft any trace of human presence for aught that we know to the contrary the place may be swarming with natives eager to obtain possession of this ship and her cargo and since we first entered these waters we have had more than one opportunity of judging what would be likely to happen should we be so unfortunate as to fall into the power of such people i therefore propose that instead of all hands swarming ashore and leaving the ship to take care of herselfas i see you all seem inclined to dothe muskets with a good supply of ammunition shall be served out to those most capable of making a good use of them and half of that number shall go ashore as an exploring party to examine the island thoroughly while the other half shall remain aboard to take care of the ship then when you have satisfied yourselves that there are no hostile natives to molest you we will take the ship into yonder cove and all hands can then land without fear this last proposition of mine was evidently extremely unpopular with no one more so than wilde who thrusting himself through the crowd hotly demanded to know who i thought i was that i should presume to dictate to them as to who should and who should not land but there were a few levelheaded ones among the party who while freely acknowledging how tantalising it would be to those left on board to gaze upon the island without being permitted to land upon it were quite able to recognise the prudence of my suggestion among them being polson and the carpenter at length after much animated discussion not altogether free from the flavour of acrimony the proposal was adopted and the difficult task of choosing those who were to form the exploring party was proceeded with wilde demanded that he should be included among the party upon the ground that he was the originator of the scheme which had brought us all to the island and as i saw no particular reason for resisting this demand i allowed it to pass unchallenged merely insisting that polson should be the leader of the expedition while four others would necessarily have to be seamen in order to handle the boat and bring her quickly back to the ship in the event of anything in the nature of a hasty retreat becoming advisable thus five of the twelve explorers were seamen and the whole of these i personally nominated being careful to choose the most steady and reliable for so important a service while the remaining six were chosen by lot from among the unmarried male emigrants this point being at length settled a packet of refreshments consisting of cold meat and ships bread was served out to each member of the expedition the largest of the quarter boats was lowered and brought to the gangway and the whole party bundled down the side into her and pushed off amid the halfenvious cheers of the rest just before they started i drew polson aside and gave him my views upon the manner in which i considered that the exploration ought to be conducted and impressed upon him the fact that he was the leader of the expedition and must exact the strictest obedience from every member of it and this he promised to do i allowed the exploring party to get fairly away from the ship and then causing the second quarter boat to be lowered sent four hands down into her with the leadline followed them myself and then headed after the first boat toward the harbour which i suspected to exist inside the two headlands first discovered by polson my object being to make a rough survey of this harbour before attempting to take the ship into it the fact that i would allow only four seamen to accompany me occasioned some further discontent among the number who were obliged to remain aboard the ship but i cared nothing for this i was quite determined that no unnecessary risks of any kind should be run and since these people appeared unable to think for themselves and wilde seemed to have as little idea as the rest of them of what precautions ought to be observed i just resolved to think for them at least until they were all safely ashore and i could feel that i was no longer responsible for their safety after that they might take as many risks as they pleased as we in the second boat neared the two headlands which formed the approach to the inner harbour they assumed a much more imposing appearance than they had presented from the deck of the ship rising sheer out of the water to a height of nearly or quite two hundred feet in the form of precipitous cliffs of dark rock which sloped away on either hand until at a distance of about a mile to right and left they dwindled away to nothing and were lost in the verdant slope that rose gently from the outside beach i started sounding as soon as the boat pushed off from the ships side and instead of heading directly for the inner harbour pursued a zigzag course athwart and toward the mouth of it each arm of the zigzag measuring about half a mile i did this in the hope of discovering any hidden dangers that might perchance lurk in the track of the ship on her way into the inner harbour but we found none and the floor of the lagoon seemed to be as smooth and almost as level as that of a ballroom sloping very gradually up from a deep five fathoms where the ship lay to four and a half fathoms between the two headlands but when at length we got fairly in between those two headlands what a surprise was sprung upon us i had expectedand indeed the utmost extent of my hopes had beenthat inside those two heads we might find a snug little cove just large enough to allow the ship room to swing in but to the astonishment of us all when we got inside we found ourselves in a splendid landlocked basin measuring about two and a half miles long by about one and threequarter miles wide by far the largest part of the area lying to the southwestward of the entrance on the inner side the two heads presented very much the same appearance as they did outside that is to say they sprang sheer out of the water as practically vertical cliffs gradually decreasing in height until at about a distance of a mile from the harbour entrance they disappeared altogether merging into the general gentle upward slope of the land from the waters edge where the cliffs ended a beautiful sandy beach began having a sweep of fully three miles round the back of the basin it was on this beach that the exploring party had landed and when we entered the basin there was the other boat her stem hauled up on the beach and her painter made fast to an oar the loom of which had been driven deep into the sand instead of lying off afloat with two hands in her as boatkeepers ready for any emergency as i had directed it was a little annoying to find ones instructions disregarded so flagrantly but i reminded myself that with the berthing of the ship in the basin i should have accomplished all that had been demanded of me and henceforth must expect to be treated as a nonentity that of course would leave me quite free to think out some plan whereby to effect my escape and return to civilisation for wildes socialistic doctrines did not in the least appeal to me and not even the prospect of passing the remainder of my life upon that beautiful and fertile island could reconcile me to them however there was plenty of time before me in which to work out a plan of escape my present business was to ascertain whether the basinas i already named it in my own mindafforded safe anchorage for the ship i therefore resumed the task of sounding working pretty regularly all over the area of it with the result that the floor was found to slope upward very gradually until within about half a mile of lowwater mark when the slope became comparatively steep so far as my somewhat cursory survey went there seemed to be no submerged rocks shoals or other dangers in that beautiful landlocked harbour to imperil the safety of the ship but in order to make assurance doubly sure i landed on the inner beach and ascended the southwest headfrom which the best view of the basin was to be obtainedwhen the sun having by this time climbed nearly to the zenith and his rays striking down almost perpendicularly into the water i was able to see a considerable portion of the sandy floor of the harbour through the crystalline depths of its waters but neither in this way could i discover any sign of danger or obstruction i therefore concluded that the ship might be brought inside the heads and anchored pretty closely to the beach without much apprehension of harm happening to her especially as there did not appear to be more than eighteen inches rise of tide in this particular part of the ocean from the situation which i now occupied i was of course afforded the best view of the island that i had yet obtained and truth compels me to say that the more i saw of it the better i liked it there should be no lack of fresh water on the island for even from my point of observation there were at least a dozen small streams in sight and doubtless there were others beyond the range of my vision then the trees upon it seemed to number some hundreds of thousands a very fair proportion of which appeared to be of large size and the timber of which would probably be found useful for a multiplicity of purposes it was a veritable garden of flowers of the most varied and beautiful shapes and hues butterflies of enormous size and the most gorgeous colours flitted here and there bees hovered over the multitudinous blossoms busily engaged in collecting their store of honey many birds were seen some of then of marvellously beautiful plumage while as to fruit wild strawberries and raspberries flourished in profusion even upon the headland on which i was standing and which boasted no other vegetation than grass and low bushes the shores of the basin offered an absolutely ideal site for a town although the ground there might perhaps be considered rather low and for my own part i practically made up my mind that while i would stick to the ship as long as i might be permitted to do so if i were compelled to remain on the island for any length of time i would endeavour to secure a plot of land on the weather side of the island and about halfway up the side of the mountain one of the most remarkable facts connected with the island that served to confirm me in the conviction that it was uninhabited was the extraordinary and absolute fearlessness of man which the birds and other living things exhibited they flitted about us and settled within reach of our hands and numbers of them might have been captured had i permitted it but i pointed out to the men who accompanied me the absolute uselessness as well as cruelty of such a proceeding and contrived to convince them that a great deal more pleasure was to be derived from the sight of these beautiful creatures alive and flying about in perfect freedom and fearlessness than from the possession of a few of their dead and stuffed skins having at length learned as much as was possible in such a brief visit to this island paradise and having also fully made up my mind as to the precise spot in the basin where the mercury should be moored i summoned my boats crew to follow me and descending to the beach got into our boat and pulled back to the ship just in time for dinner polson being ashore with the explorers the cabin party at dinner consisted only of miss hartley tudsbery and myself and it was only natural that my two companions should be eager to learn what impression a nearer view of the island had produced upon me although i could not help thinking that there was a something suggestive of apprehension or distaste in the questions which the girl put to me i took but little notice of it at the moment however for i was thinking more about the task of moving the ship than of satisfying the curiosity of my companions who i considered would doubtless have an opportunity on the morrow to learn for themselves all that they desired to know i had so completely made up my mind that there was no reason why the ship should not at once be taken into the basin that as soon as dinner was over i gave the carpenter instructions to muster the hands and heave short the news that the ship was about to enter the basin producing a sufficient number of voluntary helpers from among the emigrants to render the task of walking the ship up to her anchor an easy one despite the fact that the exploring party left us five seamen short then the seamen who remained on board having loosed and set the three topsails jib and spanker we broke out the anchor cast the ship with her head to the southward for a short stretch in the lagoon in order to get a fair run in between the heads then roused the anchor up to the bows and catted it by the time that this was done we were far enough to the southward to enable us to point our jibboom straight for the fairway between the headsthe northernmost of which slightly overlapped the otherwhen we tacked ship and bore away for the entrance with the emigrants crowding the waist on both sides of the ship eager to see their new home at somewhat closer quarters a quarter of an hour later we swept in between the two towering headlands with sufficient way on the ship to carry us through the belt of calm under the lee of the northernmost head and the interior of the basin in all its beauty lay spread out like a picture before us loud ejaculations of delight proclaimed the pleasure which the sight gave to the emigrants several of whom turned their faces toward the poop and in unmistakable language hinted the hope that they would now be allowed to go ashore without further delay once fairly inside the head the helm was starboarded and the ship was headed for a sort of bay in the southern extremity of the basin the topsail halyards were let go the jib hauled down and the spanker brailed in and with the way that she still had on her the mercury slowly drifted to the spot which i had chosen as her final berth and the anchor was let go in three and a half fathoms of water i am afraid i earned a certain amount of unpopularity by steadfastly refusing to allow anyone to leave the ship until the explorers should have returned but the refusal was part of my policy of extreme caution of leaving nothing to chance and of taking no risks of any kind and i adhered to it explaining my reasons and i think convincing the majority that i was right with the mooring of the mercury in the berth which i had chosen for her inside the basin i considered my task and my responsibility at an end and seating myself in a basket chair on the poop beneath the awning i disposed myself to begin thinking out some plan for the ordering of my own future conduct but i had scarcely settled myself comfortably when i was joined by grace hartley who strove to conceal a somewhat embarrassed manner and the obvious fact that she had something on her mind behind an attempt at light and frivolous conversation i endured this as long as i could but at length the girls preoccupation became so marked that i interrupted her somewhat unceremoniously by saying pray excuse me for breaking in upon your entertaining remarks miss hartley but do you not think you had better come to the point and have done with it you want to say something to me and do not quite know how to begin is not that the fact yes mr troubridge it is she acknowledged although how you managed to guess it i am sure i dont know well said i let it suffice that i have guessed it now go ahead and just tell me what it is the girl hesitated for some time and at length said with a laugh of embarrassment i know quite well what it is that i want to say but my difficulty is that i do not know how you will take it for i have only a very hazy idea what are your own ideas upon the subject has it anything to do with gurney by any chance i asked well yes it hasin a way she answered the fact is mr troubridge that now when that horrid man wildes scheme seems to be nearing fruition i am beginning to realise that i am in a very awkward and difficult position and i am feeling very anxious i have heard much talk lately that has greatly alarmed me and i have been compelled to ask myself what is to be the outcome of this attempt to found a colony upon socialistic lines i admit that i have never very closely studied the doctrine of socialism but if wildes views are to be accepted as its gospel my common sense tells me that the experiment which we are about to make can result in nothing but a ghastly fiasco the text of his preaching is social equality equality there has never been and never will be such a thing so long as this world endures and mankind is what it is and all attempts to make and keep men equal are foredoomed to end in failure even as they did in the days of the french revolution i foresee that one of the first results which will follow such an attempt here will be discontent then will speedily follow dissension and finally anarchy and i look forward to that condition of things with the utmost dread for anarchy means lawlessness violence the adoption of the doctrine that might is right and in the midst of such a state of things what will happen to us unfortunate women ah said i that is a question which i should think will affect you very closely although judging merely from what i have seen of the others i doubt whether it will greatly trouble them i imagine that even if anarchy should come they will know pretty well how to take care of themselves even as the french revolutionary women did but what has all this got to do with gurney well it concerns him in this way the girl answered he thinks upon this subject precisely as i do and foreseesas i dothat grave troubles for us all loom in the notfardistant future of course you know very little about george gurney mr troubridge to you he is merely one of the crew of this ship but with some little embarrassment which i very readily understood i have seen a great deal of him of late and i assure you that he is a very remarkable man intelligent welleducated refined indeed as a matter of fact i believealthough he has never told me sothat he was born to a very different station in life from that which he now occupies i may as well acknowledge that it is to conversations i have had with him that i have come to see things in the light that i have endeavoured to make clear to you and it is partly at his suggestion that i finally decided to mention the subject to you and endeavour to obtain your views upon it my views miss hartley said i are in all essentials identical with your ownand gurneysand if you think fit you may tell him so oh thank you mr troubridge exclaimed my companion i will certainly do so for i am sure that he will be glad to hear it of course you understand that this conversation of ours was intended to be private you will not mention to others what i will not i promised make your mind quite easy upon that point as a matter of fact i am very much obliged to you for opening your mind to me i will give what you have said my most serious consideration and it may be that a little later on i shall be very glad to have a little further conversation with you upon this most interesting subject chapter twelve a landing is effected the explorers weary but jubilant bubbling over with enthusiastic encomiums upon the beauty fertility and resources of the island and loaded down with samples of the numerous fruits and vegetable products which they had discovered arrived on board the ship just as the sun was sinking beyond the southern shoulder of the peak polson reported that upon landing they had gone to the westward and thence north east and south spreading themselves out in such a manner as to cover the widest possible extent of country while still retaining touch with each other and had carefully examined the entire coast line of the island in search of indications of the presence of natives but finding none so they had come to the conclusion that they might safely assume the island to be uninhabited and therefore in that respect as in all others eminently suited to their requirements they had found two harbours in addition to the basin onethat which we had observed on the preceding evening toward the northwestern extremity of the island and the otherof nearly the same area as the basinon the northern shore but they considered both these harbours to be inferior to the basin from the fact that the one on the northwest coast was practically an open roadstead exposed to westerly winds while the other although pretty well sheltered from all except northwesterly windswhich seldom blew in that latitudewas shallow the fringing reef entirely filling it they described the island as abundantly watered having encountered and crossed no less than twentyseven streams and brooks during the day and there did not appear to be a sterile spot anywhere upon it except just the bald head of the peak wilde was of opinion that the island was rich in minerals traces of both iron and coal having been met with while outcrops of granite and a very beautiful marble probably exceedingly rich in lime had also been encountered this was the first rough report of the explorers given immediately upon their return to the ship which wilde undertook to supplement in an address which he proposed to deliver from the poop after supper accordingly at the conclusion of the meal all hands emigrants and seamen alike mustered in the waist and on the quarterdeck finding seats where they could some of them on the rail with their feet resting on the planksheer some on the after hatch and the rest on the deck planks while polson tudsbery grace hartley and i disposed ourselves upon the poop near enough to hear all that was said wilde placing himself in the centre of the fore end of the poop where he could be seen and heard by everybody i am bound to admit that as a speaker the exschoolmaster acquitted himself fairly well his grammar was unexceptionable as might be reasonably expected his choice of words admirable and his mode of expressing himself easy yet precise while he seemed to have the gift of arranging the points of his subject symmetrically and in such a manner as instantly to catch and hold the attention of his hearers he began by recounting in detail the history of the days doings describing the route taken the nature of the country passed over and the various products met with some of his descriptive passages dealing with the beauties of the scenerythe loveliness of the wooded glens each with its tiny streamlet flowing over a rocky bed with here and there a romantic treeshaded waterfall its jagged margin adorned with rich growths of rare and beautiful ferns the wide parklike expanses of greensward dotted with magnificent trees the tangled brakes gorgeous with strange and wonderful orchids and flowering shrubs and creepers the countless fruitbearing trees and shrubs loaded with luscious fruits and berries the miles of coconut palms bordering the shore the gailyplumaged birds with their quaint and sometimes discordant cries the brilliantwinged butterflieswere both picturesque and poetical there were neither savages ferocious animalsor indeed animals of any kindnor reptiles on the island so far as the explorers had been able to discover he said and as for the extent of the island it was sufficient to provide each individual of the party including the children with ample subsistence for the rest of his or her life then he proceeded to sketch outfor about the thousandth timethe principle upon which the community was to be governed it was to be subject to laws which were to be enacted from time to time by a council of sevenincluding himselfof which he was to be president for life in virtue of the fact that the whole scheme and idea was of his originating the remaining six members of council to be elected once every three years there were to be no distinctions of rank or class all were to be absolutely equal there was to be no such thing as private property everything being held in common everybody was to labour diligently for the benefit of the entire community and the natural increase due to every persons labour was to be delivered into a sort of general store or warehouse and apportioned out in accordance with rules to be framed by the council there was a great deal more said that night to the same effect some of the statements being received with rapturous applausechiefly by the lazy and neerdowell members of the party but i could see that although all hands had in the first instance jumped readily enough at the prospect of an easy and luxurious life freeas they thoughtfrom all restraint in a land of eternal summer there were those among them to whom the socialistic doctrine of perfect equality and all things in common was already distinctly distasteful and i believed that if i could but school myself sufficiently in the exercise of that patience which is said to be a virtue i should hear more of that distaste and also of other things that might be advantageous to me in my determination to effect my escape from a community with the aims of which i was entirely out of sympathy wilde closed his discourse with the announcement that on the morrow all hands would be permitted to go on shore immediately after breakfast to view the island and sample its products for themselves returning to the ship at sunset in time for supper after which another meeting would be held for the purpose of electing the six members of council who would upon election immediately proceed to frame laws for the good government of the community and also make arrangements for its settlement upon the island accordingly soon after sunrise on the following morning the emigrants once more made their appearance on deck in holiday attire all impatient for the moment to arrive when the boats should be brought to the gangway to convey them to those green and bosky glades which had spread themselves so alluringly before their gaze for the preceding fortyeight hours so eager were they that it was only with the utmost difficulty we were able to persuade them to go below again until the crew had had time to wash decks and perform the ships toilet for the day my determination not to forgo this daily duty drew from wilde an acrimonious remonstrance but his objections were promptly overruled by polson and tudsbery who i now discovered to my great satisfaction were with most of the crew disposed still to leave all matters strictly pertaining to the ship and her rule and governance entirely in my hands wilde dont know nothin about a ship mr troubridgehow should he explained polson to me and if he was let to have his way he might start pullin of her to pieces for the sake of her timber and metal as likely as not he would said i but you men must never permit that polson at least not for some time to come there are a dozen ways in which she may yet be found eminently useful for instance beautiful and altogether suitable as this island appears for your purpose who is to say that it does not possess some subtle peculiarity of climate rendering it unfit for the abode of europeans and what sort of condition would you be in if such should prove to be the case and you had no ship to which to retreat and in which to seek another island very true sir cut in the carpenter i hadnt thought of that but theres the chance of it all the same now that you comes to mention it as a matter of fact however it was not the above reason that influenced me in the least in my desire to ensure the preservation of the ship for although i had mentioned it i did not for a moment believe that the contingency would ever arise but like grace hartley and gurney i had long since subjected wildes theories to careful examination and decided that there was nothing in them to satisfy a man possessed of a healthy ambition to make his mark in the world i therefore wanted to keep open for myself a way of escape and no better way could possibly be afforded than by the ship by one bell in the forenoon watchhalfpast eightbreakfast was over and everybody was once more on deck and clustering about the gangways waiting for the boats to be brought alongside this was soon done every boat belonging to the ship having been got into the water and veered astern the first thing that morning but now another delay occurred most vexatious to the impatient emigrants for every one of the boatsexcepting the quarter boats which had been kept tight by filling them about a quarter full of water every morningproved so leaky their seams having opened through long exposure to the air that they had quietly swamped in the interval between six oclock and breakfasttime the swamping process however had not occupied more than a quarter of an hour since which time the submerged boats had been rapidly taking up therefore when soon afterward they were baled out it was found that they had already become tight enough to make the short passage to the shore and by ten oclock the ship was empty save for polson and two seamen who had been included in the exploring party of the previous day and who were now willing to remain aboard and look after her i went ashore in the last boat to leave the ship and upon stepping ashore at once set my face toward the peak with the intention of ascending it the nearer slopes ahead of me were thickly dotted with people in little groups parents and children or friends who were bent upon seeing something of the island certainly but whose chief aim was an enjoyable picnic the children were already for the most part busily engaged in plucking the many strange and beautiful flowers with which the greensward was thickly dotted while the parents eager to sample the various fruits which the island yielded vainly strove to quicken the youngsters pace there were a few solitary couples straying off by themselves and among them i presently recognised gurney and grace hartley wilde acting as cicerone to a large party who were evidently anxious to see as much as possible of the island forthwith was already a long way ahead the greensward which came right down to the beach of coarse coral grit rose undulatingly at a very gentle slope until within about three quarters of a mile from the summit of the peak when the slope became considerably steeperprobably a rise of one in fiveto within a couple of hundred feet of the summit when the slope took an angle of about fortyfive degrees but it must not be imagined that the very gentle slope of which i have spoken was uniform for it was far from that on the contrary i had not advanced much more than half a mile on my way before i came to first a slight dip then a rather stiff rise of a few hundred yards to a kind of ridge upon surmounting which i found myself upon the edge of a wildly picturesque glen or ravine the steep sides of which consisted of finely broken ground interspersed with outcrops of lichenstained rock and thickly overgrown with a tangle of bushes and flowering shrubs with here and there a few graceful saplings or a clump of noble shade trees entwined with strangelooking and beautiful orchids the cool refreshing musical sound of running water came up from the depths of the glen although the stream itself was not visible from where i stood while the subdued roar of a distant waterfall strongly tempted me to swerve from my path and follow the upward course of the glen i surrendered myself to the temptation rather erroneously arguing that every foot of rise must necessarily take me so much nearer the summit of the peak whereas i eventually found that i had diverged almost at right angles to my proper course but i was richly rewarded for my labour and loss of time for at the end of a somewhat arduous climb of about twenty minutes i found myself gazing at as romantic and beautiful a bit of scenery as i had ever beheld i was in a deep hollow between two hills the bottom of the hollow forming a rocky basin into which poured the water of a small stream some ten feet in width as it tumbled over a broad rocky ledge some sixty feet above and came foaming lacelike down the mossgrown face of the precipice the pool or basin into which the water fell was some thirty feet in diameter and apparently about four feet deep the pebbly bottom showing with startling distinctness through the crystal clear water the steep sides of the hollow were grassgrown with great rough outcrops of granite rock showing here and there out of the interstices of which sprang a great variety of beautiful ferns and were overhung by a magnificent tangle of beautiful trees and bushes growing so thickly together as completely to exclude the suns rays bathing the whole scene in a soft cool delicious green twilight the water looked so clear so cool so altogether tempting that i decided there and then to treat myself to the luxury of a freshwater bath i accordingly stripped and sprang in fully expecting to touch bottom but to my astonishment the pool proved to be fully ten feet deep moreover the water was icy cold or appeared to be so in comparison with the tropical heat of the air i therefore scrambled out as quickly as possible and dressing resumed my ramble greatly refreshed by my dip the hot air was heavy with the smell of wet earth the spray of the waterfall the rank vegetation that flourished riotously along the margins of the brook and the mingled perfumes of a thousand varieties of strange and gorgeously tinted flowers as i laboriously climbed the steep side of the ravine after crossing the brook on my way to the more open country beyond but this soon changed upon my emerging from the ravine giving place to the more healthful and invigorating scent of the salt sea breeze that came sweeping over the island and roared among the lofty branches of the trees among the trunks of which i now wound my upward way i had now reached a parklike stretch of country the surface of which was clad with long rich luxuriant grass thickly dotted with clumps of splendid trees many of which were of immense height and girth promising a rich yield of valuable timber while others blazed with vivid scarlet flowers instead of leaves these open parklike expanses of country however were of comparatively limited extent the trees for the most part growing closely together while the space between their trunks was choked with thick undergrowth consisting of shrubs bushes and long tough flowering creepers so densely and inextricably intermingled that it was sometimes impossible to force a way through it and long detours became necessary in order to make any progress but there were other spots again which conveyed the idea of natural gardens for in them little else than fruitbearing trees were to be found among which i quickly recognised the banana the plantain the peach the orange the lime the custard apple the granadilla to say nothing of many other kinds to which i was a stranger while raspberries and strawberries were to be found almost everywhere and a little later on in my walk i came here and there upon patches of melon plants in all stages from that in which the blossom was just opening to that of the ripe and perfect fruit a particularly rich and lusciousflavoured purple grape also appeared to be exceedingly abundant needless to say i sampled these various fruits as freely as discretion permitted while i filled my pockets with others to serve as dessert to my dinner this meal i discussed luxuriously reclining upon a thick bed of soft moss surrounding a spring of deliriously cold fresh water that came bubbling up out of the earth in the shade of a thick grove of aromatic pines which constituted the last belt of timber before the bare soil surrounding the summit was reached finally after i had rested long enough to recover in a measure from the fatigue of my unwonted exertions i left the scented shadow of the pine grove and emerging into the blistering sunshine manfully set myself to climb the last three hundred feet of steep bare ascent that separated me from the highest point of the island the reason for the absolute bareness of the cone became apparent the instant that i stepped out of the shadow of the pines for i immediately plunged ankledeep in a loose deposit of ashes and pumicestone that yielded to my tread and slid away under me to such an extent as to make progress almost impossible but i was determined not to be beaten and at length after a full hours violent exertion i found myself breathless and with my clothing saturated with perspiration standing as i had expected on the lip of the crater of an extinct volcano the crater was almost mathematically circular in shape of about a quarter of a mile in internal diameter and fully five hundred feet deep the sides of the cup were practically vertical and everywhere so smooth that i could nowhere discover a spot where a descent into the crater would have been possible even had i desired to go down into it but i had no such inclination for i could see all that i wished from the summit the internal walls being absolutely bare while the bottom was simply a lake of stagnant water apparently not more than a few inches deep but if the interior of the crater offered little or nothing to attract the eye it was far otherwise when i directed my gaze outward the whole of the island except the comparatively small strip that was hidden from me by the spreading rim of the crater lay stretched out beneath me like a map beautifully executed in relief and tinted by the hand of a master its groves its brakes its broad parklike expanses its rocky glens its picturesque ravines its sparkling rivulets its deeply indented coast line its dazzlingly white beaches the outline of its fringing reef ay and the long thin line of its barrier reef with its spouting leaping wall of snowy spray reaching from north to south and spreading far into the deep blue of the ocean to the eastward were visible through that clear air with startling distinctness why i could even detect the evanescent whiteness of the breaking surges far out beyond the barrier reef where their crests were whipped into foam by the scourging of the fiery breeze i considered that i commanded a horizon of nearly a hundred and twenty miles in diameter yet throughout that wide stretch of ocean there was nothing visible save the island no ship save the mercury floating like a tiny toy upon the placid landlocked surface of the basin i keenly searched the horizon in every direction for signs of other land but nowhere could i detect even the loom of it we were absolutely alone here in our lovely island eden and there was no land in any direction near enough to cause us the slightest uneasiness as to incursions of hostile savages two full hours by my watch did i spend upon the summit of the crater slowly sauntering round its rim feasting my eyes upon the surpassing beauties of the scene beneath and around me and also sketching a rough map of the island for future use then sated with enjoyment and more than halfreconciled to the possibility that i might be compelled to spend the remainder of my life amid such glorious surroundings i set about to effect my descent and return to the ship following a route which i had mentally mapped out as it seemed to promise easier going than the one by which i had ascended taking my time choosing my ground and winding hither and thither to avoid obstacles i arrived at the beach just in good time to go off aboard with the last boatload of holiday makers all of whom though hot and weary with their long days ramble were full of enthusiasm at the prospect of making their homes on so lovely and fertile a spot and in such a perfect climate at eight oclock that night wilde ascended the poop and assuming the direction of affairs quite as a matter of course gave orders for all hands to assemble in the waist in order that the business of electing the members of councilwho in conjunction with himself were to frame the laws and order the affairs of the communitymight be proceeded with he opened the proceedings by explaining in detail precisely what the duties of the council were to be incidentally mentioning the fact that in consideration of the onerous and responsible character of those duties the members would be absolved from the performance of any and every other kind of work he dwelt at some length upon the qualifications which he considered indispensable for the efficient discharge of the duties of a member of council enumerating among others wisdom discretion organising ability and the faculty of anticipating and providing for the future needs of the community and then himself proceeded to propose the six persons whom he considered best fitted to fill the office all of them being chosen from among the emigrants at this stage of the proceedings gurney promptly rose and intervened he said that he fully agreed with the chairman both as to the necessity for extreme care in the choice of persons to fill positions of such heavy responsibility and also as to the qualifications required in the holders of such positions but while he had nothing to say against the persons proposed by the chairman he was of opinion that there was one person in the ship who despite his extreme youth was at least as fully qualified as any other individual among them to fill satisfactorily the position of a member of council and who moreover had fully earned the distinction by piloting them to this beautiful island he presumed that he need not add that he referred to young mr troubridge to whose exceptional skill as a seaman and a navigator they all owed so much these remarks were greeted with so much enthusiasm that it was with the utmost difficulty i succeeded in making it understoodto wildes manifest reliefthat for certain good and sufficient reasons i must decline to accept the proffered office but i continued it seemed to me not only a mistake but distinctly invidious that the seamen should be entirely excluded from the governing body and i considered that in common fairness to them two at least of their numberto be chosen by themselvesought to be included this proposal also was loudly applauded and after a great deal of rather heated discussion polson and gurney as representative of the officers and crew of the ship were duly elected members of council the other four being william fell once a solicitors clerk henry burgess lately a colliery agent john monroe formerly a builder and samuel hilary late agricultural labourer these four last as may be readily understood owed their election not so much to their superior qualifications as to the fact that they were redhot socialists full of plans to enable everybody to enjoy a maximum amount of comfort at the cost of a minimum of labour and they proved the sincerity of their doctrine by securing their own election to posts which freed them from the necessity to labour for themselves chapter thirteen an important talk with gurney immediately upon the completion of the election wilde in the plenitude of his zeal and eagerness to taste the sweets of power and authority insisted on calling a meeting of the council to meet there and then in the poop cabin for the purpose of arranging the proceedings of the morrow when the sitting was over polson told me that the very first proposal submitted by the president was that the ships sails should all be unbent and taken ashore to form tents for the people to live in and that next the ship should be stripped to a gantline and her spars and riggingtogether with as much of her bulwarks as might be required worked up into a raft for the conveyance of cargo to the shore of course polson with the memory of the conversation that had passed between him and myself on that very morning still fresh in his mind stoutly opposed the proposal adducing the arguments that i had used against such a proceeding and adding to them his own with such success that not only was the proposal negatived but he actually succeeded in carrying another to the effect that half a dozen hands under me were to be told off for the express purpose of giving the hull spars standing and running rigging and sails a thorough overhaul and executing such repairs etcetera as might be found necessary to bring the ship to and maintain her in a condition of perfect fitness for service at a moments notice this result achieved the boatswain was quite content to let wilde have his own way in all other respects with the result that it was quickly arranged that the hatches should be lifted the first thing after breakfast on the following morning the cargo overhauled as far as possible and room made by transferring to the shore such portions of it as were not likely to be injured by exposure to the weather also that the live stock consisting of some three dozen fowls together with a boar and two sows were to be landed and allowed to run wild for a week or two until proper quarters could be prepared for their reception in order that they might improve their condition the mention of live stock produced another weighty argument in favour of the proposal just carried by polson for it elicited an expression of opinion that horses and horned cattle as well as sheep were urgently required by the colonists and ought to be procured at the earliest possible moment what dye think of the arrangement mr troubridge asked the boatswain when he had brought his account of the proceedings to a close i see nothing to find fault with in it i replied except that i think you are acting unwisely in meddling with the cargo before providing a receptacle for it ashore i believe it highly probable that when you begin to break out the cargo you will find many things that must necessarily be kept under cover if they are not to be ruined by exposure to the weather and what will you do with them strike them back into the hold if so you will be giving yourselves double trouble and delaying instead of expediting matters well but what else can we do what would you have advised if youd been in my place demanded polson i should have proposed building a storehouse big enough to receive the whole of the cargo before removing the hatches replied i the job could easily be done a few poles cut up there among the hills and brought down to the shore a sufficient quantity of wattles to form the roof and sides and a covering of coconutpalm leaves and there you are we saw plenty of such structures among the islands that we visited before arriving here and i remember that everybody remarked how easily they might be built now why the mischief didnt i think of that exclaimed the boatswain smiting his knee with vexation of course thats the proper thing to do oh mr troubridge why didnt you let yourself be elected a member of council sir youve an old head although it is on young shoulders and youd have been worth more to us than fell burgess monroe and hilary all lumped together i refused polson said i because as you must have been aware from the first i absolutely and utterly disapproved of the whole affair from beginning to end you started wrong in the first place by stealing the ship and cargo from those to whom they lawfully belonged that is piracy an act for which some of you may yet be made to smart but apart from that i am strongly of opinion that you are starting this community upon totally wrong lines you have already heard me say more than once that i have no belief in or sympathy with the principles upon which wilde proposes to rule this settlement i do not believe they will be found to work satisfactorily and therefore i will have nothing whatever to do with the scheme yes yes i know mr troubridge ive heard you say all that afore answered polson with some impatience but all the same i cant for the life of me see whats wrong with the plan as for what you calls our act of piracy well theres no gettin away from it that if ever we was found out some of us would get toko for that job and i expect that i should be one but i dunno as i feels particlar oneasy about that for i dont see how were goin to be found out and the risk such as it is was worth runnin for aint we goin to settle down here and live in peace and plenty and happiness all our lives you think so polson i dont doubt said i but wait a while until the schoolmasters theories are put to the test of actual everyday practice and then come and tell me what you think of them all right mr troubridge thats fair enough i will answered the boatswain and therewith he rose and with a somewhat troubled countenance left me the effect of this conversation became apparent when on the following morning before breakfast polson came aft and announced to me that upon further consideration of the matter the council had decided to build a storehouse ashore before touching the cargo and he followed up this communication by asking me for my idea as to what the dimensions of the structure should be oh said i in a tone of indifference if you make it twice as long as the ships hold twice as wide and about twelve feet high to the eaves you ought to have ample room for the storage of everything in such a fashion that you can get at any particular portion of the cargo without difficulty and at a moments notice and let me give you another hint polson if you are wise you will have a careful inventory taken of every item of the cargo as it goes ashore with a record of the particular part of the building in which it is stored thank e mr troubridge thank e sir thats good advice and ill see as its follered answered the boatswain walking away now i was quite determined to hold myself absolutely aloof from everything in the most remote degree savouring of participation in this mad scheme for many reasons but i had no objection to the dropping of a hint to polson now and then for i considered that by so doing i should strengthen my influence with him i wanted him to acquire the habit of depending upon me to help him when he found himself in a difficulty of any kind and there was also the possibility that in this way i might occasionally be able to induce him to put forward or support proposals that might be of the utmost advantage to my plans of ultimate escape the revised arrangement of the council was put into effect immediately after breakfast the boats being brought alongside and all handsexcept the members of council myself and my gang and a few of the idlers sent ashore the carpenter with a gang of assistants going up to the higher lands to select cut down and transport to the near neighbourhood of the beach a sufficient number of suitable trees and saplings to form the framework of the store while another gang sought wattles wherewith to form the walls the women and children meanwhile being dispatched along the shore to collect the fallen leaves of the coconutpalms and bind them in bundles prior to their transportation to the site of the store for use as thatch for the roof and sides of the building a fourth working party at the same time was engaged in digging holes in the soil for the reception of the poles which were to form the corner and intermediate posts of the structure while all hands ashore were thus engaged the council was sitting in the poop cabin drafting the laws by which the community was to be governedand making a mighty poor business of it if the frequent outburst of voices raised in angry altercation might be taken as a criterion as for me half a dozen seamen were placed at my disposal thoroughly to overhaul the hull spars rigging and sails of the ship and i began my task by unbending all the sails that needed any repair sending them down on deck and storing them away in the sailroom prior to starting upon the repairs this did not take very long and pretty early in the afternoon i had my party at work on the poop under an awning cutting out worn cloths and inserting new from the stock of canvas carried for that purpose ripping off the old roping and replacing it with new and generally putting each sail into perfectly good and reliable condition there was not so much of this kind of work to be done as i had feared so it and the building of the warehouse came to an end together then followed the discharging of the cargo which was conveyed to the shore in boats carried up from the beach on mens shoulders or in the case of the heavier packages on hand barrows a few there were so heavy that they had to be removed from the beach on rollers but they were not many and when the ships hold was empty and the whole of its contents transferred to the warehouse there ensued a general overhaul of everything and a detailed inventory was taken showing precisely what articles and materials and in what quantity were at the disposal of the community the ship being empty i seized the opportunity to careen her examine her sheathing go over it with mallets where it had become wrinkled with the straining of the hull stripping off the worst of it and replacing it with new so far as our resources would allow removed all weed and barnacles and recaulked her seams where necessary the next job was to smoke her for rats with which she was overrun and remove their carcasses then we repainted her inside and out having plenty of paint for the purpose after which we ballasted her with sand putting a sufficient quantity into her to make her tolerably weatherly finally we gave her spars and rigging a thorough overhaul fitting to her a new main topmast the old one proving to be slightly sprung and rove a considerable quantity of new running gear the lower masts bowsprit mastheads and yards were next repainted the bright spars thoroughly scraped and revarnished the standing rigging tarred down and last of all the sails were rebent and the old mercury was once more ready to go to sea at practically a moments notice all this work with the small gang of men at my disposal occupied the best part of six months in the doing meanwhile the remainder of the community had not been altogether idle although it had already become apparent that there was a fairly liberal sprinkling of drones among them and there was a steadily growing discontent among the more industriously disposed because of this and because also wildes doctrines provided no means whereby the lazy ones could be compelled to do their fair share of work but despite this the aspect of the island had greatly changednot altogether for the better i thoughtduring the months of our sojourn upon it in the first place the warehouse had been so easily and quickly erected that a roomy barracklike structure had at once been built alongside it for the accommodation of all hands pending the erection of separate dwellings of better appearance and a more permanent character for the several families then many marriages had taken place wilde in his capacity of chief magistrate undertaking to tie the nuptial knot but the erection of two buildings by no means comprised the sum total of what had thus far been accomplished by the settlers small parties of prospectors had been sent out to ascertain the resources of the island and among many other valuable products coal iron clay of exceptionally fine quality for the manufacture of bricks and tiles marble granite basalt limestone pine satinwood teak and sandalwood in exceedingly large quantities had been found a brick and tile yard had been established over on the northwest side of the island and large quantities of splendid bricks and tiles had already been made a limekiln had been built and was in full operation and a large consignment of circular and other saws having been found among the cargo a sawmill had been erected alongside one of the numerous streams the flow of which had been utilised to drive the saws and much timber had already been cut down and converted into planks and scantling a considerable quantity of sandalwood had likewise been collected with the intention of loading it into the ship and dispatching her with it to china there to be converted into money with which a cargo of tea and another ship were to be purchased and dispatched to find a profitable market the proceeds of the cargo being expended to provide live stock and such other necessaries as the settlers might require so much sandalwood indeed had already been collected that to make room for it it had been found necessary to discharge all but some eighty tons of the sand ballast that had been originally shipped and the mercury was now quite deep enough in the water to enable her to go to sea with safety at any moment the only thing that was worrying wilde and the council so far as this part of their plans was concerned was the fact that i was the only navigator among them and well knowing how strongly i had disapproved of everything connected with the original scheme for the appropriation of the ship and her cargo they feared that if i were sent away to navigate the ship i should betray them at the first civilised port arrived at while without me the ship could not be sent to sea at all i gathered this partly from the strenuous efforts that were now being made to induce me to throw in my lot with the rest of the settlers and partly from grace hartley between whom and myself a firm friendship had steadily grown up and who in her turn had gained a pretty fair knowledge of the situation from gurney but i did not often see her for she had been installed as schoolmistress to instruct the young folk of the settlement while i in conjunction with a young fellow named meadows who had served his pupilage with an architect and surveyor in england had been set the task of making a detailed survey and plan of the entire island the affairs of the settlement had reached this stage when on a certain evening after all hands had knocked off for the day miss hartley came to my side as we were leaving the large shed in which all meals were served and after a few casual remarks that gave us time to get out of earshot of the rest said i suppose mr troubridge after tramping about all day in the hot sun as you have been you feel too tired to come for a walk with george and me no indeed i do not i answered i have grown quite accustomed to be on my feet all day and now think nothing of it indeed i had it in my mind to take a stroll in any case the evening is far too fine and beautiful to be spent under cover but may i ask have you any special reason for giving me this invitation yes said grace i have the fact is mr troubridge that george is very anxious to have a chat with you all right i said i shall be very pleased it is some time now since gurney and i have spoken to each other but do you know what he wishes to speak to me about i hope there is nothing wrong no she saidno there is nothing actually wrong but george will tell you all about it himself do you mind if we go up on to the head it will be delightful up there tonight and we can talk without much fear of being overheard i told george we would go there and he will follow us and so he did overtaking us about halfway up the rise i must apologise mr troubridge he said for troubling you to come all this way after your long days work but the fact is that for the last month i have had it in my mind to speak to you and the inducement to do so has been growing ever since to come to the point at once grace and i have had enough of wilde and his fantastic notions and would like to cut our connection with the whole concern if it were possible i am speaking quite freely to you mr troubridge for i know that you have been dragged into this business quite against your will andapart from what grace has told me from time to timei have drawn my own conclusions from your steadfast refusal to sign the charter also from what i have seen of you i feel tolerably certain that whatever i may say to you in confidence will not be betrayed to others of course said i you may rest assured of that but what is it that you wish to do gurney and in what way do you imagine that i can help you well said gurney the idea has taken hold of meand not me only i may tell you but a good many others wilde being one of themthat if a chance to quit this island and return to civilisation were to present itself to you you would gladly seize it and it is just this idea that has caused wilde to hesitate about completing the loading of the ship and dispatching her under your command something however must be done soon for the settlement is in urgent need of live stock and many other things which must be obtained by hook or by crook without much further delay now i cannot speak with certainty because i dont know but by putting two and two together i have come to the conclusion that wilde and certain other unscrupulous persons among his followers have it in their minds to fill up the ship with sandalwood man her with a dozen or so of the forecastle hands in whom they can place absolute trust and dispatch her to canton under your command butand here comes in the villainy of the schemeas soon as a landfall is made you are to be quietly knocked on the head and hove over the side to prevent all further trouble the ship is to be taken into port she and her cargo are to be disposed of another vessel and a cargo of tea are to be bought with the proceeds a skipper secured and the new ship is then to proceed to some good market where the tea will be disposed of and the proceeds applied to the purchase of what is most urgently needed by the settlers a very pretty scheme indeed i exclaimed but gurney you must be mistaken as to their intention to do away with me why the idea is monstrous it means sheer deliberate coldblooded murder yes it does admitted gurney and of course i may be mistaken for i do not enjoy wildes full confidence by any meanswe are far too antagonistic in every way for that but let me urge you not to trust too much to the possibility that i may be mistaken mr troubridge for i do not believe that i am and if it should happen to be you and not i who are mistaken it would be bad for you would it not it would i agreed but forewarned is forearmed gurney and i would take precious good care not to be caught napping was it to tell me this that you proposed this walk tonight yes answered gurney to tell you that and also to say that if what you have heard tonight should determine you to attempt an escape from the island you may rely upon grace and me to help you to the utmost extent of our power also i want you to include us both in your plan i think it will be quite worth your while to take us with you mr troubridge for you know something of my qualifications as a seaman and i am sure i could be of service in carrying out your plans while as for grace well if she can do nothing else she can at least cook our grub for us now what do you say i say that i will gladly include both of you in my plans and there is my hand upon it answered i offering him my right hand in token of good faith we discussed the matter for some time longer and at length i said now please leave me to think this matter out what you have told me has taken me a good deal by surprise and as yet i feel scarcely able to grasp the full significance of it but i have no doubt that i shall get the bearings of it within the next hour or so meanwhile i believe you are right in suggesting that it would be unwise to leave anything to chance i will therefore endeavour to think out some practical scheme and when i have done so we will have another chat and now good night good night miss hartley chapter fourteen the critical moment approaches i watched the tall goodlooking wellspoken sailor and the slim willowy figure of his sweetheart gradually vanish amid the deep shadows of the bushes that bordered the path leading downward from the head and then oblivious of the peril of rheumatism seated myself upon the least dewsodden boulder that i could find and proceeded to think out the momentous communication that had just been made to me it was a glorious night the full moon some thirty degrees above the eastern horizon flashed the whole sea beneath her outside the reef into a vast sheet of tumbling liquid silver while her beams fell in a long line of tremulous radiance upon the placid waters of the lagoon right up to the edge of the cliff upon which i sat the sky was cloudless and toward the zenith and away down in the west some of the larger stars beamed with that soft yet brilliant effulgence that is only to be seen within the tropics but in her own neighbourhood the stronger light of the moon had eclipsed them all save the planet venus that hung near her glowing like a silver lamp so brilliant were the moonbeams that even the ants beetles and other small creeping things that ran about my feet were distinctly visible as were the tints of the flowers that bloomed everywhere and some of which had the peculiarity of opening only at night a soft and gentle breeze was blowing in from the sea just strongly enough to stir and rustle the grasses and foliage about me and to bring to my ears the deep and ceaseless thunder of the surf that beat everlastingly upon the distant reef the greater part of the basin was still in shadow including that where the mercury lay but the moon was high enough for her rays to reach the upper spars of the ship almost down to her topsail yards and the dewwetted spars and rigging gleamed as though inlaid with wires of silver the settlement temporarily built on the inner shore of the basin was almost as distinctly visible as though it were daylight its scattered lights gleaming yellow through the gauzelike mistiness of the dewladen atmosphere and from it the slopes and undulations of the island delicately receded until at the peak they assumed almost the ethereal softness of clouds it was a glorious scene that the island presented slumbering langorously under the brilliant rays of the tropical moon more enchanting in some respects than when viewed in the garish light of the sun and so strong was the enticement of its beauty upon me that but for the dull cramping influence of the doctrines accepted by the settlers upon which to frame the guiding rules of their lives i could without very much difficulty have reconciled myself to the idea of a sojourn there for the remainder of my days but i had already perceived unmistakable evidences of the blighting effect which was being steadily produced upon certain members of the community by the consciousnesswhich i think some of them were only now beginning to fully realisethat industry and individual effort were to count for nothing and that the lazy useless units were to live a life of inglorious ease at the expense of the hard workers i foresaw that a time was coming when deadly strife would rage between the two sections and the prospect was not enticing enough to induce me to throw in my lot with the rest yet if i did not my life would be in danger for it scarcely needed gurneys communication of an hour before to impress upon me the conviction that sooner or later wilde and his followers would insist upon my giving in my adhesion to them ortaking the consequences of refusal and it did not need the gift of the seer to forecast the precise character of those consequences i had scouted the idea of deliberate coldblooded murder when gurney had suggested it to me yet i had not forgotten that i had already been threatened with death as the alternative to undertaking the navigation of the ship during the quest for a suitable island upon which to settle and i had very little doubt that they would have carried out their threat had i persisted in my refusal now i was again threatened with it there seemed to be but two alternativessubmission or flight and it was but the work of a moment with me to decide that flight was the more acceptable of the two but how to accomplish it i thought of the longboat but to fit her for a long voyage in the open ocean with any hope of accomplishing it would need an amount of preparation that could not possibly escape notice and to be detected in the making of such preparations would be to arouse such suspicion as must inevitably result in the complete defeat of my plans followed perhaps by other consequences of a still more serious character while to neglect them and attempt flight in the boat just as she was would be madnessan expedient only to be resorted to under stress of the direst extremity hour after hour i sat there racking my brains in quest of some practicable plan offering a reasonable prospect of success but could think of nothing the scheme upon which i finally settled being only one degree less mad than that of venturing to sea in the unprepared longboat such as it was however i determined to submit it to gurneys consideration and hear what he thought of it accordingly watching my opportunity i contrived to get hold of grace hartley on the following evening after supper and whispered to her that i intended to walk up to the head again and would be glad if she and gurney would follow me to the spot where we had had our previous talk together to which she replied that they would certainly do so and half an hour later the pair joined me well mr troubridge exclaimed gurney as we met i hope this summons means that you have succeeded in hitting upon some scheme which will enable us all three to get away from here without delay for i may as well tell you that the council have today decided to complete the loading of the mercury and dispatch her to canton forthwith and although wilde did not say so in so many words i have every reason to believe that the pretty little programme which i sketched out to you last night is to be carried through so much the greater reason why you and i gurney should make up our minds at once what is to be done said i yes you are right answered gurney for i have not yet told you the whole of the story nor how it affects grace and me i as one of the council am to go in the ship ostensibly for the purpose of transacting the commercial part of the businessthe disposal of the ship and cargo the purchase of another vessel and of a cargo of tea and so on but actuallyas i have only too much reason to fearin order that during my absence wilde may have an opportunity to force grace to marry him i see said i well gurney the only scheme that i have thus far been able to think of is of so mad and desperate a character that i gravely doubt whether you will feel justified in having anything to do with it let us hear what it is mr troubridge answered gurney it will have to be something pretty desperate to choke grace and me off it for i can tell you we are growing more than a trifle desperate ourselves well said i to put the scheme baldly i simply propose that we three shall run off with the ship sail her to sydney hand her over to the authorities telling the whole truth and take our chance of what may follow i doubt whether they would deal hardly with either of us miss hartley is of course quite blameless they would never dream of holding her in the least degree responsible for the theft of the ship and cargo nor do i believe they would be very hard upon me seeing that wilde and the rest compelled me to fall in with their plans and as for yourself the fact that you had assisted me to restore the ship to her proper owners would probably be accepted as a setoff against your share of the crime of stealing the ship especially in view of the fact that we had brought in a cargo of sandalwood in place of the much less valuable cargo which the settlers have appropriated now what do you think of it well answered gurney slowly as he turned my plan over in his mind the proposal that two men and a girl shall attempt to navigate a ship of eight hundred tons from here to sydneya matter of four thousand miles or more i supposehas certainly as you say more than a suggestion of madness about it yet i believe that we could do it mr troubridgei was in plymouth sound a trifle over two years ago when a ship nearly as big as the mercury came in she was from rio and the second mate an apprentice and one ordinary seaman comprised the whole of her crew she sailed from rio with her full complement and when she was only three days at sea an outbreak of yellow fever occurred aboard her first one and then another and another of her crew was struck down but the skipper would not put back he had a fair wind and he insisted that the mens best chance of shaking off the fever lay in keeping the ship at sea and they did so although the men continued to die until by the time that they reached the latitude of the azores only the three i have named remained alive meanwhile as the crew dwindled and the ship became shorthanded they snugged her down until at last they had nothing set but the closereefed fore and main topsails and the fore topmast staysail and under that canvas she entered the sound hoveto and signalled for assistance oh yes i am sure we could do it provided of course that we kept our health and we should have to take our chance of that it would be hard work certainly but there are two of us both fairly strong andas the second mate of that ship i told you of answered when he was asked how they managedone can do a lot of work with a tackle or two and as to how the authorities might be disposed to regard my share of the stealing of the ship i would take my chance of that gracie here can bear witness that i was never in favour of the scheme and only joined in it with a good grace because there seemed nothing else to be done now as to the best time for making the attempt what is your idea about that well said i in view of the fact that it has actually been decided to send the ship to sea i think it will be well to wait until the cargo is all in and the hatches on that will give us an opportunity to get all our traps aboard without exciting suspicion then on the night of the day prior to the sailing of the ship we three must go off to her slip her cable make sailas much as we can manageand trust that we may be able to reach open water before our flight is discovered if the completion of the loading can by any means be delayed until the moon rises about an hour after midnight so much the better oh as to that answered gurney the deliberate way of working that the people have got into will make it quite a week before the loading is finished which will bring moonrise to somewhere about the time you mention the moon will have taken off to about her third quarter by then but even so she will give us light enough to find our way out through the reef which is all that we need trouble about precisely i agreed then am i to understand that you and miss hartley definitely agree to throw in your lot with me in this desperate attempt yes mr troubridge you certainly may answered gurney at least he corrected himself i can answer for myself and as to gracie here what say you little woman i say of course that i would infinitely prefer to go with you and mr troubridge answered the girl the only thing is she continued that i am afraid i shall be a frightful trouble to you both and yet i dont know i can cook your meals for you and i can steer the ship in fine weather cant i george ay that you can as well as any man in the ship answered gurney i taught her myself mr troubridge long before you appeared upon the scene i foresee miss hartley said i that so far from being a trouble to us you will be absolutely indispensable to our success and now gurney i think we had better part for under all the circumstances i believe it will scarcely be wise for you and me to be seen very much together watch the progress of events in the council and let me know if anything should transpire of a character likely to interfere with our plans on the evening of the following day upon my return to the settlement from the scene of the surveying operations i found awaiting me a formal intimation from the council of its determination forthwith to complete the loading of the mercury and dispatch her to sea at the earliest possible moment and i was instructed to deliver over all documents and papers of every kind relating to the survey of the island to my coadjutor meadows who would henceforth have sole charge of the survey also i was to proceed on board the ship on the following morning accompanied by the menformer members of the crewnamed in the margin for the purpose of submitting the hull spars sails and rigging to a thorough overhaul in order to ensure that the ship was fit and ready in all respects to undertake a voyage to china and to prepare an inventory of such provisions and stores as might be required for the voyage and lastly when these orders had been carried out i was to report in person to the council and receive my final instructions relative to the voyage i found that my crew was to consist of twenty men all told namely eighteen seamen one cook and a cabin steward and of the eighteen seamen gurney was to act in the capacity of chief mate and tudsbery the carpenter as second gurney being a member of the council was excused from participation in the overhauling operations polsonwho was also a member of the councilbeing sent in his stead i could not at the time quite understand the reason for this somewhat singular arrangement for i did not for an instant accept the official explanation that polson from his former association with the ship as boatswain was considered to possess a more intimate knowledge than gurney of the minutiae of the ships equipment however it was all made clear to me afterwards with these twenty men then i proceeded on board the mercury on a certain morning and proceeded to give her and all her gear a thorough overhaul although i knew it to be simply a waste of time and energy the overhaul having already been made all defective or doubtful gear replaced and the sails loosed and aired once every week since still i did not in the least object for it was all to my personal advantage that if perchance any trifling defect had been thus far overlooked it should now be made good while the rest of the hands under polson and tudsbery were going systematically to work upon the overhauling process i set the cook and steward to work to take careful stock of the contents of the lazarette with the object of ensuring that there should be a sufficiency of provisions to last us through the voyage i also had the water tanks emptied and filled up with pure spring water and while all this was being done a strong gang was put to the task of bringing down the sandalwood loading it into the ships boats and bringing it alongside when it was carefully stowed in the hold the object being to so stow it as to make the ship receive the utmost possible quantity for which she had capacity on the fourth day the overhaul of the ship was completed and on the morning of the fifth day i presented myself before the council to hand in my report and receive my full instructions the report was a very simple document merely informing the council that the final overhaul had been most carefully executed that no defects of any description had been discovered that the supply of provisions in the lazarette had been found to be sufficient for the proposed voyage and that i was ready to proceed to sea at a moments notice the report was received with a formal expression of the councils satisfaction and i was then informed that as it was anticipated that the loading of the ship would be completed on the morrow i was to make every preparation for the sailing of the ship on the day afterward when the crew would be sent on board immediately after breakfast and when i was to present myself before the council for my final instructions i left the apartment that had been dignified with the name of council chamber exceedingly well satisfied with what had transpired and especially so at the information that the crew were not to join the ship until the day of sailing for this was precisely the point upon which i had been experiencing a good deal of anxiety of late for this reason i was most anxious that the ship should go to sea with her hatches on and the longboat at least properly stowed but on the other hand i greatly feared that when matters had reached this point the crew would be ordered aboard say on the evening of the day preceding the sailing of the ship and if this should happen my plan of making off with the ship must almost inevitably fail for it would be practically impossible for gurney and myself to overpower the remaining nineteen of the crew who apart from other considerations would certainly have their suspicions aroused as soon as grace hartleys presence on board should be discovered as it soon must be i shrewdly suspected that this arrangement relative to the embarkation of the crew at the last moment prior to the sailing of the ship must be due to gurney who would of course perceive quite as clearly as myself how vital to our success such an arrangement must be and i tried to get a word with him to ascertain whether this was actually the case but i found it impossible to do so and i accordingly devoted the remainder of the day to getting my chest aboard taking possession of my cabin and carefully studying the charts with the view of deciding upon the most desirable route to be followed on the voyage to sydney late in the afternoon gurney and tudsbery also brought their chests aboard but even then i was unable to get any private word with the former because of the constant presence of the latter moreover it appeared to me that gurney was rather markedly avoiding me a circumstance that caused me a good deal of uneasiness but at the last moment just as all hands were going ashore at the close of the days work my coadventurer came and stood beside me at the gangway for an instant and without saying a word or even looking at me felt for my hand and thrust into it what seemed to be a small tightly folded piece of paper immediately afterwards passing through the gangway and down the ships side i waited until everybody else had left the deck and then carefully thrusting the paper into my breeches pocket followed arrived at length at the quarters that i occupied while ashore i drew forth from my pocket what proved to be as i had suspected from the feel of it a sheet of paper folded into a very small compass and opening it read as follows i have just learned through the merest chance that it has been arranged that the crew shall go aboard tomorrow instead of next day which means that we must act tonight please meet me therefore among the big rocks on the basin beach under the south head as soon after supper as you conveniently can and if i should not be there when you arrive kindly wait for me i have chosen that spot for our rendezvous on account of its secluded character and because nobody cares to go there after dark this was awkward news indeed for as gurney had remarked in his communication it meant that we must actthat is to say must make our escapethat same night although the hatches were off and all the boats were ashore of course the fact that the hatches were off was the merest trifle for gurney and i could soon clap them on and batten them down but i did not at all like the idea of going to sea without even so much as a single boat on board while of all the boats belonging to the ship i should most have preferred the longboat because she was a fine wholesome boat and in the event of anything untoward happening we should stand a far better chance in her than in any of the others however there was no help for it it would be better for us to escape without boats than not at all and yet when i came to think of it there was no reason why we should go to sea entirely without boats we should require one in which to make the passage from the shore to the ship and surely it ought not to be beyond the power of two menand a girlto hoist one of the quarter boats to the davits for as gurney had said a good deal of work can be done with the aid of a tackle or two and if we could hoist one quarter boat why not both ay and it might even be possible to get in the longboat as well if time and opportunity permittedbut perhaps that was almost too much good luck to expect still i had the germ of a plan in my mind and i determined to talk to gurney about it supper the last meal of the day was served at seven oclock and was over and done with before eight by which time it was quite dark save for such light as the stars afforded while this light was quite sufficient to enable one to see ones way about the island it was not powerful enough to reveal objects at any great distance the conditions were therefore quite favourable for our purpose and when i left the building in which supper had been served i sauntered off in an aimless sort of way as though going for a stroll toward the peak before turning in for the night but when i had gone about a quarter of a mile and had satisfied myself that no one was aboutfor the settlers were as a rule early birds and usually turned in almost immediately after supperi made a detour which took me by way of a slight hollow down to the inner beach along which i passed towards the rendezvous mentioned by gurney this spot was situated beneath the cliffs on the basin side of the south head where an outcrop of big basalt rocks occurred and was always of so dark and gloomy and weird a character that it was generally shunned even during the hours of daylight while at night time nobody ever went near the place if they could possibly avoid it as i drew near it i once or twice fancied that someone was following me and thinking that it might possibly be gurney i waited to let him overtake me but as nobody appeared i supposed i must have been mistaken and went on again presently arriving among the rocks the next moment two figures emerged from among the shadows and gurney and his sweetheart stood before me chapter fifteen the great adventure ah here you are gurney and miss hartley too i exclaimed that is good better indeed than i dared hope for i did not expect to see you miss hartley at least for another two or three hours no answered grace nor did i expect to be here so soon but a lucky chance enabled me to get my box out of the hut unobserved and george happening to come to my window soon afterward to make his final arrangements we seized the opportunity and came straight away at once mrs pierson with whom i have been staying believes me to be in bed with a bad headache i made my escape through the window excellent said i then i suppose we may set to work almost at once may we not gurney yes as soon as you please mr troubridge answered gurney but i think it would be wise to give everybody a chance to get home and into bed first it would be rather awkward if anybody should happen to be out late taking a walk on the head and should see us that is true it would said i which reminds me that as i came along the beach on my way here just now i once or twice had an impression of being followed i thought that possibly it might be you and waited for you to overtake me but nothing came of it it is a case of guilty conscience i expect mr troubridge laughed gurney why should anyone follow you nobody can possibly suspect us for neither grace nor inor you either i supposehave ever breathed a word of this to a single soul not even to each other when there has been the slightest chance of our being overheard no of course not it was my fancy perhaps i answered i must plead guilty to having felt a trifle anxious and nervous during the last few days but that is all gone and past now the first thing that i want to talk to you about gurney is the boats i dont much like the idea of going to sea without boats and especially the longboat now so far as the quarter boats are concerned i believe we might manage to get them both hoisted up to the davits by hooking the watchtackle on to the falls but what about the longboat do you think there is any possibility of our being able to hoist her in we might certainlyif we only had the time answered gurney but it would have to be done before we passed out through the reef in smooth waterif as i say we had the timei dare say it could be done but not outside with the ship rolling and tumbling about the boat would be stove long before we could get her inboard undoubtedly i agreed but i have a plan which i think will afford us the time to hoist in the longboat as well as the two quarter boats before we go outside when once we are safely out of the basin what have we to fear nothing except being overtaken and the ship recaptured by a strong body of men sent after us in boats but if they have no boats they cannot follow us now my plan is this i propose that as soon as it seems safe to do so we proceed to the spot where all the boats are moored man the jollyboat and tow all the rest off to the ship veering them astern by their painters when we get aboard then we will loose and set the fore and main topsail and fore topmast staysail slip the cable and work the ship out between the heads into the lagoon once there we are safe we can heaveto and hoist the two quarter boats to the davits then put on the hatches and hoist in the longboat with no fear that anyone can possibly interfere with us then when we have completed our work to our satisfaction we can cast the remaining boats adriftthey will be certain to drive ashore undamaged and be recoveredand we can go out through the reef in broad daylight by jove mr troubridge you have hit it exclaimed gurney with enthusiasm if we can manage to secure the whole of the boats and get the ship out of the basin undetected we may defy all hands of them yes i see no possibility of a hitch in that plan but we shall not be safe until we are outside the basin and now what do you think mr troubridge will it be safe to make a beginning at once or shall we give them a little longer to get indoors and to sleep every minute is of the utmost value to us said i still it would be a pity to spoil all by being too precipitate let us wait another hour at the expiration of which i think we may safely make a move accordingly we all three sat down in the deepest shadow of the rocks chatting in low tones and discussing the prospects of the voyage the chances of success in the somewhat desperate attempt that we were about to make and kindred matters until my watch showed that we were within an hour of midnight when i thought it would be unwise to delay any longer and accordingly gave the word to make a move whereupon gurney hoisted his sweethearts box on his shoulders and we all three moved cautiously and in dead silence along the beach toward where the boats were moored keeping close in among the shadows cast by the cliffs and the overhanging foliage the boats with the exception of the jollyboat were all moored in a string at a distance of about a hundred yards from the beach the longboat riding to a small boat anchor while the others were secured to her by their painters the jollyboat being hauled up on the sand this was the boat that we intended to use to go off to the ship in towing the other boats astern and when we got alongside her gurney swung grace hartleys box off his shoulder intending to deposit it in the sternsheets of the boat prior to launching her as he leaned over the gunwale to do so however he started back with a smothered ejaculation for at the same instant a human figure rose up out of the bottom of the boat where it had been crouching to drop the box on the sand was with gurney the work of a second and the next instant he had the man by the throat and was bearing him back into the bottom of the boat again while grace hartley seized my arm and gripped it like a vice to prevent herself from screaming not a sound for your life grace i hissed in her ear as i shook myself free from her grip then springing to gurneys side i exclaimed in a low tense whisper steady gurney steady man dont kill the fellow and dont make a noise who is he let him get up and tell us who he is and what he is doing here do you hear what mr troubridge says growled gurney in his prisoners ear get up and give an account of yourself but if you attempt to raise your voice ill choke the life out of you without more ado now then let us have a look at you why ill be shot if it isnt saunders saunders it may be explained was one of the original crew of the mercury and a very quiet steady wellconducted fellow it was probably for that reason that he had not been chosen to go in the ship on her projected voyage to china i approached the man and stared in his face sure enough it was indeed saunders and a very scared as well as somewhat angry appearance he presented why saunders i exclaimed in lowpitched accents of surprise what are you doing here in the boat at this time of night come explain yourself i will mr troubridge in half a jiffy as soon as ive got the feel of gurneys grip out of my throat answered the man its like this sir ive been on this here island long enough to see that wildes ideas wont work i can see that accordin to his plan i may stay here all my life and be no better off than i am today cause whythe harder i and others like me works the better it is for a lot of lazy shirkin swabs whove made up their minds that theyll never do a hands turn if they can help it and i dont see no fun in workin for skowbanks like that ive had about enough of it and i wants to get away from this here place to somewheres where a man can get the full value of his labour so ive kep my eye on you all day today mr troubridge on the lookout for a chance to ast you to let me stow myself away aboard the mercury until she gets well out to sea intendin you understand sir to cut and run at the first port that we touches at but i couldnt get the chance to speak to you without bein seen by them as i didnt want to see me so i follered you tonight when you started out for a walkas i thoughtintendin to range up alongside of you when we was well clear of the settlement and afore i could arrange my thoughts shipshape sos to make clear what i wanted youd jined george here and the young lady and i couldnt help hearin pretty near all that was said now sir i understands that you and gurney feels pretty much as i do about wilde and his notions and intends to give the lot of em the slip by makin off all alone by yourselves in the ship tonight aint that it sir well supposing that we had any such plan what have you to say about it i returned only this sir answered saunders that i begs you most earnestly to let me come in with you its a stiff job mr troubridge for two peoplefor the young lady wont count nothin to speak ofto work a ship the size of the mercury and youd find me most uncommon useful i assure ye sir im an ab and knows my business as well as eer a man yes i agreed that is perfectly true saunders for i have noticed you more often than perhaps you think but have you considered the tremendous amount of hard work that would fall to your share in such an adventure as you speak of and hard work is not the only thing that has to be considered a voyage of the kind that you are talking about is certain to involve a considerable element of danger are you i dont care that for danger or hardship interrupted saunders snapping his fingers emphatically only say that i may jine in the picnic and you shant have no cause to regret it sir what say you gurney i asked you have a right to a voice in this matter and you probably know saunders a good deal better than i do i say let him come by all means mr troubridge answered gurney he is a good man and will be worth his weight in gold to us so i think agreed i but turning to saunders are you prepared to start with us now this instant for i cannot consent to incur the risk and delay that would be involved in a return to the settlement theres no call for me to go back sir answered the man eagerly ive nobody to say goodbye to and as to dunnage why i dare say i can make out pretty well durin the vyage by helpin myself from the chests i shall find in the focsle very well then said i you may come saunders and welcome now miss hartley step in please and sit down while gurney and i shove off in with that box though gurney we must not leave that behind go aft saunders and help with an oar but remember everything must be done in absolute silence the boat which was already afloat for three parts of her length was easily launched and in another minute i was seated in the sternsheets beside grace hartley while gurney and saunders were gently and silently paddling toward the spot where the rest of the boats were moored we ranged quietly up alongside the longboat and i got hold of her painter and hauled up the anchor which i placed in the bottom of the jollyboat whereupon the two men at the oars once more gave way gently and we were soon slowly heading for the ship with the whole string of boats in tow it took us a full halfhour to accomplish the distance between the ship and the spot where the boats had been moored and during the whole of that time gurney and saunders kept their eyes intently fixed upon the settlement while i steered but the place remained wrapped in darkness and nothing occurred to occasion us the least alarm during our stealthy passage across the basin we discussed in low tones the important question of the boats and it was ultimately settled that we would take two of the four gigs and at least make an effort to hoist in the longboat the other two gigs and the jollyboat to be cast adrift and allowed to drive ashore as soon as we were ready to pass out through the reef accordingly as soon as we had arrived alongside the ship and grace hartley and her box had been safely passed up the side all the boats were veered astern the longboat and the best two of the gigs each by her own painter while the other two gigs and the jollyboat were secured together in a string one astern of the other so that by casting off one painter all three of the boats would be released at the same instant while being lashed together they would all go ashore at the same spot by the time these arrangements were carried out the hour of midnight had arrived the moonor what there was left of herwas not due to rise until an hour and twenty minutes later but by the time that we had got the two gigs hooked on and the tackles hauled handtautwhich was as much as we intended to do with them before getting clear of the basin we had come to the conclusion that the stars afforded us light enough to see by and we therefore determined to proceed at once with the task of setting the canvas i was more anxious over this part of our job than any other for it was no light task for four peopleone of whom was a slender slip of a girlto sheet home and hoist the fore and main topsails of an eighthundredton ship it would be rather a lengthy business and somewhat noisy at that for on a quiet night the rasping of the chain sheets through the sheeveholes might be heard at a considerable distance far enough indeed to attract the attention of any sleepless individual in the settlement moreover the inside of the basin was a particularly quiet spot being under the lee of the heads and thus sheltered to a considerable extent from the sweep of the wind true the reef lay to windward and the ceaseless roar of the surf upon it filled the air with such a volume of sound during the night that other sounds might well be drowned in it but if perchance any suspicious sounds from the direction of the ship were to reach the settlement and the alarm be given it might still be very awkward for us although we had all the boats for the settlers had plenty of firearms and ammunition obtained from the cargo and if they were to muster on the heads in time to fire upon us as we passed out of the basin one or more of us might be hit and disabled if not killed which would greatly jeopardise the success of our attempted flight still the risk had to be taken and all that we could do was to minimise it as much as possible by taking every precaution accordingly the buntlines clewlines and leechlines were cast off and very carefully overhauled and the watchtackle hitched to the halyards before any of us went up on the yards then the gaskets were cast off and the main topsail sheeted home to us with our every sense wrought to its highest pitch by anxiety the noise was absolutely appalling and seemed as though it might easily be heard at the most distant extremity of the island but the die was cast we had taken our fate in our hands and there was nothing for it now but to go on and get this part of the business over as quickly as possible therefore as soon as the sheets seemed to be home we belayed them and sprang to the watchtackle with the assistance of this handy little piece of gear we got the heavy yard mastheaded without much difficulty although the process was a somewhat lengthy one in consequence of the necessity to frequently fleet the tackle racking the halyards meanwhile to keep what we had gained however we completed the job at length and then the same process had to be gone through with the fore topsail and it was while we were dragging away at the halyard of this sail that grace hartley upon whom we had not as yet found it necessary to call for help came running forward to tell us that lights were beginning to flash out here and there in the settlement it was true for when we paused from our labours for a moment to verify the statement i counted four separate points of light and while we still stood looking another and another leapt out of the darkness the alarm is given and the men are being roused i exclaimed well it cannot be helped and anyhow they are too late for before they can even discover that we have the boats we shall be under way tail on again my hearties and let us get this yard mastheaded then our heavy work will be done for the present grace you will find a lantern in the stewards pantry light it please and bring it forard but take care that the gleam is not seen from the shore well there with the halyards belay i think we have all that we can get of it saunders slip out and cast loose the fore topmast staysail gurney lend me a hand to brace round the foreyard little or no attempt was now made at concealment we hoisted the fore topmast staysail and light as was the breeze inside the basin the rustling of that important piece of canvas drummed in our ears with a sound like thunder but i had sense enough to know that it was exceedingly doubtful whether or not it could be heard at the settlement the most noisy part of our work was yet to come however and to it we now bent our energies this was the slipping of the cable we soon had the shackle out and the released portion of the cable at once rushed through the hawsepipe with a roar that must certainly be heard at the settlement then i dashed aft to the wheel and flung it hard over to help the ship to cant which she did with as it seemed to me most exasperating sluggishness but she paid off at last when we hauled aft the staysail sheet braced up the yards and the mercury began very deliberately to forge ahead and our great adventure was at length fairly begun then while the ship ratched across the basin prior to tacking to pass out between the two heads gurney and saunders both of whom were exceptionally powerful men went to work to hoist the two gigs up to the davits by the time that they had got the first boat up and the second one out of the water we were far enough to windward to render it necessary to tack in order to avoid putting the old barkie ashore on the northern beach i was just a little doubtful whether the ship would work under such short canvas but we had now drawn out from under the lee of the south head and were feeling something of the true breeze the water was smooth and the ship had very nearly four knots way on her i therefore determined to try it and giving the word ready about to the others put the helm very gently down my aim being to sail her round if possible with as little drag as might be from the rudder she luffed into the wind quite as freely as could reasonably be expected and the moment that i heard the head sails begin to flap i jammed the helm hard down and lashed it there leaving the ship to herself while i sprang to help the others to swing the mainyard by the time that we had got this and the main topsail yard round the ship was fairly paying off on the other tack when i sang out to grace to cast off the lashing and steady the helm then letting go the fore braces we dragged round the head yards and got them also braced up whereupon i ran aft to the wheel again leaving gurney and saunders to trim over the fore topmast staysail sheet upon reaching the wheel i found grace hartley already perched alongside it and the ship well to windward of the passage between the heads she had fallen off a good bit owing to the sluggishness with which the head yards had been swung but she was already coming to and a few seconds later her jibboom was pointing straight for the middle of the passage with the heads looming up on either hand black as ebony against the faint shimmer of starlight on the waters of the lagoon beyond gurney and saunders now came aft and proceeded to complete the hoisting of the second quarter boat and seeing that grace seemed to know pretty well what she was about with the wheel i left her at it directing her to steer the ship as nearly as might be midway between the two heads and went to lend the others a hand with the boat we had both davittackles two blocks by the time that the ship was fairly clear of the heads and in the lagoon after which we put the hatches on and battened them down then came the formidable job of endeavouring to hoist in the longboatand a formidable job it was when we actually came to seriously consider it nevertheless we determined to make the attempt time was the only thing needed to assure us success and it was just in regard to this that we had our doubts for it must be remembered that although we had got the ship out of the basin she was not yet in open water on the contrary she was now moving athwart the placid waters of the lagoon heading about sousou east this lagoon i think i have somewhere said was roughly crescentshaped in plan measuring about ten miles long by about two and a half miles wide at its broadest part the northern end being a trifle the more weatherly of the two now our plan was this a ship when hoveto drifts along on a course as nearly as possible at right angles to the direction of the wind which in this case was blowing due east we therefore proposed to work the mercury up toward the northern end of the lagoon until when brought round and hoveto she should have room to drive slowly to the southward without going ashore on the fringing reef which projected into the lagoon an average distance of a mile from the island then while she was thus drawing to the southwardthe available distance being about seven miles or maybe a trifle morewe were to make the attempt to hoist in the longboat by means of yard tackles and stow her on the main hatch the hatches were already on and battened down to get the chocks into place to receive the boat was but the work of a few minutes and then came the business of rousing out the yard tackles and getting them aloft i knew where to lay my hand upon them and soon had them ready for sending aloft but by the time that we had got thus far the ship had drawn well over toward the southern end of the barrier reef and it was time to heave about we therefore tacked ship again the old hooker working in much more lively fashion this time because we were now within the influence of the true breeze then with grace hartley still at the wheel gurney and saunders went aloft and got the tackles up on the fore and main yards also the stay purchases and we were then ready to begin the actual work itself the boat was next hauled alongside the starboard gangway in readiness to be hooked on when the ship being by this time as far to the northward as it was prudent to go we tacked and hoveto on the port tack chapter sixteen the cataclysm no sooner was the ship round and hoveto with her fore topsail aback than gurney and saunders slid down into the longboat and hooked on the tackles which i stood by on deck to haul taut then by means of a snatchblock the watchtackle and the winch we proceeded to lift first the bows and then the stern out of the water a foot or so at a time it was slow tedious work but we were greatly assisted by the light of the moon which was by this time well above the horizon and by working as though for our lives we at length managed to get the boat well above the level of the bulwarks to transfer her weight from the yards to the stay tackles and to swing her inboard a few minutes before it became imperatively necessary for us to wear round in order to avoid going ashore upon the barrier reef by this time too we were able to see a great crowd of people gathered upon the south head watching us and once or twice we even thought we caught the sound of hailing but their attempts to communicate with us ended with that a fear which i had entertained that a number of them might attempt to swim out and scramble aboard while we were all busy with the longboat proving groundless we contrived to get the ship round with her head to the northward again just in time to avoid nicely hitting the reef and then upon the principle that it is useless to make two bites at a cherry we determined to complete our task fully before going outside we therefore got the yard and stay tackles down and stowed away and the longboat properly secured in gripes before attempting to pass out through the reef this kept us busy for nearly another hour at the end of which we tacked for the last time in the lagoon and bore away for the passage through the reef which we successfully negotiated just as the suns upper rim flashed above the horizon the jollyboat and the two gigs that we intended to leave behind having been cast adrift a quarter of an hour earlier we were all by this time beginning to feel the need of both food and rest we therefore decided to treat ourselves to a good substantial breakfast to start with after which the weather being fine and the glass high three out of the four of us might safely venture to snatch a few hours sleep accordingly i went aft to relieve grace hartley at the wheel while she retired to the cabin which had been allotted to her and made a hasty toilet prior to an incursion into the stewards pantry with the view of arranging for breakfast but saunders was beforehand with her for while she was refreshing herself he entered the pantry and gave it an overhaul finding a smoked ham a barrel of cabin bread coffee cocoa sugar and a number of other articles already stowed there by the steward who was to have accompanied the ship on her projected voyage to china the ham he promptly cut carrying several slices together with the coffee forward to the galley where gurney was already busy starting a fire after which he returned to the cabin and produced a tablecloth knives and forks cups and saucers plates and dishes and set the table thus by the time that grace was ready she found all her intentions anticipated when breakfast was ready saunders came and relieved me at the wheel while i in company with gurney and his sweetheart sat down to breakfast at which meal it was arranged that i should take the first watch steering the ship and keeping a lookout until seven bells in the forenoon when gurney was to be called to relieve me while i took the sun saunderss duty being to prepare a makeshift dinner the next watch until eight bells in the afternoon was to be gurneys when saunders would come on duty for the first dogwatch while grace hartley was to be allowed to prepare the teaor supper as it was then the fashion to call the last meal of the day in fact we made out a regular watchbill setting forth the sequence of the watches the names of those who were to keep them and the additional duties which each person was to perform grace hartley being of course let off very lightly her share of the work being principally confined to easy domestic duties as soon as i had finished breakfast i went on deck and relieved saunders who went forward to the galley to secure the food that was there being kept hot for him taking it aft and consuming it in the cabin i had already determined upon the route that i would take and was glad to find that while i had been below the wind had veered just sufficiently to allow the ship to lay her course closehauled half an hours further experience revealed the fact that the ship was so nearly steering herself that a very slight adjustment of the helm would enable her to do so entirely and this adjustment i was able to make with sufficient accuracy within the next twenty minutes to permit of my lashing the wheel and giving my attention to other matters i therefore got out the chart and spread it open on the cabin table went on deck again to take the bearings and distance of the islandthe latitude and longitude of which i had long ago ascertained and marked upon the chartand then laid down the ships position then finding that the ship still continued to behave satisfactorily under her lashed helm i got the telescope and went up into the main topmast crosstrees to take a last look at the island by that time about ten miles distant it still lay broad on the horizon astern and so clear was the atmosphere that i was able to distinguish the boats which we had cast adrift still about a mile from the shore i next swept the entire horizon with the telescope in search of other land or a sail but not a hint of the presence of either could i detect in any direction i was especially anxious to fall in with a ship as soon as possible it being my intention to borrow a few more men if i could for our experiences of the past night had already demonstrated to us that while it was certainly possible for us four to handle the ship in fine weather it meant heavy work while in bad weather it might easily prove impossible the one thing of paramount importance to us while we were so shorthanded was plenty of sea room and this i was determined to keep ay although to do so should add another thousand miles to the length of the voyage having taken a thoroughly exhaustive look round i descended to the deck and busied myself about a number of odd jobs that needed attention such as hauling taut and coiling up as much of the running gear as had been cast off the pins during the night in this way i contrived to pass a fairly busy morning until seven bells when i called saunders to turn out and start work in the galley afterward taking my sextant on deck to catch the meridian altitude of the sun then immediately after dinner i retired to my cabin and throwing off the clothing that i had now worn for more than thirty hours stretched myself upon my bunk and slept like a log until grace hartleywho had left the cabin an hour or so beforeknocked at my door to tell me that it was four bells and supper was ready by this time we had all had at least six hours sleep and felt able to face the coming night with equanimity the more so for the reason that the weather promised to continue fine the ship was still under her two topsails and fore topmast staysail under which she was doing very well her average rate of sailing throughout the day having been as nearly as possible four and a half knots there was a nice topgallant breeze blowing and we all felt that we should like to have availed ourselves of it to the fullest possible extent but making sail and taking it in were two very different thingswe could make sail at our leisure but we should probably be in a hurry when the shortening process became necessary moreover to swing the topsail and lower yards with the strength at our command was quite as much as we could well manage after talking the matter over together therefore we ultimately decided to let everything stand just as it was until we could see a little more clearly what was before us in this manner then the first two days passed the ship jogging along to the southward at the rate of about one hundred to a hundred and twenty miles in the twentyfour hours the weather continuing fine and on the whole settled enabling us all to get an ample sufficiency of rest while attending to the duties which each day brought with it on the third night dating from the beginning of our adventure it fell to me to take the middle watch and when i went on deck at midnight i still found the weather everything that could be desired except that the wind was perceptibly lighter than it had been when i turned in some four hours earlier this change saunders informed me had been in progress during almost the whole of his watch but i did not thinknor did hethat it portended any very important alteration in the weather for the sky was perfectly clear and the stars shone brilliantly the utmost that i anticipated was a possible shift of wind which however would be no great matter since it was just as likely to be in our favour as against us we stood for a few minutes discussing probabilities and then saunders bade me good night and went below for nearly two hours i stood at the wheel holding the ship to her course with everincreasing difficulty for the wind still continued to drop until we scarcely had steerageway then with a final sigh the breeze died away altogether the topsails hung limp and dewsaturated from the yards the fore topmast staysail sheet drooped amidships and the mercury swung broadsideon to the scarcely perceptible swell abandoning the now useless wheel i walked forward to the skylightin which the cabin lamp turned low burned dimlyand had a look at the barometer it was about a tenth lower than when i had last looked at it two hours earlier and that might possibly mean an impending change of weather but if so the heavens showed no sign of it thus far for the sky was still clear as crystal the stars beamed down with undiminished radiance out of the immeasurable depths of the blueblack vault overhead and the swell was perceptibly flattening then i looked at the clock which as is usual at sea was set every day by the sun it wanted five minutes to two i therefore had still two hours of my watch to stand and to stave off a certain feeling of drowsiness that was insidiously taking possession of me i went down on to the main deck and proceeded to pace to and fro in the waist satisfied that i might walk there as long as i pleased without disturbing the rest of my companions each of whom occupied a cabin under the poop as i thoughtfully walked fore and aft between the main and fore rigging instinctively treading lightly in sympathy with the profound silence of the night my imagination carried me back to the island and i was endeavouring to picture to myself wildes rage and disgust upon making the discovery that the ship had prematurely gone to sea taking with her the girl that he had fully determined to marry when a low sound like the muttering of fardistant thunder awoke me out of my reverie i sprang up on the poop and flung a hasty glance around the horizon to see if i could anywhere catch the glimmer of distant lightning thinking that possibly a squall might be brewing far away to the northward i did indeed distinctly see what appeared to be the reflection in the sky of certain ruddy flashes but they hardly looked to me like lightning or at all events like the kind of lightning which i had been accustomed to see meanwhile the low muttering sound had not died away as thunder does on the contrary it was not only continuous but was steadily growing in volume with amazing rapidity proceeding apparently from the direction of those curious ruddy flashes which were also growing stronger even as i stood staring and wondering what the phenomenon might mean as the sound steadily increased so did its resemblance to thunderor the rapid firing of heavy gunsbecome more pronounced a distinct booming like that of frequent heavy explosions making itself heard in the midst of the continuous rumblewhich seemed to me to be drawing nearer with frightful rapidity then as i still gazed in perplexity toward the spot from which this mysterious and terrifying sound seemed to emanate i caught the gleam of white water on the northern horizon and no longer doubting that a heavy squallof a character quite unknown to me and perhaps peculiar to those waterswas about to burst upon us i dashed down the poop ladder and into the cabin uttered one yell of all hands on deck and then dashed out again on to the main deck springing first to the main topsail halyards and letting them run and then doing the same by the fore by the time that i had cast off the fore topsail halyards gurney and saunders alarmed by my cry were out on deck while in the doorway of the cabin stood grace hartley with a wrap of some sort thrown over her shoulders what is it mr troubridgewhat in the name of all that is terrible is happening demanded gurney gazing about him in amazement man the reef tackles for your lives i shouted dont you hear the squall thundering down upon us if we are not lively it will whip the masts out of herindeed i am not sure but it will in any case here we are lay hold and draggrace go back to your cabinthis is no place for you gurney sprang to one of the reef tackles while saunders and i dragged at the other yelling our yo hos as we did so meanwhile the awful booming and crashing sounds seemed to be sweeping down toward us on the wings of the squall and so heavy had they by this time become that we could actually feel the ship trembling with the reverberation of them the next second that frightful combination of rumbling and crashing sounds was all about us mingled now with the hoarse roar of heavily breaking water the ship suddenly began to pitch and roll with a violence which deprived us of all power to do anything more than just cling for our lives to the nearest object that we could lay hold of the sea all about us suddenly broke into a mad turmoil of raging waters white with the glare of phosphorescence leaping foaming and swirling hither and thither with appalling violence huge masses of water flung themselves high in the air and crashed in over our bulwarks forward aft and amidships all at the same moment deluging our decks and threatening to sweep us overboard and in the midst of it all we felt a succession of violent shocks as though the ship were being swept over a reef by a violent tide race but there was no wind not a breath save such slight baffling draughts as were probably created by the violent motion of the sea around us those grating hammering shocks lasted perhaps half a minute then they suddenly ceased the deep rumbling crashing sound swept past us away down to the southward and gradually died away the roar of broken water changed its note and became the seething hiss of an innumerable multitude of streams rushing over a rocky bed and cascading from one level to the other and the ship once more floated motionless or nearly so and throughout the whole of this soulshaking experience the stars beamed calmly down upon us with undimmed splendour for a few seconds we three men stood staring at each other in awestruck silence then gurney spoke with a curious little quaver in his voice that was no squall mr troubridge said he it was a submarine earthquake and of extraordinary violence too i should not be in the least surprised if you find that its effects have been powerful and widespread enough to make your chart of these seas absolutely useless to you for instance we are supposed to be a long way off soundings here are we not yet what are we to make of those shocks that we felt just now were they merely the result of the earth tremor communicated to the water and through it to the hull of the ship or were we actually swept violently over the surface of a shoal i should like just for curiositys sake to take a cast of the he paused suddenly while speaking his eyes had been fixed intently upon something that he seemed to see over my shoulder away out on the port side of the ship and now without attempting to finish his sentence he abruptly walked to the rail and stood staring out over it what is the matter gurney what do you think you see i demanded going to his side and somehow thrilled by the queerness of his manner come up on the poop he said we shall see better from there he led the way and i followed and as i drew to his side he slowly stretched forth his arm in a pointing attitude and sweeping his hand slowly right round the horizon said in a low impressive voice that was almost a whisper the single word look then for the first time i saw the explanation of his strangeness of manner while he had been voicing his anticipations as to the possible effects of the earthquake i had been looking at him meanwhile merely catching a suggestion out of the corner of my eye as it were of the fact that the disturbance of the oceans surface around us was very rapidly subsiding but without grasping the significance of it all for i was listening to what he was saying and turning it over in my mind but now as we stood together on the poop and gazed out in every direction round about us i saw to my unspeakable awe and consternation that what a quarter of an hour earlier had been to the best of my knowledge and belief an unfathomable ocean was now to a very large extent dry land that is to say the ship appeared to be floatingor was she agroundin a kind of pond or small lake of perhaps eight or ten acres in extent surrounded on every side by land of some sort off the rugged surface of which the salt water was still pouring in a multitude of little streams and cataracts how far this land extended it was at that moment quite impossible to say but so far as could be seen in the dim uncertain light of the stars it appeared to extend nearly or quite to the horizon and the whole of it had been hove up from the ocean depths in the space of a few seconds true this part of the great pacific ocean was thickly dotted with reefs and shoals the positions of many of which had never been accurately determined while it was known that there were many others with a sufficient depth of water upon them to allow a ship to pass safely over them in any weather this might possibly be one of them but even so the fact remained that a low island of quite respectable extent had suddenly been created well gurney i exclaimed looking round in evergrowing amazement this is something quite new in the way of shipwrecks something indeed that if recorded in the newspapers would be denounced by the clever ones who know everything as an outrageous falsehood an audacious attempt to impose upon peoples credulity very possibly agreed gurney i have run up against a good many people in my time who seem to make a point of disbelieving everything that has not come within the scope of their own actual experience yet there is nothing so very wonderful in this business after all new land is frequently being discovered where deep water is known to have previously existed and this is a case in point that is all and as to calling our present plight a shipwreckwell i think it is rather anticipating matters to do that if we had chanced to be caught floating immediately over any of that portion that has been hove out of water and the ship left high and dry we might be justified in calling ourselves shipwrecked but here we are still afloat and who is to say that a way may not be found out of this dock into the open ocean yes i agreed there is certainly something in what you say but are we really afloat the ship seems too absolutely motionless for that let us get the leadline and take a cast ay ay mr troubridge thats the proper thing to do exclaimed saunders who meanwhile had joined us ill get the lead and take a few casts all round her and he hurried off to put his resolve into execution as he descended to the main deck by way of the starboard poop ladder grace hartley fully clad ascended to the poop by way of the other and approaching us exclaimed oh georgeoh mr troubridge whatever dreadful thing has happened and what does this unnatural stillness of the ship mean it means gracie dear answered gurney that there has been a violent submarine earthquake which has replaced most of the water that was round about us half an hour ago with dry land as you may see by looking about you and the unnatural stillness of the ship as you call it is due to the fact that we are now afloatat least i hope so in a small lake instead of upon the open ocean that is the sum and substance of what has happened and to that statement i may add that the earthquake has passed and there is now no further danger there is therefore no reason why you should not be in bed miss hartley and there i very strongly advise you to go forthwith thank you mr george gurney both for your information and your advice answered grace with a little quavering laugh that testified to the extent of the alarm from which the poor girl had been suffering as to the latter however she continued i shall not follow it for the simple reason that it would be quite impossible for me to sleep notwithstanding your reassuring statement that all danger has now passed therefore as i imagine that you men will not attempt to turn in again tonight i shall go to the galley light the fire and make you each a cup of good strong coffee for which i believe you will all be the better so saying she tripped away on to the main deck and forward to the galley from the dark recesses of which we presently saw a cheerful light gleaming and within half an hour our ministering angel had placed within the hands of each of us a cup of steaming hot coffee and a buttered biscuit meanwhile saunders having procured the leadline and a lantern proceeded to sound systematically all round the ship with the result that in due time he rejoined us on the poop reporting as follows theres a bed of soft mud under our bows mr troubridge on which weve grounded to about as far aft as the fore riggin beyond that i reckon the ships afloat for at that pint theres eighteen foot of water gradually deepenin to twentytwo foot under the starnpost i dont reckon that were so very hard and fast on the mud howsever for theres a good seventeen foot o water under the bows and i noticed when wed finished loadin her tother day that she only drawed seventeen foot six forard chapter seventeen the reef that is good news i remarked when saunders had completed his report for shorthanded though we are i think it may be possible for us to get the ship afloat again then if as you gurney have suggested there happens to be a channel carrying depth enough to float us we may yet hope to find our way into open water once more let us pray however that the channelif such existsdoes not trend to windward unless of course it happens to be wide enough to work the ship in and now i think our first job must be to clew up and furl our canvas otherwise when the breeze comesas come it may at any momentwe shall drive ashore in grim earnest and perhaps never get afloat again my two companions fully agreed with me and accordingly the halyards having already been let go and the yards lowered to the caps we let go the sheets and manned the clewlines and buntlines first of the main and then of the fore topsail then we let go the fore topmast staysail halyards and hauled down the sail finally laying out and securing it before going aloft to furl the topsails which we tackled one at a time the next thing to be thought about was how to provide for the safety of the ship when the breeze should come again as come it soon must as the ship then lay she was heading almost exactly due east and if the wind should happen to come away out from that quarterwhich seemed to be its prevailing direction thereabouti thought it not improbable that we might blow off the mudbank and go ashore again on the lee side of the lake quite possibly in a very much worse position than that which we then occupied gurney and saunders were quite of my opinion and after talking the matter over for a while we decided to get the stream anchor over the bows in place of the one left behind at the island bend a hawser to it and have it all ready to let go at any moment this we did without any difficulty the anchor in question being of a weight not too great for the three of us to handle by the time that this job was ended the first signs of the coming dawn began to show themselves away to the eastward and with one consent gurney saunders and i sprang into the main rigging and made our way aloft to the crosstrees with the purpose of taking a good look round at our surroundings in those low latitudes the day comes quickly and we had not occupied our lofty perch many minutes when up leapt the sun flashing his golden beams over the dark expanse spread out around us and we saw to our dismay that we occupied a small basinone of many suchsituated almost in the exact centre of a vast reef stretching over a distance which we roughly estimated at thirty miles from north to south and perhaps twenty miles from east to west the salt water that had been hove up with the reef had by this time all run off leaving the dark weedcovered rock fully exposed to view here and there of course owing to the exceeding roughness and irregularity of the surface were scattered numerous pools some small and others of considerable extent which must obviously soon evaporate and disappear under the influence of the suns beams and the disagreeable possibility suggested itself to us all that the pool in which the mercury floated might share the same fate but we hoped not for there were at least three channels wide enough to permit the passage of the ship leading out of our basin stretching away across the reef and joining other channels until the labyrinth became too intricate for the eye to follow and we trusted that one or more of these might lead to the open ocean while we still remained aloft discussing our situation and the best means of extricating ourselves from it a light air from the eastward arose redolent of the mingled odours of mud and seaweed and as a wind from this direction if it would but come strong enough might greatly assist our efforts to get the ship off the mudbank upon which she was partially grounded we decided that we would at once try the effect of setting the main topsail and throwing it aback so while gurney and saunders proceeded with this work i looked about me for a suitable berth in which to moor the ship in the event of our efforts to refloat her being crowned with success at the height of the main topmast crosstrees it was easy for me to discern pretty clearly the character of the bottom of the basin in which we lay and as the light increased i discovered that the mudbank which held the ship was only of very small extent the remaining portion of the bottom being sandy apparently of almost uniform depth below the surface of the water and affording excellent holding ground there was one place however some two hundred fathoms to the southward of the spot where the ship then lay which seemed to be a trifle deeper than elsewhere and i at once determined that if we could by any means clear ourselves of the mud i would anchor there by the time that i had thus decided the other two had cast off the gaskets from the main topsail i therefore slid down on deck by way of the topgallant backstay and cast off the clewlines and buntlines that saunders might overhaul them prior to coming down from aloft and then manned the sheets which of course came home easily enough except for the last few inches upon which i required the help of gurney and saunders then having squared the main and topsail yard we got the halyard to the winch with the aid of a snatchblock and hoisted the sail flat aback gurney then went forward and loosed the fore topmast staysail ready for setting in case of need while saunders got the hand lead and dropped it over the side in order that we might be able at once to detect any movement on the part of the ship the wind meanwhile had freshened perceptibly and was now blowing a ten knot breeze the effect of which soon became perceptible for the lead line had not been overboard five minutes when saunders cried out that the ship was moving at the same moment i distinctly felt a slight tremor in the hull followed by a barely perceptible jerk then another another and another and she was once more afloat and driving astern i at once sprang to the wheel and put it hard astarboard at the same time shouting to gurney and saunders to hoist the fore topmost staysail then leaving the wheel to take care of itself i sprang to the main braces throwing the port main and topsail braces off their pins and rounding in on the starboard as well as i could unaided the ship had now paid off on the port tack and as soon as the starboard fore topmast staysail sheet was hauled aft she began to forge ahead whereupon i rushed back to the wheel steadied it and called to gurney to stand by to let go the stream anchor and to saunders to take a cast of the lead the first cast gave us a bare four fathoms the next a trifle over four fathoms the next four and a half fathoms and the next five fathoms whereupon i gave the word to let go the anchor and haul down the staysail at the same time abandoning the wheel and springing to the main topsail halyard which i let run by the time that we had once more furled our canvas breakfast was ready and we all sat down to it with excellent appetites having breakfasted gurney and i again betook ourselves aloft to the main topmast crosstrees carrying the ships telescope with us our object being to subject the reef to a thorough scrutiny in the hope that with the sun now high in the heavens and the light as good as it was likely to be we might be fortunate enough to discover a way of escape from our extraordinary prison as a matter of fact we did now get a much clearer and on the whole more satisfactory view of the reef than upon the previous occasion but although we perceived a perfect network of channelssome so narrow as scarcely to permit the passage of a boat while others were wide enough in places actually to allow a ship to work to windward in themthe inequalities in the surface of the reef were so great as to render it impossible for us to trace any of them for more than three or four miles at the utmost there were four channels wide enough to allow the passage of the ship branching out from the basin in which we lay one trending toward the northeast another running off toward the north west and then apparently by a zigzag course ultimately leading to open water on the west side of the reef a third running west out of the basin for a distance of about three miles beyond which its farther course became untraceable and a fourth broad on our starboard bow which looked the most promising of all we counted seven pools or lakelets in addition and similar to our ownthree to the northward one to the eastward two to the southward and one to the southwestward of our own but the one in which the mercury floated seemed to be the largest of them all the reef appeared to be composed wholly of rock covered for the most part with weed but with broad expanses of sand here and there interspersed with mud banks and its height above the ocean level seemed to vary from about a foot to ten or fifteen feet with occasional isolated hummocks rising perhaps as high in some cases as forty feet with the aid of the telescope we were able to perceive that considerable quantities of fish had been stranded and left to perish by the sudden upheaval and the appearance of them caused me a slight spasm of alarm on the score of our health which was only partially dissipated by the fact to which gurney directed my attention that already great flocks of sea birds had appeared and were busily devouring them we remained aloft for more than an hour studying the reef and so far as i was concerned making copious notes and a rough sketch map of it in my notebook and then descended to the deck having come to the conclusion that the only thing to be done was to make a systematic exploration of the reef and especially of the channels by means of one of the boats for this purpose we selected the larger of the two quarter boats a very handsomely modelled craft of twentysix feet long by six feet beam with a keel nearly eight inches deep in midships and rigged as a foreand aft schooner she had been the late captains fancy boat used by him for sailing ashore from open roadsteads and was fitted with air chambers forward and aft and under each of the thwarts thus being converted into a sort of unsinkable lifeboat she was therefore in every respect eminently suitable for the duty upon which we proposed to employ her i was rather afraid that upon learning our purpose grace hartley might express a desire to accompany us and this would be somewhat awkward in view of the rough work which might possibly lie before us but to my relief she expressed herself as perfectly content to remain aboard alone upon being assured that no harm could possibly happen to the ship we therefore bent the ensign on to the main signal halyards showed her how to hoist it and directed her to run it up to the main truck in the event of anything occurring to render our immediate return to the ship necessary then having hastily stowed away a few biscuits and a piece of cold salt beef in the boats stern locker and placed a small breaker of fresh water in her for ballast we lowered her to the water brought her to the gangway rigged her and got away about six bells in the forenoon watch grace waving her farewells to us from the poop we decided to begin our exploration by examining the channel which opened on the south side of the basin as that was the widest and the most promising of the four accordingly upon leaving the ship we brought the boat close to the wind on the port tackwhich just enabled her to point fair for the mouth of the channeland at once proceeded to take soundings but we had not been under way five minutes before we found that under whole canvas the boat travelled much too fast to enable us to sound with the frequency and accuracy that i considered necessary we were consequently obliged to take in the foresail altogether and sail the boat under the singlereefed mainsail and jib at least during the outward journey within ten minutes of leaving the ship we glided into the channel which it was our intention to explore and found ourselves slipping along a waterway ranging from two hundred to a thousand feet in width with an average depth of about five fathoms the sides of the channel were very rough and irregular its direction was also exceedingly erratic varying from eastsoutheast to south by west this irregularity of direction was the worst feature of the channel for with the prevailing direction of the wind at about due east there were stretches of the channel looking so close into the winds eye that the ship could never be sailed through them true some of these stretches were so short that gurney believed the mercury could be carried through them by making a half board but this would be a somewhat hazardous experiment unless the wind chanced to veer a point or two in our favour while even then there were other stretches that could only be traversed by kedging but apart from this disadvantage there was nothing to find fault with the channel being everywhere wide enough to permit the passage of the ship and the depth in it never less than twenty feet with a fine sandy bottom we traversed this channel for a distance of about nine miles during which the general trend of it might be said to be southeast and then we arrived at a point where it not only widened out but also abruptly took a southsouthwest direction to our great delight for if the ship could by any means be coaxed as far as this she could then proceed with a free wind but alas for our hopes we had not traversed more than another mile and a half before we found ourselves in a culdesac the channel coming to an abrupt end this was a very severe disappointment to us for after travelling so far and meeting with so few difficulties we were already beginning to congratulate ourselves upon having found a way of escape at the first attempt however there was no use in worrying about it the only thing to be done was to retrace our steps and try one of the other channels it must not be supposed that the channel which we had thus traversed to its extremity was unbroken on the contrary there were several other channels branching out of it to right and left at various points in its length two of which at leastone about three miles back and another five miles backhad struck us as not altogether unpromising and our idea was now to return and examine these but before starting upon our return journey gurney made a suggestion that was destined to exercise an extraordinary influence upon our future as we lay hoveto in the cul desac discussing the question of what should next be done our attention had been more than once attracted toward a large hummock of rock rising some thirty or forty feet above the general level of the reef at no great distance from the margin of the channel and gurneys proposal was that before attempting anything else we should land make our way to the hummock climb it and ascertain whether any observations of value were to be made from its summit the proposal had so much to commend it that it was agreed to forthwith laying the boat alongside the rock at a convenient spot we all three landed and set out to walk across the reef the hummock in question was only some two hundred yards from the margin of the channel we therefore soon reached it despite the difficulty of the going the surface of the reef proving to be exceedingly rough and covered for the most part with weed so terribly slippery that it was positively dangerous to attempt to walk upon it when at length we reached the summit of the rock we were not much better off for although we could see from thence a great deal more of the reef than was to be observed from the boat we made no discoveries that were likely to facilitate our escape but while we stood upon the summit of this rock staring about us our attention was arrested by the sight of a great brown patch some three or four acres in extent showing up strongly against the dull black of the otherwise weedcovered rock although it obviously had nothing to do with channels or extricating the ship from her extraordinary situation our curiosity was aroused and we determined to pay it a visit and ascertain its character before returning to the boat it lay some three hundred yards to the south of the hummock and we saw that upon returning from it to the boat we should only need to pass close to the eastward of the hummock to hit off the correct trail accordingly we descended to the surface of the reef and headed for the mysterious brown patch which we soon reached some suspicion of its true character having dawned upon us even before we arrived at the spot from the circumstance that as we approached our nostrils became cognisant of a most ancient and fishlike smell the suspicion that we had formed was confirmed upon our arrival by the discovery that the object of our curiosity was a great bed of oysters hove up and exposed to the air by the convulsion of the previous night but fond as i am of oysters i did not care to tackle any of these for apart from the fact that many of them were already dead i did not altogether like the appearance of them they were very much larger than the ordinary edible oyster and to my mind they did not look quite wholesome saunders however was far less fastidious than either gurney or me he found one or two that being immersed in a shallow pool of salt water were still alive and announced his intention of trying them accordingly producing a strong clasp knife he contrived with some difficulty to open one and no sooner had he forced the shells apart than i guessed that we had all stumbled upon a fortune in extent probably beyond the dreams of avarice for as the shells parted exposing the fish three or four small beadlike objects became revealed that i instantly recognised as pearls the oysters were undoubtedly pearl oysters and the millions of shells that lay at our feet doubtless contained gems enough to make us all rich for the remainder of our days not to be behindhand with saunders i seized one of the bivalves already dead and with the shells gaping apart and tore it open but although the shell was lined with beautiful lustrous motheropearl it was barren of gems flinging this away i tried another and a third and fourth with a like result a fifth yielded nine small pearls about the size of duck shot numbers six and seven proved barren but the eighth surrendered to my eager grasp a magnificent pearl perfectly globular quite half an inch in diameter and when cleaned of exquisite lustre and colour gurney and saunders meanwhile had been as busily engaged as myself and between them had secured three more gems not quite so large as mine and about as much seed pearl as would half fill an ordinary wineglass one of the three smaller pearls however secured by gurneyamply made up in beauty what it lacked in size for it was of a most exquisitely delicate yet rich rose colour my friends said i as soon as i was able to collect my scattered senses and speak intelligibly it is said that the darkest cloud has a silver lining and the extraordinary accident by which we have become imprisoned in the meshes of this reeflet us hope only temporarilyhas at the same time presented us with a treasure of incalculable value i think we should be almost criminally negligent if we failed to make the utmost of our marvellous good fortune and i therefore propose that before we proceed further with the exploration of the reef we take steps to secure the wealth that lies spread so lavishly at our feet let us take these oysters and spread themor at least a portion of themin rows so that the sun may get at them and speedily bring about that state of decomposition which i understand is necessary to enable the gems they contain to be secured uninjured and i further propose that whatever be the value of the wealth we may ultimately secure it be equally divided between all four of us for it would be manifestly unfair that miss hartley should not equally participate in our good as in our ill fortune what say you my companions cheerfully agreed with my proposal and this point settled we forthwith proceeded to collect the oysters indiscriminately from the enormous heap and lay them out singly upon the seaweed in long rows taking care to place each bivalve quite flat in order that as the process of decomposition proceeded the precious contents should not roll out and be lost so absorbed were we in our occupation that we did not desist until the sun hung upon the very verge of the western horizon by which time we had placed in position very nearly three thousand oysters and not until then did we find time to remember that we had eaten nothing since leaving the ship then returning to the boat we cleansed our hands in the water alongside shook out our reef set all our canvas and headed the boat back to the ship snatching a hasty meal as we went chapter eighteen the pearls the breeze freshened with the disappearance of the sun beneath the horizon and the boat under whole canvas and in the perfectly smooth water of the canallike channel fairly flew along careening almost gunwaleto with a merry buzzing of water at her sharp stem as she sheared through it with a sound like the rending of silk in about an hour and a half favoured with a free wind and a sufficiency of starlight to enable us to see our way we found ourselves once more alongside the ship tired with the fatigues of the day but excited and happy at the amazing good fortune that had befallen us for the moment we could neither think nor talk of anything but pearls the precarious situation of the ship and the consideration of what might happen to her should a gale spring up were entirely lost sight of and already saunders if not gurney and myself was anxiously considering what he should do with his wealth when he had conveyed it safely home grace hartley womanlike fairly gloated over the sight of the lovely gems that we had brought back with us and earnestly besought us that she might be allowed to accompany us on our next visit to the oysterbed in order that she might have the delight of securing a few with her own hands and after some demur we promised that she might do so on the following day by the end of which she would probably have had quite enough of it for decomposition of animal matter is speedy under a tropical sun and our experience even of a single day led us all to conclude that another twentyfour hours would reduce the stranded oysters to a condition sufficiently revolting to tax even male endurance pretty severely the following morning found us all early astir and the moment that breakfast was over the boat was brought alongside and our provisions for the day passed down into her then gurney descended and assisted his sweetheart down the side saunders following and i bringing up the rear the boats sails were set and under whole canvas we pushed off on our way to the oysterbed for the craving for wealth was upon us all and we felt that every moment spent otherwise than in gathering it was so much wasted time the breeze was still blowing fresh and although for the greater part of the distance the boat was jammed close upon a wind we made excellent time between the ship and our point of destination arriving there after a pleasant sail of less than two hours but long before we arrived i began to wish that i had thought of putting a gun into the boat for while we were still a good two miles from the oysterbed we saw the birds hovering over it in thousands and i strongly suspected that upon arrival we should find that those same birds had played havoc with our previous days work and so we did for when we reached the spot we found our neatly arranged rows of oysters turned topsyturvy by the birds in their endeavours to get at the fish while the odour that emanated from the millions of dead bivalves was already powerful enough to upset any but a strong stomach although the birds had completely disarranged our labours of the preceding day they did not appear to have otherwise done any very serious damage it is true that every single oyster that we had laid out so carefully had been attacked dragged out of place and the fish extracted but nearly a hundred pearls of value were found between the otherwise empty shells while a careful examination of the ground revealed fully as many more together with as much seed pearl as would rather more than fill a halfpint measure grace hartley accompanied us from the boat to the oysterbed and remained long enough to actually find for herself two very fine pearls but that sufficed she confessed that the effluvium was altogether too powerful for her and beat a hasty retreat to the boat where she spent the remainder of the day in comparative comfort only an occasional faint whiff of odour reaching her there as for us males we had taken the precaution to bring along with us a ships bucket which we filled with salt water upon leaving the boat and every pearl found whether large or small was dropped into this as soon as found our first task was to go very carefully over the ground upon which we had laid out our oysters on the previous day retrieving the pearls that had been thrown out of the shells by the birds in their endeavours to extract the fish and when we had satisfied ourselves that no more were to be found there we turned our attention to the bed itself where also the birds had been and still remained exceedingly busy but we did not then attempt to look for spilled pearls for the bulk of the oysters were by this time dead and had been so long enough to render the opening of the shells quite an easy matter we therefore wandered about the bed examining such of the shells as happened to be gaping open extracting any pearls that might happen to be therein and then flinging fish and shell as far away to leeward as we could we had done with those and now tossed them aside in order that we might not inadvertently find ourselves handling them a second time we toiled assiduously throughout the whole of that day my two companions smoking steadily all the time in order to counteract as far as might be the sickening odour of the fastdecaying fish when we knocked off work shortly before sunset we found that altogether we had gathered during the day five hundred and nineteen pearls varying in size from a large pea to a marble and nearly a quart measure full of seed pearl our prizes were generally speaking of the usual soft sheeny white colour but there were exceptions to this two more pink pearls being found as well as one of a deep rich exquisite rose colour one of a very delicate shade of seagreen and seven of so very dark a smoke colour that they were almost black we did not think very much of these last believing that their extremely dark colour was against them but we ultimately discovered that this was very far from being the case that precise shade of colour being exceedingly rare none of us had much appetite for food that night when we got back to the ship and when we turned out next morning we were even less desirous of food than we had been on the previous evening we were all suffering from violent headaches accompanied by great nausea and were fain to confess that we had had quite enough of the oysterbed for the present we therefore soon agreed to let that part of the reef very severely alone for at least a week and to devote the interval to the prosecution of our survey of the channel accordingly after making an ineffectual attempt to do justice to the excellent meal which grace hartley had provided for us we three males hauled the boat alongside descended into her and got under way our course for the first seven and a half miles lay along the canal leading to the oysterbed our purpose being to examine two promising looking channels that branched out of it and that we had already noticed and commented upon on reaching the more distantand as we thought the more promisingof the two we bore up and with the wind over our starboard quarter ran away on a westsouthwest course for about five miles next hauling up to about south but by the time that we had run some four miles in this new direction we saw clearly that this channel could be of no possible service to us for it began to shoal and ultimately became too shallow to float the ship therefore as simultaneously with this discovery we caught a strong whiff of tainted wind from our oysterbed some four miles to windward we put down our helm tacked and retraced our steps going back a couple of miles along the oysterbed channel to the other channel which we desired to examine it was by this time about noon and the purer air of the reef generallyalthough even that was not wholly innocent of a suggestion of decaying fishhad so far restored our appetites that we decided to pipe to dinner accordingly upon entering the new channel we opened out the package that grace had prepared for us and fell to the channel in which we now found ourselves trended generally about northeast by east for a distance of some four and a half miles there were therefore short stretches in it here and there where the wind came too shy to allow the boat to lay her course and we consequently had to beat to windward a long leg and a short one in those stretches at length we reached a point where the channel took a due northerly trend when away we went with flowing sheets but under short canvas sounding industriously all the way then after we had traversed some ten miles in all of this new channel we quite suddenly and unexpectedly found ourselves in a basin very similar to that in which the mercury lay peacefully at anchor but not quite so large we coasted along the weather side of this basin for a distance of about two miles and then found another channel which we at once entered this channel trended northeast but we had not sailed above four miles before it narrowed so much that we saw it would be useless to us and we therefore bore up and returned to the newlydiscovered basin continuing our progress round this we found another channel branching out of its northwestern extremity and as it had a rather promising appearance we plunged into it it trended away to the northward and westward for the first seven miles then turned abruptly toward the southward for a distance of some five miles when we found ourselves in another channel trending about northnorthwest and southsoutheast this channel was even more promising than the one which we had just emerged from being almost double the width but we were puzzled for the moment as to which direction to take whether to head to the northward or the southward the northerlytrending channel might lead anywhere the southerly portion on the other hand looked as though it might possibly take us back to the ship the spars of which were visible some nine miles away we decided to try the latter as the day was by this time well advanced and should we ultimately find ourselves obliged to retrace our steps it would make us very late in getting back to the ship fortunately however we were not driven to this latter alternative for after following the winding course of the southerly channel for a distance of some twelve miles we arrived at the north eastern extremity of the basin in which the mercury lay at anchor and safely arrived alongside half an hour later having spent the day in circumnavigating a portion of the reef which we thus discovered to be entirely surrounded by channels of a width and depth of water sufficient to allow of the passage of the ship this discovery however was of no practical service to us for it still left us in our original state of uncertainty regarding the existence of a channel through which the ship might be taken into open water the narrative of our efforts to find such a channel has been given thus far with considerable detail in order to bring home to the reader some idea of the extreme awkwardness of our situation and the difficulties and perplexities with which we found ourselves confronted but there is no need to continue the story further in quite so detailed a form since the progress of our researches was unaccompanied by anything in the nature of adventure let it suffice therefore to say that we traversed the multitudinous canallike channels of that labyrinthine reef continuously for ten days longer before we found a passage of sufficient width and with a sufficient depth of water in it everywhere to enable the mercury to go through it to the open sea this passage when found proved to be a continuation of the channel originating in the northeastern angle of what we had now come to speak of as the mercury basin from the fact that the ship lay anchored in it although it was an undoubted fact that we had actually found a channel leading from this basin to open water the difficulties in the way of successfully carrying the ship through it were so great that we had very grave doubts of our ability to accomplish it in the first place the course of the channel was of so winding a character that according to a very careful estimate the ship would have to traverse no less than a hundred and ten miles of waterway before clearing the reef consequently it would be impossible to accomplish the whole distance during the hours of daylight of a single day while to attempt the navigation of any portion of it during the hours of darkness was altogether too hazardous an undertaking to be calmly thought of but as though this difficulty were not in itself sufficient there was a stretch of twelve miles of channel running in a northeasterly direction which the ship could not possibly negotiate under sail unless a change of wind should occurof which there seemed to be absolutely no prospect the only alternative therefore would be to kedge those twelve miles truly a most formidable undertaking for four personsone of them being a girlto attempt fortunately however for us all the problem of how to overcome these tremendous difficulties was solved for us by accident and quite unexpectedly for upon going over this long and intricate channel again in order thoroughly to familiarise ourselves with it and to become better acquainted with its many dangerpoints it happened that on the return journeywhich was being made by moonlightwe missed our way continuing along what appeared to be the main channel instead of diverging into a branch trending to the eastward and by the time that we discovered our mistake we were so favourably impressed with the appearance of this new strange channelwhich seemed to be running almost straight toward mercury basinthat we determined to follow it up and see whither it led not to dilate unnecessarily upon this portion of our adventures we discovered to our infinite satisfaction and delight that it did indeed ultimately conduct us back to the ship and that too by a route which reduced the distance to be travelled to about fortyfive miles or very considerably less than half that of the other channel moreover while the original channel first ran north then northeast for the twelve miles that were only to be covered by kedgingbefore it ultimately changed its course to southin which direction the point of ultimate egress lay the new channel left mercury basin at its western or leeward extremity running first west then southwest and ultimately south straight out to sea thus the whole distance could be traversed under sail and with a free wind the three following days and nights were devoted to a most careful reexamination of this new channel with the result that we thoroughly satisfied ourselves as to its absolute practicability with our minds thus relieved of a tremendous load of anxiety we felt ourselves once more able to turn our thoughts in the direction of our pearl harvest a full fortnight had been devoted to the exploration of the reef since our last visit to the oysterbed and we were of opinion that it ought by this time to be in such a condition as to afford us a very handsome return for our labours accordingly after allowing ourselves a days rest to enable us to recover from the fatigues of our recent arduous boat duty we once more repaired to the oysterbedgrace hartley preferring on this occasion to remain at home as she put it rather than again face the disgusting sights and odours that had met her on the occasion of her visit but upon our arrival at the scene of operations we soon found that a fortnight had made a vast amount of difference in the condition of the oysters for whereas when we had last visited the oysterbed the process of putrefaction had only just begun it had now advanced so far that the fish were not only completely decayed but had also in many cases so completely dried up under the influence of the suns rays as to have to a very great extent lost their odour furthermore the birds had been so busy that more than half the shells had been completely emptied our task therefore although still excessively disagreeable promised to be far less revoltingly offensive and disgusting than it had been before even such offensiveness as still remained we contrived to mitigate to a very considerable extent by adopting the simple plan of starting work on the windward edge of the bed whereby the accumulated odours were blown away from us instead of directly in our faces as on the previous occasion now we went to work systematically roughly dividing the bed into three nearly equal portions one of which was to be gone over very carefully by each of us also we each had a bucket into which to drop our spoils so that there might be no time lost and no unnecessary fatigue incurred in passing to and fro our system of working was simplicity itself and merely consisted in starting operations on the extreme weather side of the bed examining the fish just as they came to hand extracting such pearls as they contained dropping the gems into the bucket of water with which each of us was provided and then throwing the shells out on the reef apart from those still untouched we toiled on thus all day with a pause of half an hour about midday when we retired to the boat cleaned ourselves as well as we could and snatched a hasty meal concluding our labours about half an hour before sunset when during the run back to the ship at the end of the day we proceeded to compare notes and take stock of the results of our labour we came to the conclusion that either the bed was an enormously rich one or that we had had an exceedingly lucky day for our combined booty consisted of over fourteen hundred pearlssixtythree of which were of quite exceptional value from their size or colourand a full quart measure of seed pearl i was of opinion at the timeand am so still that we might have obtained considerably more than we did of the last but for the eagerness with which we prosecuted our search for the larger gems which caused our search for the smaller seed pearls to degenerate into a very perfunctory operation the story of one days work at the oysterbed is the story of all it is therefore unnecessary to say more upon the subject than that we spent a full fortnight upon the task of gathering pearls by the end of which time we had acquired so much dexterity at the work that we did more in one day than we did in two at the beginning of our labours then although at the expiration of the fortnight we seemed to have made scarcely any perceptible inroad upon that enormous deposit we grew tired of our selfimposed task and mutually agreed that we had accumulated as much wealth as we required moreover as we watched the increase of that wealth day by day our anxiety grew lest perchance anything should happen to prevent our escape from the reef and our return to that civilisation where alone our wealth could be of any real value to us the reader may reasonably ask what grounds of justification we had for the fear that anything could possibly happen to prevent our escape seeing that we had been fortunate enough to discover a channel through which the ship might be easily taken out to sea but i think we all still carried a vivid recollection of the terrific natural convulsion that had placed us in the extraordinary situation which we then occupied and i believe the others shared with me the feeling that such a thing having once happened it might possibly happen again the reef that had held us prisoners for so long might sink again to the ocean depths perchance carrying the ship with it in the terrific turmoil that must ensue or it might be hove up still higher leaving the ship stranded and immovable and then what would be our plight therefore when on the evening of a certain day gurney ventured to voice the suggestion that it would now be well to think seriously of making good our escape while yet the opportunity to do so remained to us neither of the others raised so much as a single word of protest but on the contrary agreed to the proposal with an eagerness which clearly showed how welcome it was to us all as for me said gurney when walking the poop with me that night and discussing the matter my way is now clear gracie and i will get married as soon as we arrive in sydney and then i think i may venture to return home and once more hope to find a welcome beneath the roof tree which shelters those to whom i have given so much sorrow indeed remarked i scarcely knowing what to say for my companion had spoken those last words in a tone of such intense feeling that i felt convinced a story must lie behind them yes he said and was silent for a minute or two apparently plunged in deep and painful thought then suddenly throwing up his head he continued i belong to the genus prodigal son would you care to hear my story i think i should rather like to tell it you for you are a good lad highspirited full of generous impulses eager to excel and full of pluck you are bound to make a success of your life if you will only steadfastly follow the path that your feet are now treading but forgive me for saying sothe qualities that you possess excellent as they are are precisely those that unless you are very careful are likely to betray you when i was your age i was just such another lad as you are and my father was as proud of and as hopeful for me as any parent can possibly be of an only son he gave me a firstclass education and finally procured me an excellent post under government my duties took me abroadthere is no need to say whereand i at once found myself the associate and companion of a lot of young fellows who had somehow imbibed the idea that it was incumbent upon them as government officials to adopt a smart bold dashing reckless demeanour a kind of modern edition of the swashbucklers of the stuart regime and they did their best to live up to that idea this sort of thing was quite new to me for you must remember that i was fresh from school at the time and had never seen anything of the kind before my father being an exceptionally quiet and soberminded individual associating only with men of similar temperament to himself with my new companions however respectability was voted oldfashioned and out of date sobriety of conduct a bore they were fine dashing highspirited young fellows fearing nothing and nobody and they didnt care who knew it they drank freely constituted themselves authorities on all kinds of sport gambled and did many other things that at first distinctly frightened me but which a little later on i rather admired andlike the young fool that i wassoon began to humbly emulate facilis descensus averni the reverence for truth and purity and uprightness that had come to me in the atmosphere of home soon died i recognised that those virtues belonged to a bygone period but i was going to be uptodate in the forefront nobody should surpass me i dare sayay and i very fervently hopethat all this sounds the most incredible folly to you but i give you my word that so imperceptible were the steps by which i descended the downgrade that looking back upon it all i am even now not astonished at what i did i believe that it was inevitable under the circumstances for mark you this i had never been warned against it my parents had such implicit faith in me that the possibility of such a warning being necessary never occurred to them of course there could only be one end to this sort of thing and in two years it came two years sufficed to convert me from such a lad as you are now into an utterly worthless disreputable blackguard a confirmed drunkard a hardened liar anda contemptible thief with my constitution completely shattered i was obliged to resign my post to avoid being kicked out and i returned home a moral and physical wreck but even then my poor father and mother had no suspicion of the truth for i told them that my condition was due to fever contracted in the discharge of my duty it was however impossible for me to conceal the truth from them very long after i had once more come under their roof and the grief and shame that overwhelmed them when at length their eyes were opened might have melted the heart of a stone but it did not melt mine for i was by that time so completely the slave of my vices that i had lost every vestige of natural feeling i continued my drunken habits as long as i had money to spend on liquor and when finally i had exhausted my own resources i stole from my parents the means to still continue in the indulgence of my degrading vice it broke my poor mothers heart and she died and on the day of her funeral i was unable to follow her body to its last restingplace because i was too drunk to stand or speak that was the crowning act of my disgraceful career for on that very day my father gave me twenty pounds and turned me out of his house forbidding me ever again to darken his door i went to london spent my twenty pounds in a wild life got into a street fight and was carried to a hospital with a knifewound between my ribs and there i lingered between life and death for nearly a month before i took a turn for the better and began to mend and it was three months before i was up and out again but during that three months the hospital chaplain contrived to gain my confidence he induced me to tell him my story and in return he told me some home truths that had the eventual effect of opening my eyes to the enormity of my guilt the effect being helped perhaps by the fact that during my stay in the hospital i had been cured of my cursed craving for drink when at length i was ready to leave the hospital my friend the chaplain offered to communicate with my father and endeavour to effect a reconciliation but i refused i had vowed that i would never return home until i could do so as a thoroughly reformed character i therefore made my way down to the docks took the first berth that offered and under the assumed name of george gurney became a common sailor you will think perhaps that to go to sea and in such a capacity was not quite the best possible method whereby to effect my reformation and may be it was not but i was determined that nothingnothingshould stand in my way and i think i may now say without undue confidence that i have succeeded gracie to whom i have told my story assures me that i need no longer fear to face my father and i believe her for a woman can see more deeply than a man so now i shall return home to be a comfort as i devoutly hope to my dear fathers declining years and perhaps with the aid of my wealth i may be able to do enough good to obliterate the memory of all the grief and shame that i have caused him to suffer that is my story troubridge and all that i will add to it is this if ever you feel tempted to stray though ever so slightly from the path of rectitude think of the man whom you once knew as george gurney and let his history serve as a warning to you and now i will say good night for we must be stirring early tomorrow chapter nineteen once more in open water i slept anything but soundly that night fearing that if i abandoned myself too completely to the influence of the drowsy god i might not awake early enough in the morning to ensure the accomplishment of all that was to be done next dayfor we had to hoist the boat make sail and traverse some fortyfive miles of winding channel through the reef in order to reach open water before darkness overtook us but although i was astir with the first signs of the coming dawn i found upon going out on deck that gurney and saunders were before me they too it appeared had been too anxious to do more than doze restlessly and intermittently through the hot night and finally as though by mutual consent had turned out about an hour before daylight and after softly pacing the main deck together chatting and smoking for about half an hour had gone forward lighted the galley fire and proceeded to prepare an early breakfast in order that we might all be ready to turn to the moment that we had light enough to see what we were about when i went forward and looked into the galleythe light from which had attracted my attention the instant that i emerged from the cabini was greeted with the mingled aromas of boiling cocoa and frying bacon as well as with the cheery good morning of the two men who were bending over the galley stove but i had scarcely had time to exchange greetings with them when the fourth member of our party awakened by my movements while dressing made her appearance and promptly assumed charge of the culinary operations this left the three males of the party free to tackle the more arduous duties of the day and we forthwith proceeded to unrig the boat and make her ready for hoisting by the time that this task had been advanced to the point of hooking on and hauling taut the davittackles we were summoned to breakfast and in high spirits sat down to partake of what we hoped would be our last meal but one before we should find ourselves once more at sea the meal over we proceeded to get the quarter boat hoisted to the davits which heavy boat though she was for three men to handle we soon accomplished with the assistance of a couple of watchtackles in the employment of which we had by this time through much usage become experts then came the loosing and setting of the canvas we decided that as before we would rely upon the three topsails and the fore topmast staysail to carry us to our destination that being as much canvas as we could conveniently handle and an hour and a half sufficed us to get these sails set to our satisfaction and braced ready for casting the ship then sending grace hartley aft to the wheel which she was now able to manipulate as deftly as any of us gurney and i stood by the fore braces while saunders armed with an axe proceeded to the forecastle and stood by to sever the hawser by which the ship rode at the proper moment the word was given the axe fell once twice and we were once more adrift the ship gathering sternway and paying off with her helm hard astarboard and the port fore braces flattened in she made a stern board until she was heading about south southwest when the squared main and mizen topsails began to fill and checked her whereupon the head yards were squared the staysail sheet hauled over the helm steadied and the old mercury began to forge ahead not to stop again as we hoped until she should arrive in sydney harbour and now the most ticklish part of our task lay before us for we had to navigate some fortyfive miles of narrow winding channel and negotiate several very awkward places where the slightest mistake meant disaster before we should find ourselves once more rising and falling in safety on the swells of the open pacific but we had talked the matter over a dozen times or more before reaching this stage of our adventure and knew exactly what was best to be done we therefore proceeded forthwith to do it for there is no time for hesitation when a ship is under way in narrow waters whatever has to be done must be done smartly and on the instant the channel which we had to traverse and toward the entrance of which the ship was now heading started by heading due west for a short distance then it swerved to about southwest then looked up to about southbyeast and thence undulating slightly a point or so east or west trended south for the remainder of its length now there were two or three short reaches of channel the longest of them not much more than a mile in length where we should find the wind shy enough to necessitate the ship being braced sharp up on the port tack to enable her to negotiate them successfully but it was necessary for one of us to be aloft to con the ship and as it was obvious that the other two could not brace round the yards of a ship of the mercurys size we were no sooner free of our anchor than although the ship was at the moment running off square before the wind we sprang to the braces and braced the yards sharp up on the port tack in readiness for the negotiation of the reaches of which i have spoken for while the ship would run before the wind with her yards braced sharp up she would not sail closehauled with her yards square and we had therefore settled it that the proper thing to do was to provide for the difficult points at once by the time that this was done we were so close to the western extremity of the basin and the entrance of the channel that it became necessary for me to jump aloft at once while gurney relieved grace hartley at the wheel and saunders stood in the waist with his eye on me in the fore topmast crosstrees ready to pass the word from me to the helmsman from whom i was hidden by the main and mizen topsails i am bound to admit that when i reached the crosstrees and noted the speed with which the ship was sliding along in that perfectly smooth water under the impulsion of a fine brisk easterly breeze and observed the narrowness and tortuousness of the channel that we had to traverse winding hither and thither through that vast expanse of reef my heart almost quailed within me and i felt inclined to doubt whether we three males possessed the ability the skill the quickness of eye the readiness and strength of hand to take the ship in safety through that apparently endless twisting channel but the feeling was merely momentary an old adage flashed into my mind to the effect that one need never trouble about crossing a bridge until one comes to it also that it is very unwise to meet troubles halfway i told myself that i would not worry about the difficulties and dangers ahead but would stand up there in the crosstrees and deal with them one at a time as we came to them and so i did with the gratifying result that when the suns lower rim had reached to within a fingers breadth of the western horizon the mercury slid out past the southern edge of the reef and made her first curtsy as she once more dipped to the swell of the open ocean having triumphantly negotiated and overcome every one of the difficulties of that endless rockbound channel i sprang into the topgallant rigging and shinned up to the royal yard from which elevation i was able to watch over the head of the main topsail the great black expanse of reef receding on either quarter until the sun plunged beneath the horizon in a blaze of purple crimson and gold and then i descended to the deck by way of the backstay and walked aft to exchange congratulations with the little group of two men and a woman who stood clustered about the wheel watching the evanishment of that strange rock prison in the fastgathering gloom of the tropical night before descending from aloft i had taken the precaution to fling one long lingering allembracing glance round the horizon ahead from one quarter to the other and had pretty well satisfied myself that there were no dangers lurking in the road along which we were going no white curl of surf to warn us of the existence of treacherous sunken reefs our next act therefore was to bring the ship as close to the wind as she would lie on the port tack lash the wheel adjust the after braces in such a way that the craft would steer herself and then all go below to partake of the very excellent meal that grace hartley had prepared specially to celebrate the occasion of our happy escape from the reef the ensuing fortnight was a period absolutely barren of events the weather remaining fine and the wind steady during the whole time so that we had nothing to do but just to permit the ship to drive steadily along to the southward hour after hour and day after day at an average speed of about four knots it is true that during the course of that fortnight we sighted and passed several islands at varying distances and in one case we hoveto for about half an hour to permit a canoe with half a dozen natives to come alongside and barter their load of fruit for a few feet of brass wire and a handful of glass beads but we determined to anchor nowhere if we could help it for we were now all anxiety to reach our destination as quickly as possible the care of so big a ship was a heavy responsibility to rest upon the shoulders of three menand a girl and we desired to free ourselves of it without a moments unnecessary delay and quite apart from that the monotony of the thing was beginning to get upon our nerves for gurney and grace hartley it was doubtless well enough so long as they could be together it mattered little to them to what length the voyage might be spun out but so far as i was concernedand i think i might also answer for saundersi was beginning to crave for the sight of fresh faces the sound of new voices and the stir and bustle and excitement of life ashore at length on our sixteenth day out from the reef in latitude degree minutes north the wind showed signs of failing us and by sunset that night it had fallen stark calm with a rapidly subsiding swell yet the sky was clear the barometer high and in short there was every indication that we were booked for a long spell of calm weather before we should find ourselves to the southward of the equator so indeed it proved for i believe i may say with absolute truth that never for five consecutive minutes during the ten succeeding days had we sufficient wind to extinguish the flame of a candle true there were occasional evanescent breathings that came stealing along from nowhere in particular gently ruffling a few superficial yards of the oceans glassy surface into faintest blue for a brief two or three minutes at a time and then vanishing again but during the whole of that period we never had enough wind to keep our canvas fully distended for a whole minute or course being shorthanded we could not resort to the various devices usually adopted in a fully manned craft for profiting by those transient breathings the yards were altogether too heavy for us to attempt to swing them to meet every fickle draught of air that we saw coming toward us it was therefore only the most favourable that we made any effort to utilise yet despite this we somehow contrived to drift daily a little farther south it might be perhaps no more than a mile or it might rise to as much as five or six miles everything depending upon whether the favourable zephyrs happened to hit the ship or whether they passed her bysometimes at a distance of only a few yards when we first ran into this belt of calm our horizon was bare neither land nor ship being in sightindeed we had not sighted so much as one solitary sail since leaving the island but at dawn on the sixth morning of the calm we sighted the mastheads of a small craft far away down in the southern board which upon being inspected from aloft proved to be a schooner of possibly a hundred or one hundred and twenty tons measurement during the day it became apparent that she was bound to the northward for she assiduously utilised every chance breath of wind that touched her to work her way in that direction while we did what we could to make way in the opposite direction with the result that by sunset we had shortened the distance between us by three or four miles the succeeding four days were simply repetitions in all respects of the same wearisome monotonous state of things yet the way in which the mercury and the strange schooner insensibly drew ever nearer to each other during that time was singularly illustrative of what could be accomplished in the way of progress by sailingships even in the embrace of what was to all intents and purposes a stark calm by active and intelligent officers it is true that we in the mercury did but little toward the abbreviation of the distance between the two vessels for the reason already mentioned yet when the tenth day of the calm dawned the schooner was hullup in the southern board some six miles distant from us none but those who have endured a long spell of calm in the vicinity of the equator can have the faintest idea of the deadly monotony of the experience day after day comes and goes bringing a cloudless sky of dazzling blue in the midst of which circles a merciless sun from the scorching rays of which there is no escape even under an awning for the stoutest canvas seems incapable of completely intercepting the fiery darts that cause the pitch to bubble up out of the deck seams and heat metal and darkpainted wood to a temperature high enough to blister the hand unwarily laid upon either even though an awning be spread and shelter sought thereunder those burning rays are not to be evaded for they flash up from the mirrorlike surface of the sea with a power which is scarcely to be distinguished from that exerted by those which fall direct from the great luminary himself as to going below in order to escape the arrows of the fiery archer the thing is not to be thought of for the whole interior of the ship is at such times simply an oven the air of which is too hot to breathe under such circumstances with what eagerness does the longenduring seaman scan the polished surface of the sleeping ocean in search of the little smudge of faint evanescent blue the catspaw that betrays the presence of some wandering eddy in the stagnant air which even though it be too feeble and insignificant to move the ship by so much as a single inch may at least afford his fevered body the momentary relief of a suggestion of comparative coolness and how often does the panting and perspiring officer of the deck drag his weary enervated frame to the skylight in the almost despairing hope that he may detect a depression of the mercury in the barometric tube giving the promise of a coming change only to turn away again with a weary disappointed sigh it was under such circumstances as these that during the forenoon of the tenth day of the calm gurney upon examining the barometer reported a concavity in the surface of the mercury which as we all knew was the first indication of a tendency to fall and a falling barometer of course meant a change of weather which in its turn meant wind from what quarter we scarcely cared so long as it came with strength enough to fill our canvas and give us steerageway yet the change was long in coming for the fall of the mercury was so slow as to be all but undistinguishable while up till noon the only difference that could be detected in the aspect of the sky was a certain subtle thickening of the atmosphere that robbed the blue of its exquisite clarity and reduced the sun to a shapeless blazing mass that could be gazed at without bringing tears to the eyes although there was thus far no appreciable alleviation of the scorching heat of the rays that he showered down upon us but there was an added quality of closeness in the air that caused one literally to gasp for breath occasionally while the slightest exertioneven that of moving from one part of the deck to anotherinduced instant profuse perspiration so hot indeed was it that with one accord we decided against cooking any food that day the idea of hot viands of any kind being absolutely repulsive to us all and we accordingly dined all together upon the poop under the shelter of the awning upon such cold food as the stewards pantry afforded it was about four bells in the afternoon watch when the upper edge of a great bank of livid purple cloud began to heave itself up above the northwestern horizon but when once it had risen into sight its progress was rapidso rapid indeed that within an hour of its first appearance it had soared high enough to blot out the sun to our intense relief for with the disappearance of the luminary we were at once freed from the scorching of his beams although the closeness of the atmosphere became intensified rather than otherwise of course there was no mystery as to what we were to expect we were undoubtedly in for a firstclass tropical thunderstorm with its usual accompaniments of torrential rain and very probably a sharp squall of wind that might perhaps last half an hour or so and if we were in luck end in a breeze that would carry us across the line the moment therefore that the sun was hidden we proceeded to make our preparations for the welcome change beginning by striking the awning following this by clewing up and furling the mizen topsail and winding up by closereefing the fore and main topsails this task which kept us all busy until close upon eight bells that is four oclock in the afternoon left the ship under closereefed fore and main topsails and fore topmast staysail which was snug canvas enough to enable a vessel even as shorthanded as the mercury then was to face anything like the weather which we had reason to expect meanwhile as we found time to notice the schooner had followed our example and long before our preparations were complete had been stripped of everything except her boomforesail by the time that our labours had come to an end and we were once more free to sit down and await the issue of events the pall of thundercloud had overspread the entire visible heavens from horizon to horizon enshrouding the scene in a kind of murky twilight under which the ocean undulating sluggishly in long low irregular folds like the breathings of a sleeping giant gleamed pallid and lustreless as a sea of molten lead the atmosphere was still oppressively close but it was no longer as deadly stagnant as it had been during the earlier hours of the day for at intervals the vane at our mainroyal masthead which hitherto had drooped heavy as a sodden deck swab save for the swaying motion imparted to it by the lift of the ship to the heave of the scarcely visible swell lifted and fluttered feebly for a second or two pointing now this way and anon in some other direction showing that away up aloft there and as yet too high to reach and stir the surface of the sea the air currents were awakening under the brooding influence of the coming storm these movements occurred at first at long intervals and were of the most evanescent character but the intervals rapidly shortened and within an hour of the occurrence of the first manifestation of atmospheric movement it had increased to such an extent as to cause our topsails to rustle and fill or fall aback for a moment while a little later still we could feel the light breathings upon our faces and even note their light touch here and there upon the glassy surface of the water chapter twenty the end of the voyage suddenly the surface of the water darkened away toward the northwest showing that a breeze was coming along from that direction and we sprang to the port braces rounding them in a foot or two to meet it and hauling taut and making fast the starboard we worked quickly not yet knowing quite what was at the back of the coming breeze but it proved to be only a trifle after all creeping down toward us very gradually and scarcely careening the ship when at length it reached her but trifling though it was it was none the less welcome to us all for it was inexpressibly refreshing once more to feel a wind fanning our fevered faces stirring our hair raising a pleasant tinkling sound of water under the bows and along the bends and stilling the eternal and distracting flap of canvas aloft after the long period of breathless calm through which we had sweltered moreover the ship was once more moving through the water with her jibboom pointing in the right direction and every mile that she now travelled was so much to the good increasing our chances of getting across the line and making our escape from the awful region of equatorial calms which constitute such a ghastly bugbear to those who go down to the sea in sailingships our selfcongratulations proved however to be premature for the breeze lasted only about half an hour when it died away again leaving us as completely becalmed as before but during that halfhour we had succeeded in covering quite two miles while the schooner evidently stronghanded had snatched at the opportunity afforded her and hastily setting her mainsail and jibs once more had managed to creep up to within a short mile of us before the breeze died away leaving both craft once more boxing the compass but we were by no means discouraged for we had only to glance round us at the great lowering cloudmasses that seemed to have descended almost to the level of our mastheads to know that there would be plenty more wind before we again beheld blue sky and if appearances went for anything we should not have very much longer to wait for it for the blackness overhead was working like yeast and the outfly might come at any moment yet another halfhour passed and nothing happened then while we all stood gazing and waiting the canopy of cloud that arched above us was rent asunder by a steelbright flash of lightning so intensely vivid that we were all completely blinded for a few seconds and the next instant there followed a crash of thunder that would have drowned the combined broadsides of a thousand lineofbattle ships and the tremendous concussion of which caused the poor old mercury to quiver and tremble from stem to stern now look out for the rain shouted gurney exultantly as he sprang to close the skylight covers jump below gracie dear he continued or get under cover before the rain comes and washes you overboard but the rain did not come at least not just then but as though that first flash had been a signalgun the whole of the visible heavens seemed to break at the same moment into lightning flashes and for a full quarter of an hour there was such a terrific lancing of lightning such a crashing and roaring and rumbling of thunder that one might almost have thought the navies of the world had foregathered up aloft there and with one accord had set about the task of annihilating each other during the whole of this time not a solitary drop of rain fell and not enough stirring of air occurred to extinguish the flame of a candle we had nothing to do but simply to stand there dazzled and deafened and watch as far as we might this wonderful aweinspiring manifestation of the conflicting forces of nature it happened that the schooner lay right in the wake of the most violent part of the storm we therefore had her full in view as we stood and watched her people were at this time busily engaged in restowing their mainsail and jibs apparently convinced that the ultimate outcome of all this elemental disturbance must be an outfly of wind against which it would be well to be fully prepared they had got their mainsail down and some eight or ten hands were stretched along the length of the boom tightly rolling up the great folds of canvas while four more were laid out on the jibboom furling the jibs when the storm seemed to reach its height and a great vivid flash of lightning like a sword of bluegreen fire lighting up the whole scene with its ghastly glare fell as it appeared to us full upon the little craft and the next instant as the accompanying peal of thunder crashed and boomed in our ears we all distinctly saw a flash as of fire leap up aboard her accompanied by a great puff of whitish smoke it was only momentary and had the appearance of an explosion but it was perfectly apparent that something more or less serious had happened to the little vessel after an appreciable pause on the part of her crew as though they were collecting their faculties in the face of some sudden disaster they broke at once into a state of feverish activity rushing hither and thither about her decks like men who are attempting to do half a dozen separate and distinct things at the same moment then came another flash of flame on board her and all in a moment as it seemed to us the whole after part of her burst into a fierce blaze why gurney i exclaimed turning to where the man stood with his sweetheart that last flash of lightning seems to have set the schooner on fire yes he answered and she is blazing like a tar barrel if the rain doesnt come within the next two or three minutes they will have their work cut out to extinguish the flames ay cut in saunders you are right there george look how she flares up why she must be as dry as tinder ah there they go with their buckets but what is the use of buckets against a blaze like that why dont they get their hose along and start their headpump theyll never put out that fire by balin up water from over the side no assented gurney nor by means of a hose and headpump either nothing but a good downpour of rain will do them any good now and the rain seems to be holding off scissors that ought to fetch it down as another terrific flash of lightning illuminated the whole scene from horizon to horizon but it did not the lightningfierce vivid and balefulcontinued to flash the thunder rolled and crashed and reverberated in one continuous deafening uproar but the rain held off for a good five minutes longer during which the fire aboard the schooner gained apace and spread with amazing rapidity when at length the heavens opened and the overladen clouds began to discharge their contents it was not by any means the kind of tropical deluge that might have reasonably been expected but simply a sudden brisk shower lasting less than a minute and then ceasing abruptly it was neither copious enough nor of sufficient duration to be of any appreciable service to the crew of the schooner and indeed it did not perceptibly check the progress of the flames to the onlookers aboard the mercury it seemed that the other craft was irretrievably doomed and such also seemed to be the opinion of her own crew for they were presently seen to be frantically busy over the clearing away of the longboat which was stowed on top of the main hatch and the safety of which was now threatened by the rapidly advancing flames do you think that they will succeed in extinguishing the fire george asked grace hartley as she clung to her lovers arm and gazed with wideopen eyes of anxiety at the progress of the conflagration no answered gurney unhesitatingly to be quite candid with you dear i do not whatever may be the cargo that the schooner carries it is evidently of a highly combustible character and now seems to be fairly ignited the fire gains ground even as we stand and gaze and if the crew could not conquer it at the outset they are not likely to do so now what think you mr troubridge i quite agree with you i answered that schooner then interrupted grace passionately with an impatient stamp of her foot on the deck if you really think that what are we all standing here idly for why are we not doing something to help those poor fellows who are in danger of perishing in the flames because my dear there is no need as yet at all events answered gurney you see he continued they are clearing away their own boat and if they can only contrive to get her into the water before she is irretrievably damaged they will be all right they have but to cross that narrow space of water to reach us and safety but as for us we can do nothing it would need two of us to take one of our quarter boats alongside that schooner in time to be of any service to those people and with the weather as it is at this moment it would be the height of madness for us to make the attempt for suppose that this thunderstorm were to end in a heavy squall of windas it may at any momentcatching the boat with saunders and me in her halfway or thereabout between the two vessels what would be the result why that we should be equally unable to reach the schooner or return to the mercury we should all part company and the chances are that none of us would ever again meet in this world no no i suppose we should all be willing to risk a great deal to help our fellowcreatures in extremity but we must not lightly undertake an adventure that may be fatal to us while of very problematical advantage to the others ah see there is the answer to your appeal gracie they have cleared away the longboat and now they are hoisting her out none too soon either for if my eyes do not deceive me one gang have to sluice her with water to prevent her taking fire while the others are getting her over the side it was even as gurney had said the flames had spread with such astounding rapidity that the schooners crew only saved the boat by the very skin of their teeth but presently she splashed safely into the water alongside and as she did so the schooners people seemed to pour over that vessels low rail in a body scarcely giving themselves time to unhook the tackles before they flung out their oars and shoved off indeed there was very urgent need for haste for not only was the entire after part of the schooner ablaze by this timethe flames shooting straight up in the breathless air as high as the little vessels main truckbut within the last minute or so there had occurred that abrupt cessation which in the case of tropical thunderstorms is so frequently the precursor of a sudden and brief but exceedingly violent squall of wind and if that threatened squall should burst its bonds and come shrieking and howling in fury across the surface of the sea scourging it into a mad turmoil of foaming leaping water and blinding spindrift while the burntout crew of the schooner were making their passage across to the mercury it might be very bad for them for even should they be fortunate enough to avoid capsizal it might be exceedingly difficult if not altogether impossible for the ship smitten and bowed down by the might of the tempest to pause and pick them up of course as we fully expected the boat headed straight for the mercury and the only question now was whether she would reach us before the brooding tempest broke loose and involved us all in its clutches i glanced anxiously round the horizon and was not reassured by what i saw for the aspect of the heavens had rapidly grown so threatening that it looked as though the outburst must inevitably come within the next minute or two while strive as they might the strangers could not get alongside us in less than ten minutes at the least and we could do absolutely nothing to help them for at this moment there was not the faintest perceptible movement of the atmosphere and both craft lay as motionless as logs in a timber pond i looked aloft at the vane at our masthead it might have been made of cast iron for all the movement that it betrayed i wetted my finger and held it up turning it this way and that in the hope of detecting a draught however slight but there was nothing a glance at the blazing hull of the schooner showed that the flames were shooting heavenward as straight as the flame of a candle burning in a vault no there was nothing to be done except to get a number of ropesends ready to fling into the boat the moment that she came alongside should she succeed in doing so and this we did flinging the coils of braces and what not off the pins to the deck in readiness to cast at the moment when perhaps a second more or less might make all the difference between life and death to some fourteen or fifteen of our fellowcreatures that the occupants of the boat were as fully alive as ourselves to the critical nature of the situation was clear from the desperate energy with which they toiled at the six oars they had thrown out the stout ash blades bending almost to breaking point at each stroke and sending a long trail of tiny frothflecked swirls seething and driving astern as the men sprang and bent their backs to their work while the water buzzed and foamed under the crafts bluff bows they were racing for their lives and knew it fathom by fathom the heavy boat surged ahead over the oilsmooth surface of the black water with the scowling sky writhing overhead as though the spirit of the storm were struggling to burst its bonds and leap upon them they were already so near at hand that we could hear their cries as they shouted encouragement to each other when a sudden puff of air from the northwest swept over the ship causing the topsails and staysail to momentarily fill with a report like a musketshot with a quick jar and creaking of trusses parrals and block sheaves before the canvas again collapsed to the masts with a rustling sound that to our overstrained senses seemed preternaturally loud it is coming now look there over the starboard quarter shouted gurney pointing and putting his hands to his mouth he yelled to those in the approaching boat pull men pull for your lives or youll miss us yet i looked in the direction indicated and sure enough it was as gurney had said the sky in that quarter was black as night and beneath it was the long line of white foam that marked the progress of the approaching squall it was racing down upon us with incredible speed and near as the boat was it was evident that the squall must strike us before she could get alongside and once in the grip of that raving fury of wind no earthly power could save those unfortunates who were now fighting like maniacs to reach the ark of safety that floated so nearyet not near enough something must be done some risk must be taken to help them that we should without effort of any sort suffer ourselves to be cruelly snatched away far beyond the reach of those desperately struggling men leaving them to miserably perish was unthinkable back the fore topsail i yelled springing down the poop ladder to the main deck and feverishly casting off the fore braces it is the only thing that we can do we may lose our topmasts but we must risk that with our fore topsail aback we may perhaps be able to edge down upon and pick them up otherwise we shall never set eyes upon them again working like demons each of us seeming to be possessed for the moment of the strength of a dozen men we got the head yards braced round and the braces made fast before the squall reached us and then i sprang aft to the wheel while gurney and saunders snatching up as many loose coils of rope as they could grasp stood by to drop them into the boat as i reached the wheel and wrenched it hard astarboard the squall with an indescribable fury of sound struck usfortunately well over the starboard quarter with a report like a cannonshot and a creaking and groaning of overstrained spars and timbers the mercury buried her bows in the boiling sea and gathered way paying off square before the wind as she did so i let her go well off until the longboat was broad on our starboard bow then putting the helm hard down i brought the ship close to the wind thus throwing her fore topsail aback and by the mercy of providence judging my distance with such nicety that the next moment the longboat by this time full to her thwarts and utterly helpless was scraping along under the shelter of our lee side while the ship suddenly arrested by her backed topsail careened until her lee rail was level with the foam gurney and saunders hove their ropesends fair into the boat but there was no need for them the ship was bowed so steeply that the occupants were able to seize her rail and scramble inboard unaided in as many seconds fourteen strange men had transferred themselves from the sinking longboat to our decks while the boat rasping astern along the ships side capsized and turned bottom up as she drove clear gurney flourished his hand to me as a sign that all was well and then as i once more put the helm up and allowed the ship to go off before the wind he seized some three or four of the dazed strangers and invoked their aid to square the foreyard it was with a mighty sigh of relief that i presently resigned the wheel to saunders and went forward to greet and welcome the rescued men for by the skin of our teeth we had saved them all in the very nick of time and that too without parting so much as a ropeyarn furthermore by an extraordinary stroke of fortunegood for us although bad for them we had in the most unexpected manner secured the services of enough hands to enable us to work the ship without being constantly worried as to the quantity of sail that we might safely venture to set therefore we were now in a position to avail ourselves to the utmost extent of every kind of weather and could hope to bring our remarkable voyage to a speedy conclusion as i joined the group of strangers clustered about gurney down on the main deck it was easy to determine even before i came within sound of their tongues that they were britishaustralians that is to say for they one and all bore the wellmarked characteristics of that sturdy independent selfreliant race gurney at once took it upon himself to perform the ceremony of introduction this mates said he indicating me is our skipper mr troubridge he is but a youngster as you may see for yourselves but you may take my word for it that so long as he commands everything will go right with us our story is a long one and a queer onetoo long and too queer to be spun just now so it must wait but you will all be glad to know that we are bound for the port that you hail from so please god it will not be long before you see your sweethearts and wives once more this mr troubridge is mr thomson chief mate of the schooner seamew blazing out yonder and the rest are the remainder of her crew whose names i have not yet had time to learn welcome aboard the mercury mr thomson and men of the seamew said i i am heartily glad that since it was your lot to meet with misfortune we happened to be near enough at hand to pick you up but what of your captain where is he i am sorry to say mr troubridge answered thomson that captain peters and mr girdlestone our second mate were both struck dead by the flash of lightning that set the schooner afire and we were obliged to leave em aboard to burn with her since we had no time to do anything else the seamew was capn peters own property and we were out after sandalwood of which the schooner was moren halffull when this misfortune happened to her we fought the flames as long as we could in the hope of savin her but we never had a chance from the very first for she was old and as dry as the inside of a tinderbox and she burned like a pine splinter we hung on to her so long that we had to leave all our belongings aboard her comin away with just what we stood up in and we cut it so fine that if wed delayed another minute wed all be in davys locker now ay said i there is very little doubt of that i think however a miss is as good as a mile they say and you are all here except your unfortunate captain and second mate so you must make yourselves as comfortable as you can until we arrive in sydney i am afraid i shall have to ask you to work your passages for we are very shorthanded as you will have seen but no doubt when we arrive oh thats all right sir cut in thomson of course well work our passages and glad of the chance to do so its a lucky thing for us that you were near enough to pick us up so the matter was arranged gurney and thomson each heading a watch of six men while the cook and the steward of the seamew respectively took charge of the mercurys galley and pantry and saunders promptly escaped from the cabin to the more congenial atmosphere of the forecastle where he entertained the men during the remainder of the voyage with stories of our adventures first on the island and afterwards on the reef but a timely hint from gurney terse and strong kept his lips closed upon the subject of the pearls of the existence of which on board not a man of the schooners crew ever became aware there is but little more that need be said in order to bring this story of a very remarkable and adventurous voyage to a close the schooner continued to blaze fiercelythe flames fanned to everincreasing fury by the strength of the windfor about half an hour after we had run past her when we suddenly lost sight of her thomsons opinion being that by that time her upper works had been completely consumed and that the sea had gained access to her interior sending her charred remains to the bottom true the tail of the squall brought along a smart shower of rain that lasted about ten minutes but it was over again before she disappeared so that the alternative theory of brady her boatswain that the rain extinguished the flames found little acceptance with us in any case it was not worth while returning to seek her for even had she been found she could but have been a mere burntout shell of no value to anyone the squall blew itself out in about twenty minutes but the wind continued to blow strongly all through the night and it was not until sunrise on the following morning that the weather moderated sufficiently to induce gurney to send the hands aloft to turn out the reefs and make sail when i went on deck however at seven bells it was glorious weather the sky clear save for a few light fleecy clouds drifting solemnly along out of the north west a moderate sea running and the ship bowling gaily along under all plain sail and her starboard studding sailsa sight which i had not gazed upon for many a long day we crossed the equator during the forenoon of that day and meeting with favourable weather for the remainder of the voyage entered port jackson without further adventure some three weeks later coming to an anchor close to garden island the arrival of the mercury so long overdue that she had been given up as lost created quite a little local sensation which was vastly increased when the history of the voyage was made public to such an extent indeed that a government ship was dispatched to the island with authority to arrest wilde polson and tudsbery upon a charge of piracy and bring them to sydney for trial the business of the ship and the fact that gurney saunders grace hartley and i would be required as witnesses at the trial detained us all at sydney until the return of the corvette from the island some two months later the news which she brought back sent a thrill of horror throughout the colony it was to the effect that upon her arrival at the spot the latitude and longitude of which i had given a small islet had been discovered which upon examination proved to be the crater of a volcano that had evidently been very recently in a state of violent activity but no traces of life were to be found upon it nor had the islet any resemblance to the extensive and beautiful island which we had described the weather however proving favourable the captain of the corvette had anchored his ship for several days close to the islet and had caused an extensive series of soundings to be taken all round it which upon being plotted to a large scale were of such a character as to leave no doubt that the islet was indeed the summit of the peak of wildes island and that the latter had most probably been engulfed with its inhabitants by the same cataclysm that had imprisoned the mercury among the meshes of the pearl reef our escape therefore from the common destruction that had overtaken the rest had been an exceedingly narrow one the margin of safety amounting in fact to less than three days for there can be no question that had the mercury been at her moorings in the basin or even within a few miles of the island when the catastrophe occurred she could never have survived it the consignees of the mercurys original cargothe names and addresses of whom were mentioned in the ships manifest found by me with the rest of the ships papers in the captains deskwere of course only too glad to accept the cargo of sandalwood brought from the island in lieu of the much less valuable merchandise originally consigned to them and they at once chartered the ship to carry the wood to canton one of the partnersa mr hendersongoing with it in the capacity of supercargo to dispose of it upon arrival there was not much difficulty in engaging another master officers and crew for the ship and i subsequently learned that she arrived safely that the cargo was speedily disposed of tea purchased with the proceeds and the ship dispatched with it to england where she duly arrived the net result of the adventure being a big profit for the fortunate consignees these gentlemen were scotchmen and although persons of that nationality have the reputation of keeping a very tight hand upon the bawbees i am bound to say that they treated gurney saunders and myself with a liberality not to say generosity that left nothing to be desired although of course we had no claim on them the result being that not only were we able to maintain ourselves most comfortably in sydney while awaiting the return of the corvette from the island but also to return afterwards to england as firstclass passengers that is to say gurney grace hartley and i did so but saunders remained in the colony and eventually became a prosperous and exceedingly wealthy sheep farmer as for gurney he lost no time in making grace hartley his wife i officiating as best man on the occasion we all three went home together in the cuddy of the same ship and upon our arrival it was my happy privilege to be the means of opening the negotiations with his fathersir george burnley baronet of chudleigh grange devonthat resulted in a complete and permanent reconciliation between the two gurneyor burnley to give him his correct namehad learned his lesson while passing through the fires of adversity he had learned in the school of experiencethat best of all schoolsthat the socalled pleasures of sin endure but for a very brief season and are inevitably followed by misery suffering shame and selfcontempt beyond all power of words to express and he had the resolution and strength to pull himself together and become once more a man in the best and highest sense of the term before it was too late and mental moral and physical ruin complete and irretrievable had overtaken him he had the joy of seeing his fathers belief and pride in him fully restored and of making that fathers declining years easy pleasant and happy now he reigns in that fathers stead honoured respected and beloved by all and the pride and joy of his wife and children as for me my pearls when at length i had succeeded in converting them into money produced so unexpectedly magnificent a fortune that not only was i enabled by its means to obtain a commanding interest in the corporation which owned the gold star line of sailing clippers but also very materially to assist in converting that line from sail to steam this was of course a very gradual process and by the time that it was complete i was not only out of my apprenticeship but had worked my way up to the position of chief mate two voyages in this capacity sufficed to qualify me for the position of master and now in the time of my ripened experience i hold the proud position of commodore of the fleet and have the pleasure of walking the bridge as commander of one of the finest passenger steamers that trade between england and the australian ports

priest shall never darken my doors again then i say they are my doors and not yours and that holy man shall brighten them whenever he will the gentleman and lady who faced each other pale and furious and interchanged this bitter defiance were man and wife and had loved each other well miss catherine peyton was a young lady of ancient family in cumberland and the most striking but least popular beauty in the county she was very tall and straight and carried herself a little too imperiously yet she would sometimes relax and all but dissolve that haughty figure and hang sweetly drooping over her favorites then the contrast was delicious and the woman fascinating her hair was golden and glossy her eyes a lovely grey and she had a way of turning them on slowly and full so that their victim could not fail to observe two things that they were grand and beautiful orbs that they were thoughtfully overlooking him instead of looking at him so contemplated by glorious eyes a man feels small and bitter catherine was apt to receive the blunt compliments of the cumberland squires with this sweet celestial superior gaze and for this and other imperial charms was more admired than liked the family estate was entailed on her brother her father spent every farthing he could so she had no money and no expectations except from a distant cousin mr charlton of hernshaw castle and bolton hall even these soon dwindled mr charlton took a fancy to his late wifes relation griffith gaunt and had him into his house and treated him as his heir this disheartened two admirers who had hitherto sustained catherine peytons gaze and they retired comely girls girls longnosed but rich girls snubnosed but winning married on all sides of her but the imperial beauty remained miss peyton at twoandtwenty she was rather kind to the poor would give them money out of her slender purse and would even make clothes for the women and sometimes read to them very few of them could read to themselves in that day all she required in return was that they should be roman catholics like herself or at least pretend they might be brought to that faith by little and little she was a highminded girl and could be a womanly onewhenever she chose she hunted about twice a week in the season and was at home in the saddle for she had ridden from a child but so ingrained was her character that this sport which more or less unsexes most women had no perceptible effect on her mind nor even on her manners the scarlet ridinghabit and little purple cap and the great white bony horse she rode were often seen in a good place at the end of a long run but for all that the lady was a most ungenial foxhuntress she never spoke a word but to her acquaintances and wore a settled air of dreamy indifference except when the hounds happened to be in full cry and she galloping at their heels worse than that when the hounds were running into the fox and his fate certain she had been known to rein in her struggling horse and pace thoughtfully home instead of coming in at the death and claiming the brush one day being complimented at the end of a hard run by the gentleman who kept the hounds she turned her celestial orbs on him and said nay sir ralph i love to gallop and this sorry business it gives me an excuse it was full a hundred years ago the country teemed with foxes but it abounded in stiff coverts and a knowing fox was sure to run from one to another and then came wearisome efforts to dislodge him and then miss peytons grey eyes used to explore vacancy and ignore her companions biped and quadruped but one day they drew yewtree brow and found a stray fox at gaylads first note he broke cover and went away for home across the open country a hedger saw him steal out and gave a view halloo the riders came round halter skelter the hounds in cover one by one threw up their noses and voices the horns blew the canine music swelled to a strong chorus and away they swept across country dogs horses men and the deuce take the hindmost it was a gallant chase and our dreamy virgins blood got up erect but lithe and vigorous and one with her great white gelding she came flying behind the foremost riders and took leap for leap with them one glossy golden curl streamed back in the rushing air her grey eyes glowed with earthly fire and two red spots on the upper part of her cheeks showed she was much excited without a grain of fear yet in the first ten minutes one gentleman was unhorsed before her eyes and one came to grief along with his animal and a thoroughbred chestnut was galloping and snorting beside her with empty saddle presently young featherstone who led her by about fifteen yards crashed through a high hedge and was seen no more but heard wallowing in the deep unsuspected ditch beyond there was no time to draw bridle lie still sir if you please said catherine with cool civility then up rein in spur and she cleared the ditch and its muddy contents alive and dead and away without looking behind her on on on till all the pinks and buckskins erst so smart were splashed with clay and dirt of every hue and all the horses late glossy coats were bathed with sweat and lathered with foam and their gaping nostrils blowing and glowing red and then it was that harrowden brook swollen wide and deep by the late rains came right between the fox and dogmore underwood for which he was making the hunt sweeping down a hillside caught sight of reynard running for the brook they made sure of him now but he lapped a drop and then slipped in and soon crawled out on the other side and made feebly for the covert weighted with wet fur at sight of him the hunt hallooed and trumpeted and came tearing on with fresh vigor but when they came near the brook lo it was twenty feet wide and running fast and brown some riders skirted it looking for a narrow part two horses being spurred at it came to the bank and then went rearing round on their heels depositing one hat and another rider in the current one gallant steed planted his feet like a tower and snorted down at the water one flopped gravely in and had to swim and be dragged out another leaped and landed with his feet on the other bank his haunches in the water and his rider curled round his neck and glaring out between his retroverted ears but miss peyton encouraged her horse with spur and voice set her teeth turned rather pale this time and went at the brook with a rush and cleared it like a deer she and the huntsman were almost alone together on the other side and were as close to the hounds as the hounds were to poor pug when he slipped through a run in a quickset hedge and glided into dogmore underwood a stiff hazel coppice of five years growth the other riders soon straggled up and then the thing was to get him out again there were a few narrow roads cut in the underwood and up and down these the huntsman and whipperin went trotting and encouraged the staunch hounds and whipped the skulkers back into covert others galloped uselessly about pounding the earth for daisycutters were few in those days and miss peyton relapsed into the transcendental she sat in one place with her elbow on her knee and her fair chin supported by two fingers as undisturbed by the fracas of horns and voices as an equestrian statue of diana she sat so still and so long at a corner of the underwood that at last the harassed fox stole out close to her with lolling tongue and eye askant and took the open field again she thrilled at first sight of him and her cheeks burned but her quick eye took in all the signs of his distress and she sat quiet and watched him coolly not so her horse he plunged and then trembled all over and planted his forefeet together at this angle and parted his hindlegs a little and so stood quivering with cocked ears and peeped over a low paling at the retiring quadruped and fretted and sweated in anticipation of the gallop his long head told him was to follow he looked a deal more statuesque than any three statues in england and all about a creature not up to his kneeand bytheby the gentlemen that carve horses in our native isle did they ever see oneout of an omnibus the whipperin came by and found him in this gallant attitude and suspected the truth but observing the riders tranquil position thought the fox had only popped out and then in again however he fell in with the huntsman and told him miss peytons grey had seen something the hounds appeared puzzled and so the huntsman rode round to miss peyton and touching his cap asked her if she had seen anything of the fox she looked him dreamily in the face the fox said she he broke cover ten minutes ago the man blew his horn lustily and then asked her reproachfully why she had not tallyhoed him or winded her horn with that he blew his own again impatiently miss peyton replied very slowly and pensively that the fox had come out soiled and fatigued and trailing his brush i looked at him said she and i pitied him he was one and we are many he was so little and we are so big he had given us a good gallop and so i made up my mind he should live to run another day the huntsman stared stupidly at her for a moment then burst into a torrent of oaths then blew his horn till it was hoarse then cursed and swore till he was hoarse himself then to his horn again and dogs and men came rushing to the sound couple up and go home to supper said miss peyton quietly the fox is halfway to gallowstree gorse and you wont get him out of that this afternoon i promise you as she said this she just touched her horse with the spur leaped the low hedge in front of her and cantered slowly home across country she was one that seldom troubled the hard road go where she would she had ridden about a mile when she heard a horses feet behind her she smiled and her color rose a little but she cantered on halt in the kings name shouted a mellow voice and a gentleman galloped up to her side and reined in his mare what have they killed inquired catherine demurely not they he is in the middle of gallowstree gorse by now and is this the way to gallowstree gorse nay mistress said the young man but when the fox heads one way and the deer another what is a poor hunter to do follow the slower it seems say the lovelier and the dearer sweet kate now griffith you know i hate flattery said kate and the next moment came a soft smile and belied this unsocial sentiment flattery said the lover i have no tongue to speak half your praise i think the people in this country are as blind as bats or theyd all except mr griffith gaunt he has found a paragon where wiser people see a wayward capricious girl then he is the man for you dont you see that mistress no i dont quite see that said the lady drily this cavalier reply caused a dismay the speaker never intended the fact is mr george neville young handsome and rich had lately settled in the county and had been greatly smitten with kate the county was talking about it and griffith had been secretly on thorns for some days past and now he could hide his uneasiness no longer he cried out in a sharp trembling voice why kate my dear kate what could you love any man but me could you be so cruelcould you there let me get off my horse and lie down on this stubble and you ride over me and trample me to death i would rather have you trample on my ribs than on my heart with loving any one but me why what now said catherine drawing herself up i must scold you handsomely and she drew rein and turned full upon him but by this means she saw his face was full of real distress so instead of reprimanding him she said gently why griffith what is to do are you not my servant do not i send you word whenever i dine from home yes dearest and then i call at that house and stick there till they guess what i would be at and ask me too catherine smiled and proceeded to remind him that thrice a week she permitted him to ride over from bolton a distance of fifteen miles to see her yes replied griffith and i must say you always come wet or dry to the shrubbery gate and put your hand in mine a minute and kate said he piteously at the bare thought of your putting that same dear hand in another mans my heart turns sick within me and my skin burns and trembles on me but you have no cause said catherine soothingly nobody except yourself doubts my affection for you you are often thrown in my teeth griffithand clenching her own i like you all the betterof course griffith replied with a burst of gratitude and then as men will proceeded to encroach ah said he if you would but pluck up courage and take the matrimonial fence with me at once miss peyton sighed at that and drooped a little upon her saddle after a pause she enumerated the just impediments she reminded him that neither of them had means to marry on he made light of that he should soon have plenty mr charlton had as good as told him he was to have bolton hall and grange six hundred acres kate besides the park and paddocks in his warmth he forgot that catherine was to have been mr charltons heir catherine was too highminded to bear griffith any grudge but she colored a little and said she was averse to come to him a penniless bride why what matters it which of us has the dross so that there is enough for both said griffith with an air of astonishment catherine smiled approbation and tacitly yielded that point but then she objected the difference in their faith oh honest folk get to heaven by different roads said griffith carelessly i have been taught otherwise replied catherine gravely then give me your hand and ill give you my soul said griffith gaunt impetuously ill go to heaven your way if you cant go mine anything sooner than be parted in this world or the next she looked at him in silence and it was in a faint half apologetic tone she objected that all her kinsfolk were set against it it is not their business it is ours was the prompt reply well then said catherine sadly i suppose i must tell you the true reason i feel i should not make you happy i do not love you quite as you want to be loved as you deserve to be loved you need not look so nothing in flesh and blood is your rival but my heart it bleeds for the church i think of her ancient glory in this kingdom and when i see her present condition i long to devote myself to her service i am very fit to be an abbess or a nun most unfit to be a wife no no i must not ought not dare not many a protestant take the advice of one who esteems you dearly leave mefly from me forget medo everything but hate me nay do not hate me you little know the struggle in my mind farewell the saints whom you scorn watch over and protect you farewell and with this she sighed and struck her spur into the grey and he darted off at a gallop griffith little able to cope with such a character as this sat petrified and would have been rooted to the spot if he had happened to be on foot but his mare set off after her companion and a chase of a novel kind commenced catherines horse was fresher than griffiths mare and the latter not being urged by her petrified master lost ground but when she drew near to her fathers gate catherine relaxed her speed and griffith rejoined her she had already half relented and only wanted a warm and resolute wooer to bring her round but griffith was too sore and too little versed in woman full of suspicion and bitterness he paced gloomy and silent by her side till they reached the great avenue that led to her fathers house and while he rides alongside the capricious creature in sulky silence i may as well reveal a certain foible in his own character this griffith gaunt was by no means deficient in physical courage but he was instinctively disposed to run away from mental pain the moment he lost hope of driving it away from him for instance if catherine had been ill and her life in danger he would have ridden day and night to save her but if she had died he would either have killed himself or else fled the country and so escaped the sight of every object that was associated with her and could agonize him i do not think he could have attended the funeral of one he loved the mind as well as the body has its selfprotecting instincts this of griffiths was after all an instinct of that class and under certain circumstances is true wisdom but griffith i think earned the instinct to excess and that is why i call it his foible catherine said he resolutely let me ride by your side to the house for once for i read your advice my own way and i mean to follow it after today you will be troubled with me no more i have loved you these three years i have courted you these two years and i am none the nearer i see i am not the man you mean to marry so i shall do as my father did ride down to the coast and sell my horse and ship for foreign parts oh as you will said catherine haughtily she quite forgot she had just recommended him to do something of this very kind presently she stole a look his fine ruddy cheek was pale his manly brown eyes were moist yet a gloomy and resolute expression on his tightdrawn lips she looked at him sidelong and thought how often he had ridden thirty miles on that very mare to get a word with her at the shrubbery gate and now the mare to be sold the man to go brokenhearted to sea perhaps to his death her good heart began to yearn griffith said she softly it is not as if i was going to wed anybody else is it nothing to be preferred by her you say you love if i was you i would do nothing rash why not give me a little time in truth i hardly know my own mind about it two days together kate said the young man firmly i am courting you this two years if i wait two years more it will be but to see the right man come and carry you in a month for so girls are won when they are won at all your sister that is married and dead she held josh pitt in hand for years and what is the upshot why he wears the willow for her to this day and her husband he married again before her grave was green nay i have done all an honest man can do to woo you so take me now or let me go at this kate began to waver secretly and ask herself whether it would not be better to yield since he was so resolute but the unlucky fellow did not leave well alone he went on to say once out of sight of this place i may cure myself of my fancy here i never could oh said catherine directly if you are so bent on being cured it would not become me to say nay griffith gaunt bit his lip and hung his head and made no reply the patience with which he received her hard speech was more apparent than real but it told catherine receiving no fresh positive provocation relented again of her own accord and after a considerable silence whispered softly think how we should all miss you here was an overture to reconciliation but unfortunately it brought out what had long been rankling in griffiths mind and was in fact the real cause of the misunderstanding oh said he those i care for will soon find another to take my place soon quotha they have not waited till i was gone for that ah indeed said catherine with some surprise then like the quickwitted girl she was so this is what all the coil is about she then with a charming smile begged him to inform her who was his destined successor in her esteem griffith colored purple at her cool hypocrisy for such he considered it and replied almost fiercely who but that young blackavised george neville that you have been coquetting with this month past and danced all night with him at lady munsters ball you did catherine blushed and said deprecatingly you were not there griffith or to be sure i had not danced with him and he toasts you by name wherever he goes can i help that wait till i toast him before you make yourself ridiculous and me very angryabout nothing griffith sticking to his one idea replied doggedly mistress alice peyton shillyshallied with her true lover for yearstill richard hilton came that was not fit to tie his shoes and then catherine cut him short affront me if nothing less will serve but spare my sister in her grave she began this sentence angrily but concluded it in a broken voice griffith was half disarmed but only half he answered sullenly she did not die till she had jilted an honest gentleman and broken his heart and married a sot to her cost and you are of her breed when all is done and now that young coxcomb has come like dick hilton between you and me but i do not encourage him you do not discourage him retorted griffith or he would not be so hot after you were you ever the woman to say i have a servant already that loves me dearthat one frank word had sent him packing miss peyton colored and the water came into her eyes i may have been imprudent she murmured the young gentleman made me smile with his extravagance i never thought to be misunderstood by him far less by you then suddenly bold as brass tis all your fault if he had the power to make you uneasy why did you not check me before ay forsooth and have it cast in my teeth i was a jealous monster and played the tyrant before my time a poor fellow scarce knows what to be at that loves a coquette coquette i am none replied the lady bridling magnificently griffith took no notice of this interruption he proceeded to say that he had hitherto endured this intrusion of a rival in silence though with a sore heart hoping his patience might touch her or the fire go out of itself but at last unable to bear it any longer in silence he had shown his wound to one he knew could feel for him his poor friend pitt pitt had then let him know that his own mistake had been overconfidence in alice peytons constancy he said to me watch your kate close and at the first blush of a rival say you to her part with him or part with me catherine pinned him directly and this is how you take joshua pitts advice by offering to run away from this sorry rival the shrewd reply and a curl of the lip half arch half contemptuous that accompanied the thrust staggered the less ready griffith he got puzzled and showed it well but stammered he at last your spirit is high i was mostly afeard to put it so plump to you so i thought i would go about a bit however it comes to the same thing for this i do know that if you refuse me your hand this day it is to give it to a new acquaintance as your alice did before you and if it is to be so tis best for me to be gone best for him and best for you you dont know me kate for as clever as you are at the thought of your playing me false after all these years and marrying that george neville my heart turns to ice and then to fire and my head seems ready to burst and my hands to do mad and bloody acts ay i feel i should kill him or you or both at the church porch ah he suddenly griped her arm and at the same time involuntarily checked his mare both horses stopped she raised her head with an inquiring look and saw her lovers face discolored with passion and so strangely convulsed that she feared at first he was in a fit or stricken with death or palsy she uttered a cry of alarm and stretched forth her hand towards him but the next moment she drew it back from him for following his eye she discerned the cause of this ghastly look her fathers house stood at the end of the avenue they had just entered but there was another approach to it viz by a bridleroad at right angles to the avenue or main entrance and up that bridleroad a gentleman was walking his horse and bade fair to meet them at the hall door it was young neville there was no mistaking his piebald charger for any other animal in that county kate peyton glanced from lover to lover and shuddered at griffith she was familiar with petty jealousy she had even detected it pinching or coloring many a pretty face that tried very hard to hide it all the time but that was nothing to what she saw now hitherto she had but beheld the feeling of jealousy but now she witnessed the livid passion of jealousy writhing in every lineament of a human face that terrible passion had transfigured its victim in a moment the ruddy genial kindly griffith with his soft brown eye was gone and in his place lowered a face older and discolored and convulsed and almost demoniacal women wiser perhaps in this than men take their strongest impressions by the eye not ear catherine i say looked at him she had hitherto thought she knew looked and feared him and even while she looked and shuddered griffith spurred his mare sharply and then drew her head across the grey geldings path it was an instinctive impulse to bar the lady he loved from taking another step towards the place where his rival awaited her i cannot bear it he gasped choose you now once for all between that puppy there and me and he pointed with his ridingwhip at his rival and waited with his teeth clenched for her decision the movement was rapid the gesture large and commanding and the words manly for what says the fighting poet he either fears his fate too much or his deserts are small who fears to put it to the touch to win or lose it all chapter ii miss peyton drew herself up and back by one motion like a queen at bay but still she eyed him with a certain respect and was careful now not to provoke nor pain him needlessly i prefer youthough you speak harshly to me sir said she with gentle dignity then give me your hand with that man in sight and end my torments promise to marry me this very week ah kate have pity on your poor faithful servant who has loved you so long i do griffith i do said she sweetly but i shall never marry now only set your mind at rest about mr neville there he has never asked me for one thing he soon will then no no i declare i will be very cool to him after what you have said to me but i cannot marry you neither i dare not listen to me and do pray govern your temper as i am doing mine i have often read of men with a passion for jealousyi mean men whose jealousy feeds upon air and defies reason i know you now for such a man marriage would not cure this madness for wives do not escape admiration any more than maids something tells me you would be jealous of every fool that paid me some stale compliment jealous of my female friends and jealous of my relations and perhaps jealous of your own children and of that holy persecuted church which must still have a large share of my heart no no your face and your words have shown me a precipice i tremble and draw back and now i never will marry at all from this day i give myself to the church griffith did not believe one word of all this that is your answer to me said he bitterly when the right man puts the question and he is not far off you will tell another tale you take me for a fool and you mock me you are not the lass to die an old maid and men are not the fools to let you with faces like yours the new servant comes before the first one is gone well i have got my answer county cumberland you are no place for me the ways and the fields we two have rid together oh how could i bear their sight without my dear why what a poorspirited fool am i to stay and whine come mistress your lover waits you there and your discarded servant knows good breeding he leaves the country not to spoil your sport catherine panted heavily well sir said she then it is your doing not mine will you not even shake hands with me griffith i were a brute else sighed the jealous one with a sudden revulsion of feeling i have spent the happiest hours of my life beside you if i loved thee less i had never left thee he clung a little while to her hand more like a drowning man than anything else then let it go and suddenly shook his clenched fist in the direction of george neville and cried out with a savage yell my curse on him that parts us twain and you kate may god bless you single and curse you married and that is my last word in cumberland amen said catherine resignedly and even with this they wheeled their horses apart and rode away from each other she very pale but erect with wounded pride he reeling in his saddle like a drunken man and so griffith gaunt stung mad by jealousy affronted his sweetheart the proudest girl in cumberland and yielding to his foible fled from his pain our foibles are our manias chapter iii miss peyton was shocked and grieved at bottom but she was also affronted and wounded now anger seems to have some fine buoyant quality which makes it rise and come uppermost in an agitated mind she rode proudly into the courtyard of her fathers house and would not look once behind to see the last of her perverse lover the old groom joe who had taught her to ride when she was six years old saw her coming and hobbled out to hold her horse while she alighted mistress kate said he have you seen master griffith gaunt anywheres the young lady colored at this question why said she why repeated old joe a little contemptuously why where have you been not to know the country is out after un first comed jock dennet with his horse all in a lather to say old mr charlton was took ill and had asked for master griffith i told him to go to dogmore copse our kate is a hunting today says i and your griffith he is sure not to be far from her geldings tail a stick in his spurs and away a goes what hant you seen jock neither no no replied miss peyton impatiently what is there anything the matter the matter quo she why jock hadnt been gone an hour when in rides the new footman all in a lather and brings a letter for master griffith from the old gentlemans housekeeper you leave the letter with me in case says i and i sends him a field after tother here be the letter he took off his cap and produced the letter catherine started at the sight of it alas said she this is a heavy day look joe sealed with black poor cousin charlton i doubt he is no more joe shook his head expressively and told her the butcher had come from that part not ten minutes ago with word that the blinds were all down at bolton hall poor human nature a gleam of joy shot through catherines heart this sad news would compel griffith to stay at home and bury his benefactor and that delay would give him time to reflect and somehow or other she felt sure it would end in his not going at all but these thoughts had no sooner passed through her than she was ashamed of them and of herself what welcome that poor old mans death because it would keep her crossgrained lover at home her cheeks burned with shame and with a superfluous exercise of selfdefense she retired from old joe lest he should divine what was passing in her mind but she was so rapt in thought that she carried the letter away with her unconsciously as she passed through the hall she heard george neville and her father in animated conversation she mounted the stairs softly and went into a little boudoir of her own on the first floor and sat down the house stood high and there was a very expansive and beautiful view of the country from this window she sat down by it and drooped and looked wistfully through the window and thought of the past and fell into a sad reverie pity began to soften her pride and anger and presently two gentle tears dimmed her glorious eyes a moment and then stole down her delicate cheeks while she sat thus lost in the past jovial voices and creaking boots broke suddenly upon her ear and came up the stairs they jarred upon her so she cast one last glance out of the window and rose to get out of their way if possible but it was too late a heavy step came to the door and a ruddy portdrinking face peeped in it was her father seeho roared the jovial squire ive found the hare on her form bide thou outside a moment and he entered the room but he had no sooner closed the door than his whole manner changed from loud and jovial to agitated and subdued kate my girl said he piteously i have been a bad father to thee i have spent all the money that should have been thine thy poor father can scarce look thee in the face so now i bring thee a good husband be a good child now and a dutiful nevilles court is his and nevilles cross will be by the entail and so will the baronetcy i shall see my girl lady neville never papa never cried kate hush hush said the squire and put up his hand to her in great agitation and alarm hush or he will hear ye kate he whispered are you mad little i thought when he asked to see me it was to offer marriage be a good girl now dont you quarrel with good luck you are not fit to be poor and you have made enemies do but think how they will flout you when i die and bills jade of a wife puts you to the door as she will and now you can triumph over them all my lady neville and make your poor father happy my lady neville enough said for i have promised you so dont go and make a fool of me and yourself into the bargain andanda word in your ear he has lent me a hundred pounds at this climax the father hung his head the daughter winced and moaned out papa how could you mr peyton had gradually descended to that intermediate stage of degradation when the substance of dignity is all gone but its shadow shame remains he stamped impatiently on the ground and cut his humiliation short by rushing out of the room here try your own luck youngster he cried at the door she knows my mind he trampled down the stairs and young george neville knocked respectfully at the door though it was half open and came in with youths light foot and a handsome face flushed into beauty by love and hope miss peytons eye just swept him as he entered and with the same movement she turned away her fair head and blushing cheek towards the window yet must i own it she quietly moulded the letter that lay in her lap so that the address was no longer visible to the newcomer small secrecy verging on deceit you are bred in womens bones this blushing and averted cheek is one of those equivocal receptions that have puzzled many a sensible man it is a sign of coy love it is a sign of gentle aversion our mode of interpreting it is simple and judicious whichever it happens to be we go and take it for the other the brisk bold wooer that now engaged kate peyton was not the man to be dashed by a womans coyness handsome daring goodhumored and vain he had everything in his favor but his novelty look at kate her eye lingers wistfully on that disconsolate horseman whose every step takes him farther from her but george has her ear and draws closer and closer to it and pours loves mellow murmurs into it he told her he had made the grand tour and seen the beauties of every land but none like her other ladies had certainly pleased his eye for a moment but she alone had conquered his heart he said many charming things to her such as griffith gaunt had never said amongst the rest he assured her the beauty of her person would not alone have fascinated him so deeply but he had seen the beauty of her mind in those eyes of hers that seemed not eyes but souls and begging her pardon for his presumption he aspired to wed her mind such ideas had often risen in kates own mind but to hear them from a man was new she looked askant through the window at the lessening griffith and thought how the grand tour improves a man and said as coldly as she could i esteem you sir and cannot but be flattered by sentiments so superior to those i am used to hear but let this go no further i shall never marry now instead of being angry at this or telling her she wanted to marry somebody else as the injudicious griffith had done young neville had the address to treat it as an excellent jest and drew such comical pictures of all the old maids in the neighborhood that she could not help smiling but the moment she smiled the inflammable george made hot love to her again then she besought him to leave her piteously then he said cheerfully he would leave her as soon as ever she had promised to be his at that she turned sullen and haughty and looked through the window and took no notice of him whatever then instead of being discouraged or mortified he showed imperturbable confidence and good humour and begged archly to know what interesting object was in sight from that window on this she blushed and withdrew her eyes from the window and so they met his on that he threw himself on his knees custom of the day and wooed her with such a burst of passionate and tearful eloquence that she began to pity him and said she lifting her lovely eyes alas i was born to make all those i esteem unhappy and she sighed deeply not a bit of it said he you were born like the sun to bless all you shine upon sweet mistress kate i love you as these country boors can never be taught to love i lay my heart my name my substance at your feet you shall not be lovedyou shall be worshipped ah turn those eyes brimful of soul on me again and let me try and read in them that one day no matter how distant the delight of my eyes the joy of all my senses the pride of cumberland the pearl of england the flower of womankind the rival of the angels the darling of george nevilles heart will be george nevilles wife fire and water were in his eyes passion in every tone his manly hand grasped hers and trembled and drew her gently towards him her bosom heaved his passionate male voice and manner electrified her and made her flutter spare me this pain she faltered and she looked through the window and thought poor griffith was right after all and i was wrong he had cause for jealousy and cause for fear and then she pitied him who panted at her side and then was sorry for him who rode away disconsolate still lessening to her eye and what with this conflict and the emotion her quarrel with griffith had already caused her she leaned her head back against the shutter and began to sob low but almost hysterically now mr george neville was neither a fool nor a novice if he had never been downright in love before which i crave permission to doubt he had gone far enough on that road to make one italian lady two french one austrian and one creole in love with him and each of these love affairs had given him fresh insight into the ways of women enlightened by so many bittersweet experiences he saw at once that there was something more going on inside kates heaving bosom than he could have caused by offering her his hand he rose from his knees and leaned against the opposite shutter and fixed his eyes a little sadly but very observantly on her as she leaned back against the shutter sobbing low but hysterically and quivering all over theres some other man at the bottom of this thought george neville mistress kate said he gently i do not come here to make you weep i love you like a gentleman if you love another take courage tell me so and dont let your father constrain your inclinations dearly as i love you i would not wed your person and your heart anothers that would be too cruel to you and drawing himself up with sudden majesty too unjust to myself kate looked up at him through her tears and admired this man who could love ardently yet be proud and just and if his appeal to her candor had been made yesterday she would have said frankly there is one iesteem but since the quarrel she would not own to herself far less to another that she loved a man who had turned his back upon her so she parried there is no one i love enough to wed said she i am a coldhearted girl born to give pain to my betters but i shall do something desperate to end all this all what said he keenly the whole thing my unprofitable life mistress kate said neville i asked you was there another man if you had answered me in truth there is but he is poor and my father is averse or the like then i would have stood his friend for your sake but you say there is no man you love then i say you shall be dame neville what whether i will or no yes whether you think you will or no catherine turned her dreamy eyes on him you have had a good master why did you not come to me sooner she was thinking more of him than of herself and in fact paying too little heed to her words but she had no sooner uttered this inadvertent speech than she felt she had said too much she blushed a rosy red and hid her face in her hands in the most charming confusion sweetest it is not an hour too late as you do not love another was stout george nevilles reply but nevertheless the cunning rogue thought it safest to temporize and put his coy mistress off her guard so he ceased to alarm her by pressing the question of marriage but seduced her into a charming talk where the topics were not so personal and only the tones of his voice and the glances of his expressive eyes were caressing he was on his mettle to please her by hook or by crook and was delightful irresistible he set her at ease and she began to listen more and even to smile faintly and to look through the window a little less perseveringly suddenly the spell was broken for a while and by whom by the other ay you may well stare it sounds strange but it is true that the poor forlorn horseman hanging like a broken man as he was over his tired horse and wending his solitary way from her he loved and resigning the field like a goose to the very rival he feared did yet like the retiring parthian shoot an arrow right into that pretty boudoir and hit both his sweetheart and his rival hit them hard enough to spoil their sport and make a little mischief between themfor that afternoon at all events the arrow came into the room after this fashion kate was sitting in a very feminine attitude when a man wants to look in any direction he turns his body and his eye the same way and does it but women love to cast oblique regards and this their instinct is a fruitful source of their graceful and characteristic postures kate peyton was at this moment a statue of her sex her fair head leaned gently back against the corner of the window shutter her pretty feet and fair person in general were opposite george neville who sat facing the window but in the middle of the room her arms half pendent half extended went listlessly aslant her and somewhat to the right of her knees yet by an exquisite turn of the neck her grey eyes contrived to be looking dreamily out of the window to her left still in this figure that pointed one way and looked another there was no distortion all was easy and full of that subtle grace we artists call repose but suddenly she dissolved this feminine attitude rose to her feet and interrupted her wooer civilly excuse me said she but can you tell me which way that road on the hill leads to her companion stared a little at so sudden a turn in the conversation but replied by asking her with perfect good humour what road she meant the one that gentleman on horseback has just taken surely she continued that road does not take to bolton hall certainly not said george following the direction of her finger bolton lies to the right that road takes to the seacoast by otterbury and stanhope i thought so said kate how unfortunate he cannot know but indeed how should he who cannot know and what you speak in riddles mistress and how pale you are are you ill no not ill sir faltered kate but you see me much discomposed my cousin charlton died this day and the news met me at the very door she could say no more mr neville on hearing this news began to make many excuses for having inadvertently intruded himself upon her on such a day but in the midst of his apologies she suddenly looked him full in the face and said with nervous abruptness you talk like a preux chevalier i wonder whether you would ride five or six miles to do me a service ay a thousand said the young man glowing with pleasure what is to do kate pointed through the window you see that gentleman on horseback well i happen to know he is leaving the country he thinks that hethat ithat mr charlton has many years to live he must be told mr charlton is dead and his presence is required at bolton hall i should like somebody to gallop after him and give him this letter but my own horse is tired and i am tiredand to be frank there is a little coolness between the gentleman himself and me oh i wish him no ill but really i am not upon termsi do not feel complaisant enough to carry a letter after him yet i do feel that he must have it do not you think it would be malicious and unworthy in me to keep the news from him when i know it is so young neville smiled nay mistress why so many words give me your letter and i will soon overtake the gentleman he seems in no great hurry kate thanked him and made a polite apology for giving him so much trouble and handed him the letter when it came to that she held it out to him rather irresolutely but he took it promptly and bowed low after the fashion of the day she curtsied he marched off with alacrity she sat down again and put her head in her hand to think it all over and a chill thought ran through her was her conduct wise what would griffith think at her employing his rival would he not infer neville had entered her service in more senses than one perhaps he would throw the letter down in a rage and never read it steps came rapidly the door opened and there was george neville again but not the same george neville that went out but thirty seconds before he stood at the door looking very black and with a sardonic smile on his lips an excellent jest mistress said he ironically why what is the matter said the lady stoutly but her red cheeks belied her assumption of innocence oh not much said george with a bitter sneer it is an old story only i thought you were nobler than the rest of your sex this letter is to mr griffith gaunt well sir said kate with a face of serene and candid innocence and mr griffith gaunt is a suitor of yours say was he is so no longer he and i are out but for that think you i had even listened towhat you have been saying to me this ever so long oh that alters the case said george but stay and he knitted his brows and reflected up to a moment ago the loftiness of catherine peytons demeanor and the celestial something in her soullike dreamy eyes had convinced him she was a creature free from the small dishonesty and duplicity he had noted in so many women otherwise amiable and good but this business of the letter had shaken the illusion stay said he stiffly you say mr gaunt and you are out catherine assented by a movement of her fair head and he is leaving the country perhaps this letter is to keep him from leaving the country only until he has buried his benefactor murmured kate in deprecating accents george wore a bitter sneer at this mistress kate said he after a significant pause do you read molire she bridled a little and would not reply she knew molire quite well enough not to want his wit leveled at her head do you admire the character of climne no reply you do not how can you she was too much your inferior she never sent one of her lovers with a letter to the other to stop his flight well you may eclipse climne but permit me to remind you that i am george neville and not georges dandin miss peyton rose from her seat with eyes that literally flashed fire and the horrible truth must be told her first wild impulse was to reply to all this molire with one cut of her little ridingwhip but she had a swift mind and two reflections entered it together first that this would be unlike a gentlewoman secondly that if she whipped mr neville however slightly he would not lend her his piebald horse so she took stronger measures she just sank down again and faltered i do not understand these bitter words i have no lover at all i never will have one again but it is hard to think i cannot make a friend nor keep a friend and so lifted up her hands and began to cry piteously then the stout george was taken aback and made to think himself a ruffian nay do not weep so mistress kate said he hurriedly come take courage i am not jealous of mr gaunt a man that hath been two years dangling after you and could not win you i look but to my own selfrespect in the matter i know your sex better than you know yourselves were i to carry that letter you would thank me now but by and by despise me now as i mean you to be my wife i will not risk your contempt why not take my horse put who you like on him and so convey the letter to mr gaunt now this was all the fair mourner wanted so she said no no she would not be beholden to him for anything he had spoken harshly to her and misjudged her cruelly cruelly oh oh oh then he implored her to grant him this small favor then she cleared up and said well sooner than bear malice she would he thanked her for granting him that favor she went off with the letter saying i will be back anon but once she got clear she opened the door again and peeped in at him gaily and said she why not ask me who wrote the letter before you compared me to that french coquette and with this made him an arch curtsy and tripped away mr george neville opened his eyes with astonishment this arch question and kates manner of putting it convinced him the obnoxious missive was not a loveletter at all he was sorry now and vexed with himself for having called her a coquette and made her cry after all what was the mighty favor she had asked of him to carry a sealed letter from somebody or other to a person who to be sure had been her lover but was so no longer a simple act of charity and civility and he had refused it in injurious terms he was glad he had lent his horse and almost sorry he had not taken the letter himself to these chivalrous selfreproaches succeeded an uneasy feeling that perhaps the lady might retaliate somehow it struck him on reflection that the arch query she had let fly at him was accompanied with a certain sparkle of the laughing eye such as ere now had in his experience preceded a stroke of the feminine claw as he walked up and down uneasy awaiting the fair ones return her father came up and asked him to dine and sleep what made the invitation more welcome was that it in reality came from kate she tells me she has borrowed your horse said the squire so says she i am bound to take care of you till daylight and indeed our ways are perilous at night she is an angel cried the lover all his ardor revived by this unexpected trait my horse my house my hand and my heart are all at her service by night and day mr peyton to wile away the time before dinner invited him to walk out and seea hog deadly fat as times went but neville denied himself that satisfaction on the plea that he had his orders to await miss peytons return where he was the squire was amused at his excessive docility and winked as much as to say i have been once upon a time in your plight and so went and gloried in his hog alone the lover fell into a delicious reverie he enjoyed by anticipation the novel pleasure of an evening passed all alone with this charming girl the father being friendly to his suit would go to sleep after dinner and then by the subdued light of a woodfire he would murmur his love into that sweet ear for hours until the averted head should come round by degrees and the delicious lips yield a coy assent he resolved the night should not close till he had surprised overpowered and secured his lovely bride these soft meditations reconciled him for awhile to the prolonged absence of their object in the midst of them he happened to glance through the window and he saw a sight that took his very breath away and rooted him in amazement to the spot about a mile from the house a lady in a scarlet habit was galloping across country as the crow flies hedge ditch or brook nothing stopped her an instant and as for the pace she seemed in running to devour the way it was kate peyton on his piebald horse chapter iv griffith gaunt unknown to himself had lost temper as well as heart before he took the desperate step of leaving the country now his temper was naturally good and ere he had ridden two miles he recovered it to his cost for the sustaining force of anger being gone he was alone with his grief he drew the rein half mechanically and from a spirited canter declined to a walk and the slower he went the chillier grew his heart till it lay half ice half load in his bosom parted oh word pregnant with misery never to see those heavenly eyes again nor hear that silvery voice never again to watch that peerless form walk the minuet nor see it lift the grey horse over a fence with the grace and spirit that seemed inseparable from it desolation streamed over him at the thought and next his forlorn mind began to cling even to the inanimate objects that were dotted about the place which held her he passed a little farmhouse into which kate and he had once been driven by a storm and had sat together by the kitchen fire and the farmers wife had smiled on them for sweethearts and made them drink rum and milk and stay till the sun was fairly out ah goodbye little farm he sighed when shall i ever see you again he passed a brook where they had often stopped together and given their panting horses just a mouthful after a run with the harriers goodbye little brook said he you will ripple on as before and warble as you go but i shall never drink at your water more nor hear your pleasant murmur with her i love he sighed and crept away still making for the sea in the icy depression of his heart his body and his senses were half paralysed and none would have known the accomplished huntsman in this broken man who hung anyhow over his mares neck and went to and fro in the saddle when he had gone about five miles he came to the crest of a hill he remembered that once past that brow he could see peyton hall no more he turned slowly and cast a sorrowful look at it it was winter but the afternoon sun had come out bright the horizontal beams struck full upon the house and all the western panes shone like burnished gold her very abode how glorious it looked and he was to see it no more he gazed and gazed at the bright house till love and sorrow dimmed his eyes and he could see the beloved place no more then his dogged will prevailed and carried him away towards the sea but crying like a woman now and hanging all dislocated over his horses mane now about a mile farther on as he crept along on a vile and narrow road all woebegone and broken he heard a mighty scurry of horses feet in the field to his left he looked languidly up and the first thing he saw was a great piebald horses head and neck in the act of rising in the air and doubling his forelegs under him to leap the low hedge a yard or two in front of him he did leap and landed just in front of griffith his rider curbed him so keenly that he went back almost on his haunches and then stood motionless all across the road with quivering tail a lady in a scarlet ridinghabit and purple cap sat him as if he had been a throne instead of a horse and without moving her body turned her head swift as a snake and fixed her great grey eyes full and searching on griffith gaunt he uttered a little shout of joy and amazement his mare reared and plunged and then was quiet and thus kate peyton and he metat right anglesand so close that it looked as if she had meant to ride him down how he stared at her how more than mortal fair she shone returning to those bereaved eyes of his as if she had really dropped from heaven his clasped hands his haggard face channelled by tears showed the keen girl she was strong where she had thought herself weak and she comported herself accordingly and in one moment took a much higher tone than she had intended as she came along i am afraid said she very coldly you will have to postpone your journey a day or two i am grieved to tell you that poor mr charlton is dead griffith uttered an exclamation he asked for you and messengers are out after you on every side you must go to bolton at once well a day said griffith has he left me too good kind old man on any other day i had found tears for thee but now methinks happy are the dead alas sweet mistress i hoped you came to tell me you hadi mightwhat signifies what i hopedwhen i saw you had deigned to ride after me why should i go to bolton after all because you will be an ungrateful wretch else what leave others to carry your kinsman and your benefactor to his grave while you turn your back on himand inherit his estatefor shame sir for shame griffith expostulated humbly how hardly you judge me what are bolton hall and park to me now they were to have been yours you know and yours they shall be i came between and robbed you to be sure the old man knew my mind he said to himself griffith or kate what matters it who has the land they will live together on it but all that is changed now you will never share it with me and so i do feel i have no right to the place kate my own kate i have heard them sneer at you for being poor and it made my heart ache ill stop that anyway go you in my place to the funeral he that is dead will forgive me his spirit knows now what i endure and ill send you a writing all sealed and signed shall make bolton hall and park yours and when you are happy with some one you can love as well as i love you think sometimes of poor jealous griffith that loved you dear and grudged you nothing but grinding his teeth and turning white i cant live in cumberland and see you in another mans arms then catherine trembled and could not speak awhile but at last she faltered out you will make me hate you god forbid said simple griffith well then dont thwart me and provoke me so but just turn your horses head and go quietly home to bolton hall and do your duty to the dead and the living you cant go this way for me and my horse then seeing him waver this virago faltered out and i have been so tried today first by one then by another surely you might have some pity on me oh oh oh oh nay nay cried griffith all in a flutter ill go without more words as i am a gentleman i will sleep at bolton this night and will do my duty to the dead and the living dont you cry sweetest i give in i find i have no will but yours the next moment they were cantering side by side and never drew rein till they reached the cross roads now tell me one thing stammered griffith with a most ghastly attempt at cheerful indifference howdo youhappen to beon george nevilles horse kate had been expecting this question for some time yet she colored high when it did come however she had her answer pat the horse was in the stableyard and fresh her own was tired what was i to do griffith and now added she hastily the sun will soon set and the roads are bad be careful i wish i could ask you to sleep at our house butthere are reasons she hesitated she could not well tell him george neville was to dine and sleep there griffith assured here there was no danger his mare knew every foot of the way they parted griffith rode to bolton and kate rode home it was past dinnertime she ran upstairs and hurried on her best gown and her diamond comb for she began to quake now at the prank she had played with her guests horse and nature taught her that the best way to soften censure isto be beautiful on pardonne tout aux belles and certainly she was passing fair and queenly with her diamond comb she came downstairs and was received by her father he grumbled at being kept waiting for dinner kate easily appeased the goodnatured squire and then asked what had become of mr neville oh he is gone long ago remembered all of a sudden he had promised to dine with a neighbor kate shook her head skeptically but said nothing but a good minute after she inquired how did he go on foot the squire did not know after dinner old joe sought an interview and was admitted into the diningroom be it all right about the grey horse master what of him asked kate he be gone to neville court mistress but i suppose with a horrid leer it is all right master neville told me all about it he said says he some do break a kine or the likes on those here joyful occasions other some do exchange gold rings your young mistress and me toe exchange nags she takes my pieball i take her grey says he saddle him for me joe says he and wish me joy so i clapped master nevilles saddle on the grey and a gave me a golden guinea a did and i was so struck of a heap i let un go without wishing on him joy but i hollered it arter un as hard as i could how you looks it be all right baint it squire peyton laughed heartily and said he concluded it was all right the piebald said he is rising five and ive had the grey ten years we have got the sunny side of that bargain joe he gave joe a glass of wine and sent him off inflated with having done a good stroke in horseflesh as for kate she was red as fire and kept her lips close as wax not a word could be got out of her the less she said the more she thought she was thoroughly vexed and sore perplexed how to get her grey horse back from such a man as george neville and yet she could not help laughing at the trick and secretly admiring this chevalier who had kept his mortification to himself and parried an affront so gallantly the goodhumored wretch said she to herself if griffith ever goes away again he will have me whether i like or no no lady could resist the monster long without some other man at hand to help her chapter v as when a camel drops in the desert vultures hitherto unseen come flying from the horizon so mr charlton had no sooner succumbed than the air darkened with undertakers flocking to bolton for a lugubrious job they rode up on black steeds they crunched the gravel in grave gigs and sent in blackedged cards to griffith and lowered their voices and bridled their briskness and tried hard poor souls to be sad and were horribly complacent beneath that thin japan of venal sympathy griffith selected his raven and then sat down to issue numerous invitations the idea of eschewing funereal pomp had not yet arisen a gentleman of that day liked his very remains to make a stir and did not see the fun of stealing into his grave like a rabbit slipping aground mr charlton had even left behind him a sealed letter containing a list of the persons he wished to follow him to the grave and attend the reading of his will these were thirtyfour and amongst them three known to fame viz george neville esq edward peyton esq and miss catherine peyton to all and each of the thirtyfour young gaunt wrote a formal letter inviting them to pay respect to their deceased friend and to honor himself by coming to bolton hall at nigh noon on saturday next these letters in compliance with another custom of the time and place were all sent by mounted messengers and the answers came on horseback too so there was much clattering of hoofs coming and going and much roasting baking drinking of ale and bustling all along of him who lay so still in an upper chamber and every man and woman came to mr gaunt to ask his will and advice however simple the matter and the servants turned very obsequious and laid themselves out to please the new master and retain their old places and what with the sense of authority and the occupation and growing ambition lovesick griffith grew another man and began to forget that two days ago he was leaving the country and going to give up the whole game he found time to send kate a loving letter but no talk of marriage in it he remembered she had asked him to give her time well he would take her advice it wanted just three days to the funeral when mr charltons own carriage long unused was found to be out of repair griffith had it sent to the nearest town and followed it on that and other business now it happened to be what the country folk called justicing day and who should ride into the yard of the roebuck but the new magistrate mr neville he alighted off a great bony grey horse before griffiths very nose and sauntered into a private room griffith looked and looked and scarcely able to believe his senses followed nevilles horse to the stable and examined him all round griffith was sore perplexed and stood at the stable door glaring at the horse and sick misgivings troubled him he forgot the business he came about and went and hung about the bar and tried to pick up a clue to this mystery the poor wretch put on a miserable assumption of indifference and asked one or two of the magistrates if that was not mr peytons grey horse young neville had ridden in upon now amongst these gentlemen was a young squire miss peyton had refused and galled him he had long owed gaunt a grudge for seeming to succeed where he had notably failed and now hearing him talk so much about the grey he smelt a rat he stepped into the parlor and told neville gaunt was fuming about the grey horse and questioning everybody neville though he put so bold a face on his recent adventure at peyton hall was secretly smarting and quite disposed to sting gaunt in return he saw a tool in this treacherous young squirehis name was galtonand used him accordingly galton thoroughly primed by neville slipped back and choosing his opportunity poisoned griffith gaunt and this is how he poisoned him oh said he neville has bought the grey nag and cost him dear it did griffith gave a sigh of relief for he at once concluded old peyton had sold his daughters very horse he resolved to buy her a better next week with mr charltons money but galton who was only playing with him went on to explain that neville had paid a double price for the nag he had given miss peyton his piebald horse in exchange and his troth into the bargain in short he lent the matter so adroit a turn that the exchange of horses seemed to be kates act as much as nevilles and the inference inevitable it is a falsehood gasped griffith nay said galton i had it on the best authority but you shall not quarrel with me about it the lady is nought to me and i but tell the tale as twas told to me then who told it you said gaunt sternly why it is all over the county for that matter no subterfuges sir i am the ladys servant and you know it this report it slanders her and insults me give me the author or ill lay my hunting whip on your bones two can play at that game said galton but he turned pale at the prospect of the pastime griffith strode towards him black with ire then galton stammered out it was neville himself told me ah said griffith i thought so he is a liar and a coward i would not advise you to tell him so said the other maliciously he has killed his man in france spitted him like a lark griffith replied by a smile of contempt where is the man said he after a pause how should i know asked galton innocently where did you leave him five minutes ago galton was dumbfoundered at this stroke and could find nothing to say and now as often happens the matter took a turn not in the least anticipated by the conspirators you must come with me sir if you please said griffith quietly and he took galtons arm oh with all my heart said the other but mr gaunt do not you take these idle reports to heart i never do what the devilwhere are you carrying me to for heavens sake let this foolish business go no farther for he found griffith was taking him to the very room where neville was griffith deigned no reply he just opened the door of the room in question and walked the talebearer into the presence of the talemaker george neville rose and confronted the pair with a vast appearance of civility but under it a sneer was just discernible the rivals measured each other from head to foot and then neville inquired to what he owed the honor of this visit griffith replied he tells me you told him miss peyton has exchanged horses with youoh you indiscreet person said george shaking his finger playfully at galtonand by the same token has plighted her troth to you worse and worse said george galton ill never trust you with any secrets again besides you exaggerate come sir said griffith sternly this ned galton was but your tool and your mouthpiece and therefore i bring him here to witness my reply to you mr george neville you are a liar and a scoundrel george neville bounded to his feet like a tiger ill have your life for those two words he cried then he suddenly governed himself by a great effort it is not for me to bandy foul terms with a cumberland savage said he name your time and place i will ned galton you may go i wish to say a few words in private to mr neville galton hesitated no violence gentlemen consider nonsense said neville mr gaunt and i are going to fight we are not going to brawl be so good as to leave us ay said griffith and if you repeat a word of all this woe be to your skin as soon as he was gone griffith gaunt turned very grave and calm and said to george neville the cumberland savage has been better taught than to expose the lady he loves to gossiping tongues neville colored up to the eyes at this thrust griffith continued the least you can do is to avoid fresh scandal i shall be happy to cooperate with you so far said neville stiffly i undertake to keep galton silent and for the rest we have only to name an early hour for meeting and confide it to but one discreet friend apiece who will attend us to the field then there will be no gossip and no bumpkins nor constables breaking insuch things have happened in this county i hear it was wednesday they settled to meet on friday at noon on a hillside between bolton and nevilles court the spot was exposed but so wild and unfrequented that no interruption was to be feared mr neville being a practiced swordsman gaunt chose pistols a weapon at which the combatants were supposed to be pretty equal to this neville very handsomely consented by this time a stiff and elaborate civility had taken the place of their heat and at parting they bowed both long and low to each other griffith left the inn and went into the street and as soon as he got there he began to realize what he had done and that in a day or two he might very probably be a dead man the first thing he did was to go with sorrowful face and heavy step to mr housemans office mr houseman was a highly respectable solicitor his late father and he had long enjoyed the confidence of the gentry and this enabled him to avoid litigious business and confine himself pretty much to the more agreeable and lucrative occupation of drawing wills settlements and conveyances and effecting loans sales and transfers he visited the landed proprietors and dined with them and was a great favorite in the county justicing day brought him many visits so on that day he was always at his place of business indeed a client was with him when griffith called and the young gentleman had to wait in the outer office for full ten minutes then a door opened and the client in question came out looking mortified and anxious it was squire peyton at sight of gaunt who had risen to take his vacant place kates father gave him a stiff nod and an unfriendly glance then hurried away griffith was hurt at his manner he knew very well mr peyton looked higher for his daughter than griffith gaunt but for all that the old gentleman had never shown him any personal dislike or incivility until this moment so griffith could not but fear that neville was somehow at the bottom of this and that the combination was very strong against him now in thus interpreting mr peytons manner he fell into a very common error and fruitful cause of misunderstanding we go and fancy that everybody is thinking of us but he is not he is like us he is thinking of himself well well thought griffith if i am not to have her what better place for me than the grave he entered mr housemans private room and opened his business at once but a singular concurrence of circumstances induced lawyer houseman to confide to a third party the substance of what passed between this young gentleman and himself so to avoid repetition the best way will be to let houseman tell this part of my tale instead of me and i only hope his communication when it comes may be half as interesting to my reader as it was to his hearer suffice it for me to say that lawyer and client were closeted a good hour and were still conversing together when a card was handed in to mr houseman that seemed to cause him both surprise and pleasure in five minutes said he to the clerk griffith took the hint and bade him goodbye directly as he went out the gentleman who had sent in his card rose from a seat in the outer office to go in it was mr george neville griffith gaunt and he saluted and scanned each other curiously they little thought to meet again so soon the clerks saw nothing more than two polite gentlemen passing each other the more griffith thought of the approaching duel the less he liked it he was an impulsive man for one thing and with such a cold fit naturally succeeds a hot one and besides as his heat abated reason and reflection made themselves heard and told him that in a contest with a formidable rival he was throwing away an advantage after all kate had shown him great favor she had ridden nevilles horse after him and made him resign his purpose of leaving her surely then she preferred him on the whole to neville yet he must go and risk his chance of possessing herupon a personal encounter in which neville was at least as likely to kill him as he to kill neville he saw too late that he was playing his rivals game he felt cold and despondent and more and more convinced that he should never marry kate but that she would very likely bury him with all this he was too game to recoil and indeed he hated his rival too deeply so like many a man before him he was going doggedly to the field against his judgment with little to win and all to lose his deeper and more solemn anxieties were diversified by a lighter one a few days ago he had invited half the county to bury mr charlton on saturday the nineteenth of february but now he had gone and fixed friday the eighteenth for a duel a fine thing if he should be himself a corpse on friday afternoon who was to receive the quests who conduct the funeral the man with all his faults had a grateful heart and mr charlton was his benefactor and he felt he had no right to go and get himself killed until he had paid the last rites to his best friend the difficulty admits of course of a comic view and smells hibernian but these things seem anything but droll to those whose lives and feelings are at stake and indeed there was something chivalrous and touching in griffiths vexation at the possibility of his benefactor being buried without due honors owing to his own intemperate haste to be killed he resolved to provide against that contingency so on the thursday he wrote an urgent letter to mr houseman telling him he must come early to the funeral and be prepared to conduct it this letter was carried to mr housemans office at three oclock on thursday afternoon mr houseman was not at home he was gone to a countryhouse nine miles distant but griffiths servant was well mounted and had peremptory orders so he rode after mr houseman and found him at mr peytons house whither if you please we too will follow him in the first place you must know that the real reason why mr peyton looked so savage coming out of mr housemans office was this neville had said no more about the hundred pounds and indeed had not visited the house since so peyton who had now begun to reckon on this sum went to houseman to borrow it but houseman politely declined to lend it him and gave excellent reasons all this was natural enough common enough but the real reason why houseman declined was a truly singular one the fact is catherine peyton had made him promise to refuse between that young lady and the housemans husband and wife there was a sincere friendship founded on mutual esteem and catherine could do almost what she liked with either of them now whatever might be her faults she was a proud girl and an intelligent one it mortified her pride to see her father borrowing here and borrowing there and unable to repay and she had also observed that he always celebrated a new loan by a new extravagance and so was never a penny the richer for borrowed money he had inadvertently let fall that he should apply to houseman she raised no open objection but just mounted piebald and rode off to houseman and made him solemnly promise not to lend her father a shilling houseman kept his word but his refusal cost him more pain than he had counted on when he made the promise squire peyton had paid him thousands first and last and when he left housemans room with disappointment mortification and humiliation deeply marked on his features usually so handsome and jolly the lawyer felt sorry and ashamedand did not show it but it rankled in him and the very next day he took advantage of a little business he had to do in mr peytons neighborhood and drove to peyton hall and asked for mistress kate his was a curious errand indeed i think it would not be easy to find a parallel to it for here was an attorney calling upon a beautiful girl to do what to soften her on a daughter to do what to persuade her to permit him to lend her father on insufficient security well he reminded her of his ancient obligations to her family and assured her he could well afford to risk a hundred or even a thousand pounds he then told her that her father had shown great pain at his refusal and that he himself was human and could not divest himself of gratitude and pity and good natureall for in a word said he i have brought the money and you must give in for this once and let me lend it him without more ado miss peyton was gratified and affected and a tear trembled a moment in her eye but went indoors again and left her firm as a rock sprinkled with dew she told him she could quite understand his feeling and thanked him for it but she had long and seriously weighed the matter and could not release him from his promise no more of this base borrowing said she and clenched her white teeth indomitably he attacked her with a good many weapons but she parried them all so gently yet so nobly and so successfully that he admired her more than ever still lawyers fight hard and die very hard houseman got warm in his cause and crossexamined this defendant and asked her whether she would refuse to lend her father out of a full purse this question was answered only by a flash of her glorious eyes and a magnificent look of disdain at the doubt implied well then said houseman be your fathers surety for repayment with interest at six per centum and then there will be nothing in the business to wound your dignity i have many hundreds out at six per centum excuse me that would be dishonest said kate i have no money to repay you with but you have expectations nay not i i beg your pardon methinks i should know sir what expectations have i and from whom houseman fidgeted on his seat and then with some hesitation replied well from two that i know of you are jesting methinks good mr houseman said she reproachfully nay dear mistress kate i wish you too well to jest on such a theme the lawyer then fidgeted again on his seat in silence sign of an inward struggle during which kates eye watched him with some curiosity at last his wavering balance inclined towards revealing something or other mistress kate said he my wife and i are both your faithful friends and humble admirers we often say you would grace a coronet and wish you were as rich as you are good and beautiful kate turned her lovely head away and gave him her hand that incongruous movement so full of womanly grace and feeling and the soft pressure of her white hand completed her victory and the remains of housemans reserve melted away yes my dear young lady said he warmly i have good news for you only mind not a living soul must ever know it from your lips why i am going to do for you what i never did in my life before going to tell you something that passed yesterday in my office but then i know you you are a young lady out of a thousand i can trust you to be discreet and silent can i not as the grave well then my young mistressin truth it was like a play though the scene was but a lawyers office was it cried kate then you set me all of a flutter you must sup here and sleep here nay nay said she her eyes sparkling with animation ill take no denial my father dines abroad we shall have the house to ourselves her interest was keenly excited but she was a true woman and must coquet with her very curiosity so she ran off to see with her own eyes that sheets were aired and a roasting fire lighted in the blue bedroom for her guest while she was away a servant brought in griffith gaunts letter and a sheet of paper had to be borrowed to answer it the answer was hardly written and sent out to griffiths servant when supper and the fair hostess came in almost together after supper fresh logs were heaped on the fire and the lawyer sat in a cosy armchair and took out his diary and several papers as methodically as if he was going to lay the case by counsel before a judge of assize kate sat opposite him with her grey eyes beaming on him all the time and searching for the hidden meaning of everything he told her during the recital which follows her color often came and went but those wonderful eyes never left the narrators face a moment they put the attorney on his mettle and he elaborated the matter more than i should have done he articulated his topics marked each salient fact by a long pause in short he told his story like an attorney and not like a romancist i cannot help that you know im not procrustes mr housemans little narrative wednesday the seventeenth day of february at about one of the clock called on me at my place of business mr griffith gaunt whom i need not hero describe inasmuch as his person and place of residence are well known to the courtwhat am i sayingi mean well known to yourself mistress kate the said griffith on entering my room seemed moved and i might say distempered and did not give himself time to salute me and receive my obeisance but addressed me abruptly and said as follows mr houseman i am come to make my will dear me said kate then blushed and was more on her guard i seated the young gentleman and then replied that his resolution aforesaid did him credit the young being as mortal as the old i said further that many disasters had happened in my experience owing to the obstinacy with which men in the days of their strength shut their eyes to the precarious tenure under which all sons of adam hold existence and so many a worthy gentleman dies in his sins and what is worse dies intestate but the said griffith interrupted me with some signs of impatience and asked me bluntly would i draw his will and have it executed on the spot i assented generally but i requested him by way of needful preliminary to obtain for me a copy of mr charltons will under which as i have always understood the said griffith inherits whatever real estate he hath to bequeath mr griffith gaunt then replied to me that mr charltons will was in london and the exact terms of it could not be known until after the funeral that is to say upon the nineteenth instant thereupon i explained to mr gaunt that i must see and know what properties were devised in the will aforesaid by the said charlton to gaunt aforesaid and how devised and described without this i said i could not correctly and sufficiently describe the same in the instrument i was now requested to prepare mr gaunt did not directly reply to this objection but he pondered a little while and then asked me if it were not possible for him by means of general terms to bequeath to a sole legatee whatever lands goods chattels etc mr charlton might hereafter prove to have devised to him the said griffith gaunt i admitted this was possible but objected that it was dangerous i let him know that in matters of law general terms are a fruitful source of dispute and i said i was one of those who hold it a duty to avert litigation from our clients thereupon mr gaunt drew out of his bosom a pocketbook the said pocketbook was shown to me by the said gaunt and i say it contained a paragraph from a newspaper which i believe to have been cut out of the said newspaper with a knife or a pair of scissors or some trenchant instrument and the said paragraph purported to contain an exact copy of a certain will and testament under which as is indeed matter of public notoriety one dame butcher hath inherited and now enjoys the lands goods and chattels of a certain merry parson late deceased in these parts and i believe little missed mr gaunt would have me read the will and testament aforesaid and i read it accordingly and inasmuch as bad things are best remembered the said will and testament did by its singularity and profaneness fix itself forthwith in my memory so that i can by no means dislodge it thence do what i may the said document to the best of my memory and belief runneth after this fashion i john raymond clerk at present residing at whitbeck in the county of cumberland being a man sound in body mind and judgment do deliver this as my last will and testament i give and bequeath all my real property and all my personal property and all the property whether real or personal i may hereafter possess or become entitled toto my housekeeper janet butcher and i appoint janet butcher my sole executrix and i make janet butcher my sole residuary legatee save and except that i leave my solemn curse to any knave who hereafter shall at any time pretend that he does not understand the meaning of this my will and testament catherine smiled a little at this last bequest mr gaunt then solemnly appealed to me as an honest man to tell him whether the aforesaid document was bad or good in law i was fain to admit that it was sufficient in law but i qualified and said i thought it might be attacked on the score of the hussys undue influence and the testators apparent insanity nevertheless i concluded candidly that neither objection would prevail in our courts owing to the sturdy prejudice in the breasts of english jurymen whose ground of faith it is that every man has a right to do what he will with his own and even to do it how he likes mr gaunt did speedily abuse this my candor he urged me to lose no time but to draw his will according to the form and precedent in that case made and provided by this mad parson and my clerks forsooth were to be the witnesses thereof i refused with some heat to sully my office by allowing such an instrument to issue therefrom and i asked the said gaunt in high dudgeon for what he took me mr gaunt then offered in reply two suggestions that shook me imprimis he told me the person to whom he now desired to leave his all was mistress catherine peyton an ejaculation from kate secundo he said he would go straight from me to that coxcomb harrison were i to refuse to serve him in the matter on this having regard to your interest and my own i temporized i offered to let him draw a will after his parsons precedent and i agreed it should be witnessed in my office only i stipulated that next week a proper document should be drawn by myself with due particulars on two sheets of paper and afterwards engrossed and witnessed and to this mr gaunt assented and immediately drew his will according to newspaper precedent but when i came to examine his masterpiece i found he had taken advantage of my pliability to attach an unreasonable condition to wit that the said catherine should forfeit all interest under this will in case she should ever marry a certain party therein nominated specified and described now that was griffith all over cried catherine merrily i objected stoutly to this i took leave to remind the young gentleman that when a christian man makes his last will and testament he should think of the grave and of the place beyond whither we may carry our affections but must leave the bundle of our hates behind the gate being narrow i even went so far as to doubt whether such a proviso could stand in law and i also put a practical query what was to hinder the legatee from selling the property and diverting the funds and then marrying whom she liked mr gaunt was deaf to reason he bade me remember that he was neither saint nor apostle but a poor gentleman of cumberland who saw a stranger come between him and his lover dear with that he was much moved and did not conclude his argument at all but broke off and was fain to hide his face with both hands awhile in truth this touched me and i looked another way and began to ask myself why should i interfere who after all know not your heart in the matter and to be brief i withstood him and parsons law no more but sent his draft will to the clerks the which they copied fair in a trice and the duplicates were signed and witnessed in red hot haste as most of mens follies are done for that matter the paper writing now produced and shown to metush what am i sayingi mean the paper writing i now produce and show to you is the draft of the will aforesaid in the handwriting of the testator and with this he handed kate peyton griffith gaunts will and took a long and satirical pinch of snuff while she examined it miss peyton took the will in her white hands and read it but in reading it she held it up and turned it so that her friend could not see her face while she read it but only her white hands in which the document rustled a little it ran thus i griffith gaunt late of the eyrie and now residing at bolton hall in the county of cumberland being sound in body and mind do deliver this as my last will and testament i give and bequeath all the property real or personal which i now possess or may hereafter become entitled to to my dear friend and mistress catherine peyton daughter of edward peyton esquire of peyton hall provided always that the said catherine peyton shall at no time within the next ten years marry george neville of nevilles court in this county but should the said catherine marry the said george within ten years of this day then i leave all my said property in possession remainder or reversion to my heiratlaw the fair legatee read this extraordinary testament more than once at last she handed it back to mr houseman without a word but her cheek was red and her eyes glistening mr houseman was surprised at her silence and as he was curious to know her heart he sounded her asked her what she thought of that part of his story but she evaded him with all the tact of her sex what that is not all then said she quickly houseman replied that it was barely half then tell me all pray tell me all said kate earnestly i am here to that end said houseman and recommenced his narrative the business being done to mr gaunts satisfaction though not to mine we fell into some friendly talk but in the midst of it my clerk thomas brought me in the card of a gentleman whom i was very desirous to secure as a client mr gaunt i think read my mind for he took leave of me forthwith i attended him to the door and then welcomed the gentleman aforesaid it was no other than mr george neville mr neville after such gracious civilities as his native breeding and foreign travel have taught him came to business and requested meto draw his will la said kate i was a little startled but hid it and took his instructions this done i requested to see the titledeeds of his estates with a view to describing them and he went himself to the bankers for them and placed them in my hands i then promised to have the will ready in a week or ten days but mr neville with many polite regrets for hurrying me told me upon his honor he could give me but twentyfour hours after that said he it might be too late ah said miss peyton determined to retain my new client i set my clerks to work and this very day was engrossed signed and witnessed the last will and testament of george neville esquire of nevilles court in the county of cumberland and leicester square london where he hath a noble mansion now as to the general disposition of his lands manorial rights messuages tenements goods chattels etc and his special legacies to divers ladies and gentlemen and domestic servants these i will not reveal even to you the paper i now produce is a copy of that particular bequest which i have decided to communicate to you in strict and sacred confidence and he handed her an extract from george nevilles will miss peyton then read what follows and i give and bequeath to mistress catherine peyton of peyton hall in the said county of cumberland in token of my respect and regard all that my freehold estate called moulton grange with the messuage or tenement standing and being thereon and the farmyard buildings and appurtenances belonging thereto containing by estimation three hundred and seventysix acres three roods and five perches be the same little more or less to hold to her the said catherine peyton her heirs and assigns for ever the legatee laid down the paper and leaned her head softly on her fair hand and her eyes explored vacancy what means all this said she aloud but to herself mr houseman undertook the office of interpreter means why that he has left you one of the snuggest estates in the county tis not quite so large as bolton but lies sunnier and the land richer well mistress was i right are you not good for a thousand pounds kate still manifestly thinking of something else let fall as it were out of her mouth that mr gaunt and mr neville were both men in the flower of their youth and how was she the richer for their folly why said houseman you will not have to wait for the death of these testatorsheaven forbidbut what does all this making of wills show me that both these gentlemen are deep in love with you and you can pick and choose i say you can wed with bolton hall or nevilles court tomorrow so prithee let the squire have his hundred pounds and do you repay me at your leisure miss peyton made no reply but leaned her exquisite head upon her hand and pondered she did not knit her brows nor labour visibly at the mental oar yet a certain reposeful gravity and a fixity of the thoughtful eye showed she was applying all the powers of her mind mr houseman was not surprised at that his own wife had but little intellect yet had he seen her weigh two rival bonnets in mortal silence and with all the seeming profundity of a judge on the bench and now this young lady was doubtless weighing farms with similar gravity care and intelligence but as this continued and still she did not communicate her decision he asked her pointblank which of the two she settled to wed nevilles court or bolton grange thus appealed to miss peyton turned her great eye on him without really looking at him and repliedyou have made me very uneasy he stared she relapsed into thought a moment and then turning to houseman asked him how he accounted for those two gentlemen making their wills they were very young to make their wills all of a sudden why said houseman mr neville is a man of sense and every man of sense makes his will and as for mr gaunt he has just come into prospect of an estate thats why all but why could not griffith wait till after the funeral oh clients are always in a hurry so you see nothing in it nothing alarming i mean nothing very alarming two landed proprietors in love with you that is all but dear mr houseman that is what makes me uneasy at this rate they must look on one another asasrivals and you know rivals are sometimes enemies oh i see now said houseman you apprehend a quarrel between the gentlemen of course there is no love lost between them but they met in my office and saluted each other with perfect civility i saw them with my own eyes indeed i am glad to hear that very glad i hope it was only a coincidence then their both making their wills nothing more you may depend neither of them knows from me what the other has done nor ever will that is true said kate and seemed considerably relieved to ease her mind entirely houseman went on to say that as to the report that high words had passed between the clients in question at the roebuck he had no doubt it was exaggerated besides said he that was not about a lady im told it was about a horse some bet belike catherine uttered a faint cry about a horse said she not about a grey horse nay that is more than i know high words about a horse said catherine and they are making their wills oh my mind misgave me from the first and she turned pale presently she clasped her hands togethermr houseman she cried what shall i do what do you not see that both their lives are in danger and that is why they make their wills and how should both their lives be in danger but from each other madmen they have quarreled they are going to fight fight to the death and i fear it is about me me who love neither of them you know in that case let them fight said her legal adviser dispassionately whichever fool gets killed you will be none the poorer and the dog wore a sober complacency catherine turned her large eyes on him with horror and amazement but said nothing as for the lawyer he was more struck with her sagacity than with anything he somewhat overrated it not being aware of the private reasons she had for suspecting that her two testators were enemies to the death i almost think you are right said he for i got a curious missive from mr gaunt scarce an hour agone and he sayslet me see what he says nay let me see said kate on that he handed her griffiths note it ran thus it is possible i may not be able to conduct the funeral should this be so i appoint you to act for me so then good mr houseman let me count on you to be here at nine of the clock for heavens sake fail me not your humble servant g g this left no doubt in kates mind now first of all said she what answer made you to this what answer should i make i pledged my word to be at bolton at nine of the clock oh blind sighed kate and i must be out of the room what shall i do my dear friend forgive me i am a wretched girl i am to blame i ought to have dismissed them both or else decided between them but who would have thought it would go this length i did not think griffith was brave enough have pity on me and help me stop this fearful fighting and now the young creature clung to the man of business and prayed and prayed him earnestly to avert bloodshed mr houseman was staggered by this passionate appeal from one who so rarely lost her selfcommand he soothed her as well as he could and said he would do his best but added which was very true that he thought her interference would be more effective than his own what care these young bloods for an old attorney i should fare ill came i between their rapiers to be sure i might bind them over to keep the peace but mistress kate now be frank with me then i can serve you better you love one of these two that is clear which is the man that i may know what i am about for all her agitation kate was on her guard in some things nay she faltered i love neither not to say love them but i pity him so which both ay mistress but which do you pity most asked the shrewd lawyer whichever shall come to harm for my sake replied the simple girl you could not go to them tonight and bring them to reason asked she piteously she went to the window to see what sort of a night it was she drew the heavy crimson curtains and opened the window in rushed a bitter blast laden with flying snow the window ledges too were clogged with snow and all the ground was white houseman shuddered and drew nearer to the blazing logs kate closed the window with a groan it is not to be thought of said she at your age and not a road to be seen for snow what shall i do wait till tomorrow said mr houseman procrastination was his daily work being an attorney tomorrow cried catherine perhaps even now they have met and he lies a corpse who whichever it is i shall end my days in a convent praying for his soul she wrung her hands while she said this and still there was no catching her little did the lawyer think to rouse such a storm with his good news and now he made a feeble and vain attempt to soothe her and ended by promising to start the first thing in the morning and get both her testators bound over to keep the peace by noon with this resolution he went to bed early she was glad to be alone at all events now mind you there were plenty of vain and vulgar yet respectable girls in cumberland who would have been delighted to be fought about even though bloodshed were to be the result but this young lady was not vain but proud she was sensitive too and troubled with a conscience it reproached her bitterly it told her she had permitted the addresses of two gentlemen and so mischief had somehow arisenout of her levity now her life had been uneventful and innocent this was the very first time she had been connected with anything like a crime and her remorse was great so was her grief but her fears were greater still the terrible look griffith had cast at his rival flashed back on her so did his sinister words she felt that if he and neville met nothing less than nevilles death or his own would separate them suppose that even now one of them lay a corpse cold and ghastly as the snow that now covered natures face the agitation of her mind was such that her body could not be still now she walked the room in violent distress wringing her hands now she kneeled and prayed fervently for both those lives she had endangered often she flew to the window and looked eagerly out writhing and rebelling against the network of female custom that entangled her and would not let her fly out of her cage even to do a good action to avert a catastrophe by her prayers or her tears or her good sense and all ended in her realizing that she was a woman a poor impotent being born to lie quiet and let things go at that she wept helplessly so wore away the first night of agony this young creature ever knew towards morning exhausted by her inward struggles she fell asleep upon a sofa but her trouble followed her she dreamed she was on a horse hurried along with prodigious rapidity in a darkened atmosphere a sort of dry fog she knew somehow she was being taken to see some awful mysterious thing byandby the haze cleared and she came out upon pleasant open sunny fields that almost dazzled her she passed gates and hedges too all clear distinct and individual presently a voice by her side said this way and her horse seemed to turn of his own accord through a gap and in one moment she came on a group of gentlemen it was griffith gaunt and two strangers then she spoke and said but mr neville no answer was made her but the group opened in solemn silence and there lay george neville on the snow stark and stiff with blood issuing from his temple and trickling along the snow she saw distinctly all his wellknown features but they were pinched and sharpened now and his dark olive skin was turned to bluish white it was his corpse and now her horse thrust out his nose and snorted like a demon she looked down and ah the blood was running at her prematurely fast along the snow she screamed her horse reared high and she was falling on the bloodstained snow she awoke screaming and the sunlight seemed to rush in at the window her joy that it was only a dream overpowered every other feeling at first she kneeled and thanked god for that the next thing was she thought it might be a revelation of what had actually occurred but this chilling fear did not affect her long nothing could shake her conviction that a duel was on footand indeed the intelligent of her sex do sometimes put this and that together and spring to a just but obvious inference in a way that looks to a slower and safer reasoner like divinationbut then she knew that yesterday evening both parties were alive coupling this with griffiths broad hint that after the funeral might be too late to make his will she felt sure that it was this very day the combatants were to meet yes and this very morning for she knew that gentlemen always fought in the morning if her dream was false as to the past it might be true as to what was at hand was it not a supernatural warning sent to her in mercy the history of her church abounded in such dreams and visions and indeed the time and place she lived in were rife with stories of the kind one in particular of recent date this thought took hold of her and grew on her till it overpowered even the diffidence of her sex and then up started her individual character and now nothing could hold her for languid and dreamy in the common things of life this catherine peyton was one of those who rise into rare ardor and activity in such great crises as seem to benumb the habitually brisk and they turn tame and passive she had seen at a glance that houseman was too slow and apathetic for such an emergency she resolved to act herself she washed her face and neck and arms and hands in cold water and was refreshed and invigorated she put on her riding habit and her little gold spur griffith gaunt had given it her and hurried into the stableyard old joe and his boy had gone away to breakfast he lived in the village this was unlucky catherine must wait his return and lose time or else saddle the horse herself she chose the latter the piebald was a good horse but a fidgety one so she saddled and bridled him at his stall she then led him out to the stone steps in the stableyard and tried to mount him but he sidled away she had nobody to square him and she could get nothing to mount but his head she coaxed him she tickled him on the other side with her whip it was all in vain it was absurd but heartsickening she stared at him with wonder that he could be so cruel as to play the fool when every minute might be life or death she spoke to him she implored him piteously she patted him all was in vain as a last resource she walked him back to the stable and gave him a sieveful of oats and set it down by the corn bin for him and took an opportunity to mount the bin softly he ate the oats but with retroverted eye watched her she kept quiet and affected nonchalance till he became less cautious then suddenly sprang on him and taught him to set his wit against a womans my lord wheeled round directly ere she could get her leg over the pommel and made for the stable door she lowered her head to his mane and just scraped out without injury not an inch to spare he set off at once but luckily for her she had often ridden a barebacked horse she sat him for the first few yards by balance then reined him in quietly and soon whipped her left foot into the stirrup and her right leg over the pommel and then the piebald nag had to pay for his pranks the roads were clogged with snow but she fanned him along without mercy and never drew bridle till she pulled him up drenched and steaming like a washtub at netley crossroads here she halted irresolute the road to the right led to bolton distant two miles and a half the road in front led to nevilles court distant three miles which should she take she had asked herself this a dozen times upon the road yet could never decide until she got to the place and must the question was with which of them had she most influence she hardly knew but griffith gaunt was her old sweetheart it seemed somewhat less strange and indelicate to go to him than to the new one so she turned her horses head towards bolton but she no longer went quite so fast as she had gone before she felt going to either in particular such is the female mind she reached bolton at halfpast eleven and now she was there put a bold face on it rode up to the door and leaning forward on her horse rang the hall bell a footman came to the door with composed visage though beating heart she told him she desired to speak for a moment to mr griffith gaunt he asked her would she be pleased to alight and it was clear by his manner no calamity had yet fallen no no said kate let me speak to him here the servant went in to tell his master kate sat quiet with her heart still beating but glowing now with joy she was in time then thanks to her good horse she patted him and made the prettiest excuses aloud to him for riding him so hard through the snow the footman came back to say that mr gaunt had gone out gone out whither on horseback the footman did not know but would ask within while he was gone to inquire catherine lost patience and rode into the stableyard and asked a young lout who was lounging there whether his master was gone out on horseback the lounging youth took the trouble to call out the groom and asked him the groom said no and that mr gaunt was somewhere about the grounds he thought but in the midst of this colloquy one of the maids curious to see the lady came out by the kitchen door and curtsied to kate and told her mr gaunt was gone out walking with two other gentlemen in the midst of her discourse she recognized the visitor and having somehow imbibed the notion that miss peyton was likely to be mrs gaunt and govern bolton hall decided to curry favor with her so she called her my lady and was very communicative she said one of the gentlemen was strange to her but the other was doctor islip from stanhope town she knew him well he had taken off her own brothers leg in a jiffy but dear heart mistress said she how pale you be do come in and have a morsel of meat and a horn of ale nay my good girl said kate i could not eat but bring me a mug of new milk if you will i have not broken my fast this day the maid bustled in and catherine asked the groom if there were no means of knowing where mr gaunt was the groom and the boy scratched their heads and looked puzzled the lounging lout looked at their perplexity and grinned satirically this youth was tom leicester born in wedlock and therefore in the laws eye son of old simon leicester but gossips said his true father was the late captain gaunt tom ran with the hounds for his own sport went out shooting with gentlemen and belabored the briars for them at twopence per day and his dinner and abhorred all that sober men call work by trade a beater profession a scamp two maids came out together now one with the milk and a roll the other with a letter catherine drank the milk but could not eat then says the other maid if so be you are mistress peyton why this letter is for you master left it on his table in his bedroom kate took the letter and opened it all in a flutter it ran thus sweet mistresswhen this reaches you i shall be no more here to trouble you with my jealousy this neville set it abroad that you had changed horses with him as much as to say you had plighted troth with him he is a liar and i told him so to his teeth we are to meet at noon this day and one must die methinks i shall be the one but come what may i have taken care of thee ask jack houseman else but oh dear kate think of all that hath passed between us and do not wed this neville or i could not rest in my grave sweetheart many a letter have i written thee but none so sad as this let the grave hide my faults from thy memory think only that i loved thee well i leave thee my substance would it were ten times more and the last thought of my heart so no more in this world from him that is thy true lover and humble servant till death griffith gaunt there seems to be room in the mind for only one violent emotion at one instant of time this touching letter did not just then draw a tear from her who now received it some hours sooner than the writer intended its first effect was to paralyze her she sat white and trembling and her great eyes filled with horror then she began to scream wildly for help the men and women came round her murder murder she shrieked tell me where to find him ye wretches or may his blood be on your heads the scamp bounded from his lounging position and stood before her straight as an arrow follow me he shouted her grey eyes and the scamps black ones flashed into one another directly he dashed out of the yard without another word and she spurred her horse and clattered out after him he ran as fast as her horse could canter and soon took her all round the house and while he ran his black gipsy eyes were glancing in every direction when they got to the lawn at the back of the house he halted a moment and said quietly here they be he pointed to some enormous footsteps in the snow and bade her notice that they commenced at a certain glass door belonging to the house and that they all pointed outwards the lawn was covered with such marks but the scamp followed those his intelligence had selected and they took him through a gate and down a long walk and into the park here no other feet had trodden that morning except those tom leicester was following this is our game said he see there be six footsteps and now i look this here track is squire gaunts i know his foot in the snow among a hundred bless your heart ive often been out shooting with squire gaunt and lost him in the woods and found him again by tracking him on dead leaves let alone snow i say wasnt they useless idiots couldnt tell ye how to run into a man and snow on the ground why you can track a hare to her form and a rat to his holelet alone such big game as this with a hoof like a fryingpanin the snow oh do not talk let us make haste panted kate canter away replied the scamp she cantered on and he ran by her side shall i not tire you said she the mauvais sujet laughed at her tire me not over this ground why i run with the hounds and mostly always in at the death but that is not altogether speed ye see i know pugs mind what dont you know me im tom leicester why i know you i say youre a goodhearted one you are oh no no sighed kate nay but you are said tom i saw you take harrowden brook that day when the rest turned tail and that is what i call having a good heart gently mistress here this is full of rabbit holes i seen sir ralphs sorrel mare break her leg in a moment in one of these shot her dead that afternoon a did and then billed her for the hounds shed often followed at their tails next hunting day she ran inside their bellies ha ha ha oh dont laugh i am in agony why what is up mistress asked the young savage lowering his voice murder says you but that means nought the lasses they cry murder if you do but kiss em oh tom leicester it is murder its a duel a fight to the death unless we are in time to prevent them a jewel cried master leicester his eyes glittering with delight i never saw a jewel dont you hold him in for me mistress gallop down this slope as hard as you can pelt it is grass under foot and ye cant lose the tracks and i shall be sure to catch ye in the next field the young savage was now as anxious to be in at the death as kate was to save life as he spoke he gave her horse a whack on the quarter with his stick and away she went full gallop and soon put a hundred yards between her and tom the next field was a deep fallow and the hard furrows reduced her to a trot and before she got out of it tom was by her side didnt i tell you said he id run you to peyton hall for a pot o beer oh you good brave clever boy said kate how fortunate i am to have you i think we shall be in time tom was flattered why you see i am none of daddy leicesters breed said he im a gentlemans byblow if you know what that is i cant say i do said kate but i know you are very bold and handsome and swift of foot and i know my patron saint has sent you to me in my misery and oh my lad if we are in timewhat can i do for youare you fond of money tom that i be when i can get it then you shall have all i have got in the world if you get me there in time to hinder mischief come on shouted tom excited in his turn and took the lead and not a word more passed till they came to the foot of a long hill then said tom once we are at top of this they cant fight without our seeing em that is scutchemsee nob you can see ten miles all round from there at this information kate uttered an ejaculation and urged her horse forward the first part of this hill which stood between her and those whoso tracks she followed was grass then came a strip of turnips then on the bleak top a broad piece of heather she soon cantered over the grass and left tom so far behind he could not quite catch her in the turnips she entered the heather but here she was much retarded by the snow drifts and the ups and downs of the rough place but she struggled on bravely still leading she fixed her eyes earnestly on the ridge whence she could cry to the combatants however distant and stop the combat now as she straggled on and tom came after panting a little for the first time suddenly there rose from the crest of the hill two columns of smoke and the next moment two sharp reports rang through the frosty air kate stopped and looked round to tom with a scared inquiring air pistols yelled tom behind her at that the woman overpowered the heroine and kate hid her face and fell to trembling and wailing her wearied horse came down to a walk presently up comes tom dont lose your stomach for that he panted out gentlefolks do pop at one another all day sometimes and no harm done oh bless you cried kate i may yet be in time she spurred her horse on he did his best but ere he had gone twenty yards he plunged into a cavity hidden by the snow while he was floundering there crack went a single pistol and the smoke rose and drifted over the hill top whoop muttered tom with horrible sangfroid theres one done for this time couldnt shoot back ye see at this horrible explanation kate sank forward on her horses mane as if she herself had been killed and the smoke from the pistol came floating thinner and thinner and eddied high over her head tom spoke rude words of encouragement to her she did not even seem to hear them then he lost all patience at her and clutched her arm to make her hear him but at that it seemed as if some of his nature passed into her down his arm for she turned wild directly and urged her horse fiercely up the crest her progress was slow at first but the sun had melted the snow on the nob or extreme summit she tore her way through the last of the snow on to the clear piece then white as ashes spurred and lashed her horse over the ridge and dashed in amongst them on the other side for there they were what was the sight that met her eyes that belongs to the male branch of my story and shall be told forthwith but in its proper sequence chapter vi the two combatants came to the field in a very different spirit neville had already fought two duels and been successful in both he had confidence in his skill and in his luck his conscience too was tolerably clear for he was the insulted person and if a bullet should remove this dangerous rival from his path why all the better for him and all the worse for the fool who had brought the matter to a bloody issue though the balance of the ladys heart inclined his way he came in high spirits and rode upon kate peytons grey to sting his adversary and show his contempt of him not so griffith gaunt his heart was heavy and foreboded ill it was his first duel and he expected to be killed he had played a fools game and he saw it the night before the duel he tried hard to sleep he knew it was not giving his nerves fair play to lie thinking all night but coy sleep as usual when most wanted refused to come at daybreak the restless man gave it up in despair and rose and dressed himself he wrote that letter to catherine little thinking it would fall into her hands while he lived he ate a little toast and drank a pint of burgundy and then wandered listlessly about till major rickards his second arrived that experienced gentleman brought a surgeon with him mr islip major rickards deposited a shallow wooden box in the hall and the two gentlemen sat down to a hearty breakfast griffith took care of his guests but beyond that spoke scarcely a word and the surgeon after a ghastly attempt at commonplaces was silent too major rickards satisfied his appetite first and then finding his companions dumb set to work to keep up their spirits he entertained them with a narrative of the personal encounters he had witnessed and especially of one in which his principal had fallen on his face at the first fire and the antagonist had sprung into the air and both had lain dead as door nails and never moved nor even winked after that single discharge griffith sat under this chilling talk for more than an hour at last he rose gloomily and said it was time to go got your tools doctor inquired the major the surgeon nodded slightly he was more discreet than his friend when they had walked nearly a mile in the snow the major began to complain the devil said he this is queer walking my boots are full of water i shall catch my death the surgeon smiled satirically comparing silent griffiths peril with his seconds griffith took no notice he went like fortitude plodding to execution major rickards fell behind and whispered mr islip dont like his looks doesnt march like a winner a job for you or the sexton you mark my words they toiled up scutchemsee nob and when they reached the top they saw neville and his second mr hammersley riding towards them the pair had halters as well as bridles and dismounting made their nags fast to a large blackthorn that grew there the seconds then stepped forward and saluted each other with formal civility griffith looked at the grey horse and ground his teeth the sight of the animal in nevilles possession stirred up his hate and helped to steel his heart he stood apart still pale and gloomy the seconds stepped out fifteen paces and placed the men then they loaded two pair of pistols and put a pistol in each mans hand major rickards took that opportunity to advise his principal stand sharp keep your arm close to your side dont fire too high how do you feel like a man who must die but will try to die in company the seconds now withdrew to their places and the rivals held their pistols lowered but fixed their deadly eyes on each other the eye in such a circumstance is a terrible thing it is literally a weapon of destruction for it directs the deadly hand that guides the deadly bullet moreover the longer and the more steadily the duelist fixes his eye on his adversary the less likely he is to miss griffith was very pale but dogged neville was serious but firm both eyed each other unflinchingly gentlemen are you ready asked nevilles second yes yes then said major rickards you will fire when i let fall this handkerchief and not before mark me gentlemen to prevent mistakes i shall say onetwothreeand then drop the handkerchief now then once more are you quite ready yes yes onetwothreehe dropped the handkerchief and both gentlemen fired simultaneously mr nevilles hat spun into the air griffith stood untouched the bullet had passed through nevilles hat and had actually cut a lane through his magnificent hair the seconds now consulted and it was intimated to griffith that a word of apology would be accepted by his antagonist griffith declined to utter a syllable of apology two more pistols were given the men aim lower said rickards i mean to said griffith the seconds withdrew and the men eyed each other griffith dogged and pale as before neville not nearly so selfassured griffiths bullet in grazing him had produced the effect of a sharp cold current of air no wider than a knife it was like deaths icy forefinger laid on his head to mark him for the next shot as men mark a tree then come again and fell it onetwothree and griffiths pistol missed fire but nevilles went off and griffiths arm sank powerless and his pistol rolled out of his hand he felt a sharp twinge and then something trickle down his arm the surgeon and both seconds ran to him nay it is nothing said he i shoot far better with my left hand than my right give me another pistol and let me have fair play he has hit me and now ill hit him both seconds agreed this was impossible it is the chance of war said major rickards you cannot be allowed to take a cool shot at mr neville if you fire again so must he the affair may very well end here said mr hammersley i understand there was some provocation on our side and on behalf of the party insulted i am content to let the matter end mr gaunt being wounded i demand my second shot to his third said griffith sternly he will not decline unless he is a poltroon as well aswhat i called him the nature of this reply was communicated to neville and the seconds with considerable reluctance loaded two more pistols and during the process major rickards glanced at the combatants griffith exasperated by his wound and his jealousy was wearing out the chivalrous courage of his adversary and the major saw it his keen eye noticed that neville was getting restless and looking confounded at his despised rivals pertinacity and that gaunt was more dogged and more deadly my man will kill yours this time said he quietly to nevilles second i can see it in his eye he is hungry tother has had his bellyful once more the men were armed and the seconds withdrew to their places intimating that this was the last shot they would allow under any circumstances whatever are you both ready yes yes a faint wail seemed to echo the response all heard it and in that superstitious age believed it to be some mysterious herald of death it suspended even major packards voice a minute he recovered himself however and once more his soldierlike tones ran in the keen air one there was a great rushing and a pounding of the hard ground and a scarlet amazon galloped in and drew up in the middle right between the leveled pistols every eye had been so bent on the combatants that kate peyton and her horse seemed to have sprung out of the very earth and there she sat pale as ashes on the steaming piebald and glanced from pistol to pistol the duelists stared in utter amazement and instinctively lowered their weapons for she had put herself right in their line of fire with a recklessness that contrasted nobly with her fear for others in short this apparition literally petrified them all seconds as well as combatants and while they stood openmouthed yet dumb in came the scamp and with a brisk assumption of delegated authority took griffiths weapon out of his now unresisting hand then marched to neville he instantly saluted catherine and then handed his pistol to her seeming agent with a highbred and inimitable air of utter nonchalance kate seeing them to her surprise so easily disarmed raised her hands and her lovely eyes to heaven and in a feeble voice thanked god and st nescioquis but very soon that faint voice quavered away to nothing and her fair head was seen to droop and her eyes to close then her body sank slowly forward like a broken lily and in another moment she lay fainting on the snow beside her steaming horse he never moved he was so dead beat too o lame and impotent conclusion of a vigorous exploit masculine up to the crowning point and then to go and spoil all with womans weakness nb this is rote sarcasticul as artemus the delicious says womans weakness if solomon had planned and samson executed they could not have served her turn better than this most seasonable swooning did for lo at her fall the doughty combatants uttered a yell of dismay and there was an indiscriminate rush towards the fair sufferer but the surgeon claimed his rightsthis is my business said he authoritatively do not crowd on her gentlemen give her air whereupon the duelists and seconds stood respectfully aloof in a mixed group and watched with eager interest and pity the surgeon made a hole in the snow and laid his fair patients head low dont be alarmed said he she has swooned that is all it was all mighty fine to say dont be alarmed but her face was ashy and her lips the color of lead and she was so like death they could not help being terribly alarmed and now for the first time the duelists felt culprits and as for fighting every idea of such a thing went out of their heads the rivals now were but rival nurses and never did a lot of women make more fuss over a child than all these bloodthirsty men did over this amazon manque they produced their legendary lore ones grandmother had told him burnt feathers were the thing another from an equally venerable source had gathered that those pink palms must be profanely slapped by the horny hand of a man for at no less a price could resuscitation be obtained the surgeon scorning all their legends griffith and neville made hasty rushes with brandy and usquebaugh but whether to be taken internally or externally they did not say nor indeed know but only thrust their flasks wildly on the doctor and he declined them loftily he melted snow in his hand and dashed it hard in her face and put salts close to her pretty little nostrils and this he repeated many times without effect but at last her lips began to turn from lead color to white and then from white to pink and her heavenly eyes to open again and her mouth to murmur things pitiably small and not bearing on the matter in hand her cheek was still colorless when her consciousness came back and she found she was lying on the ground with ever so many gentlemen looking at her at that modesty alarmed sent the blood at once rushing to her pale cheek a lovely lily seemed turning to a lovely rose before their eyes the next thing was she hid that blushing face in her hands and began to whimper the surgeon encouraged her nay we are all friends he whispered paternally she half parted her fingers and peered through them at neville and gaunt then she remembered all and began to cry hysterically new dismay of sanguinary unprofessionals now gentlemen if you will lend me your flasks said mr islip mighty calmly griffith and neville were instantly at his side each with a flask the surgeon administered snow and brandy kate sipped these and gulped down her sobs and at last cried composedly but when it came to sipping brandied snow and crying comfortably major rickardss anxiety gave place to curiosity without taking his eye off her he beckoned mr hammersley apart and whispered who the deuce is it dont you know whispered the other in return why mistress peyton herself what the girl it is all about well i never heard of such a thing the causa belli to come galloping and swooning on the field of battle and so stop the fighting what will our ladies do next by heaven she is worth fighting for though which is the happy man i wonder she doesnt look at either of them ah said the gentleman that is more than i know more than neville knows more than anybody knows bet you a guinea she knows and lets it out before she leaves the field said major rickards mr hammersley objected to an even bet but said he would venture one to three she did not it was an age of bets done said the major by this time kate had risen with mr islips assistance and was now standing with her hand upon the piebalds mane she saw rickards and hammersley were whispering about her and she felt very uneasy so she told mr islip timidly she desired to explain her conduct to all the gentlemen present and avert false reports they were soon all about her and she began with the most engaging embarrassment by making excuses for her weakness she said she had ridden all the way from home fasting that was what had upset her the gentlemen took the cue directly and vowed eagerly and unanimously it was enough to upset a porter but indeed resumed kate blushing i did not come here to make a fuss and be troublesome but to prevent mischief and clear up the strangest misunderstanding between two worthy gentlemen that are both of them my good friends she paused and there was a chilling silence everybody felt she was getting on ticklish ground now she knew that well enough herself but she had a good rudder to steer by called motherwit says she with inimitable coolness mr gaunt is an old friend of mine and a little too sensitive where i am concerned some chatterbox has been and told him mr neville should say i have changed horses with him and on that the gossips put their own construction mr gaunt hears all this and applies insulting terms to mr neville nay do not deny it mr gaunt for i have it here in your own handwriting as for mr neville he merely defends his honor and is little to blame but now i shall tell the true story about these horses and make you all ashamed of this sorry quarrel gentlemen thus it is a few days ago mr gaunt bade me farewell and started for foreign parts he had not been long gone when word came from bolton that mr charlton was no more you know how sudden it was consider gentlemen him dead and his heir riding off to the continent in ignorance so i thought oh what shall i do just then mr neville visited me and i told him on that he offered me his piebald horse to carry the news after mr gaunt because my grey was too tired it was the day we drew yewtree brow and crossed harrowden brook you know griffith interrupted her stay a bit said he this is news to me you never told me he had lent you the piebald nag to do me a good turn did i not said kate mighty innocently well but i tell you now ask him he cannot deny it as for the rest it was all done in a hurry mr neville had no horse now to ride home with he did me the justice to think i should be very ill pleased were he to trudge home afoot and suffer for his courtesy so he borrowed my grey to keep him out of the mire and indeed the ways were fouler than usual with the rains was there any ill in all this honi soit qui mal y pense says i the gentlemen all sided loudly with her on this appealexcept neville who held his tongue and smiled at her plausibility and griffith who hung his head at her siding with neville at last he spoke and said sorrowfully if you did exchange horses with him of course i have only to ask his pardonand go catherine reflected a moment before she replied well said she i did exchange and i did not why quarrel about a word certainly he took my horse and i took his but it was only for the nonce mr neville is foreign bred and an example to us all he knows his piebald is worth two of my grey and so he was too fine a gentleman man to send me back my old hunter and ask for his young charger he waited for me to do that and if anybody deserves to be shot it must be me but dear heart i did not foresee all this fuss i said to myself la mr neville will be sure to call on my father or me some day or else i shall be out on the piebald and meet him on the grey and then we can each take our own again was i so far out in my reckoning is not that my rosinante yonder here tom leicester you put my sidesaddle on that grey horse and the mans saddle on the piebald thereand now griffith gaunt it is your turn you must withdraw your injurious terms and end this superlative folly griffith hesitated come said kate consider mr neville is esteemed by all the county you are the only gentleman in it who have ever uttered a disparaging word against him are you sure you are more free from passion and prejudice and wiser than all the county oblige me and do what is right come griffith gaunt let your reason unsay the barbarous words your passion hath uttered against a worthy gentleman whom we all esteem her habitual influence and these last words spoken with gentle and persuasive dignity turned the scale griffith turned to neville and said in a low voice that he began to fear he had been hasty and used harsher words than the occasion justified he was going to stammer out something more but neville interrupted him with a noble gesture that is enough mr gaunt said he i do not feel quite blameless in the matter and have no wish to mortify an honorable adversary unnecessarily very handsomely said put in major rickards and now let me have a word i say that both gentlemen have conducted themselves like menunder fire and that honor is satisfied and the misunderstanding at an end as for my principal here he has shown he can fight and now he has shown he can hear reason against himself when the lips of beauty utter it i approve his conduct from first to last and am ready to defend it in all companies and in the field should it ever be impugned kate colored with pleasure and gave her hand eloquently to the major he bowed over it and kissed the tips of her fingers oh sir she said looking on him now as a friend i dreamed i saw mr neville lying dead upon the snow with the blood trickling from his temple at this nevilles dark cheek glowed with pleasure so it was her anxiety on his account had brought her here griffith heard too and sighed patiently assured by major rickards that there neither could nor should be any more fighting kate made her adieux mounted her grey horse and rode off discreetly declining all attendance she beckoned tom leicester however but he pretended not to see the signal and let her go alone his motive for lingering behind was characteristic and will transpire shortly as soon as she was gone griffith gaunt quietly reminded the surgeon that there was a bullet in his arm all this time bless my soul said mr islip i forgot that i was so taken up with the lady griffiths coat was now taken off and the bullet searched for it had entered the fleshy part of his arm below the elbow and passing round the bone projected just under the skin the surgeon made a slight incision and then pressing with his finger and thumb out it rolled griffith put it in his pocket neville had remained out of civility and now congratulated his late antagonist and himself that it was no worse the last words that passed between the rivals on this occasion were worth recording and characteristic of the time neville addressed gaunt with elaborate courtesy and to this effect i find myself in a difficulty sir you did me the honor to invite me to mr charltons funeral and i accepted but now i fear to intrude a guest the sight of whom may be disagreeable to you and on the other hand my absence might be misconstrued as a mark of disrespect or of a petty hostility i am far from feeling be pleased therefore to dispose of me entirely in this matter griffith reflected sir said he there is an old saying let every tub stand on its own bottom the deceased wished you to follow him to the grave and therefore i would on no account have you absent besides now i think of it there will be less gossip about this unfortunate business if our neighbors see you under my roof and treated with due consideration there as you will be i do not doubt that sir from so manly an adversary and i shall do myself the honor to come such was sevilles reply the rivals then saluted each other profoundly and parted hammersley and rickards lingered behind their principals to settle their little bet about kates affections and bytheby they were indiscreet enough to discuss this delicate matter within a dozen yards of tom leicester they forgot that little pitchers have long ears catherine peyton rode slowly home and thought it all over as she went and worried herself finely she was one that winced at notoriety and she could not hope to escape it now how the gossips would talk about her they would say the gentlemen had fought about her and she had parted them for love of one of them and then the gentlemen themselves the strict neutrality she had endeavored to maintain on scutchemsee nob in order to make peace would it not keep them both her suitors she foresaw she should be pulled to pieces and live in hot water and be the talk of the county there were but two ways out she must marry one of them and petition the other not to shoot him or else she must take the veil and so escape them both she preferred the latter alternative she was more enthusiastic in religion than in any earthly thing and now the angry passions of men thrust her the same road that her own devout mind had always drawn her as soon as she got home she sent a message to father francis who drove her conscience and begged him to come and advise her after that she did the wisest thing perhaps she had done all day went to bed chapter vii the sun was just setting when catherines maid came into her room and told her father francis was below she sent down to say she counted on his sleeping at peyton hall and she would come down to him in half an hour she then ordered a refection to be prepared for him in her boudoir and made her toilet with all reasonable speed not to keep him waiting her face beamed with quiet complacency now for the holy mans very presence in the house was a comfort to her father francis was a very stout muscular man with a ruddy countenance he never wore gloves and you saw at once he was not a gentleman by birth he had a fine voice it was deep mellow and when he chose sonorous this and his person ample but not obese gave him great weight especially with his female pupils if he was not quite so much reverenced by the men yet he was both respected and liked in fact he had qualities that make men welcome in every situation good humour good sense and tact a good son of his church and early trained to let no occasion slip of advancing her interests i wish my readers could have seen the meeting between catherine peyton and this burly ecclesiastic she came into the drawingroom with that imperious air and carriage which had made her so unpopular with her own sex and at the bare sight of father francis drooped and bent in a moment as she walked and her whole body indicated a submissiveness graceful but rather abject it was as if a young poplar should turn to a weeping willow in half a moment thus metamorphosed the beauty of cumberland glided up to francis and sank almost to her knee before him crossed her hands on her bosom lowered her lovely head and awaited his benediction the father made rapidly the sign of the cross over that thoroughbred head and golden hair and blessed her businesslike the hand of less employment hath the daintier sense shakespeare father francis blessed so many of these pretty creatures every week that he had long outgrown your fine romantic way of blessing a body we manage these things better in the theatre then he lent her his hand to rise and asked her in what she required his direction at present in that which shall decide my whole life said she francis responded by a look of paternal interest but first murmured she let me confess to you and obtain absolution if i may ah father my sins have been many since last confession be it so said father francis resignedly confession is the best preface to direction and he seated himself with a certain change of manner an easy assumption of authority nay father suggested the lady we shall be more private in my room as you will mistress catherine peyton said the priest returning to his usual manner so then the fair penitent led her spiritual judge captive up another flight of stairs and into her little boudoir a cheerful wood fire crackled and flamed up the chimney and a cloth had been laid on a side table cold turkey and chine graced the board and a huge glass magnum of purple burgundy glowed and shone in the rays of the cheery fire father francis felt cosy at the sight and at once accepted kates invitation to take some nourishment before entering on the labour of listening to the catalogue of her crimes i fasted yesterday he muttered and the zeal with which he attacked the viands rendered the statement highly credible he invited kate to join him but she declined he returned more than once to the succulent meats and washed all down with a pint of the fine old burgundy perfumed and purple meantime she of the laity sat looking into the fire with heavenlyminded eyes at last with a gentle sigh of content the ghostly father installed himself in an armchair by the fire and invited his penitent to begin she took a footstool and brought it to his side so that in confessing her blacker vices she might be able to whisper them in his very ear she kneeled on her little footstool put her hands across her breast and in this lowly attitude murmured softly after this fashion with a contrite voice i have to accuse myself of many vices alas in one short fortnight i have accumulated the wickedness of a life i have committed the seven deadly sins i have been guilty of pride wrath envy disobedience immodesty vanity luxury fibs gently daughter said the priest quietly these terms are too general give me instances let us begin with wrath ah we are all prone to that the fair penitent sighed and said especially me example i was angry beyond reason with my maid ruth she does comb my hair so uncouthly so then the other night when i was in trouble and most needed soothing by being combed womanly she gets thinking of harry that helps in the stable and she tears away at my hair i started up and screamed out oh you clumsy thing go currycomb my horse and send that oaf your head is running on to handle my hair and i told her my grandma would have whipped her well for it but nowadays mistresses were the only sufferers we had lost the use of our hands we are grown so squeamish and i stamped like a fury and said get you gone out of the room and i hated the sight of her and the poor girl went from me crying without a wordbeing a better christian than her mistress mea culpa mea culpa did you slap her nay hither not so bad as that are you quite sure you did not slap her asked francis quietly nay but i had a mind to my heart slapped her if my hand forbore alas had she hurt you that she did but only my head i hurt her heart for the poor wench loves me dear the lord knows for what humphproceed to pride yes father i do confess that i was greatly puffed up with the praises of men i was proud of the sorriest things of jumping a brook when twas my horse jumped it and had jumped it better with a fly on his back than the poor worm me of my good looks forgetting that god gave them me and besides i am no beauty when all is done it is all their flattery and at my lady munsters dinner i pridefully walked out before mistress davies the rich cheesemongers wife that is as proud of her money as i of my old blood god forgive two fools which i had no right to do a maid to walk before a wife and oh father i whispered the gentleman who led me out it was mr neville here the penitent put one hand before her face and hesitated well daughter half confession is no confession you said to mr neville i said nothing comes after cheese this revelation was made most dolefully it was pert and unbecoming said father francis gravely though a twinkle in his eye showed that he was not so profoundly shocked as his penitent appeared to be but go to graver matters immodesty said you i shall be very sorry if this is so you did not use to be immodest well father i hope i have not altogether laid aside modesty otherwise it would be time for me to die let alone to confess but sure it cannot be modest of me to ride after a gentleman and take him a letter and then that was not enough i heard of a duel and what did i do but ride to scutchemsee nob and interfere what gentlewoman ever was so bold i was not their wife you know neither of thems humph said the priest i have already heard a whisper of this but told to your credit beati pacifici blessed are the peacemakers you had better lay that matter before me byandby as your director as your confessor tell me why you accuse yourself of luxury alas said the young lady scarce a day passes that i do not offend in that respect example last friday dining abroad the cooks sent up a dish of collops oh father they smelt so nice and i had been a hunting first i smelt them and that i couldnt help but then i forgot custodia oculorum and i eyed them and the next thing was presentlysomehowtwo of em were on my plate very wrong said father francis but that is a harsher term than i should have applied to this longing of a hungry woman for collops o friday pray what do you understand by that big word why you explained it yourself in your last sermon it means unruly and inordinate desires example edith hammersley told me i was mad to ride in scarlet and me so fair and my hair so light green or purple is your color says she and soon after this didnt i see in stanhope town the loveliest piece of purple broadcloth oh father it had a gloss like velvet and the sun did so shine on it as it lay in the shopwindow it was fit for a king or a bishop and i stood and gloated on it and pined for it and died for it and down went the tenth commandment ah said francis the hearts of women are set on vanity but tell me these unruly affections of yours are they ever fixed on persons of the other sex the fair sinner reflected on gentlemen said she why they come pestering one of their own accord no no i could do without them very well what i sinfully pine for is meat on a friday as sure as ever the day comes round and highcouraged horses to ride and fine clothes to wear every day in the week mea culpa mea culpa such being the dismal state of things francis slyly requested her to leave the seven deadly sins in peace and go to her small offenses for he argued shrewdly enough that since her sins were peccadilloes perhaps some of her peccadilloes might turn out to be sins small cried the culprit turning red they are none of them small i really think she was jealous of her reputation as a sinner of high degree however she complied and putting up her mouth murmured a miscellaneous confession without end the accents were soft and musical like a babbling brook and the sins such as they were poor things rippled on in endless rotation now nothing tends more to repose than a purling brook and ere long that bassoon her confessors nose let her know she had lost his ear she stopped indignant but at that he instantly awoke sublat caus tollitur effectus and addressed her thus with sudden dignitymy daughter you will fast on monday next and say two aves and a credo absolvo te and now said he as i am a practical man let us get back from the imaginary world into the real speak to me at present as your director and mind you must be serious now and call things by their right names upon this kate took a seat and told her story and showed him the difficulty she was in she then reminded him that notwithstanding her unfortunate itch for the seven deadly sins she was a good catholic a zealous daughter of the church and she let him know her desire to retire from both lovers into a convent and so freed from the world and its temptations yield up her soul entire to celestial peace and divine contemplation not so fast said the priest even zeal is nought without obedience if you could serve the church better than by going into a convent would you be willful oh no father but how can i serve the church better than by renouncing the world perhaps by remaining in the world as she herself does and by making converts to the faith you could hardly serve her worse than by going into a convent for our convents are poor and you have no means you would be a charge no daughter we want no poor nuns we have enough of them if you are as i think a true and zealous daughter of the church you must marry and instill the true faith with all a mothers art a mothers tenderness into your children then the heir to your husbands estates will be a catholic and so the true faith get rooted in the soil alas said catherine are we to look but to the worldly interests of the church they are inseparable from her spiritual interests here on earth our souls are not more bound to our bodies catherine was deeply mortified so the church rejects me because i am poor said she with a sigh the church rejects you not but only the convent no place is less fit for you you have a high spirit and high religious sentiments both would be mortified and shocked in a nunnery think you that convent walls can shut out temptation i know them better than you they are strongholds of vanity folly tittletattle and all the meanest vices of your sex nay i forbid you to think of it show me now your faith by your obedience you are harsh to me father said catherine piteously i am firm you are one that need a tight hand mistress come now humility and obedience these are the christian graces that best become your youth say can the church through me its minister count on these from you or suddenly letting loose his diapason did you send for me to ask advice and yet go your own way hiding a high stomach and a willful heart under a show of humility catherine looked at father francis with dismay this was the first time that easygoing priest had shown her how impressive he could be she was downright frightened and said she hoped she knew better than defy her director she laid her will at his feet and would obey him like a child as was her duty now i know my daughter again said he and gave her his horrible paw the which she kissed very humbly and that matter was settled to her entire dissatisfaction soon after that they were both summoned to supper but as they went down kates maid drew her aside and told her a young man wanted to speak to her a young man screamed kate hang young men they have got me a fine scolding just now which is it pray he is a stranger to me perhaps he comes with a message from some fool you may bring him to me in the hall and stay with us it may be a thief for ought i know the maid soon reappeared followed by mr thomas leicester that young worthy had lingered on scutchemsee nob to extract the last drop of enjoyment from the situation by setting up his hat at ten paces and firing the gentlemens pistols at it i despair of conveying to any rational reader the satisfaction keen though brief this afforded him it was a new sensation gentlemens guns he had fired many but dueling pistols not one till that bright hour he was now come to remind catherine of his pecuniary claims luckily for him she was one who did not need to be reminded of her promises oh it is you child said she well ill be as good as my word she then dismissed her maid and went upstairs and soon returned with two guineas a crown piece and three shillings in her hand there said she smiling i am sorry for you but that is all the money i have in the world the boys eyes glittered at sight of the coin he rammed the silver into his pocket with hungry rapidity but he shook his head about the gold im afeard o these said he and eyed them mistrustfully in his palm these be the friends that get you your throat cut o dark nights mistress please keep em for me and let me have a shilling now and then when im dry nay said kate but are you not afraid i shall spend your money now i have none left of my own tom seemed quite struck with the reasonableness of this observation and hesitated however he concluded to risk it you dont look one of the sort to wrong a poor fellow said he and besides youll have brass to spare of your own before long i know kate opened her eyes oh indeed said she and pray how do you know that mr leicester favored her with a knowing wink he gave her a moment to digest this and then said almost in a whisper hearkened the gentlefolks on scutchemsee nob after you was gone home mistress kate was annoyed what they must be prating as soon as ones back is turned talk of womens tongues now what did they say i should like to know it was about the bet ye know a bet oh that is no affair of mine ay but it is why twas you they were betting on seems that old sodger and squire hammersley had laid three guineas to one that you should let out which was your fancy of them two kates cheeks were red as fire now but her delicacy overpowered her curiosity and she would not put any more questions to be sure young hopeful needed none he was naturally a chatterbox and he proceeded to tell her that as soon as ever she was gone squire hammersley took a guinea and offered it to the old soldier and told him he had won and the old soldier pocketed it but after that somehow squire hammersley let drop that mr neville was the favorite then continued mr leicester what does the old sodger do but pull out guinea again and says he you must have this back bet is not won for you do think tis neville now i do think tis gaunt so then they fell to argufying and talking a lot o stuff no doubt the insolent meddlers can you remember any of their nonsense not that it is worth remembering ill be bound let me see well squire hammersley he said you owned to dreaming of squire neville and that was a sign of love said he and besides you sided with him against tother but the old sodger he said you called squire gaunt griffith and he built on that oh and a said you changed the horses back to please our squire says he you must look to what the lady did never heed what she said why their sweet lips was only made to kiss us and deceive us says that there old sodger illilland what did you say sir for i suppose your tongue was not idle oh me i never let em know i was hearkening or theyd have greed in a moment for to give me a hiding besides i had no need to cudgel my brains id only to ask you plump youll tell me i know which is it mistress im for gaunt you knowin course alack mistress gabbled this voluble youth sure you wont be so hard as sack my squire and him got a bullet in his carcass for love of you this day kate started and looked at him in surprise oh said she a bullet did they fight again the moment they saw my back was turned the cowards and she began to tremble no no said tom that was done before ever you came up dont ye remember that single shot while we were climbing the nob well twas squire gaunt got it in the arm that time oh but i say wasnt our man game never let out he was hit while you was there but as soon as ever you was gone they cut the bullet out of him and i seen it ahah doctor takes out his knife precious sharp and shiny twas cuts into his arm with no more ado than if he was carving a pullet out squirts the blood a good un oh no more no more you cruel boy how could you bear to look and kate hid her own face with both hands why twasnt my skin as was cut into squire gaunt he never hollered a winced though and ground his teeth but twas over in a minute and the bullet in his hand that is for my wife says he if ever i have one and puts it in his pocket why mistress you be as white as your smock no no did he faint poor soul not he what was there to faint about then why do i feel so sick even to hear of it because you hant got no stomach said the boy contemptuously your courage is skin deep im thinking however im glad you feel for our squire about the bullet so now i hope you will wed with him and sack squire neville then you and i shall be kind o kin squire gaunts feyther was my feyther that makes you stare mistress why all the folk do know it look at this here little mole on my forehead squire gaunt have got the fellow to that at this crisis of his argument he suddenly caught a glimpse of his personal interest instantly he ceased his advocacy of squire gaunt and became ludicrously impartial well mistress wed whichever you like said he with sublime indifference only whichever you do wed prithee speak a word to the gentleman and get me to be his gamekeeper id liever be your goodmans gamekeeper than king of england he was proceeding with vast volubility to enumerate his qualifications for that confidential post when the lady cut him short and told him to go and get his supper in the kitchen for she was wanted elsewhere he made a scrape and clattered away with his hobnailed shoes kate went to the hall window and opened it and let the cold air blow over her face her heart was touched and her bosom tilled with pity for her old sweetheart how hard she had been she had sided with neville against the wounded man and she thought how sadly and patiently he had submitted to her decisionand a bullet in his poor arm all the time the gentle bosom heaved and heaved and the tears began to run she entered the diningroom timidly expecting some comment on her discourteous absence instead of that both her father and her director rose respectfully and received her with kind and affectionate looks they then pressed her to eat this and that and were remarkably attentive and kind she could see she was deep in their good books this pleased her but she watched quietly after the manner of her sex to learn what it was all about nor was she left long in the dark remarks were made that hit her though they were none of them addressed to her father francis delivered quite a little homily on obedience and said how happy a thing it was when zeal a virtue none too common in these degenerate days was found tempered by humility and subservient to ghostly counsel and authority mr peyton dealt in no general topics of that kind his discourse was secular it ran upon nevilles cross nevilles court and the baronetcy and he showed francis how and why this title must sooner or later come to george neville and the heirs of his body francis joined in this topic for a while but speedily diverged into what might be called a collateral theme he described to kate a delightful spot on the neville estate where a nunnery might be built and endowed by any good catholic lady having zeal and influence with the owner of the estate and with the lordlieutenant of the county it is three parts an island for the river wey curls round it lovingly but backed by wooded slopes that keep off the north and east winds a hidden and balmy place such as the forefathers of the church did use to choose for their rustic abbeys whose ruins still survive to remind us of the pious and glorious days gone by trout and salmon come swimming to the door hawthorn and woodbine are as rife there as weeds be in some parts two broad oaks stand on turf like velvet and ring with songbirds a spot by nature sweet calm and holy good for pious exercises and heavenly contemplation there methinks if it be gods will i should see old age i would love to end my own days at peace with heaven and with all mankind kate was much moved by this picture and her clasped hands and glistening eyes showed the glory and delight it would be to her to build a convent on so lovely a spot but her words were vague how sweet how sweet was all she committed herself to for after what tom leicester had just told her she hardly knew what to say or what to think or what to do she felt she had become a mere puppet first drawn one way then another one thing appeared pretty clear to her now father francis did not mean her to choose between her two lovers he was good enough to relieve her of that difficulty by choosing for her she was to marry neville she retired to rest directly after supper for she was thoroughly worn out and the moment she rose to go her father bounced up and lighted the bed candle for her with novel fervor and kissed her on the cheek and said in her eargood night my lady neville chapter viii what with the days excitement and a sweet secluded convent in lier soul and a bullet in her bosom and a ringing in her ear that sounded mighty like lady neville lady neville lady neville kate spent a restless night and woke with a bad headache she sent her maid to excuse her on this score from going to bolton hall but she was informed in reply that the carriage had been got ready expressly for her so she must be good enough to shake off disease and go the air would do her a deal more good than lying abed thereupon she dressed herself in her black silk gown and came down looking pale and languid but still quite lovely enough to discharge what in this age of cant i suppose we should call her mission videlicet to set honest men by the ears at halfpast eight oclock the carriage came round to the front door its body all glorious with the peyton armorials and with patches of rusty gilding swung exceedingly loose on long leathern straps instead of springs and the forewheels were a mile from the hindwheels more or less a pretentious and horrible engine drawn by four horses only two of them being ponies impaired the symmetry and majestic beauty of the pageant old joe drove the wheelers his boy rode the leaders and every now and then got oft and kicked them in the pits of their stomachs or pierced them with hedgestakes to rouse their mettle thus encouraged and stimulated they effected an average of four miles and a half per hour notwithstanding the snow and reached bolton just in time at the lodge francis got out and lay in ambush but only for a time he did not think it orthodox to be present at a religious ceremony of his protestant friends nor commonsenseodox to turn his back upon their dinner the carriage drew up at the hall door it was wide open and the hall lined with servants male and female in black in the midst between these two rows stood griffith gaunt bareheaded to welcome the guests his arm was in a sling he had received all the others in the middle of the hall but he came to the threshold to meet kate and her father he bowed low and respectfully then gave his left hand to kate to conduct her after the formal fashion of the day the sight of his arm in a sling startled and affected her and with him giving her his hand almost at the same moment she pressed it or indeed squeezed it nervously and it was in her heart to say something kind and womanly but her father was close behind and she was afraid of saying something too kind if she said anything at all so griffith only got a little gentle nervous pinch but that was more than he expected and sent a thrill of delight through him his brown eyes replied with a volume and holding her hand up in the air as high as her ear and keeping at an incredible distance he led her solemnly to a room where the other ladies were and left her there with a profound bow the peytons were nearly the last persons expected and soon after their arrival the funeral procession formed this part was entirely arranged by the undertaker the monstrous custom of forbidding ladies to follow their dead had not yet occurred even to the idiots of the nation and mr peyton and his daughter were placed in the second carriage the first contained griffith gaunt alone as head mourner but the peytons were not alone no other relation of the deceased being present the undertaker put mr neville with the peytons because he was heir to a baronetcy kate was much startled and astonished to see him come out into the hall but when he entered the carriage she welcomed him warmly oh i am so glad to see you here said she guess by that what my delight at meeting you must be said he she blushed and turned it off i mean that your coming here gives me good hopes there will be no more mischief she then lowered her voice and begged him on no account to tell her father of her ride to scutchemsee nob not a word said george he knew the advantage of sharing a secret with a fair lady he proceeded to whisper something very warm in her ear she listened to some of it but then remonstrated and said are you not ashamed to go on so at a funeral oh do pray leave compliments a moment and think of your latter end he took this suggestion as indeed he did everything from her in good part and composed his visage into a decent gravity soon after this they reached the church and buried the deceased in his family vault people who are not bereaved by the death are always inclined to chatter coming home from a funeral kate now talked to neville of her own accord and asked him if he had spoken to his host he said yes and more than that had come to a clear understanding with him we agreed that it was no use fighting for you i said if either of us two was to kill the other it does not follow you would wed the survivor me wed the wretch said kate i should abhor him and go into a convent in spite of you all and end my days praying for the murdered mans soul neither of us is worth all that suggested neville with an accent of conviction that is certain replied the lady drily so please not to do it he bade her set her mind at ease they had both agreed to try and win her by peaceful arts then a pretty life mine will be well i think it will till you decide i could easily decide if it were not for giving pain tosomebody oh you cant help that my sweet mistress you are not the first that has had to choose between two worthy men for in sooth i have nothing to say against my rival neither i know him better than i did he is a very worthy gentleman though he is damnably in my way and you are a very noble one to say so and you are one of those that make a man noble i feel that petty arts are not the way to win you and i scorn them sweet mistress kate i adore you you are the best and noblest as well as the loveliest of women oh hush mr neville i am a creature of clay and you are another and both of us coming home from a funeral do think of that here they were interrupted by mr peyton asking kate to lend him a shilling for the groom kate replied aloud that she had left her purse at home then whispered in his ear that she had not a shilling in the world and this was strictly true for her little all was tom leicesters now with this they reached the hall and the coy kate gave both neville and gaunt the slip and got amongst her mates there her tongue went as fast as her neighbors though she had just come back from a funeral but soon the ladies and gentlemen were all invited to the reading of the will and now chance which had hitherto befriended neville by throwing him into one carriage with kate gave gaunt a turn he found her a moment alone and near the embrasure of a window he seized the opportunity and asked her might he say a word in her ear what a question said she gaily and the next moment they had the embrasure to themselves kate said he hurriedly in a few minutes i suppose i shall be master of this place now you told me once you would rather be an abbess or a nun than marry me did i said kate what a sensible speech but the worst of it is im never in the same mind long well replied griffith i think of all that falls from your lips and your will is mine only for pitys sake do not wed any man but me you have known me so long why you know the worst of me by this time and you have only seen the outside of him detraction is that what you wanted to say to me asked kate freezing suddenly nay nay it was about the abbey i find you can be an abbess without going and shutting yourself up and breaking ones heart the way is you build a convent in ireland and endow it and then you send a nun over to govern it under you bless your heart you can do anything with money and i shall have money enough before the day is over to be sure i did intend to build a kennel and keep harriers and you know that costs a good penny but we couldnt manage a kennel and an abbey too so now down goes the english kennel and up goes the irish abbey but you are a protestant gentleman you could not found a nunnery but my wife could whose business is it what she does with her money with your money you mean nay with hers when i give it her with all my heart well you astonish me said kate thoughtfully tell me now who put it into your head to bribe a poor girl in this abominable way who put it into my head said griffith looking rather puzzled why i suppose my heart put it into my head kate smiled very sweetly at this answer and a wild hope thrilled through griffith that perhaps she might be brought to terms but at this crisis the lawyer from london was announced and griffith as master of the house was obliged to seat the company he looked bitterly disappointed at the interruption but put a good face on it and had more chairs in and saw them all seated beginning with kate and the other ladies the room was spacious and the entire company sat in the form of a horseshoe the london solicitor was introduced by griffith and bowed in a short businesslike way seated himself in the horseshoe aforesaid and began to read the will aloud it was a lengthy document and there is nothing to be gained by repeating every line of it i pick out a clause here and there i septimus charlton of hernshaw castle and holton grange in the county of cumberland esquire being of sound mind memory and understandingthanks be to goddo make this my last will and testament as followsfirst i commit my soul to god who gave it and my body to the earth from which it came i desire my executors to discharge my funeral and testamentary expenses my just debts and the legacies hereinafter bequeathed out of my personal estate then followed several legacies of fifty and one hundred guineas then several small legacies such as the following to my friend edward peyton of peyton hall esq ten guineas to buy a mourning ring to the worshipful gentlemen and ladies who shall follow my body to the grave ten guineas each to buy a mourning ring to my wifes cousin griffith gaunt i give and bequeath the sum of two thousand pounds the same to be paid to him within one calendar month from the date of my decease and as to all my messuages or tenements farms lands hereditaments and real estate of what nature or what kind soever and wheresoever situate together with all my monies mortgages chattels furniture plate pictures wine liquors horses carnages stock and all the rest residue and remainder of my personal estate and effects whatsoever after the payment of the debts and legacies hereinbefore mentioned i give devise and bequeath the same to my cousin catherine peyton daughter of edward peyton esq of peyton hall in the county of cumberland her heirs executors administrators and assigns for ever when the lawyer read out this unexpected blow the whole company turned in their seats and looked amazed at her who in a second and a sentence was turned before their eyes from the poorest girl in cumberland to an heiress in her own right and proprietor of the house they sat in the chairs they sat on and the lawn they looked out at ay we turn to the rising sun very few looked at griffith gaunt to see how he took his mistresss good fortune that was his calamity yet his face was a book full of strange matter at first a flash of loving joy crossed his countenance but this gave way immediately to a haggard look and that to a glare of despair as for the lady she cast one deprecating glance swifter than lightning at him she had disinherited and then she turned her face to marble in vain did curious looks explore her to detect the delight such a stroke of fortune would have given to themselves faulty but great of soul and on her guard against the piercing eyes of her own sex she sat sedate and received her change of fortune with every appearance of cool composure and exalted indifference and as for her dreamy eyes they seemed thinking of heaven or something almost as many miles away from money and land but the lawyer had not stopped a moment to see how people took it he had gone steadily on through the usual formal clauses and now he brought his monotonous voice to an end and added in the same breath but in a natural and cheerful tone madam i wish you joy this operated like a signal the company exploded in a body and then they all came about the heiress and congratulated her in turn she curtsied politely though somewhat coldly but said not a word in reply till the disappointed one spoke to her he hung back at first to understand his feelings it must be remembered that in this view of things kate gained nothing by this bequest compared with what he lost as his wife she would have been mistress of bolton hall etc but now she was placed too far above him sick at heart he stood aloof while they all paid their court to her but byandby he felt it would look base and hostile if he alone said nothing so he came forward struggling visibly for composure and manly fortitude the situation was piquant and the ladies tongues stopped in a moment and they were all eyes and ears chapter ix griffith with an effort he had not the skill to hide stammered out mistress kate i do wish you joy then with sudden and touching earnestness never did good fortune light on one so worthy of it thank you griffith replied kate softly she had called him mr gaunt in public till now but money and lands do not always bring content i think i was happier a minute ago than i feel now said she quietly the blood rushed into griffiths face at this for a minute ago might mean when he and she were talking almost like lovers about to wed he was so overcome by this he turned on his heel and retreated hastily to hide his emotion and regain if possible composure to play his part of host in the house that was his no longer kate herself soon after retired nominally to make her toilet before dinner but really to escape the public and think it all over the news of her advancement had spread like wildfire she was waylaid at the very door by the housekeeper who insisted on showing her her house nay never mind the house said kate just show me one room where i can wash my face and do my hair mrs hill conducted her to the best bedroom it was lined with tapestry and all the colors flown the curtains were a deadish yellow lud heres a colored room to show me into said the blonde kate and a black grate too why not take me out o doors and bid me wash in the snow alack mistress said the woman feeling very uneasy we had no orders from mr gaunt to light fires up stairs oh if you wait for gentlemens orders to make your house fit to live in you knew there were a dozen ladies coming yet you were not woman enough to light them fires come take me to your own bedroom the woman turned red mine is but a small room my lady she stammered but theres a fire in it said kate spitefully you servants dont wait for gentlemens orders to take care of yourselves mrs hill said to herself im to leave that is flat however she led the way down a passage and opened the door of a pleasant little room in a square turret a large bay window occupied one whole side of the room and made it inexpressibly bright and cheerful though rather hot and stuffy a clear coal fire burnt in the grate ah said kate how nice please open those little windows every one i suppose you have sworn never to let wholesome air into a room thank you now go and forget every cross word i have said to youi am out of sorts and nervous and irritable there run away my good soul and light fires in every room and dont you let a creature come near me or you and i shall quarrel downright mrs hill beat a hasty retreat kate locked the door and threw herself backwards on the bed with such a weary recklessness and abandon as if she was throwing herself into the sea to end all her troubleand burst out crying it was one thing to refuse to marry her old sweetheart it was another to take his property and reduce him to poverty but here was she doing both and going to be persuaded to marry neville and swell his wealth with the very possessions she had taken from griffith and him wounded into the bargain for love of her it was really too cruel it was an accumulation of different cruelties her bosom revolted she was agitated perplexed irritated unhappy and all in a tumult and although she had but one fit of cryingto the naked eyeyet a person of her own sex would have seen that at one moment she was crying from agitated nerves at another from worry and at the next from pity and then from grief in short she had a good long hearty multiform cry and it relieved her swelling heart so far that she felt able to go down now and hide her feelings one and all from friend and foe to do which was unfortunately a part of her nature she rose and plunged her face into cold water and then smoothed her hair now as she stood at the glass two familiar voices came in through the open window and arrested her attention directly it was her father conversing with griffith gaunt kate pricked up her quick ears and listened with her back hair in her hand she caught the subject of their talk only now and then she missed a word or two mr peyton was speaking rather kindly to griffith and telling him he was as sorry for his disappointment as any father could be whose daughter had just come into a fortune but then he went on and rather spoiled this by asking griffith bluntly what on earth had ever made him think mr charlton intended to leave him bolton and hernshaw griffith replied with manifest agitation that mr charlton had repeatedly told him he was to be his heir not said griffith that he meant to wrong mistress kate neither poor old man he always thought she and i should be one ah well said squire peyton coolly there is an end of all that now at this observation kate glided to the window and laid her cheek on the sill to listen more closely but griffith made no reply mr peyton seemed dissatisfied at his silence and being a person who notwithstanding a certain superficial goodnature saw his own side of a question very big and his neighbors very little he was harder than perhaps he intended to be why master gaunt said he surely you would not follow my daughter now to feed upon a womans bread come be a man and if you are the girls friend dont stand in her light you know she can wed your betters and clap bolton hall on to nevilles court no doubt it is a disappointment to you but what cant be cured must be endured pluck up a bit of courage and turn your heart another way and then i shall always be a good friend to you and my doors open to you come when you will griffith made no reply kate strained her ears but could not hear a syllable a tremor ran through her she was in distance farther from griffith than her father was but superior intelligence provided her with a bridge from her window to her old servants mind and now she felt that this great silence was the silence of despair but the squire pressed him for a definite answer and finally insisted on one come dont be sulky said he im her father give me an answer ay or no then kate heard a violent sigh and out rushed a torrent of words that each seemed tinged with blood from the unfortunate speakers heart old man he almost shrieked what did i ever do to you that you torment me so sure you were born without bowels beggared but an hour agone and now you must come and tell me i have lost her by losing house and lands dye think i need to be told it she was too far above me before and now she is gone quite out of my reach but why come and fling it in my face cant you give a poor undone man one hour to draw his breath in trouble and when you know i have got to play the host this bitter day and smile and smirk and make you all merry with my heart breaking oh christ look down and pity me for men are made of stone well then no i will not i cannot say the word to give her up she will discharge me and then ill fly the country and never trouble you more and to think that one little hour ago she was so kind and i was so happy ah sir if you were born of a woman have a little pity and dont speak to me of her at all one way or other what are you afraid of i am a gentleman and a man though sore my trouble i shall not run after the lady of bolton hall why sir i have ordered the servants to set her chair in the middle of the table where i shall not be able to speak to her or even see her indeed i dare not look at her for i must be merry merry my arm it worries me my head it aches my heart is sick to death man man show me some little grace and do not torture me more than flesh and blood can bear you are mad young sir said the squire sternly and want locking up on bread and water for a month i am almost mad said griffith humbly but if you would only let me alone and not tear my heart out of my body i could hide my agony from the whole pack of ye and go through my part like a man i wish i was lying where i laid my only friend this afternoon oh i dont want to speak to you said peyton angrily and by the same token dont you speak to my daughter any more well sir if she speaks to me i shall be sure to speak to her without asking your leave or any mans but i will not force myself upon the lady of bolton hall dont you think it only for gods sake let me alone i want to be by myself and with this he hurried away unable to bear it any more peyton gave a hostile and contemptuous snort and also turned on his heel and went off in the opposite direction the effect of this dialogue on the listener was not to melt but exasperate her perhaps she had just cried away her stock of tenderness at any rate she rose from her ambush a very basilisk her eyes usually so languid flashed fire and her forehead was red with indignation she bit her lip and clenched her hands and her little foot beat the ground swiftly she was still in this state when a timid tap came to the door and mrs hill asked her pardon but dinner was ready and the ladies and gentlemen all a waiting for her to sit down this reminded kate she was the mistress of the house she answered civilly she would be down immediately she then took a last look in the glass and her own face startled her no she thought they shall none of them know nor guess what i feel and she stood before the glass and deliberately extracted all emotion from her countenance and by way of preparation screwed on a spiteful smile when she had got her face to her mind she went down stairs the gentlemen awaited her with impatience the ladies with curiosity to see how she would comport herself in her new situation she entered made a formal curtsy and was conducted to her seat by mr gaunt he placed her in the middle of the table i play the host for this one day said he with some dignity and took the bottom of the table himself mr hammersley was to have sat on kates left but the sly neville persuaded him to change and so got next to his inamorata opposite to her sat her father major rickards and others unknown to fame neville was in high spirits he had the good taste to try and hide his satisfaction at the fatal blow his rival had received and he entirely avoided the topic but kate saw at once by his demure complacency he was delighted at the turn things had taken and he gained nothing by it he found her a changed girl cold monosyllables were all he could extract from her he returned to the charge a hundred times with indomitable gallantry but it was no use cold haughty sullen her other neighbor fared little better and in short the lady of the house made a vile impression she was an iceberg a beautiful killjoy a wet blanket of charming texture and presently nature began to cooperate with her long before sunset it grew prodigiously dark and the cause was soon revealed by a fall of snow in flakes as large as a biscuit a shiver ran through the people and old peyton blurted out i shall not go home tonight then he bawled across the table to his daughter you are at home we will stay and take possession oh papa said kate reddening with disgust but if dulness reigned around the lady of the house it was not so everywhere loud bursts of merriment were heard at the bottom of the table kate glanced that way in some surprise and found it was griffith making the company merry griffith of all people the laughter broke out at short intervals and byandby became uproarious and constant at last she looked at neville inquiringly our worthy host is setting us an example of conviviality said he he is getting drunk oh i hope not said kate has he no friend to tell him not to make a fool of himself you take a great interest in him said neville bitterly of course i do pray do you desert your friends when ill luck falls on them nay mistress kate i hope not you only triumph over the misfortunes of your enemies eh said the stinging beauty not even that and as for mr gaunt i am not his enemy oh no of course not you are his best friend witness his arm at this moment i am his rival but not his enemy ill give you a proof then he lowered his voice and said in her ear you are grieved at his losing bolton and as you are very generous and nobleminded you are all the more grieved because his loss is your gain kate blushed at this shrewd hit neville went on you dont like him well enough to marry him and since you cannot make him happy it hurts your good heart to make him poor it is you for reading a ladys heart said kate ironically george proceeded steadily ill show you an easy way out of this dilemma thank you said kate rather insolently give mr gaunt bolton and hernshaw and give meyour hand kate turned and looked at him with surprise she saw by his eye it was no jest for all that she effected to take it as one that would be long and short division said she but her voice faltered in saying it so it would replied george coolly for bolton and hernshaw both are not worth one finger of that hand i ask of you but the value of things lies in the mind that weighs em mr gaunt you see values bolton and hernshaw very highly why he is in despair at losing them look at him he is getting rid of his reason before your very eyes to drown his disappointment oh that is it is it and strange to say she looked rather relieved that is it believe me it is a way we men have but as i was saying i dont care one straw for bolton and hernshaw it is you i love not your land nor your house but your sweet self so give me that and let the lawyers make over this famous house and lands to mr gaunt his antagonist i have been in the field and his rival i am and must be but not his enemy you see and not his illwisher kate was softened a little this is all mighty romantic said she and very like a prolix chevalier as you are but you know very well he would fling land and house in your face if you offered them him on these terms ay in my face if i offered them but not in yours if you i am sure he would all the same try him what is the use try him kate showed symptoms of uneasiness well i will said she stoutly no that i will not you begin by bribing me and then you would set me to bribe him it is the only way to make two honest men happy if i thought that you know it try him and suppose he says nay then we shall be no worse than we are and suppose he says ay then he will wed bolton hall and hernshaw and the pearl of england will wed me i have a great mind to take you at your word said kate but no it is really too indelicate george neville fixed his eyes on her are you not deceiving yourself said he do you not like mr gaunt better than you think i begin to fear you dare not put him to this test you fear his love would not stand it kate colored high and tossed her head proudly how shrewd you gentlemen are she said much you know of a ladys heart now the truth is i dont know what might happen were i to do what you bid me nay im wiser than you would have me and ill pity mr gaunt at a safe distance if you please sir neville bowed gravely he felt sure this was a plausible evasion and that she really was afraid to apply his test to his rivals love so now for the first time he became silent and reserved by her side the change was noticed by father francis and he fixed a grave remonstrating glance on kate she received it understood it affected not to notice it and acted upon it drive a donkey too hard it kicks drive a man too hard it hits drive a woman too hard it cajoles now amongst them they had driven kate peyton too hard so she secretly formed a bold resolution and this done her whole manner changed for the better she turned to neville and flattered and fascinated him the most feline of her sex could scarcely equal her calinerie on this occasion but she did not confine her fascination to him she broke out pro bono publico like the sun in april with quips and cranks and dimpled smiles and made everybody near her quite forget her late hauteur and coldness and bask in this sunny sweet hostess when the charm was at its height the siren cast a seeming merry glance at griffith and said to a lady opposite methinks some of the gentlemen will be glad to be rid of us and so carried the ladies off to the drawingroom there her first act was to dismiss her smiles without ceremony and her second was to sit down and write four lines to the gentleman at the head of the diningtable and he was as drunk as a fiddler chapter x griffiths friends laughed heartily with him while he was getting drunk and when he had got drunk they laughed still louder only at him they knocked him down for a song and he sang a rather anacreontic one very melodiously and so loud that certain of the servants listening outside derived great delectation from it and neville applauded ironically soon after they knocked him down for a story and as it requires more brains to tell a story than to sing a song the poor butt made an ass of himself he maundered and wandered and stopped and went on and lost one thread and took up and another and got into a perfect maze and while he was thus entangled a servant came in and brought him a note and put it in his hand the unhappy narrator received it with a sapient nod but was too polite or else too stupid to open it so closed his fingers on it and wont maundering on till his story trickled into the sand of the desert and somehow ceased for it could not be said to end being a thing without head or tail he sat down amidst derisive cheers about five minutes afterwards in some intermittent flash of reason he found he had got hold of something he opened his hand and lo a note on this he chuckled unreasonably and distributed sage cunning winks around as if he by special ingenuity had caught a nightingale or the like then with sudden hauteur and gravity proceeded to examine his prize but he knew the handwriting at once and it gave him a galvanic shock that half sobered him for the moment he opened the note and spelled it with great difficulty it was beautifully written in long clear letters but then those letters kept dancing so i much desire to speak to you before tis too late but can think of no way save one i lie in the turreted room come under my window at nine of the clock and prithee come sober if you respect yourself or kate griffith put the note in his pocket and tried to think but he could not think to much purpose then this made him suspect he was drunk then he tried to be sober but he found he could not he sat in a sort of stupid agony with love and drink battling for his brain it was piteous to see the poor fools struggles to regain the reason he had so madly parted with he could not do it and when he found that he took up a fingerglass and gravely poured the contents upon his head at this there was a burst of laughter this irritated mr gaunt and with that rapid change of sentiments which marks the sober savage and the drunken european he offered to fight a gentleman he had been hitherto holding up to the company as his best friend but his best friend a very distant acquaintance was by this time as tipsy as himself and offered a piteous disclaimer mingled with tears and these maudlin drops so affected griffith that he flung his one available arm round his best friends head and wept in turn and down went both their lachrymose empty noddles on the table griffiths remained there but his best friend extricated himself and shaking his skull said dolefully he is very drunk this notable discovery coming from such a quarter caused considerable merriment let him alone said an old toper and griffith remained a good hour with his head on the table meantime the other gentlemen soon put it out of their power to ridicule him on the score of intoxication griffith keeping quiet got a little better and suddenly started up with a notion he was to go to kate this very moment he muttered an excuse and staggered to a glass door that led to the lawn he opened this door and rushed out into the open air he thought it would set him all right but instead of that it made him so much worse that presently his legs came to a misunderstanding and he measured his length on the ground and could not get up again but kept slipping down upon this he groaned and lay quiet now there was a foot of snow on the ground and it melted about griffiths hot temples and flashed face and mightily refreshed and revived him he sat up and kissed kates letter and love began to get the upper hand of liquor a little finally he got up and half strutted half staggered to the turret and stood under kates window the turret was covered with luxuriant ivy and that ivy with snow so the glass of the window was set in a massive frame of winter but a bright fire burned inside the room and this set the panes all aflame it was cheery and glorious to see the window glow like a sheet of transparent fire in its deep frame of snow but griffith could not appreciate all that he stood there a sorrowful man the wine he had taken to drown his despair had lost its stimulating effect and had given him a heavy head but left him his sick heart he stood and puzzled his drowsy faculties why kate had sent for him was it to bid him goodbye for ever or to lessen his misery by telling him she would not marry another he soon gave up cudgeling his enfeebled brains kate was a superior being to him and often said things and did things that surprised him she had sent for him and that was enough he should see her and speak to her once more at all events he stood alternately nodding and looking up at her glowing room and longing for its owner to appear but as bacchus had inspired him to mistake eight oclock for nine and as she was not a votary of bacchus she did not appear and he stood there till he began to shiver the shadow of a female passed along the wall and griffith gave a great start then he heard the fire poked soon after he saw the shadow again but it had a large servants cap on so his heart had beaten high for mary or susan he hung his head disappointed and holding on by the ivy fell a nodding again byandby one of the little casements was opened softly he looked up and there was the right face peering out oh what a picture she was in the moonlight and the firelight they both fought for that fair head and each got a share of it the full moons silvery beams shone on her roselike cheeks and lilyfield them a shade and lit her great grey eyes and made them gleam astoundingly but the ruby firelight rushed at her from behind and flowed over her golden hair and reddened and glorified it till it seemed more than mortal and all this in a very pictureframe of snow imagine then how sweet and glorious she glowed on him who loved her and who looked at her perhaps for the last time the sight did wonders to clear his head he stood openmouthed with his heart beating she looked him all over a moment ah said she then quietly i am so glad you are come then kindly and regretfully how pale you look you are unhappy this greeting so gentle and land overpowered griffith his heart was too full to speak kate waited a moment and then as he did not reply to her she began to plead to him i hope you are not angry with me she said i did not want him to leave me your estates i would not rob you of them for the world if i had my way angry with you said griffith im not such a villain mr charlton did the right thing and he could say no more i do not think so said kate but dont you fret all shall be settled to your satisfaction i cannot quite love you but i have a sincere affection for you and so i ought cheer up dear griffith dont you be downhearted about what has happened today griffith smiled i dont feel unhappy he said i did feel as if my heart was broken but then you seemed parted from me now we are together i feel as happy as ever mistress dont you ever shut that window and leave me in the dark again let me stand and look at your sweet face all night and i shall be the happiest man in cumberland ay said kate blushing at his ardor happy for a single night but when i go away you will be in the dumps again and perhaps get tipsy as if that could mend matters nay i must set your happiness on stronger legs than that do you know i have got permission to undo this cruel will and let you have bolton hall and hernshaw again griffith looked pleased but rather puzzled kate went on but not so glibly now however said she a little nervously there is one condition to it that will cost us both some pain if you consent to accept those two estates from me who dont value them one straw why then she hesitated well what he gasped why then my poor griffith we shall be bound in honoryou and inot to meet for some months perhaps for a whole year in one worddo not hate menot till you can bear to see meanothermanswife the murder being out she hid her face in her hands directly and in that attitude awaited his reply griffith stood petrified a moment and i dont think his intellects were even yet quite clear enough to take it all in at once but at last he did comprehend it and when he did he just uttered a loud cry of agony and then turned his back on her without a word man does not speak by words alone a mute glance of reproach has ere now pierced the heart a tirade would have left untouched and even an inarticulate cry may utter volumes such an eloquent cry was that with which griffith gaunt turned his back upon the angelical face he adored and the soft persuasive tongue there was agony there was shame there was wrath all in that one ejaculation it frightened kate she called him back dont leave me so she said i know i have affronted you but i meant all for the best do not let us part in anger at this griffith returned in violent agitation it is your fault for making me speak he cried i was going away without a word as a man should that is insulted by a woman you heartless girl what you bid me sell you to that man for two dirty farms oh well you know bolton and hernshaw were but the steps by which i hoped to climb to you and now you tell me to part with you and take those miserable acres instead of my darling ah mistress you have never loved or you would hate yourself and despise yourself for what you have done love if you had known what that word means you couldnt look in my face and stab me to the heart like this god forgive you and sure i hope he will for after all it is not your fault that you were born without a heart why kate you are crying chapter xi crying said kate i could cry my eyes out to think what i have done but it is not my fault they egged me on i knew you would fling those two miserable things in my face if i did and i said so but they would be wiser than me and insist on my putting you to the proof they who is they no matter whoever it was they will gain nothing by it and you will lose nothing ah griffith i am so ashamed of myselfand so proud of you they repeated griffith suspiciously who is this they what does that matter so long as it was not me are you going to be jealous again let us talk of you and me and never mind who them is you have rejected my proposal with just scorn so now let me hear yours for we must agree on something this very night tell me now what can i say or do to make you happy griffith was sore puzzled alas sweet kate said he i dont know what you can do for me now except stay single for my sake i should like nothing better replied kate warmly but unfortunately they wont let me do that father francis will be at me tomorrow and insist on my marrying mr neville but you will refuse i would if i could but find a good excuse excuse why say you dont love him oh they wont allow that for a reason then i am undone sighed griffith no no you are not if i could be brought to pretend i love somebody else and really if i dont quite love you i like you too well to let you be unhappy besides i cannot bear to rob you of these unlucky farms i think there is nothing i would not do rather than that i thinki would ratherdosomething very silly indeed but i suppose you dont want me to do that now why dont you answer me why dont you say something are you drunk sir as they pretend or are you asleep oh i cant speak any plainer this is intolerable mr gaunt im going to shut the window griffith got alarmed and it sharpened his wits kate kate he cried what do you mean am i in a dream would you marry poor me after all how on earth can i tell till i am asked inquired kate with an air of childlike innocence and inspecting the stars attentively kate will you marry me said griffith all in a flutter of course i willif you will let me replied kate coolly but rather tenderly too griffith burst into raptures kate listened to them with a complacent smile then delivered herself after this fashionyou have very little to thank me for dear griffith i dont exactly downright love you but i could not rob you of those unlucky farms and you refuse to take them back any way but this so what can i do and then for all i dont love you i find i am always unhappy if you are unhappy and happy when you are happy so it comes pretty much to the same thing i declare i am sick of giving you pain and a little sick of crying in consequence there i have cried more in the last fortnight than in all my life before and you know nothing spoils ones beauty like crying and then you are so good and kind and true and brave and everybody is so unjust and so unkind to you papa and all you were quite in the right about the duel dear he is an impudent puppy and i threw dust in your eyes and made you own you were in the wrong and it was a great shame of me but it was because i liked you best i could take liberties with you dear and you are wounded for me and now i have disinherited you oh i cant bear it and i wont my heart yearns for you bleeds for you i would rather die than you should be unhappy i would rather follow you in rags round the world than marry a prince and make you wretched yes dear i am yours make me your wife and then some day i daresay i shall love you as i ought she had never showed her heart to him like this before and now it overpowered him so being also a little under vinous influence he stammered out something and then fairly blubbered with joy then what does kate do but cry for company presently to her surprise he was half way up the turret coming to her oh take care take care she cried youll break your neck nay cried he i must come at you if i die for it the turret was ornamented from top to bottom with short ledges consisting of half bricks this ledge shallow as it was gave a slight foothold insufficient in itself but he grasped the strong branches of the ivy with a powerful hand and so between the two contrived to get up and hang himself out close to her sweet mistress said he put out your hand to me for i cant take it against your will this time i have got but one arm but this she declined no no said she you do nothing but torment and terrify methere and so gave it him and he mumbled it this last feat won her quite she thought no other man could have got to her there with two arms and griffith had done it with one she said to herself how he loves me more than his own neck and then she thought i shall be wife to a strong man that is one comfort in this softened mood she asked him demurely would he take a friends advice if that friend is you ay then said she ill do a downright brazen thing now my hand is in i declare ill tell you how to secure me you make me plight my troth with you this minute and exchange rings with you whether i like or not engage my honor in this foolish business and if you do that i really do think you will have me in spite of them all but therelaam i worth all this trouble griffith did not share this chilling doubt he poured forth his gratitude and then told her he had got his mothers ring on his finger i meant to ask you to wear it said he and why didnt you because you became an heiress all of a sudden well what signifies which of us has the dross so that there is enough for both that is true said griffith approving his own sentiment but not recognizing his own words heres my mothers ring on my little finger sweet mistress but i must ask you to draw it off for i have but one hand kate made a wry face well that is my fault said she or i would not take it from you so she drew off his ring and put it on her finger then she gave him her largest ring and had to put it on his little finger for him you are making a very forward girl of me said she pouting exquisitely he kissed her hand while she was doing it dont you be so silly said she and you horrid creature how you smell of wine the bullet please the bullet exclaimed griffith what bullet the bullet the one you were wounded with for my sake i am told you put it in your pocket and i see something bulge in your waistcoat that bullet belongs to me now i think you are a witch said he i do carry it about next my heart take it out of my waistcoat if you will be so good she blushed and declined and with the refusal on her very lips fished it out with her taper fingers she eyed it with a sort of tender horror the sight of it made her feel faint a moment she told him so and that she would keep it to her dying day presently her delicate finger found something was written on it she did not ask him what it was but withdrew and examined it by her candle griffith had engraved it with these words i love kate he looked through the window and saw her examine it by the candle as she read the inscription her face glorified by the light assumed a celestial tenderness he had never seen it wear before she came back and leaned eloquently out as if she would fly to him ah griffith griffith she murmured and somehow or other their lips met in spite of all the difficulties and grew together in a long and tender embrace it was the first time she had ever given him more than her hand to kiss and the rapture repaid him for all but as soon as she had made this great advance virginal instinct suggested a proportionate retreat you must go to bed she said austerely you will catch your death of cold out here he remonstrated she insisted he held out she smiled sweetly in his face and shut the window in it pretty sharply and disappeared he went disconsolately down his ivy ladder as soon as he was at the bottom she opened the window again and asked him demurely if he would do something to oblige her he replied like a lover he was ready to be cut in pieces drawn asunder with wild horses and so on oh i know you would do anything stupid for me said she but will you do something clever for a poor girl that is in a fright at what she is going to do for you give your orders mistress said griffith and dont talk of me obliging you i feel quite ashamed to hear you talk so tonight especially well then said kate first and foremost i want you to throw yourself on father franciss neck ill throw myself on father franciss neck said griffith stoutly is that all no nor half once upon his neck you must say something therei had better settle the very words or perhaps you will make a mess of it say after me now oh father francis tis to you i owe her oh father francis tis to you i owe her you and i are friends for life you and i are friends for life and mind there is always a bed in our home for you and a plate at our table and a right welcome come when you will griffith repeated this last correctly but when requested to say the whole broke down kate had to repeat the oration a dozen times and he said it after her like a sundayschool scholar till he had it pat the task achieved he inquired of her what father francis was to say in reply at this question kate showed considerable alarm gracious heavens she cried you must not stop talking to him he will turn you inside out and i shall be undone nay you must gabble those words out and then run away as hard as you can gallop but is it true asked griffith is he so much my friend hum said kate it is quite true and he is not at all your friend there dont you puzzle yourself and pester me but do as you are bid or we are both undone quelled by a menace so mysterious griffith promised blind obedience and kate thanked him and bade him goodnight and ordered him peremptorily to bed he went she beckoned him back he came she leaned out and inquired in a soft delicious whisper as follows are you happy dearest ay kate the happiest of the happy then so am i she murmured and now she slowly closed the window and gradually retired from the eyes of her enraptured lover chapter xii but while griffith was thus sweetly employed his neglected guests were dispersing not without satirical comments on their truant host two or three however remained and slept in the house upon special invitation and that invitation came from squire peyton he chose to conclude that griffith disappointed by the will had vacated the premises in disgust and had left him in charge of them accordingly he assumed the master with alacrity and ordered beds for neville and father francis and major rickards and another the weather was inclement and the roads heavy so the gentlemen thus distinguished accepted mr peytons offer cordially there were a great many things sung and said at the festive board in the course of the evening but very few of them would amuse or interest the reader as they did the hearers one thing however must not be passed by as it had its consequences major rickards drank bumpers apiece to the king the prince church and state the army the navy and kate peyton by the time he got to her twothirds of his discretion had oozed away in loyalty esprit du corps and port wine so he sang the young ladys praises in vinous terms and of course immortalized the very exploit she most desired to consign to oblivion arma viraginemque canebat he sang the duel and in a style which i could not consistently with the interests of literature reproduce on a larger scale hasten we to the concluding versicles of his song so then sir we placed our men for the third time and you may take my word for it one or both of these heroes would have bit the dust at that discharge but by jove sir just as they were going to pull trigger in galloped your adorable daughter and swooned off her foaming horse in the middle of us disarmed us sir in a moment melted our valor bewitched our senses and the great god of war had to retreat before little cupid and the charms of beauty in distress little idiot observed the tender parent and was much distempered he said no more about it to major rickards but when they all retired for the night he undertook to show father francis his room and sat in it with him a good halfhour talking about kate heres a pretty scandal said he i must marry the silly girl out of hand before this gets wind and you must help me in a word the result of the conference was that kate should be publicly engaged to neville tomorrow and married to him as soon as her months mourning should be over the conduct of the affair was confided to father francis as having unbounded influence with her chapter xiii next morning mr peyton was up betimes in his character of host and ordered the servants about and was in high spirits only they gave place to amazement when griffith gaunt came down and played the host and was in high spirits neville too watched his rival and was puzzled at his radiancy so breakfast passed in general mystification kate who could have thrown a light did not come down to breakfast she was on her defense she made her first appearance out of doors very early in the morning mr peyton in his quality of master had ordered the gardener to cut and sweep the snow off the gravel walk that went round the lawn and on this path miss peyton was seen walking briskly to and fro in the frosty but sunny air griffith saw her first and ran out to bid her goodmorning her reception of him was a farce she made him a stately curtsy for the benefit of the three faces glued against the panes but her words were incongruous you wretch said she dont come here hide about dearest till you see me with father francis ill raise my hand so when you are to cuddle him and fib there make me a low bow and retire he obeyed and the whole thing looked mighty formal and ceremonious from the breakfastroom with your good leave gentlemen said father francis drily i will be the next to pay my respects to her with this he opened the window and stepped out kate saw him and felt very nervous she met him with apparent delight he bestowed his morning benediction on her and then they walked silently side by side on the gravel and from the diningroom window it looked like anything but what it wasa fencing match father francis was the first to break silence he congratulated her on her good fortune and on the advantage it might prove to the true church kate waited quietly till he had quite done and then said what i may go into a convent now that i can bribe the door open the scratch was feline feminine sudden and sharp but alas father francis only smiled at it though not what we call spirituallyminded he was a man of a christian temper not with my good will my daughter said he i am of the same mind still and more than ever you must marry forthwith and rear children in the true faith what a hurry you are in your own conduct has made it necessary why what have i done now no harm it was a good and humane action to prevent bloodshed but the world is not always worthy of good actions people are beginning to make free with your name for your interfering in the duel kate fired up why cant people mind their own business i do not exactly know said the priest coolly nor is it worth inquiring we must take human nature as it is and do for the best you must marry him and stop their tongues kate pretended to reflect i believe you are right said she at last and indeed i must do as you would have me for to tell the truthin an unguarded momenti pitied him sothat i half promised i would indeed said father francis this is the first i have heard of it kate replied that was no wonder for it was only last night she had so committed herself last night said father francis how can that he he was never out of my sight till we went to bed oh there i beg to differ said the lady while you were all tippling in the diningroom he was better employed making love by moonlight and oh what a terrible thing opportunity is and the moon another there what with the moonlightand my pitying him soand all he has suffered for meand my being rich now and having something to give himwe two are engaged see else this was his mothers ring and he has mine mr neville mr neville no my old servant to be sure what do you think i would go and marry for wealth when i have enough and to spare of my own oh what an opinion you must have of me father francis was staggered by this adroit thrust however after a considerable silence he recovered himself and inquired gravely why she had given him no hint of all this the other night when he had diverted her from a convent and advised her to marry neville that you never did ill be sworn said kate father francis reflected not in so many words perhaps but i said enough to show you oh said kate such a matter was too serious for hints and innuendoes if you wanted me to jilt my old servant and wed an acquaintance of yesterday why not say so plainly i dare say i should have obeyed you and been unhappy for life but now my honor is solemnly engaged my faith is plighted and were even you to urge me to break faith and behave dishonorably i should resist i would never take poison and die father francis looked at her steadily and she colored to the brow you are a very apt young lady said he you have outwitted your director that may be my fault as much as yours so i advise you to provide yourself with another director whom you will be unable or unwilling to outwit kates high spirit fell before this she turned her eyes full of tears on him oh do not desert me now that i shall need you more than ever to guide me in my new duties forgive me i did not know my own heartquite ill go into a convent now if i must but i cant marry any man but poor griffith ah father he is more generous than any of us would you believe it when he thought bolton and hernshaw were coming to him he said if i married him i should have the money to build a convent with he knows how fond i am of a convent he was jesting his religion would not allow it his religion cried kate then lifting her eyes to heaven and looking just like an angel love is his religion said she warmly then his religion is heathenism said the priest grimly nay there is too much charity in it for that retorted kate keenly then she looked down like a cunning guilty thing and murmured one of the things i esteem him for is he always speaks well of you to be sure just now the poor soul thinks you are his best friend with me but that is my fault i as good as told him so and it is true after a fashion for you kept me out of the convent that was his only real rival why here he comes oh father now dont you go and tell him you side with mr neville at this crisis griffith who to tell the truth had received a signal from kate rushed at father francis and fell upon his neck and said with great rapidity oh father francis tis to you i owe heryou and i are friends for life so long as we have a house there is a bed in it for you and whilst we have a table to sit down to theres a plate at it for you and a welcome come when you will having gabbled these words he winked at kate and fled swiftly father francis was taken aback a little by this sudden burst of affection first he staredthen he knitted his browsthen he pondered kate stole a look at him and her eyes sought the ground that is the gentleman you arranged matters with last night said he drily yes replied kate faintly was this scene part of the business oh father why i ask he did it so unnatural mr gaunt is a worthy hospitable gentleman he and i are very good friends and really i never doubted that i should be welcome in his houseuntil this moment and can you doubt it now almost his manner just now was so hollow so forced not a word of all that came from his heart you know then his heart is changed very lately the priest shook his head anything more like a puppet and a parrot to boot i never saw twas done so timely too he ran in upon our discourse let me see your hand mistress why where is the string with which you pulled yonder machine in so pat upon the word spare me muttered kate faintly then do you drop deceit and the silly cunning of your sex and speak to me from your heart or not at all diapason at this kate began to whimper father she said show me some mercy then suddenly clasping her hands have pity on him and on me this time nature herself seemed to speak and the eloquent cry went clean through the priests heart ah said he and his own voice trembled a little now you are as strong as your cunning was weak come i see how it is with you and i am human and have been young and a lover into the bargain before i was a priest there dry thy eyes child and go to thy room he thou couldst not trust shall bear the brunt for thee this once then kate bowed her fair head and kissed the horrid paw of him that had administered so severe but salutary a pat she hurried away upstairs right joyful at the unexpected turn things had taken father francis thus converted to her side lost no time he walked into the diningroom and told neville he had bad news for him summon all your courage my young friend he said with feeling and remember that this world is full of disappointments neville said nothing but rose and stood rather pale waiting like a man for the blow its nature he more than half guessed he had been at the window it fell she is engaged to gaunt since last night and she loves him the doublefaced jade cried peyton with an oath the heartless coquette groaned neville father francis made excuses for hernay nay she is not the first of her sex that did not know her own mind all at once besides we men are blind in matters of love perhaps a woman would have read her from the first after all she was not bound to give us the eyes to read a female heart he next reminded neville that gaunt had been her servant for years you knew that said he yet you came between themat your peril put yourself in his place say you had succeeded would not his wrong be greater than yours is now come be brave be generous he is wounded he is disinherited only his love is left him tis the poor mans lamb and would you take it oh i have not a word to say against the man said george with a mighty effort and what use quarreling with a woman suggested the practical priest none whatever said george sullenly after a moments silence he rang the bell feverishly order my horse round directly said he then he sat down and buried his face in his hands and did not and could not listen to the voice of consolation now the house was full of spies in petticoats amateur spies that ran and told the mistress everything of their own accord to curry favor and this no doubt was the cause that just as the groom walked the piebald out of the stable towards the hall door a maid came to father francis with a little note he opened it and found these words written faintly in a fine italian hand i scarce knew my own heart till i saw him wounded and poor and myself rich at his expense entreat mr neville to forgive me he handed the note to neville without a word neville read it and his lip trembled but he said nothing and presently went out into the hall and put on his hat for he saw his nag at the door father francis followed him and said sorrowfully what not one word in reply to so humble a request well heres my reply said george grinding his teeth she knows french though she pretends not le bruit est pour le fat la plainte est pour le sot lhonnte homme tromp sloigne et ne dit mot and with this he galloped furiously away he buried himself at nevilles cross for several days and would neither see nor speak to a soul his heart was sick his pride lacerated he even shed some scalding tears in secret though to look at him that seemed impossible so passed a bitter week and in the course of it he bethought him of the tears he had made a true italian lady shed and never pitied her a grain till now he was going abroad on his desk lay a little crumpled paper it was kates entreaty for forgiveness he had ground it in his hand and ridden away with it now he was going away he resolved to answer her he wrote a letter full of bitter reproaches read it over and tore it up he wrote a satirical and cutting letter read it and tore it up he wrote her a mawkish letter read it and tore it up the priests words scorned at first had sunk into him a little he walked about the room and tried to see it all like a bystander he examined her writing closely the pen had scarcely marked the paper they were the timidest strokes the writer seemed to kneel to him he summoned all his manhood his fortitude his generosity and above all his highbreeding and produced the following letter and this one he sent mistress katei leave england today for your sake and shall never return unless the day shall come when i can look on you but as a friend the love that ends in hate that is too sorry a thing to come betwixt you and me if you have used me ill your punishment is this you have given me the right to say to youi forgive you george neville and he went straight to italy kate laid his note upon her knee and sighed deeply and said poor fellow how noble of him what can such men as this see in any woman to go and fall in love with her griffith found her with a tear in her eye he took her out walking and laid all his radiant plans of wedded life before her she came back flushed and beaming with complacency and beauty old peyton was brought to consent to the marriage only he attached one condition that bolton and hernshaw should be settled on kate for her separate use to this griffith assented readily but kate refused plump what give him myself and then grudge him my estates said she with a look of lofty and beautiful scorn at her male advisers but father francis having regard to the temporal interests of his church exerted his strength and pertinacity and tired her out so those estates were put into trustees hands and tied up as tight as wax this done griffith gaunt and kate peyton were married and made the finest pair that wedded in the county that year as the bells burst into a merry peal and they walked out of church man and wife their path across the churchyard was strewed thick with flowers emblematic no doubt of the path of life that lay before so handsome a couple they spent the honeymoon in london and tasted earthly felicity yet did not quarrel after it but subsided into the quiet complacency of wedded life chapter xiv mr and mrs gaunt lived happily togetheras times went a fine girl and boy were born to them and need i say how their hearts expanded and exulted and seemed to grow twice as large the little boy was taken from them at three years old and how can i convey to any but a parent the anguish of that first bereavement well they suffered it together and that poignant grief was one tie more between them for many years they did not furnish any exciting or even interesting matter to this narrator and all the better for them without these happy periods of dulness our lives would be hell and our hearts eternally bubbling and boiling in a huge pot made hot with thorns in the absence of striking incidents it may be well to notice the progress of character and note the tiny seeds of events to come neither the intellectual nor the moral character of any person stands stockstill a man improves or he declines mrs gaunt had a great taste for reading mr gaunt had not what was the consequence at the end of seven years the ladys understanding had made great strides the gentlemans had apparently retrograded now we all need a little excitement and we all seek it and get it by hook or by crook the girl who satisfies that natural craving with what the canting dunces of the day call a sensational novel and the girl who does it by waltzing till daybreak are sisters only one obtains the result intellectually and the other obtains it like a young animal and a pain in her empty head next day mrs gaunt could enjoy company but was never dull with a good book mr gaunt was a pleasant companion but dull out of company so rather than not have it he would go to the parlor of the red lion and chat and sing with the yeomen and rollicking young squires that resorted thither and this was matter of grief and astonishment to mrs gaunt it was balanced by good qualities she knew how to appreciate morals were much looser then than now and more than one wife of her acquaintance had a rival in the village or even among her own domestics but griffith had no loose inclinations of that kind and never gave her a moments uneasiness he was constancy and fidelity in person sobriety had not yet been invented but griffith was not so intemperate as most squires he could always mount the stairs to tea and generally without staggering he was uxorious and it used to come out after his wine this mrs gaunt permitted at first but byandby says she expanding her delicate nostrils you may be as affectionate as you please dear and you may smell of wine if you will but please not to smell of wine and be affectionate at the same moment i value your affection too highly to let you disgust me with it and the model husband yielded to this severe restriction and as it never occurred to him to give up his wine he forebode to be affectionate in his cups one great fear mrs gaunt had entertained before marriage ceased to haunt her now and then her quick eye saw griffith writhe at the great influence her director had with her but he never spoke out to offend her and she like a good wife saw smiled and adroitly tenderly soothed and this was nothing compared to what she had feared griffith saw his wife admired by other men yet never chid nor chafed the merit of this belonged in a high degree to herself the fact is that kate peyton even before marriage was not a coquette at heart though her conduct might easily bear that construction and she was now an experienced matron and knew how to be as charming as ever yet check or parry all approaches of gallantry on the part of her admirers then griffith observed how delicate and prudent his lovely wife was without ostentatious prudery and his heart was at peace he was the happier of the two for he looked up to his wife as well as loved her whereas she was troubled at times with a sense of superiority to her husband she was amiable enough and wise enough to try and shut her eyes to it and often succeeded but not always upon the whole they were a contented couple though the ladys dreamy eyes seemed still to be exploring earth and sky in search of something they had not yet found even in wedded life they lived at hernshaw a letter had been found among mr charltont papers explaining his will he counted on their marrying and begged them to live at the castle he had left it on his wifes death it reminded him too keenly of happier days but as he drew near his end and must leave all earthly things he remembered the old house with tenderness and put out his dying hand to save it from falling into decay unfortunately considerable repairs were needed and as kates property was tied up so tight griffiths two thousand pounds went in repairing the house lawn park railings and walled gardens went every penny and left the bridge over the lake still in a battered rotten and in a word picturesque condition this lake was by the older inhabitants sometimes called the mere and sometimes the fishpools it resembled an hourglass in shape only curved like a crescent in medieval times it had no doubt been a main defense of the place it was very deep in parts especially at the waist or narrow that was spanned by the decayed bridge there were hundreds of carp and tench in it older than any be in cumberland and also enormous pike and eels and fish from one to five pounds weight by the million the water literally teemed from end to end and this was a great comfort to so good a catholic as mrs gaunt when she was seized with a desire to fast and that was pretty often the gardener just went down to the lake and flung a castingnet in some favorite hole and drew out half a bushel the first cast or planted a fluenet round a patch of weeds then belabored the weeds with a long pole and a score of fine fish were sure to run out into the meshes the mere was clear as plate glass and came to the edge of the shaven lawn and reflected flowers turf and overhanging shrubs deliciously yet an ill name brooded over its seductive waters for two persons had been drowned in it during the last hundred years and the last one was the parson of the parish returning from the squires dinner in the normal condition of a guest at that epoch but what most affected the popular mind was not the jovial soul hurried into eternity but the material circumstance that the greedy pike had cleared the flesh off his bones in a single night so that little more than a skeleton with here and there a black rag hanging to it had been recovered next morning this ghastly detail being stoutly maintained and constantly repeated by two ancient eyewitnesses whose one melodramatic incident and treasure it was the rustic mind saw no beauty whatever in those pellucid waters where flowers did glass themselves as for the women of the village they looked on this sheet of water as a trap for their poor bodies and those of their children and spoke of it as a singular hardship in their lot that hernshaw mere had not been filled up threescore years agone the castle itself was no castle nor had it been for centuries it was just a house with battlements but attached to the stable was an old square tower that really had formed part of the medieval castle however that unsubstantial shadow a name is often more durable than the thing especially in rural parts but indeed what is there in a name for times teeth to catch hold of though no castle it was a delightful abode the drawingroom and diningroom had both spacious bay windows opening on to the lawn that sloped very gradually down to the clear lake and there was mirrored on this sweet lawn the inmates and guests walked for sun and mellow air and often played bowls at eventide on the other side was the drive up to the house door and a sweep or small oval plot of turf surrounded by gravel and a gate at the corner of this sweep opened into a grove of the grandest old spruce firs in the island this grove dismal in winter and awful at night was deliciously cool and sombre in the dog days the trees were spires and their great stems stood serried like infantry in column and flung a mighty canopy of sombre plumes over head a strange antique and classic grovenulli penetrabilis astro this retreat was enclosed on three sides by a wall and on the east side came nearly to the house a few laurel bushes separated the two at night it was shunned religiously on account of the ghosts even by daylight it was little frequented except by one person and she took to it amazingly that person was mrs gaunt there seems to be even in educated women a singular instinctive love of twilight and here was twilight at high noon the place too suited her dreamy meditative nature hither then she often retired for peace and religious contemplation and moved slowly in and out among the tall stems or sat still with her thoughtful brow leaned on her white hand till the cool umbrageous retreat got to be called among the servants the dames haunt this i think is all needs to be told about the mere place where the gaunts lived comfortably many years and little dreamed of the strange events in store for them little knew the passions that slumbered in their own bosoms and like other volcanoes bided their time end of vol i griffith gaunt or jealousy by charles reade in three volumes vol ii london

xiv chapter xv chapter xvi chapter xvii chapter i one day at dinner father francis let them know that he was ordered to another part of the county and should no longer be able to enjoy their hospitality i am sorry for it said griffith heartily and mrs gaunt echoed him out of politeness but when husband and wife came to talk it over in private she let out all of a sudden and for the first time that the spiritual coldness of her governor had been a great misfortune to her all these years his mind said she is set on earthly things instead of helping the angels to raise my thoughts to heaven and heavenly things he drags me down to earth oh that mans soul was born without wings griffith ventured to suggest that francis was nevertheless an honest man and no mischiefmaker mrs gaunt soon disposed of this oh there are plenty of honest men in the world said she but in ones spiritual director one needs something more than that and i have pined for it like a thirsty soul in the desert all these years poor good man i love him dearly but thank heaven he is going the next time francis came mrs gaunt took an opportunity to inquire but in the most delicate way who was to be his successor well said he i fear you will have no one for the present i mean no one very fit to direct you in practical matters but in all that tends directly to the welfare of the soul you will have one young in years but old in good works and very much my superior in piety i think you do yourself injustice father said mrs gaunt sweetly she was always polite and to be always polite you must be sometimes insincere no my daughter said father francis quietly thank god i know my own defects and they teach me a little humility i discharge my religious duties punctually and find them wholesome and composing but i lack that holy unction that spiritual imagination by which more favoured christians have fitted themselves to converse with angels i have too much body i suppose and too little soul i own to you that i cannot look forward to the hour of death as a happy release from the burden of the flesh life is pleasant to me immortality tempts me not the pure in heart delight me but in the sentimental part of religion i feel myself dry and barren i fear god and desire to do his will but i cannot love him as the saints have done my spirit is too dull too gross i have often been unable to keep pace with you in your pious and lofty aspirations and this softens my regret at quitting you for you will be in better hands my daughter mrs gaunt was touched by her old friends humility and gave him both hands with the tears in her eyes but she said nothing the subject was delicate and really she could not honestly contradict him a day or two afterwards he brought his successor to the house a man so remarkable that mrs gaunt almost started at first sight of him born of an italian mother his skin was dark and his eyes coal black yet his ample but symmetrical forehead was singularly white and delicate very tall and spare and both face and figure were of that exalted kind which make ordinary beauty seem dross in short he was one of those ethereal priests the roman catholic church produces every now and then by way of incredible contrast to the thickset peasants in black that form her staple this brother leonard looked and moved like a being who had come down from some higher sphere to pay the world a very little visit and be very kind and patient with it all the time he was presented to mrs gaunt and bowed calmly coldly and with a certain mixture of humility and superiority and gave her but one tranquil glance then turned his eyes inward as before mrs gaunt on the contrary was almost fluttered at being presented so suddenly to one who seemed to her religion embodied she blushed and looked timidly at him and was anxious not to make an unfavourable impression she found it however very difficult to make any impression at all leonard had no small talk and met her advances in that line with courteous monosyllables and when she upon this turned and chatted with father francis he did not wait for an opening to strike in but sought a shelter from her commonplaces in his own thoughts then mrs gaunt yielded to her genuine impulse and began to talk about the prospects of the church and what might be done to reconvert the british isles to the true faith her cheek flushed and her eye shone with the theme and francis smiled paternally but the young priest drew back mrs gaunt saw in a moment that he disapproved of a woman meddling with so high a matter uninvited if he had said so she had spirit enough to have resisted but the cold lofty look of polite but grave disapproval dashed her courage and reduced her to silence she soon recovered so far as to be piqued she gave her whole attention to francis and on parting with her guests she curtsied coldly to leonard and said to francis ah my dear friend i foresee i shall miss you terribly i am afraid this pretty speech was intended as a side cut at leonard but on the impassive ice the lightnings play her new confessor retired and left her with a sense of inferiority which would have been pleasing to her womans nature if leonard himself had appeared less conscious of it and had shown ever so little approval of herself but impressed upon her too sharply it piqued and mortified her however like a gallant champion she awaited another encounter she so rarely failed to please she could not accept defeat father francis departed mrs gaunt soon found that she really missed him she had got into a habit of running to her confessor twice a week and to her director nearly every day that he did not come of his own accord to her her good sense showed her at once she must not take up brother leonards time in this way she went a long while for her without confession at last she sent a line to leonard asking him when it would be convenient to him to confess her leonard wrote back to say that he received penitents in the chapel for two hours after matins every monday tuesday and saturday this implied first come first served and was rather galling to mrs gaunt however she rode one morning with her groom behind her and had to wait until an old woman in a red cloak and black bonnet was first disposed of she confessed a heap and presently the soft but chill tones of brother leonard broke in with these freezing words my daughter excuse me but confession is one thing gossip about ourselves is another this distinction was fine but fatal the next minute the fair penitent was in her carriage her eyes filled with tears of mortification the man is a spiritual machine said she and her pride was mortified to the core in these happy days she used to open her heart to her husband and she went so far as to say some bitter little feminine things of her new confessor before him he took no notice at first but at last he said one day well i am of your mind he is very poor company compared with that jovial old blade francis but why so many words kate you dont use to bite twice at a cherry if the milksop is not to your taste give him the sack and be hanged to him and with this homely advice squire gaunt dismissed the matter and went to the stable to give his mare a ball so you see mrs gaunt was discontented with francis for not being an enthusiast and nettled with leonard for being one the very next sunday morning she went and heard leonard preach his first sermon was an era in her life after twenty years of pulpit prosers there suddenly rose before her a sacred orator an orator born blest with that divine and thrilling eloquence that no heart can really resist he prepared his great theme with art at first but once warm it carried him away and his hearers went with him like so many straws on the flood and in the exercise of this great gift the whole man seemed transfigured abroad he was a languid rather slouching priest who crept about a picture of delicate humility but with a shade of meanness for religious prejudice apart it is ignoble to sweep the wall in passing as he did and eye the ground but once in the pulpit his figure rose and swelled majestically and seemed to fly over them all like a guardian angels his sallow cheek burned his great italian eye shot black lightning at the impenitent and melted ineffably when he soothed the sorrowful observe that great mean brown bird in the zoological gardens which sits so tame on its perch and droops and slouches like a drowsy duck that is the great and soaring eagle who would believe it to look at him yet all he wants is to be put in his right place instead of his wrong he is not himself in mans cages belonging to gods sky even so leonard was abroad in the world but at home in the pulpit and so he somewhat crept and slouched about the parish but soared like an eagle in his native air mrs gaunt sat thrilled enraptured melted she hung upon his words and when they ceased she still sat motionless spellbound loath to believe that accents so divine could really come to an end even whilst all the rest were dispersing she sat quite still and closed her eyes for her soul was too highstrung now to endure the chitchat she knew would attack her on the road homechitchat that had been welcome enough coming home from other preachers and by this means she came hot and undiluted to her husband she laid her white hand on his shoulder and said oh griffith i have heard the voice of god griffith looked alarmed and rather shocked than elated mrs gaunt observed that and tacked on speaking by the lips of his servant but she fired again the next moment and said the grave hath given us back st paul in the churchs need and i have heard him this day good heavens where at st marys chapel then griffith looked very incredulous then she gushed out with what because it is a small chapel you think a great saint cannot be in it why our saviour was born in a stable if you go to that well but my dear consider said griffith who ever heard of comparing a living man to st paul for preaching why he was an apostle for one thing and there are no apostles nowadays he made felix tremble on his throne and almost persuaded whatsename another heathen gentleman to be a christian that is true said the lady thoughtfully but he sent one man that we know of to sleep catch brother leonard sending any man to sleep and then nobody will ever say of him that he was long preaching why i do say it replied griffith by the same token i have been waiting dinner for you this halfhour along of his preaching ah thats because you did not hear him retorted mrs gaunt if you had it would have seemed too short and you would have forgotten all about your dinner for once griffith made no reply he even looked vexed at her enthusiastic admiration she saw and said no more but after dinner she retired to the grove and thought of the sermon and the preacher thought of them all the more that she was discouraged from enlarging on them and it would have been kinder and also wiser of griffith if he had encouraged her to let out her heart to him on this subject although it did not happen to interest him a husband should not chill an enthusiastic wife and above all should never separate himself from her favourite topic when she loves him well enough to try and share it with him mrs gaunt however though her feelings were quick was not cursed with a sickly or irritable sensibility nor on the other hand was she one of those lovely little bores who cannot keep their tongues off their favourite theme she quietly let the subject drop for a whole week but the next sunday morning she asked her husband if he would do her a little favour im more likely to say ay than nay was the cheerful reply it is just to go to chapel with me and then you can judge for yourself griffith looked rather sheepish at this proposal and said he could not very well do that why not dearest just for once well you see parties run so high in this parish and everything one does is noted why if i was to go to chapel theyd say directly look at griffith gaunt he is so tied to his wifes apron he is going to give up the faith of his ancestors the faith of your ancestors that is a good jest the faith of your grandfather at the outside the faith of your ancestors was the faith of mine and me well dont let us differ about a word said griffith you know what i mean did ever i ask you to go to church with me and if i were to ask you would you go mrs gaunt coloured but would not give in that is not the same thing said she i do profess religion you do not you scarce think of god on week days and indeed never mention his name except in the way of swearing and on sunday you go to churchfor what to doze before dinner you know you do come now with you tis no question of religion but just of nap or no nap for brother leonard wont let you sleep i warn you fairly griffith shook his head you are too hard on me wife i know i am not so good as you are and never shall be but that is not the fault of the protestant faith which hath reared so many holy men and some of em our ancestors burnt alive and will burn in hell themselves for the deed but look you sweetheart if im not a saint im a gentleman and say i wear my faith loose i wont drag it in the dirt none the more for that so you must excuse me mrs gaunt was staggered and if griffith had said no more i think she would have withdrawn her request and so the matter ended but persons unversed in argument can seldom let well alone and this simple squire must needs go on to say besides kate it would come to the parsons ears and he is a friend of mine you know why i shall be sure to meet him tomorrow ay retorted the lady by the coverside well when you do tell him you refused your wife your company for fear of offending the religious views of a foxhunting parson nay kate said griffith this is not to ask thy man to go with thee tis to say go he must willy nilly with that he rose and rang the bell order the chariot said he i am to go with our dame mrs gaunts face beamed with gratified pride and affection the chariot came round and griffith handed his dame in he then gave an involuntary sigh and followed her with a hangdog look she heard the sigh and saw the look and laid her hand quickly on his shoulder and said gently but coldly stay you at home my dear we shall meet at dinner as you will said he cheerfully and they went their several ways he congratulated himself on her clemency and his own escape she went along sorrowful at having to drink so great a bliss alone and thought it unkind and stupid of griffith not to yield with a good grace if he could yield at all and indeed women seem cleverer than men in this that when they resign their wills they do it graciously and not by halves perhaps they are more accustomed to knock under and you know practice makes perfect but every smaller feeling was swept away by the preacher and mrs gaunt came home full of pious and lofty thoughts she found her husband seated at the dinnertable with one turnip before him and even that was not comestible for it was his grandfathers watch with a face about the size of a newborn childs fortyfive minutes past one kate said he ruefully well why not bid them serve the dinner said she with an air of consummate indifference what dine alone o sunday why you know i couldnt eat a morsel without you set opposite mrs gaunt smiled affectionately well then my dear we had better order dinner an hour later next sunday but that will upset the servants and spoil their sunday and am i to be their slave said mrs gaunt getting a little warm dinner dinner what shall i starve my soul by hurrying away from the oracles of god to a sirloin oh these gross appetites how they deaden the immortal half and wall out heavens music for my part i wish there was no such thing as eating and drinking tis like falling from heaven down into the mud to come back from such divine discourse and be greeted with dinner dinner dinner the next sunday after waiting half an hour for her griffith began his dinner without her and this time on her arrival instead of remonstrating with her he excused himself nothing said he upsets a mans temper like waiting for his dinner well but you have not waited yes i did a good halfhour till i could wait no longer well dear if i were you i would not have waited at all or else waited till your wife came home ah dame that is all very well for you to say you could live on hearing of sermons and smelling to rosebuds you dont know what tis to be a hungry man the next sunday he sat sadly down and finished his dinner without her and she came home and sat down to halfempty dishes and ate much less than she used when she had him to keep her company in it griffith looking on disconsolate told her she was more like a bird pecking than a christian eating of a sunday no matter child said she so long as my soul is filled with the bread of heaven leonards eloquence suffered no diminution either in quantity or quality and after a while gaunt gave up his rule of never dining abroad on the sunday if his wife was not punctual his stomach was and he had not the same temptation to dine at home he used to have and indeed by degrees instead of quietly enjoying his wifes company on that sweet day he got to see less of her than on the week days chapter ii your mechanical preacher flings his words out happygolucky but the pulpit orator like every other orator feels his peoples pulse as he speaks and vibrates with them and they with him so leonard soon discovered he had a great listener in mrs gaunt she was always there whenever he preached and her rapt attention never flagged her grey eyes never left his face and being upturned the full orbs came out in all their grandeur and seemed an angels come down from heaven to hear him for indeed to a very dark man as leonard was the gentle radiance of a true saxon beauty seems always more or less angelic by degrees this face became a help to the orator in preaching he looked sometimes to it for sympathy and lo it was sure to be melting with sympathy was he led on to higher or deeper thoughts than most of his congregation could understand he looked to this face to understand him and lo it had quite understood him and was beaming with intelligence from a help and an encouragement it became a comfort and a delight to him on leaving the pulpit and cooling he remembered its owner was no angel but a woman of the world and had put to him frivolous questions the illusion however was so beautiful that leonard being an imaginative man was unwilling to dispel it by coming into familiar contact with mrs gaunt so he used to make his assistant visit her and receive her when she came to confess which was very rarely for she was discouraged by her first reception brother leonard lived in a sort of dwarf monastery consisting of two cottages an oratory and a sepulchre the two latter were old but the cottages had been built expressly for him and another seminary priest who had been invited from france inside these cottages were little more than cells only the bigger had a kitchen which was a glorious place compared with the parlour for it was illuminated with bright pewter plates copper vessels brass candlesticks and a nice clean woman with a plain gown kilted over a quilted silk petticoat betty scarf an old servant of mrs gaunts who had married and was now the widow gough she stood at the gate one day as mrs gaunt drove by and curtsied all beaming mrs gaunt stopped the carriage and made some kind and patronizing inquires about her and it ended in betty asking her to come in and see her place mrs gaunt looked a little shy at that and did not move nay they are both abroad till supper time said betty reading her in a moment by the light of sex then mrs gaunt smiled and got out of her carriage betty took her in and showed her everything in doors and out mrs gaunt looked mighty demure and dignified but scanned everything closely only without seeming too curious the cold gloom of the parlour struck her she shuddered and said this would give me the vapours but doubtless angels come and brighten it for him not always said betty i do see him with his head in his hand by the hour and hear him sigh ever so loud as i pass the door why one day he was fain to have me and my spinning wheel aside him says he let me hear thy busy wheel and see thee ply it and welcome says i so i sat in his room and span and he sat a gloating of me as if he had never seen a woman spin hemp afore he is a very simple man and presently says hebut what signifies what he said nay betty if you please i am much interested in him he preaches so divinely ay said betty thats his gift but a poor trencherman and i declare im ashamed to eat all the vittels that are eaten here and me but a woman but what did he say to you that time asked mrs gaunt a little impatiently betty cudgelled her memory well says he my daughter the poor soul always calls me his daughter and me old enough to be his mother mostly says he how comes it that you are never wearied nor cast down and yet you but serve a sinner like yourself but i do often droop in my masters service and he is the lord of heaven and earth says i ill tell ye sir because ye dont eat enough o vittels what an answer why tis the truth dame and says i if i was to be always fasting like as you be dye think i should have the heart to work from morn till night now wasnt i right i dont know till i hear what answer he made said mrs gaunt with mean caution oh he shook his head and said he ate mortal food enow poor simple body but drank too little of grace divine that was his word mrs gaunt was a good deal struck and affected by this revelation and astonished at the slighting tone betty took in speaking of so remarkable a man the saying that no man is a hero to his valet was not yet current or perhaps she would have been less surprised at that alas poor man said she and is it so to hear him i thought his soul was borne up night and day by angels pinions the widow interrupted her ay you hear him preach and it is like gods trumpet mostly and so much i say for him in all companies but i see him directly after he totters into this very room and sits him down pale and panting and one time like to swoon and another all for crying and then he is ever so dull and sad for the whole afternoon and nobody knows this but you you have got my old petticoat still i see i must look you up another you are very good dame i am sure twill not come amiss ive only this for sundays and all no my lady not a soul but me and you im not one as tells tales out of doors but i dont mind you dame you are my old mistress and a discreet woman twill go no further than your ear mrs gaunt told her she might rely on that the widow then inquired after mrs gaunts little girl and admired her dress and described her own ailments and poured out a continuous stream of topics bearing no affinity to each other except that they were all of them not worth mentioning and all the while she thus discoursed mrs gaunts thoughtful eyes looked straight over the chatterboxs white cap and explored vacancy and byandby she broke the current of twaddle with the air of a camelopard marching across a running gutter betsy gough said she i am thinking mrs gough was struck dumb by an announcement so singular i have heard and i have read that great and pious and learned men are often to seek in little simple things such as plain bodies have at their fingers ends so now if you and i could only teach him something for all he has taught us and to be sure we ought to be kind to him if we can for oh betty my woman tis a poor vanity to go and despise the great and the learned and the sainted because forsooth we find them out in some one little weakness we that are all made up of weaknesses and defects so now i sit me down in this very chair so and sit you there now let us you and me look at his room quietly all over and see what is wanting first and foremost methinks this window should be filled with geraniums and jessamine and so forth with all his learning perhaps he has to be taught the colour of flowers and golden green leaves with the sun shining through how it soothes the eye and relieves the spirits yet every woman born knows that then do but see this bare table a purple cloth on that i say which he will fling it out of the window i say nay for ill embroider a cross in the middle with gold braid then a rosecoloured blind would not be amiss and there must be a good mirror facing the window but indeed if i had my way id paint these horrid walls the first thing how you run on dame bless your heart youd turn his den into a palace he wont suffer that he is all for selfmortification poor simple soul oh not all at once i did not mean said mrs gaunt but by little and little you know we must begin with the flowers god made them and so to be sure he will not spurn them betty began to enter into the plot ay ay said she the flowers first and so creep on but nought will avail to make a man of him so long as he eats but of eggs and gardenstuff like the beasts of the field that today are and tomorrow are cast into the oven mrs gaunt smiled at this ambitious attempt of the widow to apply scripture then she said rather timidly could you make his eggs into omelets and so pound in a little meat with your small herbs i dare say he would be none the wiser and he so bent on high and heavenly things you may take your oath of that well then and i shall send you some stock from the castle and you can cook his vegetables in good strong gravy unbeknown the widow gough chuckled aloud but stay said mrs gaunt for us to play the woman so and delude a saint for his mere bodily wealwill it not be a sin and a sacrilege to boot let that flea stick in the wall said betty contemptuously find you the meat and ill find the deceit for he is as poor as a rat into the bargain nay nay god almighty will never have the heart to burn us two for such a trifle why tis no more than cheating a froward child takings physic mrs gaunt got into her carriage and went home thinking all the way what she had heard filled her with feelings strangely but sweetly composed of veneration and pity in that leonard was a great orator and a highminded priest she revered him in that he was solitary and sad she pitied him in that he wanted common sense she felt like a mother and must take him under her wing all true women love to protect perhaps it is a part of the great maternal element but to protect a man and yet look up to him this is delicious leonard in truth was one of those highstrung men who pay for their periods of religious rapture by hours of melancholy this oscillation of the spirits in extraordinary men appears to be more or less a law of nature and this the widow gough was not aware of the very next sunday while he was preaching she and mrs gaunts gardener were filling his bow window with flowerpots the flowers in full bloom and leaf the said window was large and had a broad sill outside and inside one of the old fashioned high windowseats that follow the shape of the window mrs gaunt who did nothing by halves sent up a cartload of flowerpots and betty and the gardener arranged at least eighty of them small and great inside and outside the window when leonard returned from preaching betty was at the door to watch he came past the window with his hands on his breast and his eyes on the ground and never saw the flowers in his own window betty was disgusted however she followed him stealthily as he went to his room and she heard a profound ah burst from him she bustled in and found him standing in a rapture with the blood mantling in his pale cheeks and his dark eyes glowing now blessed be the heart that hath conceived this thing and the hand that hath done it said he my poor room it is a bower of roses all beauty and fragrance and he sat down inhaling them and looking at them and a dreamy tender complacency crept over his heart and softened his noble features exquisitely widow gough red with gratified pride stood watching him and admiring him but indeed she often admired him though she had got into a way of decrying him but at last she lost patience at his want of curiosity that being a defect she was free from herself ye dont ask me who sent them said she reproachfully nay nay said he prithee do not tell me let me divine divine then said betty roughly which i suppose you means guess nay but let me be quiet awhile said he imploringly let me sit down and fancy that i am a holy man and some angel hath turned my cave into a paradise no more an angel than i am said the practical widow but now i think ont yare not to know who twas them as sent them they bade me hold my tongue this was not true but betty being herself given to unwise revelations and superfluous secresy chose suddenly to assume that this business was to be clandestine the priest turned his eye inwards and meditated i see who it is said he with an air of absolute conviction it must be the lady who comes always when i preach and her face like none other it beams with divine intelligence i will make her all the return we poor priests can make to our benefactors i will pray for her soul here among the flowers god has made and she has given his servant to glorify his dwelling my daughter you may retire this last with surprising gentle dignity so betty went off rather abashed and avenged herself by adulterating the holy mans innutritions food with mrs gaunts good gravy while he prayed fervently for her eternal weal among the flowers she had given him now mrs gaunt after eight years of married life was too sensible and dignified a woman to make a romantic mystery out of nothing she concealed the gravy because there secresy was necessary but she never dreamed of hiding that she had sent her spiritual adviser a load of flowers she did not tell her neighbors for she was not ostentatious but she told her husband who grunted but did not object but bettys nonsense lent an air of romance and mystery that was well adapted to captivate the imagination of a young ardent and solitary spirit like leonard he would have called on the lady he suspected and thanked her for her kindness but this he feared would be unwelcome since she chose to be his unknown benefactress it would be ill taste in him to tell her he had found her out it might offend her sensibility and then she would draw in he kept his gratitude therefore to himself and did not cool it by utterance he often sat among the flowers in a sweet reverie enjoying their color and fragrance and sometimes he would shut his eyes and call up the angelical face with great celestial upturned orbs and fancy it among her own flowers and the queen of them all these daydreams did not at that time interfere with his religious duties they only took the place of those occasional hours when partly by the reaction consequent on great religious fervour partly through exhaustion of the body weakened by fasts partly by the natural delicacy of his fibre and the tenderness of his disposition his soul used to be sad byandby these languid hours sad no longer became sweet and dear to him he had something so interesting to think of to dream about he had a madonna that cared for him in secret she was human but good beautiful and wise she came to his sermons and understood every word and she knows me better than i know myself said he since i had these flowers from her hand i am another man one day he came into his room and found two watering pots there one was large and had a rose to it the other small and with a plain spout ah said he and colored with delight he called betty and asked her who had brought them how should i know said she roughly i dare say they dropped from heaven see there is a cross painted on em in gold letters and so there is said leonard and crossed himself that means nobody is to use them but you i trow said betty rather crossly the priests cheek coloured high i will use them this instant said he i will revive my drooping children as they have revived me and he caught up a watering pot with ardour what with the sun hot upon em screamed betty well saving your presence you are a simple man why good betty tis the sun that makes them faint objected the priest timidly and with the utmost humility of manner though bettys tone would have irritated a smaller mind well well said she softening but ye see it never rains with a hot sun and the flowers they know that and look to be watered after nature or else they take it amiss you and all your sort sir you think to be stronger than nature you do fast and pray all day and wont look a woman in the face like other men and now you wants to water the very flowers at noon betty said leonard smiling i yield to thy superior wisdom and i will water them at morn and eve in truth we have all much to learn let us try and teach one another as kindly as we can i wish youd teach me to be as humble as you be blurted out betty with something very like a sob and more respectful to my betters added she angrily watering the flowers she had given him became a solace and a delight to the solitary priest he always watered them with his own hands and felt quite paternal over them one evening mrs gaunt rode by with griffith and saw him watering them his tall figure graceful though inclined to stoop bent over them with feminine delicacy and the simple act which would have been nothing in vulgar hands seemed to mrs gaunt so earnest tender and delicate in him that her eyes filled and she murmured poor brother leonard why whats wrong with him now asked griffith a little peevishly that was him watering his flowers oh is that all said griffith carelessly leonard said to himself i go too little abroad among my people he made a little round and it ended in hernshaw castle mrs gaunt was out he looked disappointed so the servant suggested that perhaps she was in the dames haunt he pointed to the grove leonard followed his direction and soon found himself for the first time in that sombre solemn retreat it was a hot summer day and the grove was delicious it was also a place well suited to the imaginative and religious mind of the italian he walked slowly to and fro in religious meditation indeed he had nearly thought out his next sermon when his meditative eye happened to fall on a terrestrial object that startled and thrilled him yet it was only a ladys glove it lay at the foot of a rude wooden seat beneath a gigantic pine he stooped and picked it up he opened the little fingers and called up in fancy the white and tapering hand that glove could lit he laid the glove softly on his own palm and eyed it with dreamy tenderness so this is the hand that hath solaced my loneliness said he a hand fair as that angelical face and sweet as the kind heart that doeth good by stealth then forgetting for a moment as lofty spirits will the difference between meum and tuum he put the little glove in his bosom and paced thoughtfully home through the woods that were separated from the grove only by one meadow and so he missed the owner of the glove for she had returned home while he was meditating in her favourite haunt leonard amongst his other accomplishments could draw and paint with no mean skill in one of those hours that used to be of melancholy but now were hours of dreamy complacency he took out his pencils and endeavoured to sketch the inspired face that he had learned to preach to and now to dwell on with gratitude clearly as he saw it before him he could not reproduce it to his own satisfaction after many failures he got very near the mark yet still something was wanting then as a last resource he actually took his sketch to church with him and in preaching made certain pauses and with a very few touches perfected the likeness then on his return home threw himself on his knees and prayed forgiveness of god with many sighs and tears and hid the sacrilegious drawing out of his own sight two days after he was at work colouring it and the hours flew by like minutes as he laid the mellow melting tints on with infinite care and delicacy labor ipse voluptas mrs gaunt heard leonard had called on her in person she was pleased at that and it encouraged her to carry out her whole design accordingly one afternoon when she knew leonard would be at vespers she sent on a loaded ponycart and followed it on horseback then it was all hurry scurry with betty and her to get their dark deeds done before their victims return these good creatures set the mirror opposite the flowery window and so made the room a very bower they fixed a magnificent crucifix of ivory and gold over the mantelpiece and they took away his hassock of rashes and substituted a priedieu of rich crimson velvet all that remained was to put their blue cover with its golden cross on the table to do this however they had to remove the priests papers and things they were covered with a baize cloth mrs gaunt felt them under it but perhaps he will be angry if we move his papers said she not he said betty he has no secrets from god or man well i wont take it on me said mrs gaunt merrily i leave that to you and she turned her back and settled the mirror officiously leaving all the other responsibilities to betty the sturdy widow laughed at her scruples and whipped off the clot without ceremony but soon her laugh stopped mighty short and she uttered an exclamation what is the matter said mrs gaunt turning her head sharply round a wenchs glove as im a living sinner groaned betty a poor little glove lay on the table and both women eyed it like basilisks a moment then betty pounced on it and examined it with the fierce keenness of her sex in such conjunctures searching for a name or a clue owing to this rapidity mrs gaunt who stood at some distance had not time to observe the button on the glove or she would have recognized her own property he have had a hussy with him unbeknown said betty and she have left her glove tis easy to get in by the window and out again only let me catch her ill tear her eyes out and give him my mind ill have no young hussies creeping in an out where i be thus spoke the simple woman venting her coarse domestic jealousy the gentlewoman said nothing but a strange feeling traversed her heart for the first time in her life it was a little chill it was a little ache it was a little sense of sickness none of these violent yet all distinct and all about what after this curious novel spasm at the heart she began to be ashamed of herself for having had such a feeling betty held her out the glove and then she recognized it and turned as red as fire you know whose tis said betty keenly mrs gaunt was on her guard in a moment why betty said she for shame tis some penitent hath left her glove after confession would you belie a good man for that oh lie humph said betty doubtfully then why keep it under cover now you can read dame let us see if there isnt a letter or so writ by the hand as owns this very glove mrs gaunt declined with cold dignity to pry into brother leonards manuscripts her eye however darted sidelong at them and told another tale and if she had been there alone perhaps the daughter of eve would have predominated betty inflamed by the glove rummaged the papers in search of female handwriting she could tell that from a mans though she could not read either but there is a handwriting that the most ignorant can read at sight and so bettys researches were not in vain hidden under several sheets of paper she found a picture she gave but one glance at it and screamed outthere didnt i tell you here she is the brazen redhairedlawk a daisy why tis yourself chapter iii me cried mrs gaunt in amazement then she ran to the picture and at sight of it every other sentiment gave way for a moment to gratified vanity nay said she beaming and blushing i was never half so beautiful what heavenly eyes the fellows to em be in your own head dame this moment seeing is believing said mrs gaunt gaily and in a moment she was at the priests mirror and inspected her eyes minutely cocking her head this way and that she ended by shaking it and saying nay he has flattered them prodigiously not a jot said betty if you could see yourself in chapel you do turn em up just so and the white shows all round then she tapped the picture with her finger oh them eyes they were never made for the good of his soul poor simple man betty said this with sudden gravity and now mrs gaunt began to feel very awkward mr gaunt would give fifty pounds for this said she to gain time and while she uttered that sentence she whipped on her armour ill tell you what i think said she calmly he wished to paint a madonna and he must take some womans face to aid his fancy all the painters are driven to that so he just took the best that came to hand and that is not saying much for this is a rare illfavoured parish and he has made an angel of her a very angel there hide me away again or i shall long for meto show to my husband i must be going i wouldnt be caught here now for a pension well if ye must said betty but when will ye come again she hadnt got the petticoat yet humph said mrs gaunt i have done all i can for him and perhaps more than i ought but theres nothing to hinder you from coming to me ill be as good as my word and i have an old paduasoy besides you can do something with it perhaps you are very good dame said betty curtsying mrs gaunt then hurried away and betty looked after her very expressively and shook her head she had a female instinct that mischief was brewing mrs gaunt went home in a reverie at the gate she found her husband and asked him to take a turn in the garden with her he complied and she intended to tell him a portion at least of what had occurred she began timidly after this fashionmy dear brother leonard is so grateful for your flowers and then hesitated im sure he is very welcome said griffith why doesnt he sup with us and be sociable as father francis used invite him let him know he will be welcome sirs gaunt blushed and objected he never calls on us well well every man to his taste said griffith indifferently and proceeded to talk to her about his farm and a sorrel mare with a white mane and tail that he had seen and thought it would suit her she humoured him and affected a great interest in all this and had not the courage to force the other topic on next sunday morning after a very silent breakfast she burst out almost violently griffith i shall go to the parish church with you and then we will dine together afterwards you dont mean it kate said he delighted ay but i do although you refused to go to chapel with me they went to church together and mrs gaunts appearance there created no small sensation she was conscious of that but hid it and conducted herself admirably her mind seemed entirely given to the service and to a dull sermon that followed but at dinner she broke out well give me your church for a sleeping draught you all slumbered more or less those that survived the drowsy droning prayers sank under the dry dull dreary discourse you snored for one nay i hope not my dear you did then as loud as your bass fiddle and you sat there and let me said griffith reproachfully to be sure i did i was too good a wife and too good a christian to wake you sleep is good for the body and twaddle is not good for the soul id have slept too if i could but with me going to chapel im not used to sleep at that time o day you cant sleep and brother leonard speaking in the afternoon came mrs gough all in her best mrs gaunt had her into her bedroom and gave her the promised petticoat and the old peau de soie gown and then as ladies will when their hand is once in added first one thing then another till there was quite a large bundle but how is it you are here so soon asked mrs gaunt oh we had next to no sermon today he couldnt make no hand of it dawdled on a bit then gave us his blessing and bundled us out then ive lost nothing said mrs gaunt not you well i dont know mayhap if you had been there hed have preached his best but la we werent worth it at this conjecture mrs gaunts face burned but she said nothing only she cut the interview short and dismissed betty with her bundle as betty crossed the landing mrs gaunts new ladysmaid caroline ryder stepped accidentally on purpose out of an adjoining room in which she had been lurking and lifted her black brows in affected surprise what are you going to strip the house my woman said she quietly betty put down the bundle and set her arms akimbo there is none ont stolen any way said she carolines black eyes flashed fire at this and her cheek lost colour but she parried the innuendo skilfully taking my perquisites on the sly that is not so very far from stealing oh theres plenty left for you my fine lady besides you dont want her you can set your cap at the master they say im too old for that and too honest into the bargain too illfavoured you mean ye old harridan said ryder contemptuously but for reasons hereafter to be dealt with bettys thrust went home and the pair were mortal enemies from that hour mrs gaunt came down from her room discomposed from that she became restless and irritable so much so indeed that at last sir gaunt told her goodhumouredly enough if going to church made her ill meaning peevish she had better go to chapel you are right said she and so i will the next sunday she was at her post in good time the preacher cast an anxious glance around to see if she was there her quick eye saw that glance and it gave her a demure pleasure this day he was more eloquent than ever and he delivered a beautiful passage concerning those who do good in secret in uttering these eloquent sentences his cheek glowed and he could not deny himself the pleasure of looking down at the lovely face that was turned up to him probably his look was more expressive than he intended the celestial eyes sank under it and were abashed and the fair cheek burned and then so did leonards at that thus subtly yet effectually did these two minds communicate in a crowd that never noticed nor suspected the delicate interchange of sentiment that was going on under their very eyes in a general way compliments did not seduce mrs gaunt she was well used to them for one thing put to be praised in that sacred edifice and from the pulpit and by such an orator as leonard and to be praised in words so sacred and beautiful that the ears around her drank them with delight all this made her heart beat and filled her with soft and sweet complacency and then to be thanked in public yet as it were clandestinely this gratified the furtive tendency of women there was no irritability this afternoon but a gentle radiance that diffused itself on all around and made the whole household happy especially griffith whose pipe she filled for once with her own white hand and talked dogs horses calves hinds cows politics markets hay to please him and seemed interested in them all but the next day she changed ill at ease and out of spirits and could settle to nothing it was very hot for one thing and altogether a sort of lassitude and distaste for everything overpowered her and she retired into the grove and sat languidly on a seat with halfclosed eyes but her meditations were no longer so calm and speculative as heretofore she found her mind constantly recurring to one person and above all to the discovery she had made of her portrait in his possession she had turned it off to betty gough but here in her calm solitude and umbrageous twilight her mind crept out of its cave like wild and timid things at dusk and whispered to her heart that leonard perhaps admired her more than was safe or prudent then this alarmed her yet caused her a secret complacency and that her furtive satisfaction alarmed her still more now while she sat thus absorbed she heard a gentle footstep coming near she looked up and there was leonard close to her standing meekly with his arms crossed upon his bosom his being there so pat upon her thoughts scared her out of her habitual selfcommand she started up with a faint cry and stood panting as if about to fly with her beautiful eyes turned large upon him he put forth a deprecating hand and soothed her forgive me madam said he i have unawares intruded on your privacy i will retire nay said she falteringly you are welcome but no one comes here so i was startled then recovering herself excuse my illmanners tis so strange you should come to me here of all places nay my daughter said the priest not so very strange contemplative minds love such places calling one day to see you i found this sweet and solemn grove the like i never saw in england and today i returned in hopes to profit by it do but look around at these tall columns how calm how reverend tis gods own temple not built with hands indeed it is said mrs gaunt earnestly then like a woman as she was so you came to see my trees not me leonard blushed i did not design to return without paying my respects to her who owns this temple and is worthy of it nay i beg you not to think me ungrateful his humility and gentle but earnest voice made mrs gaunt ashamed of her petulance she smiled sweetly and looked pleased however ere long she attacked him again father francis used to visit us often said she he made friends with my husband too and i never lacked an adviser while he was here leonard looked so confused at this second reproach that mrs gaunt regretted having uttered it then he said humbly that francis was a secular priest whereas he was conventbred he added that by his years and experience francis was better fitted to advise persons of her age and sex in matters secular than he was he concluded timidly that he was ready nevertheless to try and advise her but could not in such matters assume the authority that belongs to age and knowledge of the world nay nay said she earnestly guide and direct my soul and i am content he said yes that was his duty and his right then after a certain hesitation which at once let her know what was coming he began to thank her with infinite grace and sweetness for her kindness to him she looked him full in the face and said she was not aware of any kindness she had shown him worth speaking of that but shows said he how natural it is to you to do acts of goodness my poor room is a very bower now and i am happy in it i used to feel very sad there at times but your hand has cured me mrs gaunt coloured beautifully you make me ashamed said she things are come to a pass indeed if a lady may not send a few flowers and things to her spiritual father without beingthanked for it and oh sir what are earthly flowers compared with those blossoms of the soul you have shed so liberally over us our immortal parts were all asleep when you came here and wakened them by the fire of your words eloquence twas a thing i had read of but never heard nor thought to hear methought the orators and poets of the church were all in their graves this thousand years and she must go all the way to heaven that would hear the souls true music but i know better now leonard coloured high with pleasure such praise from you is too sweet he muttered i must not court it the heart is full of vanity and he deprecated further eulogy by a movement of the hand extremely refined and in fact rather feminine deferring to his wish mrs gaunt glided to other matters and was naturally led to speak of the prospects of their church and the possibility of reconverting these islands this had been the dream of her young heart but marriage and maternity and the universal coldness with which the subject had been received had chilled her so that of late years she had almost ceased to speak of it even leonard on a former occasion had listened coldly to her but now his heart was open to her he was in fact quite as enthusiastic on this point as ever she had been and then he had digested his aspirations into clearer forms not only had he resolved that great britain must be reconverted but had planned the way to do it his cheek glowed his eyes gleamed and he poured out his hopes and his plans before her with an eloquence that few mortals could have resisted as for this his hearer she was quite carried away by it she joined herself to his plans on the spot she begged with tears in her eyes to be permitted to support him in this great cause she devoted to it her substance her influence and every gift that god had given her the hours passed like minutes in this high converse and when the tinkling of the little bell at a distance summoned him to vespers he left her with a gentle regret he scarcely tried to conceal and she went slowly in like one in a dream and the world seemed dead to her for ever nevertheless when mrs ryder combing out her long hair gave one inadvertent tug the fair enthusiast came back to earth and asked her rather sharply who her head was running on ryder a very handsome young woman with fine black eyes made no reply but only drew her breath audibly hard i do not very much wonder at that nor at my having to answer that question for mrs ryder for her head was at that moment running like any other womans on the man she was in love with and the man she was in love with was the husband of the lady whose hair she was combing and who put her that curious questionplump chapter iv this caroline ryder was a character almost impossible to present so as to enable the reader to recognize her should she cross his path so great was the contradiction between what she was and what she seemed and so perfect was the imitation she looked a respectable young spinster with a grace of manner beyond her station and a decency and propriety of demeanour that inspired respect she was a married woman separated from her husband by mutual consent and she had had many lovers each of whom she had loved ardentlyfor a little while she was a woman that brought to bear upon foolish culpable loves a mental power that would have adorned the woolsack the moment prudence or waning inclination made it advisable to break with the reigning favourite she set to work to cool him down by deliberate coldness sullenness insolence and generally succeeded but if he was incurable she never hesitated as to her course she smiled again on him and looked out for another place being an invaluable servant she got one directly and was off to fresh pastures a female rake but with the air of a very prude still the decency and propriety of her demeanour were not all hypocrisy but half hypocrisy and half inborn and instinctive good taste and good sense as dangerous a creature to herself and others as ever tied on a bonnet on her arrival at hernshaw castle she cast her eyes round to see what there was to fall in love with and observed the gamekeeper tom leicester she gave him a smile or two that won his heart but there she stopped for soon the ruddy cheek brown eyes manly proportions and square shoulders of her master attracted this connoisseur in masculine beauty and then his manner was so genial and hearty with a smile for everybody mrs ryder eyed him demurely day by day and often opened a window slily to watch him unseen from that she got to throwing herself in his way and this with such art that he never discovered it though he fell in with her about the house six times as often as he met his wife or any other inmate she had already studied his character and whether she arranged to meet him full or to cross him it was always with a curtsy and a sunshiny smile he smiled on her in his turn and felt a certain pleasure at sight of her for he loved to see people bright and cheerful about him then she did of her own accord what no other master on earth would have persuaded her to do looked over his linen sewed on buttons for him and sometimes the artful jade deliberately cut a button off a clean shirt and then came to him and sewed it on during wear this brought about a contact none knew better than she how to manage to a mans undoing the eyelashes lowered over her work deprecating yet invitingthe twenty stitches when six would have donethe one coy glance at leaving all this soft witchcraft beset griffith gaunt and told on him but not as yet in the way his inamorata intended kate said he one day that girl of yours is worth her weight in gold indeed said mrs gaunt frigidly i have not discovered it when caroline found that her master was singlehearted and loved his wife too well to look elsewhere instead of hating him she began to love him more seriously and to hate his wife that haughty beauty who took such a husband as a matter of course and held him tight without troubling her head it was a coarse age and in that very county more than one wife had suffered jealous agony from her own domestic but here the parts were inverted the lady was at her ease the servant paid a bitter penalty for her folly she was now passionately in love and had to do menial offices for her rival every hour of the day she must sit with mrs gaunt and make her dresses and consult with her how to set off her hateful beauty to the best advantage she had to dress her and look daggers at her satin skin and royal neck and to sit behind her an hour at a time combing and brushing her long golden hair how she longed to tear a handful of it out and then run away instead of that her happy rival expected her to be as tender and coaxing with it as madame de maintenon was with the queens of france ryder called it yellow stuff down in the kitchen that was one comfort but a feeble one the sun came in at the ladys window and ryders shapely hand was overflowed and her eyes offended by waves of burnished gold and one day griffith came in and kissed it in her very hand his lips felt nothing but his wifes glorious hair but by that exquisite sensibility which the heart can convey in a moment to the very fingernails carolines hand beneath felt the soft touch through her mistresss hair and the enamoured hypocrite thrilled and then sickened at her own folly for in her good sense could be overpowered but never long blinded on the day in question she was thinking of griffith as usual and wondering whether he would always prefer yellow hair to black this actually put her off her guard for once and she gave the rival hair a little contemptuous tug and the reader knows what followed staggered by her mistresss question caroline made no reply but only panted a little and proceeded more carefully but oh the struggle it cost her not to slap both mrs gaunts fair cheeks with the backs of the brushes and what with this struggle and the reprimand and the past agitations byandby the comb ceased and the silence was broken by faint sobs mrs gaunt turned calmly round and looked full at her hysterical handmaid what is to do said she is it because i chid you child nay you need not take that to heart it is just my way i can bear anything but my hair pulled with this she rose and poured some drops of salvolatile into water and put it to her secret rivals lips it was kindly done but with that sort of half contemptuous and thoroughly cold pity women are apt to show to women and especially when one of them is mistress and the other is servant still it cooled the extreme hatred caroline had nursed and gave her a little twinge and awakened her intelligence now her intelligence was truly remarkable when not blinded by passion she was a woman with one or two other masculine traits beside her roving heart for instance she could sit and think hard and practically for hours together and on these occasions her thoughts were never dreamy and vague it was no brown study but good hard thinking she would knit her coalblack brows like lord thurlow himself and realize the situation and weigh the pros and cons with a steady judicial power rarely found in her sex and nota bene when once her mind had gone through this process then she would act with almost monstrous resolution she now shut herself up in her own room for some hours and weighed the matter carefully the conclusion she arrived at was this that if she stayed at hernshaw castle there would be mischief and probably she herself would be the principal sufferer to the end of the chapter as she was now she said to herself i shall go mad or else expose myself and be turned away with loss of character and then what will become of me and my child better lose life or reason than character i know what i have to go through i have left a man ere now with my heart tugging at me to stay beside him it is a terrible wrench and then all seems dead for a long while without him but the world goes on and takes you round with it and byandby you find there are as good fish left in the sea as ever came out ont ill go while ive sense enough left to see i must the very next day she came to mrs gaunt and said she wished to leave certainly said mrs gaunt coldly may i ask the reason oh i have no complaint to make maam none whatever but i am not happy here and i wish to go when my months up or sooner maam if you could suit yourself mrs gaunt considered a moment then she said you came all the way from gloucestershire to me had you not better give the place a fair trial i have had two or three good servants that felt uncomfortable at first but they soon found out my ways and stayed with me till they married as for leaving me before your month that is out of the question to this ryder said not a word but merely vented a little sigh half dogged half submissive and went catlike about arranging her mistresss things with admirable precision and neatness mrs gaunt watched her without seeming to do so and observed that her discontent did not in the least affect her punctual discharge of her duties said mrs gaunt to herself this servant is a treasure she shall not go and ryder to herself well tis but for a month and then no power shall keep me here chapter v not long after these events came the county ball griffith was there but no mrs gaunt this excited surprise and among the gentlemen disappointment they asked griffith if she was unwell he thanked them drily she was very well and that was all they could get out of him but to the ladies he let out that she had given up balls and indeed all reasonable pleasures she does nothing but fast and pray and visit the sick he added with rather a weak smile i see next to nothing of her a minx stood by and put in her word you should catch the smallpox then who knows she might look in upon you griffith laughed but not heartily in truth mrs gaunts religious fervour knew no bounds absorbed in pious schemes and religious duties she had little time and much distaste for frivolous society invited none but the devout and found polite excuses for not dining abroad she sent her husband into the world alone and laden with apologies my wife is turned saint tis a sin to dance a sin to hunt a sin to enjoy ourselves we are here to fast and pray and build schools and go to church twice a day and so he went about publishing his household ill but to tell the truth a secret satisfaction peeped through his lugubrious accents an ugly saint is an unmixed calamity to jolly fellows but to be lord and master and possessor of a beautiful saint was not without its piquant charm his jealousy was dormant not extinct and kates piety tickled that foible not wounded it he found himself the rival of heaven and the successful rival for let her be ever so strict ever so devout she must give her husband many comforts she could not give to heaven this soft and piquant phase of the passion did not last long all things are progressive brother leonard was director now as well as confessor his visits became frequent and mrs gaunt often quoted his authority for her acts or her sentiments so griffith began to suspect that the change in his wife was entirely due to leonard and that with all her eloquence and fervour she was but a priests echo this galled him to be sure leonard was only an ecclesiastic but if he had been a woman griffith was the man to wince his wife to lean so on another his wife to withdraw from the social pleasures she had hitherto shared with him and all because another human creature disapproved them he writhed in silence a while and then remonstrated he was met at first with ridicule are you going to be jealous of my confessor and on repeating the offence with a kind but grave admonition that silenced him for the time but did not cure him nor even convince him the facts were too strong kate was no longer to him the genial companion she had been gone was the ready sympathy with which she had listened to all his little earthly concerns and as for his haymaking he might as well talk about it to an iceberg as to the partner of his bosom he was genial by nature and could not live without sympathy he sought it in the parlour of the red lion mrs gaunts highbred nostrils told her where he haunted and it caused her dismay womanlike instead of opening her battery at once she wore a gloomy and displeased air which a few months ago would have served her turn and brought about an explanation at once but griffith took it for a stronger dose of religious sentiment and trundled off to the red lion all the more so then at last she spoke her mind and asked him how he could lower himself so and afflict her oh said he doggedly this house is too cold for me now my mate is priestrid plague on the knave that hath put coldness twixt thee and me mrs gaunt froze visibly and said no more at that time one bit of sunshine remained in the house and shone brighter than ever on its chilled master shone through two black seducing eyes some three months before the date we have now reached caroline ryders two boxes were packed and corded ready to go next day she had quietly persisted in her resolution to leave and mrs gaunt though secretly angry had been just and magnanimous enough to give her a good character now female domestics are like the little birds if that great hawk their mistress follows them about it is a deadly grievance but if she does not they follow her about and pester her with idle questions and invite the beak and claws of petty tyranny and needless interference so the afternoon before she was to leave caroline ryder came to her mistresss room on some imaginary business she was not there ryder forgetting that it did not matter a straw proceeded to hunt her everywhere and at last ran out with only her cap on to the dames haunt and there she was but not alone she was walking up and down with brother leonard their backs were turned and ryder came up behind them leonard was pacing gravely with his head gently drooping as usual mrs gaunt was walking elastically and discoursing with great fire and animation ryder glided after noiseless as a serpent more bent on wondering and watching now than on overtaking for inside the house her mistress showed none of this charming vivacity presently the keen black eyes observed a trifle light as air that made them shine again she turned and wound herself amongst the trees and disappeared soon after she was in her own room a changed woman with glowing cheeks sparkling eyes and nimble fingers she uncorded her boxes unpacked her things and placed them neatly in the drawers what more had she seen than i have indicated only this mrs gaunt in the warmth of discourse laid her hand lightly for a moment on the priests elbow that was nothing she had laid the same hand on ryder for in fact it was a little womanly way she had and a hand that settled like down but this time as she withdrew it again that delicate hand seemed to speak it did not leave leonards elbow all at once it glided slowly away first the palm then the fingers and so parted lingeringly the other woman saw this subtle touch of womanhood coupled it with mrs gaunts vivacity and the air of happiness that seemed to inspire her whole eloquent person and formed a harsh judgment on the spot though she could not see the ladys face when mrs gaunt came in she met her and addressed her thus if you please maam have you any one coming in my place mrs gaunt looked her full in the face you know i have not said she haughtily then if it is agreeable to you maam i will stay to be sure the place is dull but i have got a good mistressand that will do ryder a servant has always her own reasons and never tells them to her mistress you can stay this time but the next you go and once for all i am not to be trifled with ryder called up a look all submission and retired with an obeisance but once out of sight she threw off the mask and expanded with insolent triumph yes i have my own reasons said she keep you the priest and ill take the man from that hour caroline ryder watched her mistress like a lynx and hovered about her master and poisoned him slowly with vague insidious hints chapter vi brother leonard like many holy men was vain not but what he had his gusts of humility and diffidence only they blew over at first as you may perhaps remember he doubted his ability to replace father francis as mrs gaunts director but after a slight disclaimer he did replace him and had no more misgivings as to his fitness but his tolerance and good sense were by no means equal to his devotion and his persuasive powers and so his advice in matters spiritual and secular somehow sowed the first seeds of conjugal coolness in hernshaw castle and now ryder slily insinuated into griffiths ear that the mistress told the priest everything and did nothing but by his advice thus the fire already kindled was fanned by an artful womans breath griffith began to hate brother leonard and to show it so plainly and rudely that leonard shrank from the encounter and came less often and stayed but a few minutes then mrs gaunt remonstrated gently with griffith but received short sullen replies then as the servile element of her sex was comparatively small in her she turned bitter and cold and avenged leonard indirectly but openly with those terrible pins and needles a beloved woman has ever at command then griffith became moody and downright unhappy and went more and more to the red lion seeking comfort there now as well as company mrs gaunt saw and had fits of irritation and fits of pity and sore perplexity she knew she had a good husband and instead of taking him to heaven with her she found that each step she made with leonards help towards the angelic life seemed somehow to be bad for griffiths soul and for his earthly happiness she blamed herself she blamed griffith she blamed the protestant heresy she blamed everybody and everythingexcept brother leonard one sunday afternoon griffith sat on his own lawn silently smoking his pipe mrs gaunt came to him and saw an air of dejection on his genial face her heart yearned she sat down beside him on the bench and sighed then he sighed too my dear said she sweetly fetch out your viol da gambo and we will sing a hymn or two together here this fine afternoon we can praise god together though we must pray apart alas that it is so with all my heart said griffith nay i forgot my viol da gambo is not here tis at the red lion at the red lion said she bitterly what do you sing there as well as drink oh husband how can you so bemean yourself what is a poor man to do whose wife is priestridden and got to be no companyexcept for angels i did not come here to quarrel said she coldly and sadly then they were both silent a minute then she got up and left him brother leonard like many earnest men was rather intolerant he urged on mrs gaunt that she had too many protestants in her household her cook and her nursemaid ought at all events to be catholics mrs gaunt on this was quite ready to turn them both off and that without disguise but leonard dissuaded her from so violent a measure she had better take occasion to part with one of them and byandby with the other the nursemaid was the first to go and her place was filled by a roman catholic then the cook received warning but this did not pass off so quietly jane bannister was a buxom hearty woman well liked by her fellowservants her parents lived in the village and she had been six years with the gaunts and her honest heart clung to them she took to crying used to burst out in the middle of her work or while conversing with fitful cheerfulness on ordinary topics one day griffith found her crying and ryder consoling her as carelessly and contemptuously as possible heyday lasses said he what is your trouble at this janes tears flowed in a stream and ryder made no reply but waited at last and not till the third or fourth time of asking jane blurted out that she had got the sack such was her homely expression dignified however by honest tears what for asked griffith kindly nay sir sobbed jane that is what i want to know our dame neer found a fault in me and now she does pack me off like a dog me that have been here this six years and got to feel at home what will father say hell give me a hiding for two pins id drown myself in the mere come you must not blame the mistress said the sly ryder she is a good mistress as ever breathed tis all the priests doings ill tell you the truth master if you will pass me your word i shant be sent away for it i pledge you my word as a gentleman said griffith well then sir janes fault is yours and mine she is not a papist and that is why she is to go how i come to know i listened in the next room and heard the priest tell our dame she must send away two of us and have catholics the priests word it is law in this house twas in march he gave the order harriet she went in may and now poor jane is to gofor walking to church behind you sir but there jane i believe he would get our very master out of the house if he could and then what would become of us all griffith turned black and then ashy pale under this venomous tongue and went away without a word looking dangerous ryder looked after him and her black eye glittered with a kind of fiendish beauty jane having told her mind now began to pluck up a little spirit mrs ryder said she i never thought to like you so well and with that gave her a great hearty smacking kiss which ryder to judge by her countenance relished as epicures albumen i wont cry no more after all this house is no place for us that be women tis a fine roost to be sure where the hen she crows and the cock do but cluck townbred ryder laughed at the rustic maids simile and not to be outdone in metaphor told her there were dogs that barked and dogs that bit our master is one of those that bite ive done the priests business he is as like to get the sack as you are griffith found his wife seated on the lawn reading he gulped down his ire as well as he could but nevertheless his voice trembled a little with suppressed passion so jane is turned off now said he i dont know about being turned off replied mrs gaunt calmly but she leaves me next month and cicely davis comes back and cicely davis is a useless slut that cannot boil a potato fit to eat but then she is a papist and poor jenny is a protestant and can cook a dinner my dear said mrs gaunt do not you trouble about the servants leave them to me and welcome but this is not your doing it is that leonards and i cannot allow a popish priest to turn off all my servants that are worth their salt come kate you used to be a sensible woman and a tender wife now i ask you is a young bachelor a fit person to govern a mans family mrs gaunt laughed in his face a young bachelor said she whoever heard of such a term applied to a priest and a saint upon earth why he is not married so he must be a bachelor and i say again it is monstrous for a young bachelor to come between old married folk and hear all their secrets and have a finger in every pie and set up to be master of my house and order my wife to turn away my servants for going to church behind me why not turn me away too their fault is mine griffith you are in a passion and i begin to think you want to put me in one well perhaps i am jobs patience went at last and mine has been sore tried this many a month twas bad enough when the man was only your confessor you told him everything and you dont tell me everything he knew your very heart better than i do and that was a bitter thing for me to bear that love you and have no secrets from you but every man who marries a catholic must endure this so i put a good face on it though my heart was often sore twas the price i had to pay for my pearl of womankind but since he set up your governor as well you are a changed woman you shun company abroad you freeze my friends at home you have made the house so cold that i am fain to seek the red lion for a smile or a kindly word and now to please this fanatical priest you would turn away the best servants i have and put useless dirty slatterns in their place that happen to be papists you did not use to be so uncharitable nor so unreasonable tis the priests doing he is my secret underhand enemy i feel him undermining me inch by inch and i can bear it no longer i must make a stand somewhere and i may as well make it here for jenny is a good girl and her folk live in the village and she helps them think better of it kate and let the poor wench stay though she does go to church behind your husband griffith said mrs gaunt i might retort and say that you are a changed man for to be sure you did never use to interfere between me and my maids are you sure some mischiefmaking woman is not advising you but there do not let us chafe one another for you know we are hottempered both of us well leave it for the present my dear prithee let me think it over till tomorrow at all events and try if i can satisfy you the jealous husband saw through this proposal directly he turned purple that is to say you must ask your priest first for leave to show your husband one grain of respect and affection and not make him quite a cipher in his own house no kate no man who respects himself will let another man come between himself and the wife of his bosom this business is between you and me i will brook no interference in it and i tell you plainly if you turn this poor lass off to please this dd priest ill turn the priest off to please her and her folk they are as good as he is any way the bitter contempt with which he spoke of brother leonard and this astounding threat imported a new and dangerous element into the discussion it stung mrs gaunt beyond bearing she turned with flashing eyes upon griffith as good as he is the scum of my kitchen you will make me hate the mischiefmaking hussy she shall pack out of the house tomorrow morning then i say that priest shall never darken my doors again then i say they are my doors not yours and that holy man shall brighten them whenever he will if to strike an adversary dumb is the tongues triumph mrs gaunt was victorious for griffith gasped but did not reply they faced each other pale with fury but no more words no an ominous silence succeeded this lamentable answer like the silence that follows a thunderclap griffith stood still awhile benumbed as it were by the cruel stroke then cast one speaking look of anguish and reproach upon her drew himself haughtily up and stalked away like a wounded lion well said the ancients that anger is a short madness when we reflect in cold blood on the things we have said in hot how impossible they seem how out of character with our real selves and this is one of the recognized symptoms of mania there were few persons could compare with mrs gaunt in native magnanimity yet how ungenerous a stab had she given and had he gone on she would have gone on but when he turned silent at her bitter thrust and stalked away from her she came to herself almost directly she thought good god what have i said to him and the flush of shame came to her cheek and her eyes filled with tears he saw them not he had gone away wounded to the heart you see it was true the house was hers tied up as tight as wax the very money his own money that had been spent on the place had become hers by being expended on real property he could not reclaim it he was her lodger a dependant on her bounty during all the years they had lived together she had never once assumed the proprietor on the contrary she put him forward as the squire and slipped quietly into the background bene latuit but lo let a hand be put out to offend her saintly favourite and that moment she could waken her husband from his dream and put him down into his true legal position with a word the matrimonial throne for him till he resisted her priest and then a stool at her feet and his he was enraged as well as hurt but being a true lover his fury was levelled not at the woman who had hurt him but at the man who stood out of sight and set her on by this time the reader knows his good qualities and his defects superior to his wife in one or two things he was by no means so thorough a gentleman as she was a lady he had begun to make a party with his own servants against the common enemy and in his wrath he now took another step or rather a stride in the same direction as he hurried away to the publichouse white with ire he met his gamekeeper coming in with a bucketful of fish fresh caught what have ye got there said griffith roughly not that he was angry with the man but that his very skin was full of wrath and it must exude mr leicester did not relish the tone and replied bluntly and sulkily pike for our papists the answer though rude did not altogether displease griffith it smacked of odium theologicum a sentiment he was learning to understand put em down and listen to me thomas leicester said he and his manner was now so impressive that leicester put down the bucket with ludicrous expedition and gaped at him how my man why do i keep you here to take care of your game squire i do suppose what when you are the worst gamekeeper in the county how many poachers do you catch in the year they have only to set one of their gang to treat you at the publichouse on a moonshiny night and the rest can have all my pheasants at roost while you are boozing and singing like my betters in the parlour muttered tom but that is not all continued gaunt pretending not to hear him you wire my rabbits and sell them in the town dont go to deny it fore ive half a dozen to prove it mr leicester looked very uncomfortable his master continuedi have known it this ten months yet you are none the worse fort now why do i keep you here that any other gentleman in my place would send to carlisle gaol on a justices warrant mr leicester who had thought his master blind and was so suddenly undeceived hung his head and snivelled out tis because you have a good heart squire and would not ruin a poor fellow for an odd rabbit or two stuff and nonsense cried gaunt speak your mind for once or else begone for a liar as well as a knave thus appealed to leicesters gipsy eyes roved to and fro as if he were looking for some loophole to escape by but at last he faced the situation he said with a touch of genuine feeling dn the rabbits i wish my hand had withered ere i touched one on them but after this preface he sunk his voice to a whisper and said i see what you are driving at squire and since there is nobody with us he took off his capwhy sir tis this here mole i am in debt to no doubt then the gentleman and his servant looked one another silently in the face and what with their standing in the same attitude and being both excited and earnest the truth must be owned a certain family likeness came out certainly their eyes were quite unlike leicester had his gipsy mothers black keen and restless gaunt had his mothers brown calm and steady but the two men had the same stature the same manly mould and square shoulders and though leicesters cheek was brown as a berry his forehead was singularly white for a man in his rank of life and over his left temple close to the roots of the hair was an oblong mole as black as ink that bore a close resemblance in appearance and position to his masters tom leicester i have been insulted that wont pass sir who is the man one that i cannot call out like a gentleman and yet i must not lay on him with my cane or i am like to get the sack as well as my servants tis the popish priest lad brother leonard own brother to old kick he has got our dames ear she cannot say him nay she is turning away all my people and filling the house with papists to please him and when i interfered she as good as told me i should go next and so i shall i or else that priest this little piece of exaggeration fired tom leicester say ye so squire then just you whisper a word in my ear and george and i will lay that priest by the heels and drag him through the horsepond he wont come here to trouble you after that i know gaunts eyes flashed triumph a friend in need is a friend indeed said he ay you are right lad there must be no broken bones and no bloodshed the horsepond is the very thing and if she discharges you for it take no heed of her you shall never leave hernshaw castle for that good deed or if you do ill go with you for the world it is wide and ill never live a servant in the house where i have been a master they then put their heads together and concerted the means by which the priest at his very next visit was to be decoyed into the neighbourhood of the horsepond and then they parted and griffith went to the red lion and a pair of black eyes that had slily watched this singular interview from an upper window withdrew quietly and soon after tom leicester found himself face to face with their owner the sight of whom always made his heart beat a little faster caroline ryder had been rather cold to him of late it was therefore a charming surprise when she met him all wreathed in smiles and drawing him apart began to treat him like a bosom friend and tell him what had passed between the master and her and jane confidence begets confidence and so tom told her in turn that the squire and the dame had come to words over it however said he tis all the priests fault but bide awhile all of ye with this mysterious hint he meant to close his revelations but ryder intended nothing of the kind her keen eye had read the looks and gestures of gaunt and leicester and these had shown her that something very strange and serious was going on she had come out expressly to learn what it was and tom was no match for her arts she so smiled on him and agreed with him and led him and drew him and pumped him that she got it all out of him on a promise of secresy she then entered into it with spirit and being what they called a scholar undertook to write a paper for tom and his helper to pin on the priests back no sooner said than done she left him and speedily returned with the following document written out in large and somewhat straggling letters honest folk behold a mischievious priest which for causing of strife twixt man and wyfe hath made acquaintaunce with squires horsepond and so a female conspirator was added to the plot mrs gaunt cooperated too but need i say unconsciously she was unhappy and full of regret at what she had said she took herself severely to task and drew a very unfavourable comparison between herself and brother leonard how ill she thought am i fitted to carry out that meek saints views see what my ungoverned temper has done so then having made so great a mistake she thought the best thing she could do was to seek advice of leonard at once she was not without hopes he would tell her to postpone the projected change in her household and so soothe her offended husband directly she wrote a line requesting leonard to call on her as soon as possible and advise her in a great difficulty and she gave this note to ryder and told her to send the groom off with it at once ryder squeezed the letter and peered into it and gathered its nature before she gave it to the groom to take to leonard when he was gone she went and told tom leicester and he chuckled and made his preparations accordingly then she retired to her own room and went through a certain process i have indicated before as one of her habits knitted her great black brows and pondered the whole situation with a mental power that was worthy of a nobler sphere and higher materials her practical reverie so to speak continued until she was rung for to dress her mistress for dinner griffith was so upset so agitated and restless he could not stay long in any one place not even in the red lion so he came home to dinner though he had mighty little appetite for it and this led to another little conjugal scene mrs gaunt mounted the great oak staircase to dress for dinner languidly as ladies are apt to do when reflection and regret come after excitement presently she heard a quick foot behind her she knew it directly for her husbands and her heart yearned she did not stop nor turn her head womanly pride withheld her from direct submission but womanly tenderness and tact opened a way to reconciliation she drew softly aside almost to the wall and went slower and her hand her sidelong drooping head and her whole eloquent person whispered plainly enough if somebody would like to make friends here is the door open griffith saw but was too deeply wounded he passed her without stopping the staircase was eight feet broad but as he passed he looked at her and sighed for he saw she was sorry she heard and sighed too poor things they had lived so happy together for years he went on her pride bent griffith said she very timidly he turned and stopped at that sweetheart she murmured i was to blame i was ungenerous i forgot myself let me recall my words you know they did not come from my heart you need not tell me that said griffith doggedly i have no quarrel with you and never will you but do what you are bidden and say what you are bidden i take the wound from you as best i may the man that set you on tis him ill be revenged on alas that you will think so said she believe me dearest that holy man would be the first to rebuke me for rebelling against my husband and flouting him oh how could i say such things i thank you and love you dearly for being so blind to my faults but i must not abuse your blindness father leonard will put me to penance for the fault you forgive he will hear no excuses prithee now be more just to that good man griffith listened quietly with a cold sneer upon his lip and this was his reply till that mischiefmaking villain came between you and me you never gave me a bitter word we were the happiest pair in cumberland but now what are we and what shall we be in another year or tworevenge he had begun gravely enough but suddenly burst into an ungovernable rage and as he yelled out that furious word his face was convulsed and ugly to look at very ugly mrs gaunt started she had not seen that vile expression in his face for many a year but she knew it again ay he cried he has made me drink a bitter cup this many a day but ill force as bitter a one down his throat and you shall see it done mrs gaunt turned pale at this violent threat but being a highspirited woman she stiffened and hid her apprehensions loftily madman that you are said she i throw away excuses on jealousy and i waste reason upon phrenzy ill say no more things to provoke you but to be sure tis i that am offended now and deeply too as you will find so be it said griffith sullenly then grinding his teeth he shall pay for that too then he went to his dressingroom and she to her bedroom griffith hating leonard and kate deeply indignant with griffith and ere her blood could cool she was subjected to the keen cold scrutiny of another female and that female a secret rival chapter vii would you learn what men gain by admitting a member of the fair sex into their conspiracies read the tragedy of venice preserved and by way of afterpiece this little chapter mrs gaunt sat pale and very silent and caroline ryder stood behind doing up her hair into a magnificent structure that added eight inches to the ladys height and in this operation her own black hair and keen black eyes came close to the golden hair and deep blue eyes now troubled and made a picture striking by contrast as she was putting the finishing touches she said quietly if you please dame i have somewhat to tell you mrs gaunt sighed wearily expecting some very minute communication well dame i dare say i am risking my place but i cant help it another time ryder said mrs gaunt i am in no humour to be worried with my servants squabbles nay madam tis not that at all tis about father leonard sure you would not like him to be drawn through the horsepond and that is what they mean to do next time he comes here in saying these words the jade contrived to be adjusting mrs gaunts dress the ladys heart gave a leap and the servants cunning finger felt it and then felt a shudder run all over that stately frame but after that mrs gaunt seemed to turn to steel she distrusted ryder she could not tell why distrusted her and was upon her guard you must be mistaken said she who would dare to lay hands on a priest in my house well dame you see they egg one another on dont ask me to betray my fellowservants but let us baulk them i dont deceive you dame if the good priest shows his face here he will be thrown into the horsepond and sent home with a ticket pinned to his back them that is to do it are on the watch now and have got their orders and tis a burning shame to be sure i am not a catholic but religion is religion and a more heavenly face i never saw and for it to be dragged through a filthy horsepond mrs gaunt clutched her inspectors arm and turned pale the villains the fiends she gasped go ask your master to come to me this moment ryder took a step or two then stopped alack dame said she that is not the way to do you may be sure the others would not dare if my master had not shown them his mind mrs gaunt stopped her ears dont tell me that he has ordered this impious cruel cowardly act he is a lion and this comes from the heart of cowardly curs what is to be done woman tell me for you are cooler than i am well dame if i were in your place id just send him a line and bid him stay away till the storm blows over you are right but who is to carry it my own servants are traitors to me ill carry it myself you shall put on your hat and run through the wood that is the shortest way she wrote a few lines on a large sheet of paper for notepaper there was none in those days sealed it and gave it to ryder ryder retired to put on her hat and pry into the letter with greedy eyes it ran thus dear father and friendyou must come hither no more at present ask the bearer why this is for i am ashamed to put it on paper pray for them for you can but i cannot pray for me too bereft for a time of your counsels i shall come and confess to you in a few days when we are all cooler but you shall honour his house no more obey me in this one thing who shall obey you in all things else and am your indignant and sorrowful daughter catherine gaunt no more than that said ryder ay she guessed as i should look she whipped on her hat and went out who should she meet or i might say run against at the hall door but father leonard he had come at once in compliance with mrs gaunts request chapter viii mrs ryder uttered a little scream of dismay the priest smiled and said sweetly forgive me mistress i fear i startled you indeed you did sir said she she looked furtively round and saw leicester and his underling on the watch leicester unaware of her treachery made her a signal of intelligence she responded to it to gain time it was a ticklish situation some would have lost their heads ryder was alarmed but all the more able to defend her plans her first move as usual with such women wasa lie our dame is in the grove sir said she i am to bring you to her the priest bowed his head gravely and moved towards the grove with downcast eyes ryder kept close to him for a few steps then she ran to leicester and whispered hastily go you to the stablegate ill bring him round that way hide now he suspects ay ay said leicester and the confiding pair slipped away round a corner to wait for their victim ryder hurried him into the grove and as soon as she had got him out of hearing told him the truth he turned pale for these delicate organizations do not generally excel in courage ryder pitied him and something of womanly feeling began to mingle with her plans they shall not lay a finger on you sir said she ill scratch and scream and bring the whole parish out sooner but the best way is not to give them the chance please you follow me and she hurried him through the grove and then into an unfrequented path of the great wood when they were safe from pursuit she turned and looked at him he was a good deal agitated but the uppermost sentiment was gratitude it soon found words and as usual happy ones he thanked her with dignity and tenderness for the service she had done him and asked her if she was a catholic no said she at that his countenance fell but only for a moment ah would you were he said earnestly so then added sweetly to be sure i have all the more reason to be grateful to you you are very welcome reverend sir said ryder graciously religion is religion and tis a barbarous thing that violence should be done to men of your cloth having thus won his heart the artful woman began at one and the same time to please and to probe him sir said she be of good heart they have done you no harm and themselves no good my mistress will hate them for it and love you all the more father leonards pale cheek coloured all over at these words though he said nothing since they wont let you come to her she will come to you do you think so said he faintly nay i am sure of it sir so would any woman we still follow our hearts and get our way by hook or by crook again the priest coloured either with pleasure or with shame or with both and the keen feminine eye perused him with microscopic power she waited to give him an opportunity of talking to her and laying bare his feelings but he was either too delicate too cautious or too pure so then she suddenly affected to remember her mistresss letter she produced it with an apology he took it with unfeigned eagerness and read it in silence and having read it he stood patient with the tears in his eyes ryder eyed him with much curiosity and a little pity dont you take on for that said she why she will be more at her ease when she visits you at your place than here and she wont give you up i promise the priest trembled and ryder saw it but my daughter said he i am perplexed and grieved it seems that i make mischief in your house that is an ill office i fear it is my duty to retire from this place altogether rather than cause dissension between those whom the church by holy sacrament hath bound together so saying he hung his head and sighed ryder eyed him with a little pity but more contempt why take other peoples faults on your back said she my mistress is tied to a man she does not love but that is not your fault and he is jealous of you that never gave him cause if i was a man he should not accuse mefor nothing nor set his man on to drag me through a horsepondfor nothing id have the sweet as well as the bitter father leonard turned and looked at her with a face full of terror some beautiful honeyed fiend seemed to be entering his heart and tempting it oh hush my daughter hush he said what words are these for a virtuous woman to speak and a priest to hear there i have offended you by my blunt way said the cajoling hussy in soft and timid tones nay not so but oh speak not so lightly of things that peril the immortal soul well i have done said ryder you are out of danger now so give you good day he stopped her what before i have thanked you for your goodness ah mistress ryder tis on these occasions a priest sins by longing for riches to reward his benefactors i have nought to offer you but this ring it was my mothers my dear mothers he took it off his finger to give it her but the little bit of goodness that cleaves even to the heart of an intriguante revolted against her avarice nay poor soul ill not take it said she and put her hands before her eyes not to see it for she knew she could not look at it long and spare it with this she left him but ere she had gone far her cunning and curiosity gained the upper hand again and she whipped behind a great tree and crouched invisible all but her nose and one piercing eye she saw the priest make a few steps homewards then look around then take mrs gaunts letter out of his pocket press it passionately to his lips and hide it tenderly in his bosom this done he went home with his eyes on the ground as usual and measured steps and to all who met him he seemed a creature in whom religion had conquered all human frailty caroline ryder hurried home with cruel exultation in her black eyes but she soon found that the first thing she had to do was to defend herself leicester and his man met her and the former looked gloomy and the latter reproached her bitterly called her a doublefaced jade and said he would tell the squire of the trick she had played them but ryder had her story ready in a moment tis you i have saved not him said she he is something more than mortal why he told me of his own accord what you were there for but that if you were so unlucky as to lay hands on him you would rot alive it seems that has been tried out stanhope way a man did but give him a blow and his arm was stiff next day and he never used it again and next his hair fell off his head and then his eyes they turned to water and ran all out of him and he died within the twelvemonth country folk were nearly though not quite as superstitious at that time as in the middle ages murrain on him said leicester catch me laying a finger on him im glad he is gone and i hope he wont never come back no more not likely since he can read all our hearts why he told me something about you tom leicester he says you are in love no did he really now and leicester opened his eyes very wide and did he tell you who the lass is he did so and surprised me properly this with a haughty glance leicester held his tongue and turned red who is it mistress asked the helper he didnt say i was to tell you young man and with these two pricks of her needle she left them both more or less discomfited and went to scrutinize and anatomize her mistresss heart with plenty of cunning but no mercy she related her own part in the affair very briefly but dwelt with wellfeigned sympathy on the priests feelings he turned as white as a sheet maam when i told him and offered me his very ring off his finger he was so grateful poor man you did not take it i hope said mrs gaunt quickly la no maam i hadnt the heart mrs gaunt was silent awhile when she spoke again it was to inquire whether ryder had given him the letter that i did and it brought the tears into his poor eyes and such beautiful eyes as he has to be sure you would have pitied him if you had seen him read it and cry over it and then kiss it and put it in his bosom he did mrs gaunt said nothing but turned her head away the operator shot a sly glance into the lookingglass and saw a pearly tear trickling down her subjects fair cheek so she went on all sympathy outside and remorselessness within to think of that face more like an angels than a mans to be dragged through a nasty horsepond tis a shame of master to set his men on a clergyman and so was proceeding with wellacted and catching warmth to dig as dangerous a pit for mrs gaunt as ever was dug for any lady for whatever mrs gaunt had been betrayed into saying this ryder would have used without mercy and with diabolical skill yes it was a pit and the ladys pure but tender heart pushed her towards it and her fiery temper drew her towards it yet she escaped it this time the dignity delicacy and pride that is oftener found in these old families than out of them saved her from that peril she did not see the trap but she spurned the bait by native instinct she threw up her hand in a moment with a queenly gesture and stopped the tempter notonewordfrom my servant against my husband in my hearing said she superbly and ryder shrank back into herself directly child said mrs gaunt you have done me a great service and my husband too for if this dastardly act had been done in his name he would soon have been heartily ashamed of it and deplored it such services can never be quite repaid but you will find a purse in that drawer with five guineas it is yours and my lavender silk dress be pleased to wear that about me to remind me of the good office you have done me and now all you can do for me is to leave me for i am very very unhappy ryder retired with the spoil and mrs gaunt leaned her head over her chair and cried without stint after this no angry words passed between mr and mrs gaunt but something worse a settled coolness sprung up as for griffith his cook kept her place and the priest came no more to the castle so having outwardly gained the day he was ready to forget and forgive but kate though she would not let her servant speak ill of griffith was deeply indignant and disgusted with him she met his advances with such a stern coldness that he turned sulky and bitter in his turn husband and wife saw little of each other and hardly spoke both were unhappy but kate was angriest and griffith saddest in an evil hour he let out his grief to caroline ryder she seized the opportunity and by a show of affectionate sympathy and zeal made herself almost necessary to him and contrived to establish a very perilous relation between him and her matters went so far as this that the poor mans eye used to brighten when he saw her coming yet this victory cost her a sore heart and all the patient selfdenial of her sex to be welcome to griffith she had to speak to him of her rival and to speak well of her she tried talking of herself and her attachment he yawned in her face she tried smooth detraction and innuendo he fired up directly and defended her of whose conduct he had been complaining the very moment before then she saw that there was but one way to the mans heart sore and sick and smiling she took that way resolving to bide her time to worm herself in anyhow and wait patiently till she could venture to thrust her mistress out if any of my readers need to be told why this shemachiavel threw her fellow conspirators over the reason was simply this on calm reflection she saw it was not her interest to get father leonard insulted she looked on him as her mistresss lover and her own best friend was i mad said she to herself my business is to keep him sweet upon her till they cant live without one another and then ill tell him and take your place in this house my lady and now it is time to visit that extraordinary man who was the cause of all this mischief whom gaunt called a villain and mrs gaunt a saint and as usual he was neither one nor the other father leonard was a pious pure and nobleminded man who had undertaken to defy nature with religions aid and after years of successful warfare now sustained one of those defeats to which such warriors have been liable in every age if his heart was pure it was tender and nature never intended him to live all his days alone after years of prudent coldness to the other sex he fell in with a creature that put him off his guard at first she seemed so angelic at wisdoms gate suspicion slept and by degrees which have been already indicated in this narrative she whom the church had committed to his spiritual care became his idol could he have foreseen this it would never have happened he would have steeled himself or left the country that contained this sweet temptation but love stole on him masked with religious zeal and robed in a garment of light that seemed celestial when the mask fell it was too late the power to resist the soft and thrilling enchantment was gone the solitary man was too deep in love yet he clung still to that selfdeception without which he never could have been entrapped into an earthly passion he never breathed a word of love to her it would have alarmed her it would have alarmed himself every syllable that passed between these two might have been published without scandal but the heart does not speak by words alone there are looks and there are tones of voice that belong to love and are his signs his weapons and it was in these very tones the priest murmured to his gentle listener about the angelic life between spirits still lingering on earth but purged from earthly dross and even about other topics less captivating to the religious imagination he had persuaded her to found a school in this dark parish and in it he taught the poor with exemplary and touching patience well when he spoke to her about this school it was in words of practical good sense but in tones of love and she being one of those feminine women who catch the tone they are addressed in and instinctively answer in tune and moreover seeing no ill but good in the subject of their conversation replied sometimes unguardedly enough in accents almost as tender in truth if love was really a personage as the heathens feigned he must have often perched on a tree in that quiet grove and chuckled and mocked when this man and woman sat and murmured together in the soft seducing twilight about the love of god and now things had come to a crisis husband and wife went about the house silent and gloomy the ghosts of their former selves and the priest sat solitary benighted bereaved of the one human creature he cared for day succeeded to day and still she never came every morning he said she will come today and brightened with the hope but the leaden hours crept by and still she came not three sorrowful weeks went by and he fell into deep dejection he used to wander out at night and come and stand where he could see her windows with the moon shining on them then go slowly home cold in body and with his heart aching lonely deserted and perhaps forgotten oh never till now had he known the utter aching sense of being quite alone in this weary world one day as he sat drooping and listless there came a light foot along the passage a light tap at the door and the next moment she stood before him a little paler than usual but lovelier than ever for celestial pity softened her noble features the priest started up with a cry of joy that ought to have warned her but it only brought a faint blush of pleasure to her cheek and the brimming tears to her eyes dear father and friend said she what have you missed me think then how i have missed you but twas best for us both to let their vile passions cool first leonard could not immediately reply the emotion of seeing her again so suddenly almost choked him he needed all the selfpossession he had been years acquiring not to throw himself at her knees and declare his passion to her mrs gaunt saw his agitation but did not interpret it aright she came eagerly and sat on a stool beside him dear father she said do not let their insolence grieve you they have smarted for it and shall smart till they make their submission to you and beg and entreat you to come to us again meantime since you cannot visit me i visit you confess me father and then direct me with your counsels ah if you could but give me the christian temper to carry them out firmly but meekly tis my ungoverned spirit hath wrought all this mischief mea culpa mea culpa by this time leonard had recovered his selfpossession and he spent an hour of strange intoxication confessing his idol sentencing his idol to light penances directing and advising his idol and all in the soft murmurs of a lover she left him and the room seemed to darken two days only elapsed and she came again visit succeeded to visit and her affection seemed boundless the insult he had received was to be avenged in one place and healed in another and if possible effaced with tender hand so she kept all her sweetness for that little cottage and all her acidity for hernshaw castle it was an evil hour when griffith attacked her saint with violence the woman was too highspirited and too sure of her own rectitude to endure that so instead of crushing her it drove her to retaliation and to imprudence these visits to console father leonard were quietly watched by ryder for one thing but worse than that they placed mrs gaunt in a new position with leonard and one that melts the female heart she was now the protectress and the consoler of a man she admired and revered i say if any thing on earth can breed love in a grand female bosom this will she had put her foot on a sunny slope clad with innocentlooking flowers but more and more precipitous at every step and perdition at the bottom chapter ix father leonard visited soothed and petted by his idol recovered his spirits and if he pined during her absence he was always so joyful in her presence that she thought of course he was permanently happy so then being by nature magnanimous and placable she began to smile on her husband again and a tacit reconciliation came about by natural degrees but this produced a startling result leonard as her confessor had only to follow precedents and ask questions his church has printed for the use of confessors and he soon learned enough to infer that their disunion had given way the consequence was that one day being off his guard or literally unable to contain his bursting heart any longer he uttered a cry of jealous agony and then in a torrent of burning melting words appealed to her pity he painted her husbands happiness and his own misery and barren desolation with a fervid passionate eloquence that paralysed his hearer and left her pale and trembling and the tears of pity trickling down her cheek those silent tears calmed him a little and he begged her forgiveness and awaited his doom i pity you said she angelically what you jealous of my husband oh pray to christ and our lady to cure you of this folly she rose fluttering inwardly but calm as a statue on the outside gave him her hand and went home very slowly and the moment she was out of his sight she drooped her head like a crushed flower she was sad ashamed alarmed her mind was in a whirl and were i to imitate those writers who undertake to dissect and analyse the heart at such moments and put the exact result on paper i should be apt to sacrifice truth to precision i must stick to my old plan and tell you what she did that will surely be some index to her mind especially with my female readers she went home straight to her husband he was smoking his pipe after dinner she drew her chair close to him and laid her hand tenderly on his shoulder griffith she said will you grant your wife a favour you once promised to take me abroad i desire to go now i long to see foreign countries i am tired of this place i want a change prithee prithee take me hence this very day griffith looked aghast why sweetheart it takes a deal of money to go abroad we must get in our rents first nay i have a hundred pounds laid by well but what a fancy to take all of a sudden oh griffith dont deny me what i ask you with my arm round your neck dearest it is no fancy i want to be alone with you far from this place where coolness has come between us and with this she fell to crying and sobbing and straining him tight to her bosom as if she feared to lose him or be taken from him griffith kissed her and told her to cheer up he was not the man to deny her anything just let me get my hay in said he and ill take you to rome if you like no no today or tomorrow at furthest or you dont love me as i deserve to be loved by you this day now kate my darling be reasonable i must get my hay in and then i am your man mrs gaunt had gradually sunk almost to her knees she now started up with nostrils expanding and her blue eyes glittering your hay she cried with bitter contempt your hay before your wife that is how you love me and the next moment she seemed to turn from a fiery woman to a glacier griffith smiled at all this with that lordly superiority the male of our species sometimes wears when he is behaving like a dull ass and smoked his pipe and resolved to indulge her whim as soon as ever he had got his hay in chapter x showery weather set in and the hay had to be turned twice and left in cocks instead of carried griffith spoke now and then about the foreign tour but kate deigned no reply whatever and the chilled topic died out before the wet hay could be got in and so much for procrastination meantime betty gough was sent for to mend the houselinen she came every other day after dinner and sat working alone beside mrs gaunt till dark caroline ryder put her own construction on this and tried to make friends with mrs gough intending to pump her but mrs gough gave her short dry answers ryder then felt sure that gough was a gobetween and womanlike turned up her nose at her with marked contempt for why this office of gobetween was one she especially coveted for herself under the circumstances and a little while ago it had seemed within her grasp one fine afternoon the hay was all carried and griffith came home in good spirits to tell his wife he was ready to make the grand tour with her he was met at the gate by mrs gough with a face of great concern she begged him to come and see the dame she had slipped on the oak stairs poor soul and hurt her back griffith tore up the stairs and found kate in the drawingroom lying on a sofa and her doctor by her side he came in trembling like a leaf and clasped her piteously in his arms at this she uttered a little patient sigh of pain and the doctor begged him to moderate himself there was no immediate cause of alarm but she must be kept quiet she had strained her back and her nerves were shaken by the fall oh my poor kate cried griffith and would let nobody else touch her she was no longer a tall girl but a statuesque woman yet he carried her in his herculean arms up to her bed she turned her head towards him and shed a gentle tear at this proof of his love but the next moment she was cold again and seemed weary of her life an invalids bed was sent to her by the doctor at her own request and placed on a small bedstead she lay on this at night and on a sofa by day griffith was now as good as a widower and caroline ryder improved the opportunity she threw herself constantly in his way all smiles small talk and geniality like many healthy men your sickness wearied him if it lasted over two days and whenever he came out chilled and discontented from his invalid wife there was a fine buoyant healthy young woman ready to chat with him and brimming over with undisguised admiration true she was only a servant a servant to the core but she had been always about ladies and could wear their surface as readily as she could their gowns moreover griffith himself lacked dignity and reserve he would talk to anybody the two women began to fill the relative situations of clouds and sunshine but ere this had lasted long the enticing contact with the object of her lawless fancy inflamed ryder and made her so impatient that she struck her long meditated blow a little prematurely the passage outside mrs gaunts door had a large window and one day while griffith was with his wife ryder composed herself on the windowseat in a forlorn attitude too striking and unlike her usual gay demeanour to pass unnoticed griffith came out and saw this drooping disconsolate figure hallo said he what is wrong with you a little fretfully a deep sigh was the only response had words with your sweetheart you know i have no sweetheart sir the goodnatured squire made an attempt or two to console her and find out what was the matter but he could get nothing out of her but monosyllables and sighs at last the crocodile contrived to cry and having thus secured his pity she said there never heed me im a foolish woman i cant bear to see my dear master so abused what dye mean said griffith sternly her very first shaft wounded his peace of mind oh no matter why should i be your friend and my own enemy if i tell you i shall lose my place nonsense girl you shall never lose your place while i am here well i hope not sir for i am very happy here too happy methinks when you speak kindly to me take no notice of what i said tis best to be blind at times the simple squire did not see that this artful creature was playing the stale game of her sex stimulating his curiosity under pretence of putting him off ho began to fret with suspicion and curiosity and insisted on her speaking out ah but i am so afraid you will hate me said she and that will be worse than losing my place griffith stamped on the ground what is it said he fiercely ryder seemed frightened it is nothing said she then she paused and added but my folly i cant bear to see you waste your feelings she is not so ill as you fancy do you mean to say that my wife is pretending how can i say that i wasnt there nobody saw her fall nor heard her either and the house full of people no doubt there is something the matter with her but i do believe her heart is in more trouble than her back and what troubles her heart tell me and she shall not fret long well sir then just you send for father leonard and she will get up and walk as she used and smile on you as she used that man is the main of her sickness you take my word griffith turned sick at heart and the strong man literally staggered at this envenomed thrust of a weak womans tongue but he struggled with the poison what dye mean woman said he the priest hasnt been near her these two months that is it sir replied eyder quietly he is too wise to come here against your will and she is bitter against you for frightening him away ask yourself sir didnt she change to you the moment that you threatened that leonard with the horsepond that is true gasped the wretched husband yet he struggled again but she made it up with me after that why twas but the other day she begged me to go abroad with her and take her away from this place ah indeed said ryder bending her black brows did she so that she did said griffith joyfully so you see you are mistaken you should have taken her at her word sir was all the womans reply well you see the hay was out so i put it off and then came the cursed rain day after day and so she cooled upon it of course she did sir then with a solemnity that appalled her miserable listener id give all im worth if you had taken her at her word that minute but that is the way with you gentlemen you let the occasion slip and we that be women never forgive that she wont give you the same chance again i know now if i was not afraid to make you unhappy id tell you why she asked you to go abroad she felt herself weak and saw her danger she found she could not resist that leonard any longer and she had the sense to see it wasnt worth her while to ruin herself for him so she asked you to save her from him that is the plain english and you didnt at this griffiths face wore an expression of agony so horrible that ryder hesitated in her course there there said she pray dont look so dear master after all theres nothing certain and perhaps i am too severe where i see you illtreated and to be sure no woman could be cold to you unless she was bewitched out of her seven senses by some other man i couldnt use you as mistress does but then theres nobody i care a straw for in these parts except my dear master griffith took no notice of this overture the potent poison of jealousy was coursing through all his veins and distorting his ghastly face oh god he gasped can this thing be my wife the mother of my child it is a lie i cant believe it i wont believe it have pity on me woman and think again and unsay your words for if tis so there will be murder in this house ryder was alarmed dont talk so said she hastily no woman born is worth that besides as you say what do we know against her she is a gentlewoman and well brought up now dear master you have got one friend in this house and that is me i know women better than you do will you be ruled by me yes i will for i do believe you care a little for me then dont you believe anything against our dame keep quiet till you know more dont you be so simple as to accuse her to her face or youll never learn the truth just you watch her quietly without seeming and ill help you be a man and know the truth i will said griffith grinding his teeth and i believe she will come out pure as snow well i hope so too said ryder drily then she added but dont you be seen speaking to me too much sir or she will suspect me and then she will be on her guard with me when i have anything particular to tell you ill cough so and then ill run out into the grove nobody goes there now griffith did not see the hussy was contriving a series of assignations he fell into the trap bodily the life this man led was now infernal he watched his wife night and day to detect her heart he gave up hunting he deserted the red lion if he went out of doors it was but a step he hovered about the place to see if messages came or went and he spent hours in his wifes bedroom watching her grim silent and sombre to detect her inmost heart his flesh wasted visibly and his ruddy colour paled hell was in his heart ay two hells jealousy and suspense mrs gaunt saw directly that something was amiss and ere long she divined what it was but if he was jealous she was proud as lucifer so she met his everwatchful eye with the face of a marble statue only in secret her heart quaked and yearned and she shed many a furtive tear and was sore sore perplexed meantime ryder was playing with her masters anguish like a cat with a mouse upon the pretence of some petty discovery or other she got him out day after day into the grove and to make him believe in her candour and impartiality would give him feeble reasons for thinking his wife loved him still taking care to overpower these reasons with some little piece of strong good sense and subtle observation it is the fate of moral poisoners to poison themselves as well as their victims this is a just retribution and it fell upon this female iago her wretched master now loved his wife to distraction yet hated her to the death and ryder loved her master passionately yet hated him intensely by fits and starts these secret meetings on which she had counted so what did she gain by them she saw that with all her beauty intelligence and zeal for him she was nothing to him still he suspected he sometimes hated his wife but he was always full of her there was no getting any other wedge into his heart this so embittered ryder that one day she revenged herself on him he had been saying that no earthly torment could equal his all his watching had shown him nothing for certain oh said he if i could only get proof of her innocence or proof of her guilt anything better than the misery of doubt it gnaws my heart it consumes my flesh i cant sleep i cant eat i cant sit down i envy the dead that lie at peace oh my heart my heart and all for a woman that is not young nor half so handsome as yourself well sir ill try and cure you of your doubt if that is what torments you when you threatened that leonard he got his orders to come here no more but she visited him at his place again and again tis false how know you that as soon as your back was turned she used to order her horse and ride to him how do you know she went to him i mounted the tower and saw the way she took griffiths face was a piteous sight he stammered out well he is her confessor she always visited him at times ay sir but in those days her blood was cool and his too but bethink you now when you threatened the man with the horsepond he became your enemy all revenge is sweet but what revenge is so sweet to any man as that which came to his arms of its own accord i do notice that men cant read men but any woman can read a woman maids they are reserved because their mothers have told them that is the only way to get married but what have a wife and a priest to keep them distant can they ever hope to come together lawfully that is why a priests lightolove is always some honest mans wife what had those two to keep them from folly old betty gough why the mistress had bought her body and soul long ago no sir you had no friend there and you had three enemieslove revenge and opportunity why what did the priest say to me i met him not ten yards from here ware the horsepond says i says he since i am to have the bitter ill have the sweet as well these infernal words were not spoken in vain griffiths features were horribly distorted his eyes rolled fearfully and he fell to the ground grinding his teeth and foaming at the mouth an epileptic fit footnote compare this statement with p ah epileptic fit is a terrible sight the simple description of one in our medical books is appalling and in this case it was all the more fearful the subject being so strong and active caroline ryder shrieked with terror but no one heard her at all events no one came to be sure the place had a bad name for ghosts etc she tried to hold his head but could not for his body kept bounding from the earth with inconceivable elasticity and fury and his arms flew in every direction and presently ryder received a violent blow that almost stunned her she lay groaning and trembling beside the victim of her poisonous tongue and of his own passion when she recovered herself he was snorting rather than breathing but lying still and pale enough his eyes set and glassy she got up and went with uneven steps to a little rill hard by and plunged her face in it then filled her beaver hat and came and dashed water repeatedly in his face he came to his senses by degrees but was weak as an infant then ryder wiped the foam from his lips and kneeling on her knees laid a soft hand upon his heavy head shedding tears of pity and remorse and sick at heart herself for what had she gained by blackening her rival the sight of his bodily agony and his ineradicable love mrs gaunt sat out of shot cold calm superior yet in the desperation of her passion it was something to nurse his weak head an instant and shed hot tears upon his brow it was a positive joy and soon proved a fresh and inevitable temptation my poor master said she tenderly i never will say a word to you again it is better to be blind my god how you cling to her that feigns a broken back to be rid of you when there are others as well to look at and ever so much younger that adore every hair on your head and would follow you round the world for one kind look let no one love me like that said griffith feebly to love so is to be miserable pity her then at least murmured ryder and feeling she had quite committed herself now her bosom panted under griffiths ear and told him the secret she had kept till now my female readers will sneer at this temptation my male readers know that scarcely one man out of a dozen sick sore and hating her he loved would have turned away from the illicit consolation thus offered to him in his hour of weakness with soft seducing tones warm tears and heart that panted at his ear chapter xi how did poor faulty griffith receive it he raised his head and turned his brown eye gentle but full upon her my poor girl said he i see what you are driving at but that will not do i have nothing to give you in exchange i hate my wife that i loved so dear dn her dn her but i hate all womankind for her sake keep you clear of me i would ruin no poor girl for heartless sport i shall have blood on my hands ere long and that is enough and with these alarming words he seemed suddenly to recover all his vigour for he rose and stalked away at once and never looked behind him ryder made no further attempt she sat down and shed bitter tears of sorrow and mortification after this cruel rebuff she must hate somebody and with the justice of her sex she pitched on mrs gaunt and hated her like a demon and watched to do her a mischief by hook or by crook griffiths appearance and manner caused mrs gaunt very serious anxiety his clothes hung loose on his wasted frame his face was of one uniform sallow tint like a maniacs and he sat silent for hours beside his wife eyeing her askant from time to time like a surly mastiff guarding some treasure she divined what was passing in his mind and tried to soothe him but almost in vain he was sometimes softened for the moment but hret lateri lethalis arundo he still hovered about watching her and tormenting himself gnawed mad by three vultures of the minddoubt jealousy and suspense then mrs gaunt wrote letters to father leonard hitherto she had only sent him short messages betty gough carried these letters and brought the answers griffith thanks to the hint ryder had given him suspected this and waylaid the old woman and roughly demanded to see the letter she was carrying she stoutly protested she had none he seized her turned her pockets inside out and found a bunch of keys item a printed dialogue between peter and herod omitted in the canonical books but described by the modern discoverer as an infallible charm for the toothache item a brass thimble item half a nutmeg curse your cunning said he and went off muttering the old woman tottered trembling to mrs gaunt related this outrage with an air of injured innocence then removed her cap undid her hair and took out a letter from leonard this must end and shall said mrs gaunt firmly else it will drive him mad and me too bolton fairday came it was a great fair and had attractions for all classes there were cattle and horses of all kinds for sale and also shows games wrestling and dancing till daybreak all the servants had a prescriptive right to go to this fair and griffith himself had never missed one he told kate overnight he would go if it were not for leaving her alone the words were kinder than their meaning but mrs gaunt had the tact or the candour to take them in their best sense and i would go with you my dear said she but i should only be a drag never heed me give yourself a days pleasure for indeed you need it i am in care about you you are so dull of late well i will said griffith ill not mope here when all the rest are merrymaking accordingly next day about eleven in the morning he mounted his horse and rode to the fair leaving the house empty for all the servants were gone except the old housekeeper she was tied to the fireside by rheumatics even ryder started with a new bonnet and red ribbons but that was only a blind she slipped back and got unperceived into her own bedroom griffith ran through the fair but could not enjoy it hrebat lateri arundo he came galloping back to watch his wife and see whether betty gough had come again or not as he rode into the stableyard he caught sight of ryders face at an upper window she looked pale and agitated and her black eyes flashed with a strange expression she made him a signal which he did not understand but she joined him directly after in the stableyard come quietly with me said she solemnly he hooked his horses rein to the wall and followed her trembling she took him up the back stairs and when she got on the landing she turned and said where did you leave her in her own room see if she is there now said ryder pointing to the door griffith tore the door open the room was empty nor is she to be found in the house said ryder for ive been in every room griffiths face turned livid and he staggered and leaned against the wall where is she said he hoarsely humph said ryder fiendishly find him and you will find her ill find them if they are above ground cried griffith furiously and he rushed into his bedroom and soon came out again with a fearful purpose written on his ghastly features and in his bloodshot eyes and a loaded pistol in his hand ryder was terrified but instead of succumbing to terror she flew at him like a cat and wreathed her arms round him what would you do cried she madman would you hang for them and break my heart the only woman in the world that loves you give me the pistol nay i will have it and with that extraordinary power excitement lends her sex she wrenched it out of his hands he gnashed his teeth with fury and clutched her with a gripe of iron she screamed with pain he relaxed his grasp a little at that she turned on him and defied him i wont let you get into trouble for a priest and a wanton she cried you shall kill me first leave mo the pistol and pledge me your sacred word to do them no harm and then ill tell you where they are refuse me this and you shall go to your grave and know nothing more than you know now no no if you are a woman have pity on me let me come at them there ill use no weapon ill tear them to atoms with these hands where are they may i put the pistol away then yes take it out of my sight so best where are they ryder locked the pistol up in one of mrs gaunts boxes then she said in a trembling voice follow me he followed her in awful silence she went rather slowly to the door that opened on the lawn and then she hesitated if you are a man and have any feeling for a poor girl who loves you if you are a gentleman and respect your wordno violence i promise said he where are they nay nay i fear i shall rue the day i told you promise me once more no bloodshedupon your soul i promise where are they god forgive me they are in the grove he bounded away from her like some beast of prey and she crouched and trembled on the steps of the door and now that she realized what she was doing a sickening sense of dire misgiving came over her and made her feel quite faint and so the weak but dangerous creature sat crouching and quaking and launched the strong one griffith was soon in the grove and the first thing he saw was leonard and his wife walking together in earnest conversation their backs were towards him mrs gaunt whom he had left lying on a sofa and who professed herself scarce able to walk half a dozen times across the room was now springing along elastic as a young greyhound and full of fire and animation the miserable husband saw and his heart died within him he leaned against a tree and groaned the deadly sickness of his heart soon gave way to sombre fury he came softly after them with ghastly cheek and bloodthirsty eyes like redhot coals they stopped and he heard his wife say tis a solemn promise then this very night the priest bowed assent then they spoke in so low a voice he could not hear but his wife pressed a purse upon leonard and leonard hesitated but ended by taking it griffith uttered a yell like a tiger and rushed between them with savage violence driving the lady one way with his wrists and the priest another she screamed he trembled in silence griffith stood a moment between these two pale faces silent and awful then he faced his wife you vile wretch he cried so you buy your own dishonour and mine he raised his hand high over her head she never winced oh but for my oath id lay you dead at my feet but no ill not hang for a priest and a wanton so this is the thing you love and pay it to love you and with all the mad inconsistency of rage which mixes small things and great he tore the purse out of leonards hand then seized him felly by the throat at that the high spirit of mrs gaunt gave way to abject terror oh mercy mercy she cried it is all a mistake and she clung to his knees he spurned her furiously away dont touch me woman he cried or you are dead look at this and in a moment with gigantic strength and fury he dashed the priest down at her feet i know ye ye proud devil he cried love the thing you have seen me tread upon love itif ye can and he literally trampled upon the poor priest with both feet leonard shrieked for mercy none in this world or the next roared griffith but the next moment he took fright at himself god he cried i must go or kill live and be damned for ever the pair of ye and with this he fled from them grinding his teeth and beating the air with his clenched lists he darted to the stableyard sprang on his horse and galloped away from hernshaw castle with the face the eyes the gestures the incoherent mutterings of a raving bedlamite chapter xii at the fair the wrestling was ended and the tongues going over it all again and throwing the victors the greasy pole with leg of mutton attached by ribbons was being hoisted and the swings flying and the lads and lasses footing it to the fife and tabor and the people chattering in groups when the clatter of a horses feet was heard and a horseman burst in and rode recklessly through the marketplace indeed if his noble horse had been as rash as he was some would have been trampled under foot the riders face was ghastly such as were not exactly in his path had time to see it and wonder how this terrible countenance came into that merry place thus as he passed shouts of dismay arose and a space opened before him and then closed behind him with a great murmur that followed at his heels tom leicester was listening spellbound on the outskirts of the throng to the songs and humorous tirades of a pedlar selling his wares and was saying to himself i too will be a pedlar hearing the row he turned round and saw his master just coming down with that stricken face tom could not decipher his own name in print or manuscript and these are the fellows that beat us all at reading countenances he saw in a moment that some great calamity had fallen on griffiths head and nature stirred in him he darted to his masters side and seized the bridle what is up he cried but griffith did not answer nor notice his ears were almost deaf and his eyes great and staring were fixed right ahead and to all appearance he did not see the people he seemed to be making for the horizon master for the love of heaven speak to me cried leicester what have they done to you whither be you going with the face of a ghost away from the hangman shrieked griffith still staring at the horizon stay me not my hands itch for their throats my heart thirsts for their blood but ill not hang for a priest and a wanton then he suddenly turned on leicester let thou go or and he lifted up his heavy riding whip then leicester let go the rein and the whip descended on the horses flank he went clattering furiously over the stones and drove the thinner groups apart like chaff and his galloping feet were soon heard fainter and fainter till they died away in the distance leicester stood gaping griffiths horse a black hunter of singular power and beauty carried his wretched master well that day he went on till sunset trotting cantering and walking without intermission the whip ceased to touch him the rein never checked him he found he was the master and he went his own way he took his broken rider back into the county where he had been foaled but a few miles from his native place they came to the packhorse a pretty little roadside inn with farmyard and buildings at the back he had often baited here in his infancy and now stiff and stumbling with fatigue the good horse could not pass the familiar place he walked gravely into the stableyard and there fairly came to an end craned out his drooping head crooked his limbs and seemed of wood and no wonder he was ninetythree miles from his last corn paul carrick a young farrier who frequented the packhorse happened just then to be lounging at the kitchen door and saw him come in he turned directly and shouted into the house ho master vint come hither heres black dick come home and brought you a worshipful customer the landlord bustled out of the kitchen crying they are welcome both then he came lowly louting to griffith cap in hand and held the horse poor immoveable brute and his wife curtsied perseveringly at the door griffith dismounted and stood there looking like one in a dream please you come in sir said the landlady smiling professionally he followed her mechanically would your worship be private we keep a parlour for gentles ay let me be alone he groaned mercy vint the daughter happened to be on the stairs and heard him the voice startled her and she turned round directly to look at the speaker but she only saw his back going into the room and then he flung himself like a sack into the armchair the landlady invited him to order supper he declined she pressed him he flung a piece of money on the table and told her savagely to score his supper and leave him in peace she flounced out with a red face and complained to her husband in the kitchen harry vint rung the crown piece on the table before he committed himself to a reply it rang like a bell churl or not his coin is good said harry vint philosophically ill eat his supper dame for that matter father whispered mercy i do think the gentleman is in trouble and that is no business of mine neither said harry vint presently the guest they were discussing called loudly for a quart of burnt wine when it was ready mercy offered to take it in to him she was curious the landlord looked up rather surprised for his daughter attended to the farm but fought shy of the inn and its business take it lass and welcome for me said mrs vint pettishly mercy took the wine in and found griffith with his head buried in his hands she stood a while with the tray not knowing what to do then as he did not move she said softly the wine sir an if it please you griffith lifted his head and turned two eyes clouded with suffering upon her he saw a buxom blooming young woman with remarkably dovelike eyes that dwelt with timid kindly curiosity upon him he looked at her in a half distracted way and then put his hand to the mug heres perdition to all false women said he and tossed half the wine down at a single draught tis not to me you drink sir said mercy with gentle dignity then she curtsied modestly and retired discouraged not offended the wretched griffith took no noticedid not even see he had repulsed a friendly visitor the wine taken on an empty stomach soon stupified him and he staggered to bed he awoke at daybreak and oh the agony of that waking he lay sighing a while with his hot skin quivering on his bones and his heart like lead then got up and flung his clothes on hastily and asked how far to the nearest seaport twenty miles he called for his horse the poor brute was dead lame he cursed that good servant for going lame he walked round and round like a wild beast chafing and fuming a while then sank into a torpor of dejection and sat with his head bowed on the table all day he ate scarcely any food but drank wine freely remarking however that it was falsehearted stuff did him no good and had no taste as wine used to have but nothing is what it was said he even i was happy once but that seems years ago alas poor gentleman god comfort you said mercy vint and came with the tears in her dovelike eyes and said to her father to be sure his worship hath been crossed in love and what could she be thinking of such a handsome wellmade gentleman now that is a wenchs first thought said harry vint more likely lost his money gambling or racing but indeed i think tis his head is disordered not his heart i wish the packhorse was quit of him maugre his laced coat we want no killjoys here that night he was heard groaning and talking and did not come down at all so at noon mrs vint knocked at his door a weak voice bade her enter she found him shivering and he asked her for a fire she grumbled out of hearing but lighted a fire presently his voice was heard hallooing he wanted all the windows open he was so burning hot the landlady looked at him and saw his face was flushed and swollen and he complained of pain in all his bones she opened the windows and asked him would he have a doctor sent for he shook his head contemptuously however towards evening he became delirious and raved and tossed and rolled his head as if it was an intolerable weight he wanted to get rid of the females of the family were for sending at once for a doctor but the prudent harry demurred tell me first who is to pay the fee said he ive seen a fine coat with the pockets empty before today the women set up their throats at him with one accord each after her kind out fie said mercy are we to do nought for charity why theres his horse ye foolish man said mrs vint ay ye are both wiser than me said harry vint ironically and soon after that he went out softly the next minute he was in the sick mans room examining his pockets to his infinite surprise he found twenty gold pieces a quantity of silver and some trinkets he spread them all out on the table and gloated on them with greedy eyes they looked so inviting that he said to himself they would be safer in his custody than in that of a delirious person who was even now raving incoherently before him and could not see what he was doing he therefore proceeded to transfer them to his own care on the way to his pocket his shaking hand was arrested by another hand soft but firm as iron he shuddered and looked round in abject terror and there was his daughters face pale as his own but full of resolution nay father said she i must take charge of these and well do you know why these simple words cowed harry vint so that he instantly resigned the money and jewels and retired muttering that things were come to a pretty passa man was no longer master in his own house etc etc etc while he inveighed against the degeneracy of the age the women paid him no more attention than the age did but just sent for the doctor he came and bled the patient this gave him a momentary relief but when in the natural progress of the disease sweating and weakness came on the loss of the precious vital fluid was fatal and the patients pulse became scarce perceptible there he lay with wet hair and gleaming eyes and haggard face at deaths door an experienced old crone was got to nurse him and she told mrs vint he would live maybe three days paul carrick used to come to the packhorse after mercy vint and finding her sad asked her what was the matter what should it be said she but the poor gentleman adying overhead away from all his friends let me see him said paul mercy took him softly into the room ay he is booked said the farrier doctor has taken too much blood out of the mans body they kill a many that way alack paul must he die can nought be done said mercy clasping her hands i dont say that neither said the farrier he is a wellmade man he is young i might save him perhaps if i had not so many beasts to look to ill tell you what you do make him soup as strong as strong have him watched night and day and let em put a spoonful of warm wine into him every hour and then of soup egg flip is a good thing too change his bedlinen and keep the doctors from him that is his only chance he is fairly dying of weakness but i must be off farmer blakes cow is down for calving i must give her an ounce of salts before tis too late mercy vint scanned the patient closely and saw that paul carrick was right she followed his instructions to the letter with one exception instead of trusting to the old woman of whom she had no very good opinion she had the great armchair brought into the sickroom and watched the patient herself by night and day a gentle hand cooled his temples a gentle hand brought concentrated nourishment to his lips and a mellow voice coaxed him to be good and swallow it there are voices it is not natural to resist and griffith learned by degrees to obey this one even when he was half unconscious at the end of three days this zealous young nurse thought she discerned a slight improvement and told her mother so then the old lady came and examined the patient and shook her head gravely her judgment like her daughters was influenced by her wishes the fact is both landlord and landlady were now calculating upon griffiths decease harry had told her about the money and jewels and the pair had put their heads together and settled that griffith was a gentleman highwayman and his spoil would never be reclaimed after his decease but fall to those good samaritans who were now nursing him and intended to bury him respectably the future being thus settled this worthy couple became a little impatient for griffith like charles the second was an unconscionable time dying we order dinner to hasten a lingering guest and with equal force of logic mine host of the packhorse spoke to white the village carpenter about a fullsized coffin and his wife set the old crone to make a linen shroud unobtrusively in the bakehouse on the third afternoon of her nursing mercy left her patient and called up the crone to tend him she herself worn out with fatigue threw herself on a bed in her mothers room hard by and soon fell asleep she had slept about two hours when she was wakened by a strange noise in the sick chamber a man and a woman quarrelling she bounded off the bed and was in the room directly lo and behold there were the nurse and the dying man abusing one another like pickpockets the cause of this little misunderstanding was not far to seek the old crone had brought up her work videlicet a windingsheet all but finished and certain strips of glazed muslin about three inches deep she soon completed the windingsheet and hung it over two chairs in the patients sight she then proceeded to double the slips in six and nick them then she unrolled them and they were frills and well adapted to make the coming corpse absurd and divest it of any little dignity the king of terrors might bestow on it she was so intent upon her congenial task that she did not observe the sick man had awakened and was viewing her and her work with an intelligent but sinister eye what is that you are making said he grimly the voice was rather clear and strong and seemed so loud and strange in that still chamber that it startled the woman mightily she uttered a little shriek and then was wrath plague take the man said she how you scared me keep quiet do and mind your own business the business of going off the hooks i ask you what is that you are making said griffith louder and raising himself on his arm babys frills replied the woman coolly recovering that contempt for the understandings of the dying which marks the veritable crone ye lie said griffith and there is a shroud who is that for who should it be for thou simple body keep quiet do till the change comes twont be long now art too well to last till sundown so tis for me is it screamed griffith ill disappoint ye yet give me my clothes ill not lie here to be measured for my grave ye old witch heres manners cackled the indignant crone ye foulmouthed knave is this how you thank a decent woman for making a comfortable corpse of ye you that has no right to die in your shoes let a be such dainties as muslin neckruff and shroud of good dutch flax at this griffith discharged a volley in which vulture hag bloodsucker etc blended with as many oaths during which mercy came in she glided to him with her doves eyes full of concern and laid her hand gently on his shoulder youll work yourself a mischief said she leave me to scold her why my good nelly how could you be so harebrained prithee take all that trumpery away this minute none here needeth it nor shall not this many a year please god they want me dead said griffith to her piteously finding he had got one friend and sunk back on his pillow exhausted so it seems said mercy cunningly but id baulk them finely id up and order a beefsteak this minute and shall said griffith with feeble spite leastways do you order it and ill eat it dn her sick men are like children and women soon find that out and manage them accordingly in ten minutes mercy brought a good rumpsteak to the bedside and said now fort marry come up with her windingsheets thus played upon and encouraged the great baby ate more than half the steak and soon after perspired gently and fell asleep paul carrick found him breathing gently with a slight tint of red in his cheek and told mercy there was a change for the better we have brought him to a true intermission said he so throw in the bark at once what drench his honours worship said mercy innocently nay send thou the medicine and ill find womanly ways to get it down him next day came the doctor and whispered softly to mrs vint how are we all upstairs why couldnt you come afore replied mrs vint crossly heres farrier carrick stepped in and curing him out of hand the meddlesome body a farrier rob me of my patient cried the doctor in high dudgeon nay good sir tis no fault of mine this paul is a sort of a kind of a follower of our mercys and she is mistress here i trow and what hath his farriership prescribed friars balsam belike nay i know not but you may soon learn for he is above physicking the gentleman a pretty gentleman and suiting to our mercyafter a manner the doctor declined to make one in so mixed a consultation give me my fee dame said he and as for this impertinent farrier the patients blood be on his head and id have him beware the law mrs vint went to the stairfoot and screamed mercy the good doctor wants his fee who is to pay it i wonder ill bring it him anon said a gentle voice and mercy soon came down and paid it with a willing air that half disarmed professional fury tis a good lass dame said the doctor when she was gone and by the same token i wish her better mated than to a scrub of a farrier griffith still weak but freed of fever woke one glorious afternoon and heard a birdlike voice humming a quaint old ditty and saw a field of golden wheat through an open window and seated at that window the mellow songstress mercy vint plying her needle with lowered lashes but beaming face a picture of health and quiet womanly happiness things were going to her mind in that sickroom he looked at her and at the golden corn and summer haze beyond and the tide of life seemed to rush back upon him my good lass said he tell me where am i for i know not mercy started and left off singing then rose and came slowly towards him with her work in her hand innocent joy at this new symptom of convalescence flushed her comely features but she spoke low good sir at the packhorse said she smiling the packhorse and where is that hard by allerton village and where is that not in cumberland nay in lancashire your worship why whence come you that know not the packhorse nor yet allerton township come you from cumberland no matter whence i come im going on board ship like my father before me alas sir you are not fit you have been very ill and partly distraught she stopped for griffith turned his face to the wall with a deep groan it had all rushed over him in a moment mercy stood still and worked on but the water gathered in her eyes at that eloquent groan byandby griffith turned round again with a face of anguish and filmy eyes and saw her in the same place standing working and pitying what are you there still said he roughly ay sir but ill go sooner than be troublesome can i fetch you anything no ay wine bring me wine to drown it all she brought him a pint of wine pledge me said he with a miserable attempt at a smile she put the cup to her lips and sipped a drop or two but her doves eyes were looking up at him over the liquor all the time griffith soon disposed of the rest and asked for more nay said she but i dare not the doctor hath forbidden excess in drinking the doctor what doctor doctor paul said she demurely he hath saved your life sir i do think plague take him for that so say not i here she left him with an excuse tis milking time sir and you shall know that i am our dairymaid i seldom trouble the inn next day she was on the windowseat working and beaming the patient called to her in peevish accents to put his head higher she laid down her work with a smile and came and raised his head there now that is too high said he how awkward you are i lack experience sir but not good will there now is that a little better ay a little im sick of lying here i want to get up dost hear what i say iwantto get up and so you shall as soon as ever you are fit tomorrow perhaps today you must een be patient patience is a rare medicine tic tic tic what a noise they are making downstairs go lass and bid them hold their peace mercy shook her head good lackaday we might as well bid the river give over running but to be sure this comes of keeping a hostelry sir when we had only the farm we were quiet and did no ill to no one well sing me to drown their eternal buzzing it worries me dead me sing alack sir im no songster that is false you sing like a throstle i dote on music and when i was delirious i heard one singing about my bed i thought it was an angel at that time but twas only you my young mistress and now i ask you you say me nay that is the way with you all plague take the girl and all her curst unreasonable hypocritical sex i warrant me youd sing if i wanted to sleep and dance the devil to a standstill mercy instead of flouncing out of the room stood looking on him with maternal eyes and chuckling like a bird that is right sir tax us all to your hearts content o but im a joyful woman to hear you for tis a sure sign of mending when the sick take to rating of their nurses in sooth i am too crossgrained said griffith relenting not a whit sir for my taste ive been in care for you and now you are a little cross that maketh me easy thou art a good soul wilt sing me a stave after all la you now how you come back to that ay and with a good heart for to be sure tis a sin to gainsay a sick man but indeed i am the homeliest singer methinks tis time i went down and bade them cook your worships supper nay ill not eat nor sup till i hear thee sing your will is my law sir said mercy drily and retired to the windowseat that was the first obvious preliminary then she fiddled with her apron and hemd and waited in hopes a reprieve might come but a peevish relentless voice demanded the song at intervals so then she turned her head carefully away from her hearer lowered her eyes and looking the picture of guilt and shame all the time sang an ancient ditty the poltroons voice was rich mellow clear and sweet as honey and she sang the notes for the sake of the words not the words for the sake of the notes as all but natures singers do the air was grave as well as sweet for mercy was of an old puritan stock and even her songs were not giddypaced but solid quaint and tender all the more did they reach the soul in vain was the blushing cheek averted and the honeyed lips the ravishing tones set the birds chirping outside yet filled the room within and the glasses rang in harmony upon the shelf as the sweet singer poured out from her heart so it seemed the speaking song that begins thus in vain you tell your parting lover you wish fair winds may waft him over alas what winds can happy prove that bear me far from her i love alas what dangers on the main can equal those that i sustain from slighted love and cold disdain griffith beat time with his hand awhile and his own face softened and beautified as the melody curled about his heart but soon it was too much for him he knew the song had sung it to kate peyton in their days of courtship a thousand memories gushed in upon his soul and overpowered him he burst out sobbing violently and wept as if his heart must break alas what have i done said mercy and the tears ran swiftly from her eyes at the sight then with native delicacy she hurried from the room what griffith went through that night in silence was never known but to himself but the next morning he was a changed man he was all dogged resolution put on his clothes unaided though he could hardly stand to do it and borrowed the landlords staff and crawled out a smart distance into the sun it was kill or cure said he i am to live it seems well then the past is dead my life begins again today henlike mercy soon learned this sally of her refractory duckling and was uneasy so for an excuse to watch him she brought him out his money and jewels and told him she had thought it safest to take charge of them he thanked her cavalierly and offered her a diamond ring she blushed scarlet and declined it and even turned a meekly reproachful glance on at him with her doves eyes he had a suit of russet made and put away his fine coat and forbade any one to call him your worship i am a farmer like yourselves said he and my name isthomas leicester a brain fever either kills the unhappy lover or else benumbs the very anguish that caused it and so it was with griffith his love got benumbed and the sense of his wrongs vivid he nursed a bitter hatred of his wife only as he could not punish her without going near her and no punishment short of death seemed enough for her he set to work to obliterate her from his very memory if possible he tried employment he pottered about the little farm advising and helping and that so zealously that the landlord retired altogether from that department and griffith instead of he became mercys ally agricultural and bucolical she was a shepherdess to the core and hated the poor packhorse for all that it was her fate to add to its attractions for griffith bought a viol da gambo and taught her sweet songs which he accompanied with such skill and sometimes with his voice that good company often looked in on the chance of a good song sweetly sung and played the sick in body or mind are egotistical griffith was no exception bent on curing his own deep wound he never troubled his head about the wound he might inflict he was grateful to his sweet nurse and told her so and his gratitude charmed her all the more that it had been rather long in coming he found this dovelike creature a wonderful soother he applied her more and more to his sore heart as for mercy she had been too good and kind to her patient not to take a tender interest in his convalescence our hearts warm more to those we have been kind to than to those who have been kind to us and the female reader can easily imagine what delicious feelings stole into that womanly heart when she saw her pale nursling pick up health and strength under her wing and become the finest handsomest man in the parish pity and admiration where these meet love is not far behind and then this man who had been cross and rough while he was weak became gentler kinder and more deferential to her the stronger he got mrs vint saw they were both fond of each others company and disapproved it she told paul garrick if he had any thought of mercy he had bettor give over shillyshallying for there was another man after her paul made light of it at first she has known me too long to take up her head with a newcomer said he to be sure i never asked her to name the day but she knows my mind well enough and i know hers then you know more than i do said the mother ironically he thought over this conversation and very wisely determined not to run unnecessary risks he came up one afternoon and hunted about for mercy till he found her milking a cow in the adjoining paddock well lass said he ive good news for thee my old dad says we may have his house to live in so now you and i can yoke next month if ye will me turn the honest man out of his house said mercy mighty innocently who asks you he nobbut bargains for the chimney corner and you are not the girl to begrudge the old man that oh no paul but what would father do if i were to leave his house methinks the farm would go to rack and ruin he is so wrapped up in his nasty public why he has got a helper by all accounts and if you talk like that you will never wed at all never is a big word but im too young to marry yet jenny thou jade stand still the attack and defence proceeded upon these terms for some time and the defendant had one base advantage and used it her forehead was wedged tight against jennys ribs and paul could not see her face this and the feminine evasiveness of her replies irritated him at last take thy head out o the coow said he roughly and answer straight is all our wooing to go for nought wooing you never said so much to me in all these years as you have today oh ye knew my mind well enough theres a many ways of showing the heart speaking out is the best i trow why what do i come here for twice a week this two years past if not for thee ay for me and fathers ale and thou canst look at me and tell me that ye false hardhearted hussy but nay thou wast never so tis this thomas leicester hath bewitched thee and set thee against thy true lover mr leicester pays no suit to me said mercy blushing he is a right civilspoken gentleman and you know you saved his life the more fool i i wish i had known he was going to rob me of my lasss heart id have seen him die a hundred times ere id have interfered but they say if you save a mans life hell make you rue it mercy my lass you are well respected in the parish take a thought now better be a farriers wife than a gentlemans mistress mercy did take her head out of the cow at this and for once her cheek burned with anger but the unwonted sentiment died before it could find words and she said quietly i need not be either against my will young carrick made many such appeals to mercy vint but he could never bring her to confess to him that he and she had ever been more than friends or were now anything less than friends still he forced her to own to herself that if she had never seen thomas leicester her quiet affection and respect for garrick would probably have carried her to the altar with him his remonstrances sometimes angry sometimes tearful awoke her pity which was the grand sentiment of her heart and disturbed her peace moreover she studied the two men in her quiet thoughtful way and saw that carrick loved her with all his honest though hitherto tepid heart but griffith had depths and could love with more passion than ever he had shown for her he is not the man to have a fever by reason of me said the poor girl to herself but i am afraid even this attracted her to griffith it nettled a womans soft ambition which is to be as well loved as ever woman was and so things went on and as generally happens the man who was losing ground went the very way to lose more he spoke ill of griffith behind his back called him a highwayman a gentleman an ungrateful undermining traitor but griffith never mentioned carrick and so when he and mercy were together her old follower was pleasingly obliterated and affectionate good humour reigned thus griffith alias thomas became her sunbeam and paul her cloud but he who had disturbed the peace of others his own turn came one day he found mercy crying he sat clown beside her and said kindly why sweetheart what is amiss no great matter said she and turned her head away but did not check her tears for it was new and pleasant to be consoled by thomas leicester nay but tell me child well then jessie carrick has been at me that is all the vixen what did she say nay im not pleased enow with it to repeat it she did cast something in my teeth griffith pressed her to be more explicit she declined with so many blushes that his curiosity was awakened and he told mrs vint with some heat that jess carrick had been making mercy cry like enow said mrs vint coolly shell eat her victuals all one for that please god else ill ring the cocknosed jades neck next time she comes here replied griffith but dame i want to know what she can have to say to mercy to make her cry mrs vint looked him steadily in the face for some time and then and there decided to come to an explanation ten to one tis about her brother said she you know this paul is our mercys sweetheart at these simple words griffith winced and his countenance changed remarkably mrs vint observed it and was all the more resolved to have it out with him her sweetheart said griffith why i have seen them together a dozen of times and not a word of courtship oh the young men dont make many speeches in these parts they show their hearts by act by act why i met them coming home from milking t other evening mercy was carrying the pail brimful and that oaf sauntered by her side with his hands in his pockets was that the act of a lover i heard of it sir said mrs vint quietly and as how you took the pail from her willy nilly and carried it home mercy was vexed about it she told me you panted at the door and she was a deal fitter to carry the pail than you that is just off a sick bed like but lawk sir ye cant go by the likes of that the bachelors here theyd see their sweethearts carry the roof into next parish on their backs like a snail and never put out a hand tis not the custom hereaway but as i was saying paul and our mercy kept company after a manner he never had the wit to flatter her as should be nor the stomach to bid her name the day and hed buy the ring but he talked to her about his sick beasts more than he did to any other girl in the parish and shed have ended by going to church with him only you came and put a coolness atween em i how well sir our mercy is a kindhearted lass though i say it and you were sick and she did nurse you and that was a beginning and to be sure you are a fine personable man and capital company and you are always about the girl and bethink you sir she is flesh and blood like her neighbours and they say once a body has tasted venison steak it spoils their stomach for oat porridge now that is mercys case im thinking not that she ever said as much to me she is too reserved but bless your heart im forced to go about with eyes in my head and watch em all a bit me that keeps an inn griffith groaned im a villain said he nay nay said mrs vint gentlefolks must be amused cost what it may but hoping no offence sir the girl was a good friend to you in time of sickness and so was this paul for that matter she was cried griffith god bless her how can i ever repay her well sir said mrs vint if that comes from your heart you might take our mercy apart and tell her you like her very well but not enough to marry a farmers daughterdont say an innkeepers daughter or youll be sure to offend her she is bitter against the packhorse says you this paul is an honest lad turn your heart back to him and with that mount your black horse and ride away and god speed you sir we shall often talk of you at the packhorse and nought but good griffith gave the woman his hand and his breast laboured visibly jealousy was ingrained in the man mrs vint had pricked his conscience but she had wounded his foible he was not in love with mercy but he esteemed her and liked her and saw her value and above all could not bear another man should have her now this gave the matter a new turn mrs vint had overcome her dislike to him long ago still he was not her favourite but his giving her his hand with a gentle pressure and his manifest agitation rather won her and as uneducated women are your true weathercocks she went about directly to be sure said she our mercy is too good for the likes of him she is not like harry and me she has been well brought up by her aunt prudence as was governess in a noblemans house she can read and write and cast accounts good at her sampler and can churn and make cheeses and play of the viol and lead the psalm in church and dance a minuet she can with any lady in the land as to her nursing in time of sickness that i leave to you sir she is an angel cried griffith and my benefactress no man living is good enough for her and he went away visibly discomposed mrs vint repeated this conversation to mercy and told her thomas leicester was certainly in love with her shouldst have seen his face girl when i told him paul and you were sweethearts twas as if i had run a knife in his heart mercy murmured a few words of doubt but she kissed her mother eloquently and went about rosy and beaming all that afternoon as for griffith his gratitude and his jealousy were now at war and caused him a severe mental struggle carrick too was spurred by jealousy and came every day to the house and besieged blercy and griffith who saw them together and did not hear mercys replies was excited irritated alarmed mrs vint saw his agitation and determined to bring matters to a climax she was always giving him a side thrust and at last she told him plainly that he was not behaving like a man if the girl is not good enough for you why make a fool of her and set her against a good husband and when he replied she was good enough for any man in england then said she why not show your respect for her as paul carrick does he likes her well enough to go to church with her with the horns of this dilemma she so gored kate peytons husband that at last she and paul carrick between them drove him out of his conscience so he watched his opportunity and got mercy alone he took her hand and told her he loved her and that she was his only comfort in the world and he found he could not live without her at this she blushed and trembled a little and leaned her brow upon his shoulder and was a happy creature for a few moments so far fluently enough but then he began to falter and stammer and say that for certain reasons he could not marry at all but if she could be content with anything short of that he would retire with her into a distant country and there where nobody could contradict him would call her his wife and treat her as his wife and pay his debt of gratitude to her by a life of devotion as he spoke her brow retired an inch or two from his shoulder but she heard him quietly out and then drew back and confronted him pale but to all appearance calm call things by their right names said she what you offer me this day in my fathers house is to be your mistress thengod forgive you thomas leicester with this oblique and feminine reply and one look of unfathomable reproach from her soft eyes she turned her back on him but remembering her manners curtsied at the door and so retired and unpretending virtue lent her such true dignity that he was struck dumb and made no attempt to detain her i think her dignified composure did not last long when she was alone at least the next time he saw her her eyes were red his heart smote him and he began to make excuses and beg her forgiveness but she interrupted him dont speak to me no more if you please sir said she civilly but coldly mercy though so quiet and inoffensive had depth and strength of character she never told her mother what thomas leicester had proposed to her her honest pride kept her silent for one thing she would not have it known she had been insulted and besides that she loved thomas leicester still and could not expose or hurt him once there was an israelite without guile though you and i never saw him and once there was a saxon without bile and her name was mercy vint in this heart of gold the affections were stronger than the passions she was deeply wounded and showed it in a patient way to him who had wounded her but to none other her conduct to him in public and private was truly singular and would alone have stamped her a remarkable character she declined all communication with him in private and avoided him steadily and adroitly but in public she spoke to him sang with him when she was asked and treated him much the same as before he could see a subtle difference but nobody else could this generosity coupled with all she had done for him before penetrated his heart and filled him with admiration and remorse he yielded to mrs vints suggestions and told her she was right he would tear himself away and never see the dear packhorse again but oh dame said he tis a sorrowful thing to be alone in the world again and nought to do if i had but a farm and a sweet little inn like this perchance my heart would not be quite so heavy as tis this day at thoughts of parting from thee and thine well sir said mrs vint if that is all there is the vine to let at this moment tis a better place of business than this and some meadows go with it and land to be had in the parish ill ride and see it said griffith eagerly then dejectedly but alas i have no heart to keep an inn without somebody to help me and say a kind word now and then ah mercy vint thou hast spoiled me for living alone this vacillation exhausted mrs vints patience what are ye sighing about ye foolish man said she contemptuously you have got it all your own way if tis a wife ye want ask mercy and dont take a nay if ye would have a housekeeper you need not want one long ill be bound theres plenty of young women where you came from as would be glad to keep the vine under you and if you come to that our mercy is a treasure on the farm but she is no help in the inn no more than a wax figure she never brought us a shilling till you came and made her sing to your base viol nay what you want is a smart handsome girl with a quick eye and a ready tongue and one as can look a man in the face and not given to love nor liquor dont you know never such a one not i humph to be sure there is caroline ryder she is handsome and hath a good wit she is a ladys maid thats your woman if shell come and to be sure she will for to be mistress of an inn thats a ladys maids paradise she would have come a few months ago and gladly ill write to her better talk to her and persuade her ill do that too but i must write to her first so do then but whatever you do dont shillyshally no longer if wrestling was shillyshallying methinks youd bear the bell you or else paul carrick why all this trouble comes ont he might have wed our mercy a year agone for the asking shillyshally belongs to us that be women tis despisable in a man thus driven on all sides griffith rode and inspected the vine it was only seven miles off and after the usual chaffering came to terms with the proprietor he fixed the day for his departure and told mrs vint he must ride into cumberland first to get some money and also to see about a housekeeper he made no secret of all this and indeed was not without hopes mercy would relent or perhaps be jealous of this housekeeper but the only visible effect was to make her look pale and sad she avoided him in private as before harry vint was loud in his regrets and carrick openly exultant griffith wrote to caroline ryder and addressed the latter in a feigned hand and took it himself to the nearest post town the letter came to hand and will appear in that sequence of events on which i am now about to enter chapter xiii if griffith gaunt suffered anguish he inflicted agony mrs gaunt was a highspirited proud and sensitive woman and he crushed her with foul words leonard was a delicate vain and sensitive man accustomed to veneration imagine such a man hurled to the ground and trampled upon griffith should not have fled he should have stayed and enjoyed his vengeance on these two persons it might have cooled him a little had he stopped and seen the immediate consequences of his savage act the priest rose from the ground pale as ashes and trembling with fear and hate the lady was leaning white as a sheet against a tree and holding it with her very nails for a little support they looked round at one another a piteous glance of anguish and horror then mrs gaunt turned and flung her arm round so that the palm of her hand high raised confronted leonard i am thus particular because it was a gesture grand and terrible as the occasion that called it forth a gesture that spoke and said put the whole earth and sea between us for ever after this the next moment she bent her head and rushed away cowering and wringing her hands she made for her house as naturally as a scared animal for its lair but ere she could reach it she tottered under the shame the distress and the mere terror and fell fainting with her fair forehead on the grass caroline ryder was crouched in the doorway and did not see her come out of the grove but only heard a rustle and then saw her proud mistress totter forward and lie white senseless helpless at her very feet ryder littered a scream but did not lose her presence of mind she instantly kneeled over mrs gaunt and loosened her stays with quick and dexterous hand it was very like the hawk perched over and clawing the ringdove she has struck down but people with brains are never quite inhuman a drop of lukewarm pity entered even ryders heart as she assisted her victim she called no one to help her for she saw something very serious had happened and she felt sure mrs gaunt would say something imprudent in that dangerous period when the patient recovers consciousness but has not all her wits about her now ryder was equally determined to know her mistresss secrets and not to share the knowledge with any other person it was a long swoon and when mrs gaunt came to the first thing she saw was ryder leaning over her with a face of much curiosity and some concern in that moment of weakness the poor lady who had keen so roughly handled saw a woman close to her and being a little kind to her so what did she do but throw her arms round ryders neck and burst out sobbing as if her heart would break then that unprincipled woman shed a tear or two with her halfcrocodile half impulse mrs gaunt not only cried on her servants neck she justified ryders forecast by speaking unguardedly ive been insultedinsultedinsulted but even while uttering these words she was recovering her pride so the first insulted seemed to come from a brokenhearted child the second from an indignant lady the third from a wounded queen no more words than this but rose with ryders assistance and went leaning on that faithful creatures shoulder to her own bedroom there she sank into a chair and said in a voice to melt a stone my child bring me my little rose ryder ran and fetched the little girl and mrs gaunt held out both arms to her angelically and clasped her so passionately and piteously to her bosom that rose cried for fear and never forgot the scene all her days and mrs ryder who was secretly a mother felt a genuine twinge of pity and remorse curiosity however was the dominant sentiment she was impatient to get all these convulsions over and learn what had actually passed between mr and mrs gaunt she waited till her mistress appeared calmer and then in soft caressing tones asked her what had happened never ask me that question again cried mrs gaunt wildly then with inexpressible dignity my good girl you have done all you could for me now you must leave me alone with my daughter and my god who knows the truth ryder curtsied and retired burning with baffled curiosity towards dusk thomas leicester came into the kitchen and brought her news with a vengeance he told her and the other maids that the squire had gone raving mad and fled the country oh lasses said he if you had seen the poor souls face a riding headlong through the fair all one as if it was a ploughed field twas white as your smocks and his eyes glowering on tother world we shall neer see that face alive again and this was her doing it surprised and overpowered ryder she threw her apron over her head and went off in hysterics and betrayed her lawless attachment to every woman in the kitchen she who was so clever at probing others this day of violent emotions was followed by a sullen and sorrowful gloom mrs gaunt kept her bedroom and admitted nobody till at last the servants consulted together and sent little rose to knock at her door with a basin of chocolate while they watched on the stairs its only me mamma said rose come in my precious said a trembling voice and so rose got in with her chocolate the next day she was sent for early and at noon mrs gaunt and rose came downstairs but their appearance startled the whole household the mother was dressed all in black and so was her daughter whom she led by the hand mrs gaunts face was pale and sad and stem a monument of deep suffering and highstrung resolution it soon transpired that griffith had left his home for good and friends called on mrs gaunt to slake their curiosity under the mask of sympathy not one of them was admitted no false excuses were made my mistress sees no one for the present was the reply curiosity thus baffled took up the pen but was met with a short unvarying formula there is an unhappy misunderstanding between my husband and me but i shall neither accuse him behind his back nor justify myself thus the proud lady carried herself before the world but secretly she writhed a wife abandoned is a woman insulted and makes the wives that are not abandonedcluck ryder was dejected for a time and though not honestly penitent suffered some remorse at the miserable issue of her intrigues but her elastic nature soon shook it off and she felt a certain satisfaction at having reduced mrs gaunt to her own level this disarmed her hostility she watched her as keenly as ever but out of pure curiosity one thing puzzled her strangely leonard did not visit the house nor could she even detect any communication between the parties at last one day her mistress told her to put on her hat and go to father leonard ryders eyes sparkled and she was soon equipped mrs gaunt put a parcel and a letter into her hands ryder no sooner got out of her sight than she proceeded to tamper with the letter but to her just indignation she found it so ingeniously folded and sealed that she could not read a word the parcel however she easily undid and it contained forty pounds in gold and small notes oho my lady said ryder she was received by leonard with a tender emotion he in vain tried to conceal on reading the letter his features contracted sharply and he seemed to suffer agony he would not even open the parcel you will take that hack said he bitterly what without a word without a word but i will write when i am able dont be long sir suggested ryder i am sure my mistress is wearying for you consider sir she is all alone now not so much alone as i am said the priest nor half so unfortunate and with this he leaned his head despairingly on his hand and motioned to ryder to leave him heres a couple of fools said she to herself as she went home that very evening thomas leicester caught her alone and asked her to marry him she stared at first and then treated it as a jest you come at the wrong time young man said she marriage is put out of countenance no no i will never marry after what i have seen in this house leicester would not take this for an answer and pressed her hard thomas said this plausible jade i like you very well but i couldnt leave my mistress in her trouble time to talk of marrying when master comes here alive and well nay said leicester my only chance is while he is away you care more for his little finger than for my whole body that they all say who says jane and all the lasses you simple man they want you for themselves that is why they belie me nay nay i saw how you carried on when i brought word he was gone you let your heart out for once dont take me for a fool i see how tis but ill face it for i worship the ground you walk on take a thought my lass what good can come of your setting your heart on him im young im healthy and not ugly enough to set the dogs a barking ive got a good place i love you dear ill cure you of that fancy and make you as happy as the day is long ill try and make you as happy as you will make me my beauty he was so earnest and so much in love that mrs ryder pitied him and wished her husband was in heaven i am very sorry tom said she softly dear me i did not think you cared so much for me as this i must just tell you the truth i have got one in my own country and ive promised him i dont care to break my word and if i did he is such a man i am sure he would kill me for it indeed he has told me as much more than once or twice killing is a game that two can play at ah but tis an ugly game and ill have no hand in it anddont you be angry with me tomive known him longest andi love him best by pertinacity and variety in lying she hit the mark at last tom swallowed this figment whole that is but reason said he i take my answer and i wish ye both many happy days together and well spent with this he retired and blubbered a good hour in an outhouse tom avoided the castle and fell into low spirits he told his mother all and she advised him to change the air you have been too long in one place said she i hate being too long in one place myself this fired toms gipsy blood and he said he would travel tomorrow if he could but scrape together money enough to fill a pedlars pack he applied for a loan in several quarters but was denied in all at last the poor fellow summoned courage to lay his case before mrs gaunt ryders influence procured him an interview she took him into the drawingroom and bade him wait there by and by a pale lady all in black glided into the room he pulled his front hair and began to stammer something or other she interrupted him ryder has told me said she softly i am sorry for you and i will do what you require and to be sure we need no gamekeeper here now she then gave him some money and said she would look him up a few trifles besides to put in his pack tonis mother helped him to lay out this money to advantage and one day he called at hernshaw pack and all to bid farewell the servants all laid out something with him for luck and mrs gaunt sent for him and gave him a gold thimble and a pound of tea and several yards of gold lace slightly tarnished and a queen annes guinea he thanked her heartily ay dame said he you had always an open hand married or single my heart is heavy at leaving you but i miss the squires kindly face too hernshaw is not what it used to be mrs gaunt turned her head aside and the man could see his words had made her cry my good thomas said she at last you are going to travel the country you might fall in with him i might said leicester incredulously god grant you may and if ever you should think of your poor mistress and give himthis she put her finger into her bosom and drew out a bullet wrapped in silver paper you will never lose this said she i value it more than gold or silver oh if ever you should see him think of me and my daughter and just put it in his hand without a word as he went out of the room ryder intercepted him and said mayhap you will fall in with our master if ever you do tell him he is under a mistake and the sooner he comes home the better tom leicester departed and for days and weeks nothing occurred to break the sorrowful monotony of the place but the mourner had written to her old friend and confessor francis and after some delay involuntary on his part he came to see her they were often closeted together and spoke so low that ryder could not catch a word francis also paid several visits to leonard and the final result of these visits was that the latter left england francis remained at hernshaw as long as he could and it was mrs gaunts hourly prayer that griffith might return while francis was with her ho did at her earnest request stay much longer than he had intended but at length he was obliged to fix next monday to return to his own place it was on thursday he made this arrangement but the very next day the postman brought a letter to the castle thus addressed to mistress caroline ryder living servant with griffith gaunt esq at his house called hernshaw castle near wigeonmoor in the county of cumberland these with speed the address was in a feigned hand ryder opened it in the kitchen and uttered a scream instantly three female throats opened upon her with questions she looked them contemptously in them faces put the letter into her pocket and soon after slipped away to her own room and locked herself in while she read it it ran thus good mistress ryderi am alive yet by the blessing though somewhat battered being now risen from a fever wherein i lost my wits for a time and on coming to myself i found them making of my shroud whereby you shall learn how near i was to death and all this i owe to that false perjured woman that was my wife and is your mistress know that i have donned russet and doffed gentility for i find a heavy hearts best cure is occupation i have taken a wayside inn and think of renting a small farm which two things go well together now you are of all those i know most fitted to manage the inn and i the farm you were always my good friend and if you be so still then i charge you most solemnly that you utter no word to any living soul about this letter but meet me privately where we can talk fully of these matters for i will not set foot in hernshaw castle moreover she told me once twas hers and so be it on friday i shall be at stapleton and the next day by an easy journey to the place where i once was so happy so then at seven of the clock on saturday evening be the same wet or dry prithee come to the gate of the grove unbeknown and speak to your faithful friend and most unhappy master griffith gaunt be secret as the grave would i were in it this letter set caroline ryder in a tumult griffith alive and well and set against his wife and coming to her for assistance after the first agitation she read it again and weighed every syllable there was one book she had studied more than most of usthe heart and she soon read griffiths in this letter it was no loveletter he really intended business but weak in health and broken in spirit and alone in the world he naturally turned to one who had confessed an affection for him and would therefore be true to his interests and study his happiness the proposal was every way satisfactory to mrs ryder to be mistress of an inn and have servants under her instead of being one herself and then if griffith and she began as allies in business she felt very sure she could make herself first necessary to him and then dear to him she was so elated she could hardly contain herself and all her fellow servants remarked that mrs ryder had heard good news saturday came and never did hours seem to creep so slowly but at last the sun set and the stars came out there was no moon ryder opened the window and looked out it was an admirable night for an assignation she washed her face again put on her grey silk gown and purple petticoatmrs gaunt had given them to herand at the last moment went and made up her mistresss fire and put out everything she thought could be wanted and five minutes after seven oclock tied a scarlet handkerchief over her head and stepped out at the back door what with her coal black hair so streaked with red her black eyes flashing in the starlight and her glowing cheeks she looked bewitching and thus armed for conquest wily yet impassioned she stole out with noiseless foot and beating heart to her appointment with her imprudent master chapter xiv the bill was paid the black horse saddled and brought round to the door mr and mrs vint stood bareheaded to honour the parting guest and the latter offered him the stirrup cup griffith looked round for mercy she was nowhere to be seen then he said piteously to mrs vint what not even bid me goodbye mrs vint replied in a very low voice that there was no disrespect intended the truth is sir she could not trust herself to see you go but she bade me give you a message says she mother tell him i pray god to bless him go where he will something rose in griffiths throat oh dame said he if she only knew the truth she would think better of me than she does god bless her and he rode sorrowfully away alone in the world once more at the first turn in the road he wheeled his horse and took a last lingering look there was nothing vulgar nor innlike in the packhorse it stood fifty yards from the road on a little rural green and was picturesque itself the front was entirely clad with largeleaved ivy shutters there were none the windows with their diamond panes were lustrous squares set like great eyes in the green ivy it looked a pretty peaceful retreat and in it griffith had found peace and a dovelike friend he sighed and rode away from the sight not raging and convulsed as when he rode from hernshaw castle but somewhat sick at heart and very heavy he paced so slowly that it took him a quarter of an hour to reach the woodman a wayside inn not two miles distant as he went by a farmer hailed him from the porch and insisted on drinking with him for he was very popular in the neighbourhood whilst they were thus employed who should come out but paul carrick booted and spurred and flushed in the face and rather the worse for liquor imbibed on the spot so you are going are ye said he a good job too then turning to the other master gutteridge never you save a mans life if you can anywise help it i saved this ones and what does he do but turn round and poison my sweetheart against me how can you say so remonstrated griffith i never belied you your name scarce ever passed my lips dont tell me said carrick however she has come to her senses and given your worship the sack ride you into cumberland and i to the packhorse and take my own again with this he unhooked his nag from the wall and clattered off to the packhorse griffith sat a moment stupified and then his face was convulsed by his ruling passion he wheeled his horse gave him the spur and galloped after carrick he soon came up with him and yelled in his ear ill teach you to spit your wormwood in my cup of sorrow carrick shook his fist defiantly and spurred his horse in turn it was an exciting race and a novel one but soon decided the great black hunter went ahead and still improved his advantage carrick purple with rage was full a quarter of a mile behind when griffith dashed furiously into the stable of the packhorse and leaving black dick panting and covered with foam ran in search of mercy the girl told him she was in the dairy he looked in at the window and there she was with her mother with instinctive sense and fortitude she had fled to work she was trying to churn but it would not do she had laid her shapely arm all across the churn and her head on it and was crying mrs vint was praising carrick and offering homely consolation ah mother sighed mercy i could have made him happy he does not know that and he has turned his back on content what will become of him now griffith heard no more he went round to the front door and rushed in take your own way dame said he in great agitation put up the banns when you like sweetheart wilt wed with me ill make thee the best husband i can mercy screamed faintly and lifted up her hands then she blushed and trembled to her very finger ends but it ended in smiles of joy and her brow upon his shoulder in which attitude with mrs vint patting him approvingly on the back they were surprised by paul carrick he came to the door and there stood aghast the young man stared ruefully at the picture and then said very drily im too late methinks that you be paul said mrs vint cheerfully she is meat for your master dontyounevercome to meto save your lifeno more blubbered paul breaking down all of a sudden he then retired little heeded and came no more to the packhorse for several days chapter xv it is desirable that improper marriages should never be solemnized and the christian church saw this many hundred years ago and ordained that before a marriage the banns should be cried in a church three sundays and any person there present might forbid the union of the parties and allege the just impediment this precaution was feeble but not wholly inadequatein the middle ages for we know by good evidence that the priest was often interrupted and the banns forbidden but in modern days the banns are never forbidden in other words the precautionary measure that has come down to us from the thirteenth century is out of date and useless it rests indeed on an estimate of publicity that has become childish if persons about to marry were compelled to inscribe their names and descriptions in a matrimonial weekly gazette and a copy of this were placed on a desk in ten thousand churches perhaps we might stop one lady per annum from marrying her husbands brother and one gentleman from wedding his neighbours wife but the crying of banns in a single parish church is a waste of the peoples time and the parsons breath and so it proved in griffith gaunts case the rev william wentworth published in the usual recitative the banns of marriage between thomas leicester of the parish of marylebone in london and mercy vint spinster of this parish and creation present ex hypothesi medivale but absent in fact assented by silence to the union so thomas leicester wedded mercy vint and took her home to the packhorse it would be well if those who stifle their consciences and commit crimes would set up a sort of medicomoral diary and record their symptoms minutely day by day such records might help to clear away some vague conventional notions to tell the truth our hero and now malefactor the combination is of high antiquity enjoyed for several months the peace of mind that belongs of right to innocence and his days passed in a state of smooth complacency mercy was a good wise and tender wife she naturally looked up to him after marriage more than she did before she studied his happiness as she had never studied her own she mastered his character admired his good qualities discerned his weaknesses but did not view them as defects only as little traits to be watched lest she should give pain to her master as she called him affection in her took a more obsequious form than it could ever assume in kate peyton and yet she had great influence and softly governed her master for his good she would come into the room and take away the bottle if he was committing excess but she had a way of doing it so like a good but resolute mother and so unlike a termagant that he never resisted upon the whole she nursed his mind as in earlier days she had nursed his body and then she made him so comfortable she observed him minutely to that end as is the eye of a maid to the hand of her mistress so mercy leicesters dovelike eye was ever watching her masters face to learn the minutest features of his mind one evening he came in tired and there was a black fire in the parlour his countenance fell the sixteenth of an inch you and i sir should never have noticed it but mercy did and ever after there was a clear fire when he came in she noted too that he loved to play the viol da gambo but disliked the trouble of tuning it so then she tuned it for him when he came home at night early or late he was sure to find a dry pair of shoes on the rug his sixstringed viol tuned to a hair a bright fire and a brighter wife smiling and radiant at his coming and always neat for said she shall i don my bravery for strangers and not for my thomas that is the best of company they used to go to church and come back together hand in hand like lovers for the arm was rarely given in those days and griffith said to himself every sunday what a comfort to have a protestant wife but one day he was off his guard and called her kate my dear who is kate said she softly but with a degree of trouble and intelligence that made him tremble no matter said he all in a flutter then solemnly whoever she was she is dead dead ah said mercy very tenderly and solemnly and under her breath you loved her yet she must die she paused then in a tone so exquisite i can only call it an angels whisper poor kate griffith groaned aloud for gods sake never mention that name to me again let me forget she ever lived she was not the true friend to me that you have been mercy replied softly say not so thomas you loved her well her death had all but cost me thine ah well we cannot all be the first i am not very jealous for my part and i thank god fort thou art a dear good husband to me and that is enow paul carrick unable to break off his habits came to the packhorse now and then but mercy protected her husbands heart from pain she was kind and even pitiful but so discreet and resolute and contrived to draw the line so clearly between her husband and her old sweetheart that griffiths foible could not burn him for want of fuel and so passed several months and the mans heart was at peace he could not love mercy passionately as he had loved kate but he was full of real regard and esteem for her it was one of those gentle clinging attachments that outlast grand passions and survive till death a tender pure affection though built upon a crime they had been married and lived in sweet content about three quarters of a yearwhen trouble came but in a vulgar form a murrain carried off several of harry vints cattle and it then came out that he had purchased six of them on credit and had been induced to set his hands to bills of exchange for them his rent was also behind and in fact his affairs were in a desperate condition he hid it as long as he could from them all but at last being served with a process for debt and threatened with a distress and an execution he called a family council and exposed the real state of things mrs vint rated him soundly for keeping all this secret so long he whom they called thomas leicester remonstrated with him had you told me in time said he i had not paid forfeit for the vine but settled there and given you a home mercy said never a word but poor father as the peril drew nearer the conversation became more animated and agitated and soon the old people took to complaining of thomas leicester to his wife thou hast married a gentleman and he hath not the heart to lift a hand to save thy folk from ruin say not so pleaded mercy to be sure he hath the heart but not the means twas but yestreen he bade me sell his jewels for you but mother i think they belonged to some one he loved and she died so poor thing how could i then if you love me blame me and not him jewels quotha will they stop such a gap as ours was the contemptuous reply from complaining of him behind his back the old people soon came to launching innuendoes obliquely at him here is one specimen out of a dozen wife if our mercy had wedded one of her own sort mayhap hed have helped us a bit ay poor soul and she so near her time if the bailiffs come down on us next month tis my belief we shall lose her as well as house and home the false thomas leicester let them run on in dogged silence but every word was a stab and one day when he had been baited sore with hints he turned round on them fiercely and said did i get you into this mess its all your own doing learn to see your own faults and not be so hard on one that has been the best servant you ever had gentleman or not men can resist the remonstrances that wound them and so irritate them better than they can those gentle appeals that rouse no anger but soften the whole heart the old people stung him but mercy without design took a surer way she never said a word but sometimes when the discussions were at their height she turned her dovelike eyes on him with a look so loving so humbly inquiring so timidly imploring that his heart melted within him ah that is a true touch of nature and genuine observation of the sexes in the old song my feyther urged me sair my mither didna speak but she looked me in the face till my hairt was like to break these silent womanly imploring looks of patient mercy were mightier than argument or invective the man knew all along where to get money and how to get it he had only to go to hernshaw castle but his very soul shuddered at the idea however for mercys sake he took the first step he compelled himself to look the thing in the face and discuss it with himself a few months ago he could not have done this he loved his lawful wife too much hated her too much but now mercy and time had blunted both those passions and he could ask himself whether he could not encounter kate and her priest without any very violent emotion when they first set up house together he had spent his whole fortune a sum of two thousand pounds on repairing and embellishing hernshaw castle and grounds since she had driven him out of the house he had a clear right to have back the money and now he resolved he would have it only what he wanted was to get it without going to the place in person and now mercys figure as well as her imploring looks moved him greatly she was in that condition which appeals to a mans humanity and masculine pity as well as to his affection to use the homely words of scripture she was great with child and in that condition moved slowly about him filling his pipe and laying his slippers and ministering to all his little comforts she would make no difference and when he saw the poor dove move about him so heavily and rather languidly yet so zealously and tenderly the mans very bowels yearned over her and he felt as if he could die to do her a service so one day when she was standing by him bending over his little round table and filling his pipe with her neat hand he took her by the other hand and drew her gently on his knee her burden and all child said he do not thou fret i know how to get money and ill dot for thy sake i know that said she softly can i no read thy face by this time and so laid her cheek to his but thomas for my sake get it honestly or not at all said she still filling his pipe with her cheek to his ill but take back my own said he fear nought but after thus positively pledging himself to mercy he became thoughtful and rather fretful for he was still most averse to go to hernshaw and yet could hit upon no other way since to employ an agent would be to let out that he had committed bigamy and so risk his own neck and break mercys heart after all his scale was turned by his foible mrs vint had been weak enough to confide her trouble to a friend it was all over the parish in three days well one day in the kitchen of the inn paul carrick having drunk two pints of good ale said to vint landlord you ought to have married her to me ive got two hundred pounds laid by id have pulled you out of the mire and welcome would you though paul said harry vint then by g i wish i had now carrick bawled that out and griffith who was at the door heard it he walked into the kitchen ghastly pale and spoke to harry vint first i take your inn your farm and your debts on me said he not one without tother spoke like a man cried the landlord joyfully and so be itbefore these witnesses griffith turned on carrick this house is mine get out ont ye jealous mischiefmaking cur and he took him by the collar and dragged him furiously out of the place and sent him whirling into the middle of the road then ran back for his hat and flung it out after him this done he sat down boiling and his eyes roved fiercely round the room in search of some other antagonist but his strength was so great and his face so altered with this sudden spasm of reviving jealousy that nobody cared to provoke him farther after a while however harry vint muttered drily there goes one good customer griffith took him up sternly if your debts are to be mine your trade shall be mine too that you had not the head to conduct so be it soninlaw said the old man only you go so fast you do take possession afore you pays the fee griffith winced that shall be the last of your taunts old man he turned to the ostler bill give black dick his oats at sunrise and in ten days at farthest ill pay every shilling this house and farm do owe now master white youll put in hand a new signboard for this inn a fresh packhorse and paint him jet black with one white hoof instead of chocolate in honour of my nag dick and in place of harry vint youll put in thomas leicester see that is done against i come back or come you here no more soon after this scene he retired to tell mercy and on his departure the suppressed tongues went like millclacks dick came round saddled at peep of day but mercy had been up more than an hour and prepared her mans breakfast she clung to him at parting and cried a little and whispered something in his ear for nobody else to hear it was an entreaty that he would not be long gone lest he should be far from her in the hour of her peril thereupon he promised her and kissed her tenderly and bade her be of good heart and so rode away northwards with dogged resolution as soon as he was gone mercys tears flowed without restraint her father set himself to console her thy good man he said is but gone back to the high road for a night or two to follow his trade of stand and deliver fear nought child his pistols are well primed i saw to that myself and his horse is the fleetest in the county youll have him back in three days and money in both pockets i warrant you his is a better trade than mine and he is a fool to change it griffith was two days upon the road and all that time he was turning over and discussing in his mind how he should conduct the disagreeable but necessary business he had undertaken he determined at last to make the visit one of business only no heat no reproaches that lovely hateful woman might continue to dishonour his name for he had himself abandoned it he would not deign to receive any money that was hers but his own two thousand pounds he would have and two or three hundred on the spot by way of instalment and with these hard views he drew near to hernshaw but the nearer he got the slower he went for what at a distance had seemed tolerably easy began to get more and more difficult and repulsive moreover his heart which he thought he had steeled began now to flutter a little and somehow to shudder at the approaching interview chapter xvi caroline ryder went to the gate of the grove and stayed there two hours but of course no griffith came she returned the next night and the next and then she gave it up and awaited an explanation none came and she was bitterly disappointed and indignant she began to hate griffith and to conceive a certain respect and even a tepid friendship for the other woman he had insulted another clue to this change of feeling is to be found in a word she let drop in talking to another servant sly mistress said she bears it like a man in fact mrs gaunts conduct at this period was truly noble she suffered months of torture months of grief but the highspirited creature hid it from the world and maintained a sad but high composure she wore her black for she said how do i know he is alive she retrenched her establishment reduced her expenses twothirds and busied herself in works of charity and religion her desolate condition attracted a gentleman who had once loved her and now esteemed and pitied her profoundly sir george neville he was still unmarried and she was the cause so far at least as this she had put him out of conceit with the other ladies at that period when he had serious thoughts of marriage and the inclination to marry at all had not since returned if the gaunts had settled at bolton sir george would have been their near neighbour but nevilles court was nine miles from hernshaw castle and when they met which was not very often mrs gaunt was on her guard to give griffith no shadow of uneasiness she was therefore rather more dignified and distant with sir george than her own inclination and his merits would have prompted for he was a superior and very agreeable man when it became quite certain that her husband had left her sir george rode up to hernshaw castle and called upon her she begged to be excused from seeing him now sir george was universally courted and this rather nettled him however he soon learned that she received nobody except a few religious friends of her own sex sir george then wrote her a letter that did him credit it was full of worthy sentiment and good sense for instance he said he desired to intrude his friendly offices and his sympathy upon her but nothing more time had cured him of those warmer feelings which had once ruffled his peace but time could not efface his tender esteem for the lady he had loved in his youth nor his profound respect for her character mrs gaunt wept over his gentle letter and was on the verge of asking herself why she had chosen griffith instead of this chevalier she sent him a sweet yet prudent reply she did not encourage him to visit her but said that if ever she should bring herself to receive visits from the gentlemen of the county during her husbands absence he should be the first to know it she signed herself his unhappy but deeply grateful servant and friend one day as she came out of a poor womans cottage with a little basket on her arm which she had emptied in the cottage she met sir george neville full he took his hat off and made her a profound bow he was then about to ride on but altered his mind and dismounted to speak to her the interview was constrained at first but ere long he ventured to tell her she really ought to consult with some old friend and practical man like himself he would undertake to scour the country and find her husband if he was above ground me go a hunting the man cried she turning red not if he was my king as well as my husband he knows where to find me and that is enough well but madam would you not like to learn where he is and what he is doing why yes my good kind friend i should like to know that and having pronounced these words with apparent calmness she burst out crying and almost ran away from him sir george looked sadly after her and formed a worthy resolution he saw there was but one road to her regard he resolved to hunt her husband for her without intruding on her or giving her a voice in the matter sir george was a magistrate and accustomed to organize inquiries spite of the length of time that had elapsed he traced griffith for a considerable distance pending further inquiries he sent mrs gaunt word that the truant had not made for the sea but had gone due south mrs gaunt returned him her warm thanks for this scrap of information so long as griffith remained in the island there was always a hope he might return to her the money he had taken would soon be exhausted and poverty might drive him to her and she was so far humbled by grief that she could welcome him even on those terms affliction tempers the proud mrs gaunt was deeply injured as well as insulted but for all that in her many days and weeks of solitude and sorrow she took herself to task and saw her fault she became more gentle more considerate of her servants feelings more womanly for many months she could not enter the grove the spirited womans very flesh revolted at the sight of the place where she had been insulted and abandoned but as she went deeper in religion she forced herself to go to the gate and look in and say out loud i gave the first offence and then she would go indoors again quivering with the internal conflict finally being a catholic and therefore attaching more value to selftorture than we do the poor soul made this very grove her place of penance once a week she had the fortitude to drag herself to the very spot where griffith had denounced her and there she would kneel and pray for him and for herself and certainly if humility and selfabasement were qualities of the body here was to be seen their picture for her way was to set her crucifix up at the foot of a tree then to bow herself all down between kneeling and lying and put her lips meekly to the foot of the crucifix and so pray long and earnestly now one day while she was thus crouching in prayer a gentleman booted and spurred and splashed drew near with hesitating steps she was so absorbed she did not hear those steps at all till they were very near but then she trembled all over for her delicate ear recognized a manly tread she had not heard for many a day she dared not move nor look for she thought it was a mere sound sent to her by heaven to comfort her but the next moment a wellknown mellow voice came like a thunderclap it shook her so forgive me my good dame but i desire to know the question went no farther for kate gaunt sprang to her feet with a loud scream and stood glaring at griffith gaunt and he at her and thus husband and wife met againmet by some strange caprice of destiny on the very spot where they had parted so horribly chapter xvii the gaze these two persons bent on one another may be half imagined it can never be described griffith spoke first in black said he in a whisper his voice was low his face though pale and grim had not the terrible aspect he wore at parting so she thought he had come back in an amicable spirit and she flew to him with a cry of love and threw her arm round his neck and panted on his shoulder at this reception and the tremulous contact of one he had loved so dearly a strange shudder ran through his frame a shudder that marked his present repugnance yet indicated her latent power he himself felt he had betrayed some weakness and it was all the worse for her he caught her wrist and put her from him not roughly but with a look of horror the day is gone by for that madam he gasped then sternly think you i came here to play the credulous husband mrs gaunt drew back in her turn and faltered out what come back here and not sorry for what you have done not the least sorry oh my heart you have almost broken it prithee no more of this said griffith sternly you and i are nought to one another now and for ever but there you are but a woman and i did not come to quarrel with you and he fixed his eyes on the ground thank god for that faltered mrs gaunt oh sir the sight of youthe thought of what you were to me oncetill jealousy blinded you lend me your arm if you are a man my limbs do fail me the shock had been too much a pallor overspread her lovely features her knees knocked together and she was tottering like some tender tree cut down when griffith who with all his faults was a man put out his strong arm and she clung to it quivering all over and weeping hysterically that little hand with its little feminine clutch trembling on his arm raised a certain male compassion for her piteous condition and he bestowed a few cold sad words of encouragement on her come come said he gently i shall not trouble you long im cured of my jealousy tis gone along with my love you and your saintly sinner are safe from me i am come hither for my own my two thousand pounds and for nothing more ah you are come back for money not for me she murmured with forced calmness for money and not for you of course said he coldly the words wore hardly out of his month when the proud lady flung his arm from her then money shall you have and not me nor ought of me but my contempt but she could not carry it off as heretofore she turned her back haughtily on him but at the first step she burst out crying come and ill give you what you are come for she sobbed ungrateful heartless oh how little i knew this man she crept away before him drooping her head and crying bitterly and he followed her hanging his head and ill at ease for there was such true passion in her voice her streaming eyes and indeed in her whole body that he was moved and the part he was playing revolted him he felt confused and troubled and asked himself how on earth it was that she the guilty one contrived to appear the injured one and made him the wronged one feel almost remorseful mrs gaunt took no more notice of him now than if he had been a dog following at her heels she went into the drawingroom and sank helplessly on the nearest couch threw her head wearily back and shut her eyes yet the tears trickled through the closed lids griffith caught up a handbell and rang it vigorously quick light steps were soon heard pattering and in darted caroline ryder with an anxious face for of late she had conceived a certain sober regard for her mistress who had ceased to be her successful rival and who bore her grief like a man at sight of griffith ryder screamed aloud and stood panting mrs gaunt opened her eyes ay child he has come home said she bitterly his body but not his heart she stretched her hand out feebly and pointed to a bottle of salts that stood on the table ryder ran and put them to her nostrils mrs gaunt whispered in her ear send a swift horse for father francis tell him life or death ryder gave her a very intelligent look and presently slipped out and ran into the stableyard at the gate she caught sight of griffiths horse what does this quickwitted creature do but send the groom off on that horse and not on mrs gaunts now dame said griffith doggedly are you better ay i thank you then listen to me when you and i set up house together i had two thousand pounds i spent it on this house the house is yours you told me so one day you know ah you can remember my faults i remember all kate thank you at least for calling me kate well griffith since you abandoned us i thought and thought and thought of all that might befall you and i said what will he do for money my jewels that you did me the honour to take would not last you long i feared so i reduced my expenses threefourths at least and i put by some money for your need griffith looked amazed for my need said he for whose else ill send for it and place it in your handstomorrow tomorrow why not today i have a favour to ask of you first what is that justice if you are fond of money i too have something i prize my honour you have belied and insulted me sir but i know you were under a delusion i mean to remove that delusion and make you see how little i am to blame for alas i own i was imprudent but oh griffith as i hope to be saved it was the imprudence of innocence and overconfidence mistress said griffith in a stern yet agitated voice be advised and leave all this rouse not a mans sleeping wrath let bygones be bygones mrs gaunt rose and said faintly so be it i must go sir and give some orders for your entertainment oh dont put yourself about for me said griffith i am not the master of this house mrs gaunts lip trembled but she was a match for him then are you my guest said she and my credit is concerned in your comfort she made him a curtsy as if he were a stranger and marched to the door concealing with great pride and art a certain trembling of her knees at the door she found ryder and bade her follow much to that ladys disappointment for she desired a ttette with griffith and an explanation as soon as the two women were out of griffiths hearing the mistress laid her hand on the servants arm and giving way to her feelings said all in a flutter child if i have been a good mistress to thee show it now help me keep him in the house till father francis comes i undertake to do so much said ryder firmly leave it to me mistress mrs gaunt threw her arms round ryders neck and kissed her it was done so ardently and by a woman hitherto so dignified and proud that ryder was taken by surprise and almost affected as for the service mrs gaunt had asked of her it suited her own designs mistress said she be ruled by me keep out of his way abit while i get miss rose ready you understand ah i have one true friend in the house said poor mrs gaunt she then confided in ryder and went away to give her own orders for griffiths reception ryder found little rose dressed her to perfection and told her her dear papa was come home she then worked upon the childs mind in that subtle way known to women so that rose went downstairs loaded and primed though no distinct instructions had been given her as for griffith he walked up and down uneasy and wished he had stayed at the packhorse he had not bargained for all these emotions the peace of mind he had enjoyed for some months seemed trickling away mercy my dear said he to himself twill be a dear penny to me i doubt then he went to the window and looked at the lawn and sighed then he sat down and thought of the past whilst he sat thus moody the door opened very softly and a little cherubic face with blue eyes and golden hair peeped in griffith started ah cried rose with a joyful scream and out flew her little arms and away she came half running half dancing and was on his knee in a moment with her arms round his neck papa papa she cried oh my dear dear dear darling papa and she kissed and patted his cheek again and again her innocent endearments moved him to tears my pretty angel he sighed my lamb how your heart beats dont cry dear papa nobody is dead only we thought you were im so glad you are come home alive now we can take off this nasty black i hate it what tis for me you wear it pretty one ay mamma made us poor mamma has been so unhappy and that reminds me you are a wicked man papa but i love you all one for that it tis so dull when everybody is good like mamma and she makes me dreadfully good too but now you are come back there will be a little little wickedness again it is to be hoped arent you glad you are not dead and are come home instead i am i am glad i have seen thee come take my hand and let us go look at the old place ay but you must wait till i get on my new hat and feather nay nay art pretty enough bareheaded oh papa but i must for decency you are company now you know dull company sweetheart thoult find me i dont mean that i mean when you were here always you were only papa but now you come once in an age youre company i wont budge without em so there now well little one i do submit to thy hat and feather only be quick or i shall go forth without thee if you dare said rose impetuously for i wont be half a moment she ran and extorted from ryder the new hat and feather which by rights she was not to have worn until next month griffith and his little girl went all over the wellknown premises he sad and moody she excited and chattering and nodding her head down and cocking her eye up every now and then to get a glimpse of her feather and dont you go away again dear papa it tis so dull without you nobody comes here mamma wont let em nobody except father leonard said griffith bitterly father leonard why he never comes here leonard that is the beautiful priest that used to pat me on the head and bid me love and honour my parents and so i do only mamma is always crying and you keep away so how can i love and honour you when i never see you and they keep telling me you are good for nothing and dead my young mistress when did you see father leonard last said griffith gnawing his lip how can i tell why it was miles ago when i was a mere girl you know he went away before you did i know nothing of the kind tell me the truth now he has visited here since i went away nay papa that is strange she visits him then what mamma she seldom stirs out and never beyond the village we keep no carriage now mamma is turned such a miser she is afraid you will be poor so she puts it all by for you but now you are come we shall have carriages and things again oh bytheby father leonard i heard them say he had left england so i did when was that well i think that was a little bit after you went away that is strange said griffith thoughtfully he led his little girl by the hand but scarcely listened to her prattle he was so surprised and puzzled by the information he had elicited from her upon the whole however he concluded that his wife and the priest had perhaps been smitten with remorse and had partedwhen it was too late this and the peace of mind he had found elsewhere somewhat softened his feelings towards them so thought he they were not hardened creatures after all poor kate as these milder feelings gained on him rose suddenly uttered a joyful cry and looking up he saw mrs gaunt coming towards him and ryder behind her both were in gay colours which in fact was what had so delighted rose they came up and mrs gaunt seemed a changed woman she looked young and beautiful and bent a look of angelic affection on her daughter and said to griffith is she not grown is she not lovely sure you will never desert her again twas not her i deserted but her mother and she had played me false with her dd priest was griffiths reply mrs gaunt drew back with horror this before my girl she cried griffith gaunt you lie and this time it was the woman who menaced the man she rose to six feet high and advanced on him with her great grey eyes flashing flames at him oh that i were a man she cried this insult should be the last id lay you dead at her feet and mine griffith actually drew back a step for the wrath of such a woman was terrible more terrible perhaps to a brave man than to a coward then he put his hands in his pockets with a dogged air and said grinding his teeth butas you are not a man and im not a woman we cant settle it that way so i give you the last word and good day im sore in want of money but i find i cant pay the price it is like to cost me farewell begone said mrs gaunt and this time for ever ruffian and fool i loathe the sight of you rose ran weeping to her oh mamma dont quarrel with papa then back to griffith oh papa dont quarrel with mammafor my sake griffith hung his head and said in a broken voice no my lamb we twain must not quarrel before thee we will part in silence as becomes those that once were dear and have thee to show fort madam i wish you all health and happiness adieu he turned on his heel and mrs gaunt took rose to her knees and bent and wept over her niobe over her last was not more graceful nor more sad as for ryder she stole quietly after her retiring master she found him peering about and asked him demurely what he was looking for my good black horse girl to take me from this cursed place did i not tie him to your gate the black horse why i sent him for father francis nay listen to me master you know i was always your friend and hard upon her well since you went things have come to pass that make me doubt i do begin to fear you were too hasty do you tell me this now woman cried griffith furiously how could i tell you before why did you break your tryst with me if you had come according to your letter id have told you months ago what i tell you now but as i was saying the priest never came near her after you left and she never stirred abroad to meet him more than that he has left england remorse too late perhaps it may sir i couldnt say but there is one coming that knows the very truth who is that father francis the moment you came sir i took it on me to send for him you know the man he wont tell a lie to please our dame and he knows all for leonard has confessed to him i listened and heard him say as much then master be advised and get the truth from father francis griffith trembled francis is an honest man said he ill wait till he comes but oh my lass i find money may be bought too dear your chamber is ready sir and your clothes put out supper is ordered let me show you your room we are all so happy now well said he listlessly since my horse is gone and francis coming and im wearied and sick of the world do what you will with me for this one day he followed her mechanically to a bedroom where was a bright fire and a fine shirt and his silverlaced suit of clothes airing a sense of luxurious comfort struck him at the sight ay he said ill dress and so to supper im main hungry it seems a man must eat let his heart be ever so sore before she left him ryder asked him coldly why he had broken his appointment with her that is too long a story to tell you now said he coolly another time then said she and went out smiling but bitter at heart griffith had a good wash and enjoyed certain little conveniences which he had not at the packhorse he doffed his riding suit and donned the magnificent dress ryder had selected for him and with his fine clothes he somehow put on more ceremonious manners he came down to the diningroom to his surprise he found it illuminated with wax candles and the table and sideboard gorgeous with plate supper soon smoked upon the board but though it was set for three nobody else appeared griffith inquired of ryder whether he was to sup alone she replied my mistress desires you not to wait for her she has no stomach well then i have said griffith and fell o with a will ryder who waited on this occasion stood and eyed him with curiosity his conduct was so unlike a womans just as he concluded the door opened and a burly form entered griffith rose and embraced him with his arms and lips after the fashion of the day welcome thou one honest priest said he welcome thrice welcome my longlost son said the cordial francis sit down man and eat with me ill begin again for you presently squire ive work to do first go thou and bid thy mistress to come hither to me ryder to whom this was addressed went out and left the gentlemen together father francis drew out of his pocket two packets carefully tied and sealed he took a knife from the table and cut the strings and broke the seals griffith eyed him with curiosity father francis looked at him these said he very gravely are the letters that brother leonard hath written at sundry times to catherine gaunt and these are the letters catherine gaunt hath written to brother leonard griffith trembled and his face was convulsed let me read them at once said he and stretched out his hand with eyes like a dogs in the dark francis withdrew them quietly not till she is also present said he at that griffiths goodnature multiplied by a good supper took the alarm come come sir said he have a little mercy i know you are a just man and though a boon companion most severe in all matters of morality but i tell you plainly if you are going to drag this poor woman in the dirt i shall go out of the room what is the use tormenting her ive told her my mind before her own child and now i wish i had not when i caught them in the grove i lifted my hand to strike her and she never winced i had better have left that alone too methinks dn the women you are always in the wrong if you treat em like men they are not wicked they are weak and this one hath lain in my bosom and borne me two children and one he lieth in the churchyard and tother hath her hair and my very eyes and the truth is i cant bear any man on earth to miscall her but myself god help me i doubt i love her still too well to sit by and see her tortured she was all in black for her fault poor penitent wretch give me the letters but let her be francis was moved by this appeal but shook his head solemnly and ere griffith could renew his argument the door was flung open by ryder and a stately figure sailed in that took both the gentlemen by surprise it was mrs gaunt in full dress rich brocade that swept the ground magnificent bust like parian marble varnished and on her brow a diadem of emeralds and diamonds that gave her beauty an imperial stamp she swept into the room as only fine women can sweep made griffith a haughty curtsy and suddenly lowered her head and received father franciss blessing then seated herself and quietly awaited events the brazen jade thought griffith but how divinely beautiful and he became as agitated as she was calmin appearance for need i say her calmness was put on defensive armour made for her by her pride and her sex the voice of father francis now rose solid grave and too impressive to be interrupted my daughter and you who are her husband and my friend i am here to do justice between you both with gods help and to show you both your faults catherine gaunt you began the mischief by encouraging another man to interfere between you and your husband in things secular but father he was my director my priest my daughter do you believe with the protestants that marriage is a mere civil contract or do you hold with us that it is one of the holy sacraments can you ask me murmured kate reproachfully well then those whom god and the whole church have in holy sacrament united what right hath a single priest to disunite in heart and make the wife false to any part whatever of that most holy vow i hear and not from you that leonard did set you against your husbands friends withdrew you from society and sent him abroad alone in one word he robbed your husband of his companion and his friend the sin was leonards but the fault was yours you were five years older than leonard and a woman of sense and experience he but a boy by comparison what right had you to surrender your understanding in a matter of this kind to a poor silly priest fresh from his seminary and as manifestly without a grain of common sense as he was full of piety this remonstrance produced rather a striking effect on both those who heard it mrs gaunt seemed much struck with it she leaned back in her chair and put her hand to her brow with a sort of despairing gesture that griffith could not very well understand it seemed to him so disproportionate it softened him however and he faltered out ay father that is how it all began would to heaven it had stopped there francis resumed this false step led to consequences you never dreamed of for one of your romantic notions is that a priest is an angel i have known you in former times try to take me for an angel then would i throw cold water on your folly by calling lustily for chines of beef and mugs of ale but i suppose leonard thought himself an angel too and the upshot was he fell in love with his neighbours wife and she with him groaned griffith not so said francis but perhaps she was nearer it than she thinks prove that said mrs gaunt and ill fall on my knees to him before you francis smiled and proceeded to be sure from the moment you discovered leonard was in love with you you drew back and conducted yourself with prudence and propriety read these letters sir and tell me what you think of them he handed them to griffith griffiths hand trembled visibly as he took them stay said father francis your better way will be to read the whole correspondence according to their dates begin with this of mrs gaunts griffith read the letter in an audible whisper mrs gaunt turned her head a little and for the first time lowered her eyes to the ground end of vol ii griffith gaunt or jealousy by charles reade in three volumes vol iii london chapman and hall piccadilly table of contents chapter i chapter ii chapter iii chapter iv chapter v chapter vi chapter vii chapter viii chapter ix chapter x chapter xi chapter xii chapter xiii chapter xiv chapter xv chapter i dear father and friendthe words you spoke to me today admit but one meaning you are jealous of my husband then you must behow can i write italmost in love with me so then my poor husband was wiser than i he saw a rival in you and he has one i am deeply deeply shocked i ought to be very angry too but thinking of your solitary condition and all the good you have done to my soul my heart has no place for ought but pity only as i am in my senses and you are not you must now obey me as heretofore i have obeyed you you must seek another sphere of duty without delay these seem harsh words from me to you you will live to see they are kind ones write me one line and no more to say you will be ruled by me in this god and the saints have you in their holy keeping so prays your affectionate and sorrowful daughter and true friend catherine gaunt poor soul said griffith said i not that women are not wicked but weak who would think that after this he could get the better of her good resolvesthe villain now read his reply said father francis ay said griffith so this is his one word of reply is it three pages closely writthe villain oh the villain read the villains letter said francis calmly the letter was very humble and pathetic the reply of a good though erring man who owned that in a moment of weakness he had been betrayed into a feeling inconsistent with his holy profession he begged his correspondent however not to judge him quite so hardly he reminded her of his solitary life his natural melancholy and assured her that all men in his condition had moments when they envied those whose bosoms had partners such a cry of anguish said he was once rung from a maiden queen maugre all her pride the queen of scots hath a son and i am but a barren stock he went on to say that prayer and vigilance united do much do not despair so soon of me flight is not cure let me rather stay and with gods help and the saints overcome this unhappy weakness if i fail it will indeed be time for me to go and never again see the angelic face of my daughter and my benefactress griffith laid down the letter he was somewhat softened by it and said gently i cannot understand it this is not the letter of a thorough bad man neither no said father francis coldly tis the letter of a selfdeceiver and there is no more dangerous man to himself and others than your selfdeceiver but now let us see whether he can throw dust in her eyes as well as his own and he handed him kates reply the first word of it was you deceive yourself the writer then insisted quietly that he owed it to himself to her and to her husband whose happiness he was destroying to leave the place at her request either you must go or i said she and pray let it be you also this place is unworthy of your high gifts and i love you in my way the way i mean to love you when we meet againin heaven and i labour your advancement to a sphere more worthy of you i wish space permitted me to lay the whole correspondence before the reader but i must confine myself to its general purport it proceeded in this way the priest humble eloquent pathetic but gently yet pertinaciously clinging to the place the lady gentle wise and firm detaching with her soft fingers first one hand then another of the poor priests till at last he was driven to the sorry excuse that he had no money to travel with nor place to go to i cant understand it said griffith are these letters all forged or are there two kate gaunts the one that wrote these prudent letters and the one i caught upon this very priests arm perdition mrs gaunt started to her feet methinks tis time for me to leave the room said she scarlet gently my good friends one thing at a time said francis sit thou down impetuous the letters sir what think you of them i see no harm in them said griffith no harm is that all but i say these are very remarkable letters sir and they show us that a woman may be innocent and unsuspicious and so seem foolish yet may be wise for all that in her early communication with leonard at wisdoms gate suspicion slept and thought no ill where no ill seemed but you see suspicion being once aroused wisdom was not to be lulled nor blinded but that is not all these letters breathe a spirit of christian charity of true and rare and exalted piety tender are they without passion wise yet not cold full of conjugal love and of filial pity for an erring father whom she leads for his good with firm yet dutiful hand trust to my great experience doubt the chastity of snow rather than hers who could write these pure and exquisite lines my good friend you heard me rebuke and sneer at this poor lady for being too innocent and unsuspicious of mans frailty now hear me own to you that i could no more have written these angelic letters than a barndoor fowl could soar to the mansions of the saints in heaven this unexpected tribute took mrs gaunts heart by storm she threw her arms round father franciss neck and wept upon his shoulder ah she sobbed you are the only one left that loves me she could not understand justice praising her it must be love ay said griffith in a broken voice she writes like an angel she speaks like an angel she looks like an angel my heart says she is an angel but my eyes have shown me she is naught i left her unable to walk by her way of it i came back and found her on that priests arm springing along like a greyhound he buried his head in his hands and groaned aloud francis turned to mrs gaunt and said a little severely how do you account for that ill tell you father said kate because you love me i do not speak to you sir for you never loved me i could give thee the lie said griffith in a trembling voice but tis not worth while know sir that within twentyfour hours after i caught her with that villain i lay a dying for her sake and lost my wits and when i came to they were a making my shroud in the very room where i lay no matter no matter i never loved her alas poor soul sighed kate would i had died ere i brought thee to that and with this they both began to cry at the same moment ay poor fools said father francis softly neither of ye loved tother that is plain so now sit you there and let us have your explanation for you must own appearances are strong against you mrs gaunt drew her stool to franciss knee and addressing herself to him alone explained as follows i saw father leonard was giving way and only wanted one good push after a manner well you know i had got him by my friends a good place in ireland and i had money by me for his journey so when my husband talked of going to the fair i thought oh if i could but get this settled to his mind before he comes back so i wrote a line to leonard you can read it if you like tis dated the th of september i suppose i will said francis and read this out dear father and friendyou have fought the good fight and conquered now therefore i will see you once more and thank you for my husband he is so unhappy and put the money for your journey into your hand myself your journey to ireland you are the duke of leinsters chaplain for i have accepted that place for you let me see you tomorrow in the grove for a few minutes at high noon god bless you catherine gaunt well father said mrs gaunt tis true that i could only walk two or three times across the room but alack you know what women are excitement gives us strength with thinking that our unhappiness was at an end that when he should come back from the fair i should fling my arm round his neck and tell him i had removed the cause of his misery and so of mine i seemed to have wings and i did walk with leonard and talked with rapture of the good he was to do in ireland and how he was to be a mitred abbot one day for he is a great man and poor little me be proud of him and how we were all to be happy together in heaven where is no marrying nor giving in marriage this was our discourse and i was just putting the purse into his hands and bidding him godspeed when hefor whom i fought against my womans nature and took this trying task upon mebroke in upon us with a face of a fiend trampled on the poor good priest that deserved veneration and consolation from him of all men and raised his hand to me and was not man enough to kill me after all but called meask him what he called mesee if he dares to say it again before you and then ran away like a coward as he is from the lady he had defiled with his rude tongue and the heart he had broken forgive him that i never will never never who asked you to forgive him said the shrewd priest your own heart come look at him not i said she irresolutely then still more feebly he is nought to me and so stole a look at him griffith pale as ashes had his hand on his brow and his eyes were fixed with horror and remorse something tells me she has spoken the truth he said in a quavering voice then with concentrated horror but if sooh god what have i donewhat shall i do mrs gaunt extended her arms towards him across the priest why fall at thy wifes knees and ask her to forgive thee griffith obeyed he fell on his knees and mrs gaunt leaned her head on franciss shoulder and gave her hand across him to her remorsestricken husband neither spoke nor desired to speak and even father francis sat silent and enjoyed that sweet glow which sometimes blesses the peacemaker even in this world of wrangles and jars but the good soul had ridden hard and the neglected meats emitted savory odors and byandby he said drily i wonder whether that fat pullet tastes as well as it smells can you tell me squire oh inhospitable wretch that i am said mrs gaunt i thought but of my own heart and forgot the stomach of your unspiritual father but madam you are pale you tremble tis nothing sir i shall soon be better sit you down and sup i will return anon she retired not to make a fuss but her heart palpitated violently and she had to sit down on the stairs ryder who was prowling about found her there and fetched her hartshorn mrs gaunt got better but felt so languid and also hysterical that she retired to her own room for the night attended by the faithful ryder to whom she confided that a reconciliation had taken place and to celebrate it gave her a dress she had only worn a year this does not sound queenly to you ladies but know that a weeks wear tells far more on the flimsy trash you wear nowadays than a year did on the glorious silks of lyons mrs gaunt put on thick as broadcloth and embroidered so cunningly by the loom that it would pass for rarest needlework besides in those days silk was silk as ryder left her she asked where is the master to lie tonight mrs gaunt was not pleased at this question being put to her being a singular mixture of frankness and finesse she had retired to her own room partly to test griffiths heart if he was as sincere as she was he would not be content with a public reconciliation but the question being put to her plump and by one of her own sex she colored faintly and said why is there not a bed in his room oh yes madam then see it be well aired put down all the things before the fire and then tell me ill come and see the feather bed mind as well as the sheets and blankets ryder executed all this with zeal she did more though griffith and francis sat up very late she sat up too and on the gentlemen leaving the supperroom she met them both with bedcandles in a delightful cap and undertook with cordial smiles to show them both their chambers tread softly on the landing an if it please you gentlemen my mistress hath been unwell but she is in a fine sleep now by the blessing and i would not have her disturbed father francis went to bed thoughtful there was something about griffith he did not like the man every now and then broke out into boisterous raptures and presently relapsed into moody thoughtfulness francis almost feared that his cure was only temporary in the morning before he left he drew mrs gaunt aside and told her his misgivings she replied that she thought she knew what was amiss and would soon set that right griffith tossed and turned in his bed and spent a stormy night his mind was in a confused whirl and his heart distracted the wife he had loved so tenderly proved to be the very reverse of all he had lately thought her she was pure as snow and had always loved him loved him now and only wanted a good excuse to take him to her arms again but mercy vinthis wife his benefactress a woman as chaste as kate as strict in life and moralswhat was to become of her how could he tell her she was not his wife how to reveal to her her own calamity and his treason and on the other hand desert her without a word and leave her hoping fearing pining all her life affection humanity gratitude alike forbade it he came down in the morning pale for him and worn with the inward struggle naturally there was a restraint between him and mrs gaunt and only short sentences passed between them he saw the peacemaker off and then wandered all over the premises and the past came nearer and the present seemed to retire into the background he wandered about like one in a dream and was so selfabsorbed that he did not see mrs gaunt coming towards him with observant eyes she met him full he started like a guilty thing are you afraid of me said she sweetly no my dear not exactly and yet i am afraid or ashamed or both you need not i said i forgive you and you know i am not one that does things by halves you are an angel said he warmly but suddenly relapsing into despondency we shall never be happy together again she sighed say not so time and sweet recollections may heal even this wound by degrees god grant it said he despairingly and though we cant be lovers again all at once we may be friends to begin tell me what have you on your mind come make a friend of me he looked at her in alarm she smiled shall i guess said she you will never guess said he and i shall never have the heart to tell you let me try well i think you have run in debt and are afraid to ask me for the money griffith was greatly relieved by this conjecture he drew a long breath and after a pause said cunningly what made you think that because you came here for money and not for happiness you told me so in the grove that is true what a sordid wretch you must think me no because you were under a delusion but i do believe you are just the man to turn reckless when you thought me false and go drinking and dicing she added eagerly i do not suspect you of anything worse he assured her that was not the way of it then tell me the way of it you must not think because i pester you not with questions i have no curiosity oh how often have i longed to be a bird and watch you day and night unseen how would you have liked that i wish you had been one to watch me ah you dont answer could you have borne so close an inspection sir griffith shuddered at the idea and his eyes fell before the full grey orbs of his wife well never mind said she tell me your story well then when i left you i was raving mad that is true ill be sworn i let my horse go and he took me near a hundred miles from here and stopped atata farmhouse the good people took me in god bless them for it ill ride and thank them nay nay tis too far there i fell sick of a fever a brainfever the doctor blooded me alas would he had taken mine instead and i lost my wits for several days and when i came back i was weak as water and given up by the doctor and the first thing i saw was an old hag set a making of my shroud here the narrative was interrupted a moment by mrs gaunt seizing him convulsively and then holding him tenderly as if he was even now about to be taken from her the good people nursed me and so did their daughter and i came back from the grave i took an inn but i gave up that and had to pay forfeit and so my money all went but they kept me on to be sure i helped on the farm they kept a hostelry as well byandby came that murrain among the cattle did you have it in these parts too i know not nor care prithee leave cattle and talk of thyself well in a word they were ruined and going to be sold up i could not bear that i became bondsman for the old man it was the least i could do kate they had saved thy husbands life not a word more griffith how much stand you pledged for a large sum would five hundred pounds be of any avail five hundred pounds ay that it would and to spare but where can i get so much money and the time so short give me thy hand and come with me said mrs gaunt ardently she took his hand and made a swift rush across the lawn it was not exactly running nor walking but some grand motion she had when excited she put him to his stride to keep up with her at all and in two minutes she had him into her boudoir she unlocked a bureau all in a hurry and took out a bag of gold there she cried thrusting it into his hand and blooming all over with joy and eagerness i thought you would want money so i saved it up you shall not be in debt a day longer now mount thy horse and carry it to those good souls only for my sake take the gardener with theei have no groom now but heand both well armed what go this very day ay this very hour i can bear thy absence for a day or two more i have borne it so long but i cannot bear thy plighted word to stand in doubt a day no not an hour i am your wife sir your true and loving wife your honor is mine and is as dear to me now as it was when you saw me with father leonard in the grove and read me all awry dont wait a moment begone at once nay nay if i go tomorrow i shall be in time ay but said mrs gaunt very softly i am afraid if i keep you another hour i shall not have the heart to let you go at all and the sooner gone the sooner back for good please god there give me one kiss to live on and begone this instant he covered her hands with kisses and tears im not worthy to kiss any higher than thy hand he said and so ran sobbing from her chapter ii he went straight to the stable and saddled black dick but in the very act his nature revolted what turn his back on her the moment he had got hold of her money to take to the other he could not do it he went back to her room and came so suddenly that he caught her crying he asked her what was the matter nothing said she with a sigh only a womans foolish misgivings i was afraid perhaps you would not come back forgive me no fear of that said he however i have taken a resolve not to go today if i go tomorrow i shall be just in time and dick wants a good days rest mrs gaunt said nothing but her expressive face was triumphant griffith and she took a walk together and he who used to be the more genial of the two was dull and she full of animation this whole day she laid herself out to bewitch her husband and put him in high spirits it was uphill work but when such a woman sets herself in earnest to delight a man she reads our sex a lesson in the art that shows us we are all babies at it however it was at supper she finally conquered here the lights her beauty set off with art her deepening eyes her satin skin her happy excitement her wit and tenderness and joyous sprightliness enveloped griffith in an atmosphere of delight and drove everything out of his head but herself and with this if the truth must be told the sparkling wines cooperated griffith plied the bottle a little too freely but mrs gaunt on this one occasion had not the heart to check him the more he toasted her the more uxorious he became and she could not deny herself even this joy but besides she had less of the prudent wife in her just then than of the weak indulgent mother anything rather than check his love she was greedy of it at last however she said to him sweetheart i shall go to bed for i see if i stay longer i shall lead thee into a debauch be good now drink no more when i am gone else ill say thou lovest thy bottle more than thy wife he promised faithfully but when she was gone modified his pledge by drinking just one bumper to her health which bumper let in another and when at last he retired to rest he was in that state of mental confusion wherein the limbs appear to have a memory independent of the mind in this condition do some mens hands wind up their watches the mind taking no appreciable part in the ceremony by some such act of what physicians call organic memory griffiths feet carried him to the chamber he had slept in a thousand times and not into the one mrs ryder had taken him to the night before the next morning he came down rather late for him and found himself treated with a great access of respect by the servants his position was no longer doubtful he was the master of the house mrs gaunt followed in due course and sat at breakfast with him looking young and blooming as hebe and her eye never off him long she had lived temperately and had not yet passed the age when happiness can restore a womans beauty and brightness in a single day as for him he was like a man in a heavenly dream he floated in the past and the present the recent and the future seemed obscure and distant and comparatively in a mist but that same afternoon after a most affectionate farewell and many promises to return as soon as ever he had discharged his obligations griffith gaunt started for the packhorse to carry to mercy leicester alias vint the money catherine gaunt had saved by selfdenial and economy and he went south a worse man than he came when he left mercy leicester he was a bigamist in law but not at heart kate was dead to him he had given her up for ever and was constant and true to his new wife but now he was false to mercy yet not true to kate and curiously enough it was a day or two passed with his lawful wife that had demoralized him his unlawful wife had hitherto done nothing but improve his character but a great fault once committed is often the first link in a chain of acts that look like crimes but are strictly speaking consequences this man blinded at first by his own foible and after that the sport of circumstances was singlehearted by nature and his conscience was not hardened he desired earnestly to free himself and both his wives from the cruel situation but to do this one of them he saw must be abandoned entirely and his heart bled for her a villain or a fool would have relished the situation many men would have dallied with it but to do this erring man justice he writhed and sorrowed under it and sincerely desired to end it and this was why he prized kates money so it enabled him to render a great service to her he had injured worse than he had the other to her he saw he must abandon but this was feeble comfort after all he rode along a miserable man none the less wretched and remorseful that ere he got into lancashire he saw his way clear this was his resolve to pay old vints debts with kates money take the packhorse get it made over to mercy give her the odd two hundred pounds and his jewels and fly he would never see her again but would return home and get the rest of the two thousand pounds from kate and send it mercy by a friend who should tell her he was dead and had left word with his relations to send her all his substance at last the packhorse came in sight he drew rein and had half a mind to turn back but instead of that he crawled on and very sick and cold he felt many a man has marched to the scaffold with a less quaking heart than he to the packhorse his dejection contrasted strangely with the warm reception he met from everybody there and the house was full of women and they seemed somehow all cockahoop and filled with admiration of him where is she said he faintly hark to the poor soul said a gossip dame vint wheres thy daughter gone out awalking belike at this the other women present chuckled and clucked ill bring you to her said mrs vint but prithee be quiet and reasonable for to be sure she is none too strong there was some little preparation and then griffith was ushered into mercys room and found her in bed looking a little pale but sweeter and comelier than ever she had the bedclothes up to her chin you look wan my poor lass said he what ails ye nought ails me now thou art come said she lovingly griffith put the bag on the table there said he theres five hundred pounds in gold i come not to thee emptyhanded nor i to thee said mercy with a heavenly smile see and she drew down the bedclothes a little and showed the face of a babe scarcely three days old a little boy she turned in the bed and tried to hold him up to his father and said heres my treasure for thee and the effort the flush on her cheek and the deep light in her dovelike eyes told plainly that the poor soul thought she had contributed to their domestic wealth something far richer than griffith had with his bag of gold the father littered an ejaculation and came to her side and for a moment nature overpowered everything else he kissed the child he kissed mercy again and again now god he praised for both said he passionately but most for thee the best wife the truest friend he thinking of her virtues and the blow he had come to strike her he broke down and was almost choked with emotion whereupon mrs vint exerted female authority and bundled him out of the room is that the way to carry on at such a time said she twas enow to upset her altogether oh but you men have little sense in womens matters i looked to you to give her courage not to set her off into hysterics after a manner nay keep up her heart or keep your distance say i that am her mother griffith took this hint and ever after took pity on mercys weak condition and suspending the fatal blow did all he could to restore her to health and spirits of course to do that he must deceive her and so his life became a lie for hitherto she had never looked forward much but now her eyes were always diving into futurity and she lay smiling and discussing the prospects of her boy and griffith had to sit by her side and see her gnaw the boys hand and kiss his feet and anticipate his brilliant career he had to look and listen with an aching heart and assent with feigned warmth and an inward chill of horror and remorse one drummond a travelling artist called and mercy who had often refused to sit to him consented now for she said when he grows up he shall know how his parents looked in their youth the very year their darling was born so griffith had to sit with her and excellent likenesses the man produced but a horrible one of the child and griffith thoughtpoor soul a little while and this picture will be all that shall be left to thee of me for all this time he was actually transacting the preliminaries of separation he got a man of law to make all sure the farm the stock the furniture and goodwill of the packhorse all these he got assigned to mercy leicester for her own use in consideration of three hundred and fifty pounds whereof three hundred were devoted to clearing the concern of its debts the odd fifty was to sweeten the pill to harry vint when the deed came to be executed mercy was surprised and uttered a gentle remonstrance what have i to do with it said she tis thy money not mine no matter said griffith i choose to have it so your will is my law said mercy besides said griffith the old folk will not feel so sore nor be afraid of being turned out if it is in thy name and that is true said mercy now who had thought of that but my good man and she threw her arms lovingly round his neck and gazed on him adoringly but his lionlike eyes avoided her dovelike eyes and an involuntary shudder ran through him the habit of deceiving mercy led to a consequence he had not anticipated it tightened the chain that held him she opened his eyes more and more to her deep affection and he began to fear she would die if he abandoned her and then her present situation was so touching she had borne him a lovely boy that must be abandoned too if he left her and somehow the birth of this child had embellished the mother a delicious pink had taken the place of her rustic bloom and her beauty was more refined and delicate so pure so loving so fair so maternal to wound her heart now it seemed like stabbing an angel one day succeeded to another and still griffith had not the heart to carry out his resolve he temporized he wrote to kate that he was detained by the business and he stayed on and on strengthening his gratitude and his affection and weakening his love for the absent and his resolution till at last he became so distracted and divided in heart and so demoralized that he began to give up the idea of abandoning mercy and babbled to himself about fate and destiny and decided that the most merciful course would be to deceive both women mercy was patient mercy was unsuspicious she would content herself with occasional visits if he could only feign some plausible tale to account for long absences before he got into this mess he was a singularly truthful person but now a he was nothing to him but for that matter many a man has been first made a liar by his connexion with two women and by degrees has carried his mendacity into other things however though now blessed with mendacity he was cursed with a lack of invention and sorely puzzled how to live at hernshaw yet visit the packhorse the best thing he could hit upon was to pretend to turn bagman and so mercy would believe he was travelling all over england when all the time he was quietly living at hernshaw and perhaps these long separations might prepare her heart for a final parting and so let in his original plan a few years hence he prepared this manuvre with some art he told her one day he had been to lancaster and there fallen in with a friend who had as good as promised him the place of a commercial traveller for a mercantile house a traveller said mercy heaven forbid if you knew how i wearied for you when you went to cumberland to cumberland how know you i went thither oh i but guessed that but now i know it by your face but go where thou wilt the house is dull directly thou art our sunshine isnt he my poppet well well if it kept me too long from thee i could give it up but child we must think of young master you could manage the inn and your mother the farm without me and i should be earning money on my side i want to make a gentleman of him anything for him said mercy anything in the world but the tears stood in her eyes in furtherance of this deceit griffith did one day actually ride to lancaster and slept there he wrote to kate from that town to say he was detained by a slight illness but hoped to be home in a week and the next day brought mercy home some ribbons and told her he had seen the merchant and his brother and they had made him a very fair offer but ive a week to think of it said he so theres no hurry mercy fixed her eyes on him in a very peculiar way and made no reply you must know that something very curious had happened whilst griffith was gone to lancaster a travelling pedlar passing by was struck with the name on the signboard halloo said he why heres a namesake of mine ill have a glass of his ale any way so he came into the public room and called for a glass taking care to open his pack and display his inviting wares harry vint served him heres your health said the pedlar you must drink with me you must and welcome said the old man well said the pedlar i do travel five counties but for all that you are the first namesake i have found i am thomas leicester too as sure as you are a living sinner the old man laughed and said then no namesake of mine are you for they call me harry vint thomas leicester he that keeps this inn now is my soninlaw he is gone to lancaster this morning the pedlar said that was a pity he should have liked to see his namesake and drink a glass with him come again tomorrow said harry vint ironically dame he cried come hither heres another thomas leicester for ye wants to see our one mrs vint turned her head and inspected the pedlar from afar as if he was some natural curiosity where do you come from young man said she well i came from kendal last but i am cumberland born why that is where tother comes from suggested paul carrick who was once more a frequenter of the house like enow said mrs vint with that she dropped the matter as one of no consequence and retired but she went straight to mercy in the parlor and told her there was a man in the kitchen that called himself thomas leicester well mother said mercy with high indifference for she was trying new socks on king baby he comes from cumberland well to be sure names do run in counties that is true but seems to me he favors your man much of a height andthere do just step into the kitchen a moment la mother said mercy i dont desire to see any more thomas leicesters than my own tis the man not the name isnt it my lamb mrs vint went back to the kitchen discomfited but with quiet pertinacity she brought thomas leicester into the parlor pack and all there mercy said she lay out a penny with thy husbands namesake mercy did not reply for at that moment thomas leicester caught sight of griffiths portrait and gave a sudden start and a most extraordinary look besides both the womens eyes happened to be upon him and they saw at once that he knew the original you know my husband said mercy vint after a while not i said leicester looking askant at the picture dont tell no lies said mrs vint you do know him well and she pointed her assertion by looking at the portrait oh i know him whose picture hangs there of course said leicester well and that is her husband oh that is her husband is it and he was unaffectedly puzzled mercy turned pale yes he is my husband said she and this is our child can you tell me anything about him for he came a stranger to these parts belike you are a kinsman of his so they say this reply puzzled both women any way said the pedlar you see we are marked alike and he showed a long black mole on his forehead mercy was now as curious as she had been indifferent tell me all about him said she how comes it that he is a gentleman and thou a pedlar well because my mother was a gipsy and his a gentlewoman what brought him to these parts trouble they say what trouble nay i know not this after a slight but visible hesitation but you have heard say well i am always on the foot and dont bide long enough in one place to learn all the gossip but i do remember hearing he was gone to sea and that was a lie for he had settled here and married you ifackins he might have done worse he has got a bonny buxom wife and a rare fine boy to be sure and now the pedlar was on his guard and determined he would not be the one to break up the household he saw before him and afflict the doveeyed wife and mother he was a goodnatured fellow and averse to make mischief with his own hands besides he took for granted griffith loved his new wife better than the old one and above all the punishment of bigamy was severe and was it for him to get the squire indicted and branded in the hand for a felon so the women could get nothing more out of him he lied evaded shuffled and feigned utter ignorance pleading adroitly enough his vagrant life all this however aroused vague suspicions in mrs vints mind and she went and whispered them to her favorite paul carrick and paul said she call for what you like and score it to me only treat this pedlar till he leaks out summut to be sure hell tell a man more than he will us paul entered with zeal into this commission treated the pedlar to a chop and plied him well with the best ale all this failed to loose the pedlars tongue at the time but it muddled his judgment on resuming his journey he gave his entertainer a wink carrick rose and followed him out you seem a decent lad said the pedlar and a goodhearted one will do me a favor carrick said he would if it lay in his power oh it is easy enow said the pedlar tis just to give you thomas leicester into his own hand this here trifle as soon as ever he comes home and he handed carrick a hard substance wrapped in paper carrick promised ay ay lad said the pedlar but see you play fair and give it him unbeknown now dont you be so simple as show it to any of the womenfolk dye understand all right said carrick knowingly and so the boon companions for a day shook hands and parted and carrick took the little parcel straight to mrs vint and told her every word the pedlar had said and mrs vint took the little parcel straight to mercy and told her what carrick said the pedlar had said and the pedlar went off flushed with beer and selfcomplacency for he thought he had drawn the line precisely had faithfully discharged his promise to his lady and benefactress but not so as to make mischief in another household such was the power of alein the last century mercy undid the paper and found the bullet on which was engraved i love kate as she read these words a knife seemed to enter her heart the pang was so keen but she soon took herself to task thou naughty woman said she what jealous of the dead she wrapped the bullet up put it carefully away had a good cry and was herself again but all this set her watching griffith and reading his face she had subtle vague misgivings and forbade her mother to mention the pedlars visit to griffith yet awhile womanlike she preferred to worm out the truth on the evening of his return from lancaster as he was smoking his pipe she quietly tested him she fixed her eyes on him and said one was here today that knows thee and brought thee this she then handed him the bullet and watched his face griffith undid the paper carelessly enough but at sight of the bullet uttered a loud cry and his eyes seemed ready to start out of his head he turned as pale as ashes and stammered piteously what what what dye mean in heavens name what is this how who mercy was surprised but also much concerned at his distress and tried to soothe him she also asked him piteously whether she had done wrong to give it him god knows said she tis no business of mine to go and remind thee of her thou hast loved better mayhap than thou lovest me but to keep it from thee and she in her grave oh i had not the heart but griffiths agitation increased instead of diminishing and even while she was trying to soothe him he rushed wildly out of the room and into the open air mercy went in perplexity and distress and told her mother mrs vint not being blinded by affection thought the whole thing had a very ugly look and said as much she gave it as her opinion that this kate was alive and had sent the token herself to make mischief between man and wife that shall she never said mercy stoutly but now her suspicions were thoroughly excited and her happiness disturbed the next day griffith found her in tears he asked her what was the matter she would not tell him you have your secrets said she and so now i have mine griffith became very uneasy for now mercy was often in tears and mrs vint looked daggers at him all this was mysterious and unintelligible and to a guilty man very alarming at last he implored mercy to speak out he wanted to know the worst then mercy did speak out you have deceived me said she kate is alive this very morning between sleeping and waking you whispered her name ay false man whispered it like a lover you told me she was dead but she is alive and has sent you a reminder and the bare sight of it hath turned your heart her way again what shall i do why did you marry me if you could not forget her i did not want you to desert any woman for me the desire of my heart was always for your happiness but oh thomas deceit and falsehood will not bring you happiness no more than they will me what shall i do what shall i do her tears flowed freely and griffith sat down and groaned with horror and remorse beside her he had not the courage to tell her the horrible truth that kate was his wife and she was not do not thou afflict thyself he muttered of course with you putting that bullet in my hand so sudden it set my fancy a wandering back to other days ah said mercy if it be no worse than that theres little harm but why did thy namesake start so at sight of thy picture my namesake cried griffith all aghast ay he that brought thee that lovetoken thomas leicester nay for very shame feign not ignorance of him why he hath thy very mole on his temple and knew thy picture in a moment he is thy halfbrother is he not i am a ruined man cried griffith and sank into a chair without power of motion god help me what is all this cried mercy oh thomas thomas i could forgive thee ought but deceit for both our sakes speak out and tell me the worst no harm shall come near thee while i live how can i tell thee i am an unfortunate man the world will call me a villain yet i am not a villain at heart but who will believe me i have broken the law thee i could trust but not thy folk they never loved me mercy for pitys sake when was that thomas leicester here four days ago which way went he i hear he told paul he was going to cumberland if he gets there before me i shall rot in gaol now heaven forbid oh thomas then mount and ride after him i will and this very moment he saddled black dick and loaded his pistols for the journey but ere he went a pale face looked out into the yard and a finger beckoned it was mercy she bade him follow her she took him to her room where their child was sleeping and then she closed and even locked the door no soul can hear us said she now look me in the face and tell me gods truth who and what are you griffith shuddered at this exordium he made no reply mercy went to a box and took out an old shirt of his the one he wore when he first came to the packhorse she brought it to him and showed him g g embroidered on it with a womans hair ryders here are your initials said she now leave useless falsehoods be a man and tell me your real name my name is griffith gaunt mercy sick at heart turned her head away but she had the resolution to urge him on go on said she in an agonized whisper if you believe in god and a judgment to come deceive me no more the truth i say the truth so be it said griffith desperately when i have told thee what a villain i am i can die at thy feet and then thou wilt forgive me who is kate was all she replied kate ismy wife i thought her false who could think any other appearances were so strong against her others thought so beside me i raised my hand to kill her but she never winced i trampled on him i believed her paramour i fled and soon i lay a dying in this house for her sake i told thee she was dead alas i thought her dead to me i went back to our house it is her house sore against the grain to get money for thee and thine then she cleared herself bright as the sun and pure as snow she was all in black for me she had put by money against i should come to my senses and need it i told her i owed a debt in lancashire a debt of gratitude as well as money and so i did how have i repaid it the poor soul forced five hundred pounds on me i had much ado to keep her from bringing it hither with her own hands oh villain villain then i thought to leave thee and send thee word i was dead and heap money on thee money but how could i thou wast my benefactress my more than wife all the riches of the world can make no return to thee what what shall i do shall i fly with thee and thy child across the seas shall i go back to her no the best thing i can do is to take this good pistol and let the life out of my dishonorable carcass and free two honest women from me by one resolute act in his despair he cocked the pistol and at a word from mercy this tale had ended but the poor woman pale and trembling tottered across the room and took it out of his hand i would not harm thy body nor thy soul she gasped let me draw my breath and think she rocked herself to and fro in silence griffith stood trembling like a criminal before his judge it was long ere she could speak for anguish yet when she did speak it was with a sort of deadly calm go tell the truth to her as you have done to me and if she can forgive you all the better for you i can never forgive you nor yet can harm you my child my child thy father is our ruin oh begone man or the sight of you will kill us both at that he fell at her knees kissed and wept over her cold hand and in his pity and despair offered to cross the seas with her and her child and so repair the wrong he had done her tempt me not she sobbed go leave me none here shall ever know thy crime but she whose heart thou hast broken and ruined her good name he took her in his arms in spite of her resistance and kissed her passionately but for the first time she shuddered at his embrace and that gave him the power to leave her he rushed from her all but distracted and rode away to cumberland but not to tell the truth to kate if he could possibly help it chapter iii at this particular time no mans presence was more desired in that county than griffith gaunts and this i need not now he telling the reader if i had related this story on the plan of a miscellaneous chronicle but the affairs of the heart are so absorbing that even in a narrative they thrust aside important circumstances of a less moving kind i must therefore go back a step before i advance further you must know that forty years before our griffith gaunt saw the light another griffith gaunt was born in cumberland a younger son and the family estate entailed but a shrewd lad who chose rather to hunt fortune elsewhere than to live in miserable dependence on his elder brother his godfather a city merchant encouraged him and he left cumberland he went into commerce and in twenty years became a wealthy man so wealthy that he lived to look down on his brothers estate which he had once thought opulence his life was all prosperity with a single exception but that a bitter one he laid out some of his funds in a fashionable and beautiful wife he loved her before marriage and as she was always cold to him he loved her more and more in the second year of their marriage she ran away from him and no beggar in the streets of london was so miserable as the wealthy merchant it blighted the man and left him a sore heart all his days he never married again and railed on all womankind for this one he led a solitary life in london till he was sixtynine and then all of a sudden nature or accident or both changed his whole habits word came to him that the family estate already deeply mortgaged was for sale and a farmer who had rented a principal farm on it and held a heavy mortgage had made the highest offer old griffith sent down mr atkins his solicitor post haste and snapped the estate out of that purchasers hands when the lands and house had been duly conveyed to him he came down and his heart seemed to bud again in the scenes of his childhood finding the house small and built in a valley instead of on rising ground he got an army of bricklayers and began to build a mansion with a rapidity unheard of in those parts and he looked about for some one to inherit it the name of gaunt had dwindled down to three since he left cumberland but a rich man never lacks relations featherstonhaughs and underhills and even smiths poured in with parish registers in their laps and proved themselves gauntesses and flattered and carneyed the new head of the family then the perverse old gentleman felt inclined to look elsewhere he knew he had a namesake at the other side of the county but this namesake did not come near him this independent gaunt excited his curiosity and interest he made inquiries and heard that young griffith had just quarrelled with his wife and gone away in despair griffith senior took for granted that the fault lay with mrs gaunt and wasted some good sympathy on griffith junior on further inquiry he learnt that the truant was dependent on his wife then argued the moneyed man he would not run away from her but that his wound was deep the consequence of all this was that he made a will very favorable to his absent and injured namesake he left numerous bequests but made griffith his residuary legatee and having settled this matter urged on and superintended his workmen alas just as the roof was going on a narrower house claimed him and he made good the saying of the wise bard tu secanda marmora locas sub ipsum funus et sepulchri immemor struis domos the heir of his own choosing could not be found to attend his funeral and mr atkins his solicitor a very worthy man was really hurt at this with the quiet bitterness of a displeased attorney he merely sent mrs gaunt word her husband inherited something under the will and she would do well to produce him or else furnish him atkins with proof of his decease mrs gaunt was offended by this cavalier note and replied very like a woman and very unlike business i do not know where he is said she nor whether he is alive or dead nor do i feel disposed to raise the hue and cry after him but favor me with your address and i shall let you know should i hear anything about him mr atkins was half annoyed half amused at this piece of indifference it never occurred to him that it might be all put on he wrote back to say that the estate was large and owing to the terms of the will could not be administered without mr griffith gaunt and in the interest of the said griffith gaunt and also of the other legatees he really must advertise for him la gaunt replied that he was very welcome to advertise for whomsoever he pleased mr atkins was a very worthy man but human to tell the truth he was himself one of the other legatees he inherited and to be just had well deserved four thousand guineas under the will and could not legally touch it without griffith gaunt this little circumstance spurred his professional zeal mr atkins advertised for griffith gaunt in the london and cumberland papers and in the usual enticing form he was to apply to mr atkins solicitor of grays inn and he would hear of something greatly to his advantage these advertisements had not been out a fortnight when griffith came home as i have related but mr atkins had punished mrs gaunt for her insouciance by not informing her of the extent of her good fortune so she merely told griffith casually that old griffith gaunt had left him some money and the solicitor mr atkins could not get on without him even this information she did not vouchsafe until she had given him her l for she grudged atkins the pleasure of supplying her husband with money however as soon as griffith left her she wrote to mr atkins to say that her husband had come home in perfect health thank god had only stayed two days but was to return in a week when ten days had elapsed atkins wrote to inquire she replied he had not yet returned and this went on till mr atkins showed considerable impatience as for mrs gaunt she made light of the matter to mr atkins but in truth this new mystery irritated her and pained her deeply in one respect she was more unhappy than she had been before he came back at all then she was alone her door was closed to commentators but now on the strength of so happy a reconciliation she had reentered the world and received visits from sir george neville and others and above all had announced that griffith would be back for good in a few days so now his continued absence exposed her to sly questions from her own sex to the interchange of glances between female visitors as well as to the internal torture of doubt and suspense but what distracted her most was the view mrs ryder took of the matter that experienced lady had begun to suspect some other woman was at the bottom of griffiths conduct and her own love for griffith was now soured repeated disappointments and affronts spretque injuria form had not quite extinguished it but had mixed so much spite with it that she was equally ready to kiss or to stab him so she took every opportunity to instill into her mistress whose confidence she had won at last that griffith was false to her that is the way with these men that are so ready to suspect others take my word for it dame he has carried your money to his leman tis still the honest woman that must bleed for some nasty trollop or other she enforced this theory by examples drawn from her own observations in families and gave the very names and drove mrs gaunt almost mad with fear anger jealousy and cruel suspense she could not sleep she could not eat she was in a constant fever yet before the world she battled it out bravely and indeed none but ryder knew the anguish of her spirit and her passionate wrath at last there came a most eventful day mrs gaunt had summoned all her pride and fortitude and invited certain ladies and gentlemen to dine and sup she was one of the true spartan breed and played the hostess as well as if her heart had been at ease it was an age in which the host struggled fiercely to entertain the guests and mrs gaunt was taxing all her powers of pleasing in the diningroom when an unexpected guest strolled into the kitchen the pedlar thomas leicester jane welcomed him cordially and he was soon seated at a table eating his share of the feast presently mrs ryder came down dressed in her best and looking handsomer than ever at sight of her tom leicesters affection revived and he soon took occasion to whisper an inquiry whether she was still single ay said she and like to be waiting for the master still mayhap i could cure you of that complaint but least said is soonest mended this mysterious hint showed ryder he had a secret burning his bosom the sly hussy said nothing just then but plied him with ale and flattery and when he whispered a request for a private meeting out of doors she cast her eyes down and assented and in that meeting she carried herself so adroitly that he renewed his offer of marriage and told her not to waste her fancy on a man who cared neither for her nor any other she in cumberland prove that to me said ryder cunningly and may be ill take you at your word the bribe was not to be resisted tom revealed to her under a solemn promise of secrecy that the squire had got a wife and child in lancashire and had a farm and an inn which latter he kept under the name of thomas leicester in short he told her in his way all the particulars i have told in mine she led him on with a voice of very velvet he did not see how her cheek paled and her eyes flashed jealous fury when she had sucked him dry she suddenly turned on him with a cold voice and said i cant stay any longer with you just now she will want me you will meet me here again lass said tom ruefully yes for a minute after supper she then left him and went to mrs gaunts room and sat crouching before the fire all hate and bitterness what he had left the wife he loved and yet had not turned to her she sat there waiting for mrs gaunt and nursing her vindictive fury two mortal hours at last just before supper mrs gaunt came up to her room to cool her fevered hands and brow and found this creature crouched by her fire all in a heap with pale cheek and black eyes that glittered like basilisks what is the matter child said mrs gaunt good heavens what hath happened dame said ryder sternly i have got news of him news of him faltered mrs gaunt bad news i dont know whether to tell you or not said ryder sulkily but with a touch of human feeling what cannot i bear what have i not borne tell me the truth the words were stout but she trembled all over in uttering them well it is as i said only worse dame he has got a wife and child in another county and no doubt been deceiving her as he has us a wife gasped mrs gaunt and one white hand clutched her bosom and the other the mantelpiece ay thomas leicester that is in the kitchen now saw her and saw his picture hanging aside hers on the wall and he goes by the name of thomas leicester that was what made tom go into the inn seeing his own name on the signboard nay dame never give way like that lean on me so he is a villain a false jealous doublefaced villain mrs gaunts head fell on ryders shoulder and she said no word but only moaned and moaned and her white teeth clicked convulsively together ryder wept over her sad state the tears were half impulse half crocodile she applied hartshorn to the sufferers nostrils and tried to rouse her mind by exciting her anger but all was in vain there hung the betrayed wife pale crushed and quivering under the cruel blow ryder asked her if she should go down and excuse her to her guests she nodded a feeble assent ryder then laid her down on the bed with her head low and was just about to leave her on that errand when hurried steps were heard outside the door and one of the female servants knocked and not waiting to be invited put her head in and cried oh dame the master is come home he is in the kitchen chapter iv mrs ryder made an agitated motion with her hand and gave the girl such a look withal that she retired precipitately but mrs gaunt had caught the words and they literally transformed her she sprang off the bed and stood erect and looked a saxon pythoness golden hair streaming down her back and grey eyes gleaming with fury she caught up a little ivoryhandled knife and held it above her head ill drive this into his heart before them all she cried and tell them the reason afterwards ryder looked at her for a moment in utter terror she saw a woman with grander passions than herself a woman that looked quite capable of executing her sanguinary threat ryder made no more ado but slipped out directly to prevent a meeting that might be attended with such terrible consequences she found her master in the kitchen splashed with mud drinking a horn of ale after his ride and looking rather troubled and anxious and by the keen eye of her sex she saw that the female servants were also in considerable anxiety the fact is they had just extemporized a lie tom leicester being near the kitchen window had seen griffith ride into the courtyard at sight of that wellknown figure he drew back and his heart quaked at his own imprudence in confiding griffiths secret to caroline ryder lasses said he hastily do me a kindness for old acquaintance heres the squire for heavens sake dont let him know i am in the house or there will be bloodshed between us he is a hasty man and im another ill tell ye more by and by the next moment griffiths tread was heard approaching the very door and leicester darted into the housekeepers room and hid in a cupboard there griffith opened the kitchen door and stood upon the threshold the women curtseyed to him and were loud in welcome he returned their civilities briefly and then his first word washath thomas leicester been here you know how servants stick together against their master the girls looked him in the face like candid doves and told him leicester had not been that way for six months or more why i have tracked him to within two miles said griffith doubtfully then he is sure to come here said jane adroitly he wouldnt ever think to go by us the moment he enters the house you let me know he is a mischiefmaking loon he then asked for a horn of ale and as he finished it ryder came in and he turned to her and asked her after her mistress she is well just now said ryder but she has been took with a spasm and it would be well sir if you could dress and entertain the company in her place awhile for i must tell you your being so long away hath set their tongues going and almost broken my ladys heart griffith sighed and said he could not help it and now he was here he would do all in his power to please her ill go to her at once said he no sir said ryder firmly come with me i want to speak to you she took him to his bachelors room and stayed a few minutes to talk to him master said she solemnly things are very serious here why did you stay so long away our dame says some woman is at the bottom of it and shell put a knife into you if you come a nigh her this threat did not appall griffith as ryder expected indeed he seemed rather flattered poor kate said he she is just the woman to do it but i am afraid she does not love me enough for that but indeed how should she well sir replied ryder oblige me by keeping clear of her for a little while i have got orders to make your bed here now dress like a good soul and then go down and show respect to the company that is in your house for they know you are here why that is the least i can do said griffith put you out what i am to wear and then run and say ill be with them anon griffith walked into the diningroom and somewhat to his surprise after what ryder had said found mrs gaunt seated at the head of her own table and presiding like a radiant queen over a brilliant assembly he walked in and made a low bow to his guests first then he approached to greet his wife more freely but she drew back decidedly and made him a curtsy the dignity and distance of which struck the whole company sir george neville who was at the bottom of the table proposed with his usual courtesy to resign his place to griffith but mrs gaunt forbade the arrangement no sir george said she this is but an occasional visitor you are my constant friend if this had been said pleasantly well and good but the guests looked in vain into their hostesss face for the smile that ought to have accompanied so strange a speech and disarmed it rarities are the more welcome said a lady coming to the rescue and edged aside to make room for him madam said griffith i am in your debt for that explanation but i hope you will be no rarity here for all that supper proceeded but the mirth languished somehow or other the chill fact that there was a grave quarrel between two at the table and those two man and wife insinuated itself into the spirits of the guests there began to be lulls fatal lulls and in one of these some unlucky voice was heard to murmur such a meeting of man and wife i never saw the hearers felt miserable at this personality that fell upon the ear of silence like a thunderbolt griffith was illadvised enough to notice the remark though clearly not intended for his ears for one thing his jealousy had actually revived at the cool preference kate had shown his old rival neville oh said he bitterly a man is not always his wifes favorite he does not always deserve to he said mrs gaunt sternly when matters had gone that length one idea seemed to occur pretty simultaneously to all the wellbred guests and that idea was sauve qui peut mrs gaunt took leave of them one by one and husband and wife were left alone mrs gaunt by this time was alarmed at the violence of her own passions and wished to avoid griffith for that night at all events so she cast one terribly stern look upon him and was about to retire in grim silence but he indignant at the public affront she had put on him and not aware of the true cause unfortunately detained her he said sulkily what sort of a reception was that you gave me this was too much she turned on him furiously too good for thee thou heartless creature thomas leicester is here and i know thee for a villain you know nothing cried griffith would you believe that mischiefmaking knave what has he told you go back to her cried mrs gaunt furiously me you can deceive and pillage no more so this was your jealousy false and forsworn yourself you dared to suspect and insult me ah and you think i am the woman to endure this ill have your life for it ill have your life griffith endeavored to soften her protested that notwithstanding appearances he had never loved but her ill soon be rid of you and your love said the raging woman the constables shall come for you tomorrow you have seen how i can love you shall know how i can hate she then in her fury poured out a torrent of reproaches and threats that made his blood run cold he could not answer her he had suspected her wrongfully and been false to her himself he had abused her generosity and taken her money for mercy vint after one or two vain efforts to check the torrent he sank into a chair and hid his face in his hands but this did not disarm her at the time her raging voice and raging words were heard by the very servants long after he had ceased to defend himself at last she came out pale with fury and finding ryder near the door shrieked out take that reptile to his den if he is mean enough to lie in this house then lowering her voice and bring thomas leicester to me ryder went to leicester and told him but he objected to come you have betrayed me said he curse my weak heart and my loose tongue i have done the poor squire an ill turn i can never look him in the face again but tis all thy fault doubleface i hate the sight of thee at this ryder shed some crocodile tears and very soon by her blandishments obtained forgiveness and leicester since the mischief was done was persuaded to see the dame who was his recent benefactor you know he bargained however that the squire should be got to bed first for he had a great dread of meeting him hell break every bone in my skin said tom or else i shall do him a mischief in my defense ryder herself saw the wisdom of this she bade him stay quiet and she went to look after griffith she found him in the drawingroom with his head on the table in deep dejection she assumed authority and said he must go to bed he rose humbly and followed her like a submissive dog she took him to his room there was no fire that is where you are to sleep said she spitefully it is better than i deserve said he humbly the absurd rule about not hitting a man when he is down has never obtained a place in the great female soul so ryder lashed him without mercy well sir said she methinks you have gained little by breaking faith with me y had better have set up your inn with me than gone and sinned against the law much better would to heaven i had what dye mean to do now you know the saying between two stools child said griffith faintly methinks i shall trouble neither long i am not so ill a man as i seem but who will believe that i shall not live long and i shall leave an ill name behind me she told me so just now and oh her eye was so cruel i saw my death in it come come said ryder relenting a little you mustnt believe every word an angry woman says there take my advice go to bed and in the morning dont speak to her keep out of her way a day or two and with this piece of friendly advice she left him and waited about till she thought he was in bed and asleep then she brought thomas leicester up to her mistress but griffith was not in bed and he heard leicesters heavy tread cross the landing he waited and waited behind his door for more than half an hour and then he heard the same heavy tread go away again by this time nearly all the inmates of the house were asleep about twentyfive minutes after leicester left mrs gaunt caroline ryder stole quietly upstairs from the kitchen and sat down to think it all over she then proceeded to undress but had only taken off her gown when she started and listened for a cry of distress reached her from outside the house she darted to the window and threw it open then she heard a cry more distinct help help it was a clear starlight night but no moon the mere shone before her and the cries were on the bank now came something more alarming still a flash a pistol shot and an agonized voice cried loudly murder help murder that voice she knew directly it was griffith gaunts chapter v ryder ran screaming and alarmed the other servants all the windows that looked on the mere were hung open but no more sounds were heard a terrible silence brooded now over those clear waters the female servants huddled together and quaked for who could doubt that a bloody deed had been done it was some time before they mustered the presence of mind to go and tell mrs gaunt at last they opened her door she was not in her room ryder ran to griffiths it was locked she called to him he made no reply they burst the door open he was not there and the window was open while their tongues were all going in consternation mrs gaunt was suddenly among them very pale they turned and looked at her aghast what means all this said she did i not hear cries outside ay said ryder murder and a pistol fired oh my poor master mrs gaunt was white as death but selfpossessed light torches this moment and search the place said she there was only one man in the house and he declined to go out alone so ryder and mrs gaunt went with him all three bearing lighted links they searched the place where ryder had heard the cries they went up and down the whole bank of the mere and east their torches red light over the placid waters themselves but there was nothing to be seen alive or dead no trace either of calamity or crime they roused the neighbors and came back to the house with their clothes all draggled and dirty mrs gaunt took ryder apart and asked her if she could guess at what time of the night griffith had made his escape he is a villain said she yet i would not have him come to harm god knows there are thieves abroad but i hope he ran away as soon as your back was turned and so fell not in with them humph said ryder then looking mrs gaunt in the face she said quietly where were you when you heard the cries i was on the other side of the house what out odoors at that time of night ay i was in the grove praying did you hear any voice you knew no all was too indistinct i heard a pistol but no words did you i heard no more than you madam said ryder trembling no one went to bed any more that night in hernshaw castle chapter vi this mysterious circumstance made a great talk in the village and in the kitchen of hernshaw castle but not in the drawingroom for mrs gaunt instantly closed her door to visitors and let it be known that it was her intention to retire to a convent and in the meantime she desired not to be disturbed ryder made one or two attempts to draw her out upon the subject but was sternly checked pale gloomy and silent the mistress of hernshaw castle moved about the place like the ghost of her former self she never mentioned griffith forbade his name to be uttered in her hearing and strange to say gave ryder strict orders not to tell any one what she had heard from thomas leicester this last insult is known but to you and me if it ever gets abroad you leave my service that very hour this injunction set ryder thinking however she obeyed it to the letter her place was getting better and better and she was a woman accustomed to keep secrets a pressing letter came from mr atkins mrs gaunt replied that her husband had come to hernshaw but had left again and the period of his ultimate return was now more uncertain than ever on this mr atkins came down to hernshaw castle but mrs gaunt would not see him he retired very angry and renewed his advertisements but in a more explicit form he now published that griffith gaunt of hernshaw and bolton was executor and residuary legatee to the late griffith gaunt of coggleswade and requested him to apply directly to james atkins solicitor of grays inn london in due course this advertisement was read by the servants at hernshaw and shown by ryder to mrs gaunt she made no comment whatever and contrived to render her pale face impenetrable ryder became as silent and thoughtful as herself and often sat bending her black judicial brows byandby dark mysterious words began to be thrown out in hernshaw village he will never come back at all he will never come into that fortune tis no use advertising for a man that is past reading these and the like equivocal sayings were followed by a vague buzz which was traceable to no individual author but seemed to rise on all sides like a dark mist and envelope that unhappy house and that dark mist of rumor soon condensed itself into a palpable and terrible whisper griffith gaunt hath met with foul play no one of the servants told mrs gaunt this horrid rumor but the women used to look at her and after her with strange eyes she noticed this and felt somehow that her people were falling away from her it added one drop to her bitter cup she began to droop into a sort of calm despondent lethargy then came fresh trouble to rouse her two of the county magistrates called on her in their official capacity and with perfect politeness but a very grave air requested her to inform them of all the circumstances attending her husbands disappearance she replied coldly and curtly that she knew very little about it her husband had left in the middle of the night he came to stay i believe so came on horseback yes did he go away on horseback no for the horse is now in my stable is it true there was a quarrel between you and him that evening gentlemen said mrs gaunt drawing herself back haughtily did you come here to gratify your curiosity no madam said the elder of the two but to discharge a very serious and painful duty in which i earnestly request you and even advise you to aid us was there a quarrel there wasa mortal quarrel the gentlemen exchanged glances and the elder made a note may we ask the subject of that quarrel mrs gaunt declined positively to enter into a matter so delicate a note was taken of this refusal are you aware madam that your husbands voice was heard calling for help and that a pistolshot was fired mrs gaunt trembled visibly i heard the pistol shot said she but not the voice distinctly oh i hope it was not his voice ryder heard ryder who is he ryder is my ladysmaid her bedroom is on that side the house can we see mrs ryder certainly said mrs gaunt and rose and rang the bell mrs ryder answered the bell in person very promptly for she was listening at the door being questioned she told the magistrates what she had heard down by the mere and said she was sure it was her masters voice that cried help and murder and with this she began to cry mrs gaunt trembled and turned pale the magistrates confined their questions to ryder they elicited however very little more from her she saw the drift of their questions and had an impulse to defend her mistress there present behind her back it would have been otherwise that resolution once taken two children might as well have tried to extract evidence from her as two justices of the peace and then mrs gaunts pale face and noble features touched them the case was mysterious but no more and they departed little the wiser and with some apologies for the trouble they had given her the next week down came mr atkins out of all patience and determined to find griffith gaunt or else obtain some proof of his decease he obtained two interviews with ryder and bribed her to tell him all she knew he prosecuted other inquiries with more method than had hitherto been used and elicited an important fact viz that griffith gaunt had been seen walking in a certain direction at one oclock in the morning followed at a short distance by a tall man with a knapsack or the like on his back the person who gave this tardy information was the wife of a certain farmers man who wired hares upon the sly the man himself being assured that in a case so serious as this no particular inquiries should be made how he came to be out so late confirmed what his wife had let out and added that both men had taken the way that would lead them to the bridge meaning the bridge over the mere more than that he could not say for he had met them and was full half a mile from the mere before those men could have reached it following up this clue mr atkins learned so many ugly things that he went to the bench on justicing day and demanded a full and searching inquiry on the premises sir george neville after in vain opposing this rode off straight from the bench to hernshaw and in feeling terms conveyed the bad news to mrs gaunt and then with the utmost delicacy let her know that some suspicion rested upon herself which she would do well to meet with the bold front of innocence what suspicion pray said mrs gaunt haughtily sir george shrugged his shoulders and replied that you have done gaunt the honorto put him out of the way mrs gaunt took this very differently from what sir george expected what she cried are they so sure he is dead murdered and with this she went into a passion of grief and remorse even sir george was puzzled as well as affected by her convulsive agitation chapter vii though it was known the proposed inquiry might result in the committal of mrs gaunt on a charge of murder yet the respect in which she had hitherto been held and the influence of sir george neville who having been her lover stoutly maintained her innocence prevailed so far that even this inquiry was private and at her own house only she was present in the character of a suspected person and the witnesses were examined before her first the poacher gave his evidence then jane the cook proved that a pedlar called thomas leicester had been in the kitchen and secreted about the premises till a late hour and this thomas leicester corresponded exactly to the description given by the poacher this threw suspicion on thomas leicester but did not connect mrs gaunt with the deed in any way but ryders evidence filled this gap she revealed three serious facts first that by her mistresss orders she had introduced this very leicester into her mistresss room about midnight where he had remained nearly half an hour and had then left the house secondly that mrs gaunt herself had been out of doors after midnight and thirdly that she had listened at the door and heard her threaten griffith gaunts life this is a mere prcis of the evidence and altogether it looked so suspicious that the magistrates after telling mrs gaunt she could ask the witnesses any question she chose a suggestion she treated with marked contempt put their heads together a moment and whispered then the eldest of them mr underhill who lived at a considerable distance told her gravely he must commit her to take her trial at the next assizes do what you conceive to be your duty gentlemen said mrs gaunt with marvellous dignity if i do not assert my innocence it is because i disdain the accusation too much i shall take no part in the committal of this innocent lady said sir george neville and was about to leave the room but mrs gaunt begged him to stay to be guilty is one thing said she to be accused is another i shall go to prison as easy as to my dinner and to the gallows as to my bed the presiding magistrate was staggered a moment by these words and it was not without considerable hesitation he took the warrant and prepared to fill it up then mr houseman who had watched the proceedings very keenly put in his word i am here for the accused person sir and with your good leave object to her committalon grounds of law what may they be mr houseman said the magistrate civilly and laid his pen down to hear them briefly sir these where a murder is proven you can commit a subject of this realm upon suspicion but you cannot suspect the murder as well as the culprit and so commit the murder must be proved to the senses now in this case the death of mr gaunt by violence is not proved indeed his very death rests but upon suspicion i admit that the law of england in this respect has once or twice been tampered with and persons have even been executed where no corpus delicti was found but what was the consequence in each ease the murdered man turned out to be alive and justice was the only murderer after harrisons case and s no cumberland jury will ever commit for murder unless the corpus delicti has been found and with signs of violence upon it come come mr atkins you are too good a lawyer and too humane a man to send my client to prison on the suspicion of a suspicion which you know the very breath of the judge will blow away even if the grand jury let it go into court i offer bail ten thousand pounds in two sureties sir george neville here present and myself the magistrate looked at mr atkins i am not employed by the crown said that gentleman but acting on mere civil grounds and have no right nor wish to be severe bail by all means but is the lady so sure of her innocence as to lend me her assistance to find the corpus delicti the question was so shrewdly put that any hesitation would have ruined mrs gaunt houseman therefore replied eagerly and promptly i answer for her she will mrs gaunt bowed her head in assent then said atkins i ask leave to drag and if need be to drain that piece of water there called the mere drag it or drain it which you will said houseman said atkins very impressively and mark my words at the bottom of that very sheet of water there i shall find the remains of the late griffith gaunt at these solemn words coming as they did not from a loose unprofessional speaker but from a lawyer a man who measured all his words a very keen observer might have seen a sort of tremor run all through mr housemans frame the more admirable was the perfect coolness and seeming indifference with which he replied find him and ill admit suicide find him with signs of violence and ill admit homicide by some person or persons unknown all further remarks were interrupted by bustle and confusion mrs gaunt had fainted dead away chapter viii of course pity was the first feeling but by the time mrs gaunt revived her fainting so soon after mr atkinss proposal had produced a sinister effect on the minds of all present and every face showed it except the wary housemans on her retiring it broke out first in murmurs then in plain words as for mr atkins he now showed the moderation of an able man who feels he has a strong cause he merely said i think there should be constables about in case of an escape being attempted but i agree with mr houseman that your worships will be quite justified in taking bail provided the corpus delicti should not be found gentlemen you were most of you neighbors and friends of the deceased and are i am sure lovers of justice i do entreat you to aid me in searching that piece of water by the side of which the deceased gentleman was heard to cry for help and much i fear he cried in vain the persons thus appealed to entered into the matter with all the ardor of just men whose curiosity as well as justice is inflamed a set of old rusty drags was found on the premises and men went punting up and down the mere and dragged it rude hooks were made by the village blacksmith and fitted to cartropes another boat was brought to hernshaw in a wagon and all that afternoon the bottom of the mere was raked and some curious things fished up but no dead man the next clay a score of amateur dragsmen were out some throwing their drags from the bridge some circulating in boats and even in large tubs and meantime mr atkins and his crew went steadily up and down dragging every foot of those placid waters they worked till dinner time and brought up a good copper pot with two handles a horses head and several decayed trunks of trees which had become saturated and sunk to the bottom at about three in the afternoon two boys who for want of a boat were dragging from the bridge found something heavy but elastic at the end of their drag they pulled up eagerly and a thing like a huge turnip half gnawed came up with a great bob and blasted their sight they let go drags and all and stood shrieking and shrieking those who were nearest them called out and asked what was the matter but the boys did not reply and their faces showed so white that a woman who saw them screamed to sir atkins and said she was sure those boys had seen something out of the common mr atkins came up and found the boys blubbering he encouraged them and they told him a fearful thing had come up it was like a mans head and shoulders all scooped out and gnawed by the fishes and had torn the drags out of their hands mr atkins made them tell him the exact place and was soon upon it with his boat the water here was very deep and though the boys kept pointing to the very spot the drags found nothing for some time but at last they showed by their resistance that they had clawed hold of something draw slowly said sir atkins and if it is be men and hold fast the men drew slowly slowly and presently there rose to the surface a thing to strike terror and loathing into the stoutest heart the mutilated remains of a human face and body the greedy pike had cleared not the features only but the entire flesh off the face but had left the hair and the tight skin of the forehead though their teeth had raked this last the remnants they had left made what they had mutilated doubly horrible since now it was not a skull not a skeleton but a face and a man gnawed down to the bones and hair and feet these last were in stout shoes that resisted even those voracious teeth and a leathern stock had offered some little protection to the throat the men groaned and hid their faces with one hand and pulled softly to the shore with the other and then with halfaverted faces they drew the ghastly remains and fluttering rags gently and reverently to land mr atkins yielded to nature and was violently sick at the sight he had searched for so eagerly as soon as he recovered his powers he bade the constables guard the body it was a body in law and see that no one laid so much as a finger on it until some magistrate had taken a deposition he also sent a messenger to mr houseman telling him the corpus delicti was found he did this partly to show that gentleman he was right in his judgment and partly out of common humanity since after this discovery mr housemans client was sure to be tried for her life a magistrate soon came and viewed the remains and took careful notes of the state in which they were found houseman came and was much affected both by the sight of his dead friend so mutilated and by the probable consequences to mrs gaunt however as lawyers fight very hard he recovered himself enough to remark that there were no marks of violence before death and insisted on this being inserted in the magistrates notes an inquest was ordered next day and meantime mrs gaunt was told she could not quit the upper apartments of her own house two constables were placed on the ground floor night and day next day the remains were removed to the little inn where griffith had spent so many jovial hours laid on a table and covered with a white sheet the coroners jury sat in the same room as was then the custom and the evidence i have already noticed was gone into and the finding of the body deposed to the jury without hesitation returned a verdict of willful murder mrs gaunt was then brought in she came white as a ghost leaning upon housemans shoulder upon her entering a juryman by a humane impulse drew the sheet over the remains again the coroner according to the custom of the day put a question to mrs gaunt with the view of eliciting her guilt if i remember right he asked her how she came to be out of doors so late on the night of the murder mrs gaunt however was in no condition to answer queries i doubt if she even heard this one her lovely eyes dilated with horror were fixed on that terrible sheet with a stony glance show me she gasped and let me die too the jurymen looked with doubtful faces at the coroner he bowed a grave assent the nearest juryman withdrew the sheet now the belief was not yet extinct that the dead body shows some signs of its murderers approach so every eye glared on her and it by turns as she with dilated horrorstricken orbs looked on that awful thing chapter ix she recoiled with a violent shudder at first and hid her face with one hand then she gradually stole a horrorstricken side glance she had not looked at it so a moment when she uttered a loud cry and pointed at its feet with quivering hand the shoes the shoesit is not my griffith with this she fell into violent hysterics and was carried out of the room at housemans earnest entreaty as soon as she was gone mr houseman being freed from his fear that his client would commit herself irretrievably recovered a show of composure and his wits went keenly to work on behalf of the accused said he i admit the suicide of some person unknown wearing heavy hobnailed shoes probably one of the lower order of people this adroit remark produced some little effect notwithstanding the strong feeling against the accused the coroner inquired if there were any bodily marks by which the remains could be identified my master had a long black mole on his forehead suggested caroline ryder tis here cried a juryman bending over the remains and now they all gathered in great excitement round the corpus delicti and there sure enough was a long black mole then was there a buzz of pity for griffith gaunt followed by a stern murmur of execration gentlemen said the coroner solemnly behold in this the finger of heaven the poor gentleman may well have put off his boots since it seems he left his horse but he could not take from his forehead his natal sign and that by gods will hath strangely escaped mutilation and revealed a most foul deed we must now do our duty gentlemen without respect of persons a warrant was then issued for the apprehension of thomas leicester and that same night mrs gaunt left hernshaw in her own chariot between two constables and escorted by armed yeomen her proud head was bowed almost to her knees and her streaming eyes hidden in her lovely hands for why a mob accompanied her for miles shouting murderessbloody papisthast done to death the kindliest gentleman in cumberland well all come to see thee hangedfair face but foul heartand groaning hissing and cursing and indeed only kept from violence by the escort and so they took that poor proud lady and lodged her in carlisle gaol she was enceinte into the bargain by the man she was to be hanged for murdering chapter x the county was against her with some few exceptions sir george neville and mr houseman stood stoutly by her sir georges influence and money obtained her certain comforts in gaol and in that day the law of england was so far respected in a gaol that untried prisoners were not thrown into cells nor impeded as they now are in preparing their defense her two staunch friends visited her every day and tried to keep her heart up but they could not do it she was in a state of dejection bordering upon lethargy if he is dead said she what matters it if by gods mercy he is alive still he will not let me die for want of a word from him impatience hath been my bane now i say gods will be done i am weary of the world houseman tried every argument to rouse her out of this desperate frame of mind but in vain it ran its course and then behold it passed away like a cloud and there came a keen desire to live and defeat her accusers she made houseman write out all the evidence against her and she studied it by day and thought of it by night and often surprised both her friends by the acuteness of her remarks mr atkins discontinued his advertisements it was houseman who now filled every paper with notices informing griffith gaunt of his accession to fortune and entreated him for that and other weighty reasons to communicate in confidence with his old friend john houseman attorneyatlaw houseman was too wary to invite him to appear and save his wife for in that case he feared the crown would use his advertisements as evidence at the trial should griffith not appear the fact is houseman relied more upon certain lacun in the evidence and the absence of all marks of violence than upon any hope that griffith might be alive the assizes drew near and no fresh light broke in upon this mysterious case mrs gaunt lay in her bed at night and thought and thought now the female understanding has sometimes remarkable power under such circumstances by degrees truth flashes across it like lightning in the dark after many such nightly meditations mrs gaunt sent one day for sir george neville and mr houseman and addressed them as follows i believe he is alive and that i can guess where he is at this moment both the gentlemen started and looked amazed yes sirs so sure as we sit here he is now at a little inn in lancashire called the packhorse with a woman he calls his wife and with this her face was scarlet and her eyes flashed their old fire she exacted a solemn promise of secrecy from them and then she told them all she had learned from thomas leicester and so now said she i believe you can save my life if you think it is worth saving and with this she began to cry bitterly but houseman the practical had no patience with the pangs of love betrayed and jealousy and such small deer in a client whose life was at stake great heaven madam said he roughly why did you not tell me this before because i am not a manto go and tell everything all at once sobbed mrs gaunt besides i wanted to shield his good name whose dear life they pretend i have taken as soon as she recovered her composure she begged sir george neville to ride to the packhorse for her sir george assented eagerly but asked how he was to find it i have thought of that too said she his black horse has been to and fro ride that horse into lancashire and give him his head ten to one but he takes you to the place or where you may hear of it if not go to lancaster and ask about the packhorse he wrote to me from lancaster see and she showed him the letter sir george embraced with ardor this opportunity of serving her ill be at hernshaw in one hour said he and ride the black horse south at once excuse me said houseman but would it not be better for me to go as a lawyer i may be more able to cope with her nay said mrs gaunt sir george is young and handsome if he manages well she will tell him more than she will you all i beg of him is to drop the chevalier for this once and see women with a womans eyes and not a mans see them as they are do not go telling a creature of this kind that she has had my money as well as my husband and ought to pity me lying here in prison keep me out of her sight as much as you can whether griffith hath deceived her or not you will never raise in her any feeling but love for him and hatred for his lawful wife dress like a yeoman go quietly and lodge in the house a day or two begin by flattering her and then get from her when she saw him last or heard from him but indeed i fear you will surprise him with her fear exclaimed sir george well hope then said the lady and a tear trickled down her face in a moment but if you do promise me on your honor as a gentleman not to affront him for i know you think him a villain a dd villain saving your presence well sir you have said it to me now promise me to say nought to him but just this rose gaunts mother she lies in carlisle gaol to be tried for her life for murdering you she begs of you not to let her die publicly upon the scaffold but quietly at home of her broken heart write it said sir george with the tears in his eyes that i may just put it in his hand for i can never utter your sweet words to such a monster as he is armed with this appeal and several minute instructions which it is needless to particularize here that staunch friend rode into lancashire and next day the black horse justified his mistresss sagacity and his own he seemed all along to know where he was going and late in the afternoon he turned off the road on to a piece of green and sir george with beating heart saw right before him the sign of the packhorse and on coming nearer the words thomas leicester he dismounted at the door and asked if he could have a bed mrs vint said yes and supper into the bargain if he liked he ordered a substantial supper directly mrs vint saw at once it was a good customer and showed him into the parlor he sat down by the fire but the moment she retired he got up and made a circuit of the house looking quietly into every window to see if he could catch a glance of griffith gaunt there were no signs of him and sir george returned to his parlor heavyhearted one hope the greatest of all had been defeated directly still it was just possible that griffith might be away on temporary business in this faint hope sir george strolled about till his supper was ready for him when he had eaten his supper he rang the bell and taking advantage of a common custom insisted on the landlord thomas leicester taking a glass with him thomas leicester said the girl he is not at home but ill send master vint old vint came in and readily accepted an invitation to drink his guests health sir george found him loquacious and soon extracted from him that his daughter mercy was leicesters wife that leicester was gone on a journey and that mercy was in care for him leastways said he she is very dull and cries at times when her mother speaks of him but she is too close to say much all this puzzled sir george neville sorely but greater surprises were in store the next morning after breakfast the servant came and told him dame leicester desired to see him he started at that but put on nonchalance and said he was at her service he was ushered into another parlor and there he found a grave comely young woman seated working with a child on the floor beside her she rose quietly he bowed low and respectfully she blushed faintly but with every appearance of selfpossession curtsied to him then eyed him pointblank a single moment and requested him to be seated i hear sir said she you did ask my father many questions last night may i ask you one sir george colored but bowed assent from whom had you the black horse you ride now if sir george had not been a veracious man he would have been caught directly but although he saw at once the oversight he had committed he replied i had him of a lady in cumberland one mistress gaunt mercy vint trembled no doubt said she softly excuse my question you shall understand that the horse is well known here madam said sir george if you admire the horse he is at your service for twenty pounds though indeed he is worth more i thank you sir said mercy i have no desire for the horse whatever and be pleased to excuse my curiosity you must think me impertinent nay madam said sir george i consider nothing impertinent that hath procured me the pleasure of an interview with you he then as directed by mrs gaunt proceeded to flatter the mother and the child and exerted those powers of pleasing which had made him irresistible in society here however he found they went a very little way mercy did not even smile she cast out of her dovelike eyes a gentle humble reproachful glance as much as to say what do i seem so vain a creature as to believe all this sir george himself had tact and sensibility and byandby became discontented with the part he was playing under those meek honest eyes there was a pause and as her sex have a wonderful art of reading the face mercy looked at him steadily and said yes sir tis best to be straightforward especially with womenfolk before he could recover this little facer she said quietly what is your name george neville well george neville said mercy very slowly and softly when you have a mind to tell me what you came here for and who sent you you will find me in this little room i seldom leave it now i beg you to speak your errand to none but me and she sighed deeply sir george bowed low and retired to collect his wits he had come here strongly prepossessed against mercy but instead of a vulgar shallow woman whom he was to surprise into confession he encountered a softeyed puritan all unpretending dignity grace propriety and sagacity flatter her said he to himself i might as well flatter an iceberg outwit her i feel like a child beside her he strolled about in a brown study not knowing what to do she had given him a fair opening she had invited him to tell the truth but he was afraid to take her at her word and yet what was the use to persist in what his own eyes told him was the wrong course whilst he hesitated and debated within himself a trifling incident turned the scale a poor woman came begging with her child and was received rather roughly by harry vint pass on good woman said he we want no tramps here then a window was opened on the ground floor and mercy beckoned the woman sir george flattened himself against the wall and listened to the two talking mercy examined the woman gently but shrewdly and elicited a tale of genuine distress sir george then saw her hand out to the woman some warm flannel for herself a piece of stuff for the child a large piece of bread and a sixpence he also caught sight of mercys dovelike eyes as she bestowed her alms and they were lit with an inward lustre she cannot be an ill woman thought sir george ill een go by my own eyes and judgment after all mrs gaunt has never seen her and i have he went and knocked at mercys door come in said a mild voice neville entered and said abruptly and with great emotion madam i see you can feel for the unhappy so i take my own way now and appeal to your pity i have come to speak to you on the saddest business you come from him said mercy closing her lips tight but her bosom heaved her heart and her judgment grappled like wrestlers that moment nay madam said sir george i come from her mercy knew in a moment who her must be she looked scared and drew back with manifest signs of repulsion the movement did not escape sir george it alarmed him he remembered what mrs gaunt had said that this woman would be sure to hate gaunts lawful wife but it was too late to go back he did the next best thing he rushed on he threw himself on his knees before mercy vint oh madam he cried piteously do not set your heart against the most unhappy lady in england if you did but know her her nobleness her misery before you steel yourself against me her friend let me ask you one question do you know where mrs gaunt is at this moment mercy answered coldly how should i know where the lady is well then she lies in carlisle gaol sheliesin carlisle gaol repeated mercy looking all confused they accuse her of murdering her husband mercy uttered a scream and catching her child up off the floor began to rock herself and moan over it no no no cried sir george she is innocent she is innocent what is that to me cried mercy wildly he is murdered he is dead and my child an orphan and so she went on moaning and rocking herself but i tell you he is not dead at all cried sir george tis all a mistake when did you see him last more than six weeks ago i mean when did you hear from him last never since that day sir george groaned aloud at this intelligence and mercy who heard him groan was heartbroken she accused herself of griffiths death twas i who drove him from me said she twas i who bade him go back to his lawful wife and the wretch hated him i sent him to his death her grief was wild and deep she could not hear sir georges arguments but presently she said sternly what does that woman say for herself madam said sir george dejectedly heaven knows you are in no condition to fathom a mystery that hath puzzled wiser heads than yours or mine and i am but little able to lay the tale before you fairly for your grief it moves me deeply and i could curse myself for putting the matter to you so bluntly and uncouthly permit me to retire a while and compose my own spirits for the task i have undertaken too rashly nay george neville said mercy stay you there only give me a moment to draw my breath she struggled hard for a little composure and after a shower of tears she hung her head over the chair like a crushed thing but made him a sign of attention sir george told the story as fairly as he could only of course his bias was in favor of mrs gaunt but as mercys bias was against her this brought the thing nearly square when he came to the finding of the body mercy was seized with a deadly faintness and though she did not become insensible yet she was in no condition to judge or even to comprehend sir george was moved with pity and would have called for help but she shook her head so then he sprinkled water on her face and slapped her hand and a beautifully moulded hand it was when she got a little better she sobbed faintly and sobbing thanked him and begged him to go on my mind is stronger than my heart she said ill hear it all though it kill me where i sit sir george went on and to avoid repetition i must ask the reader to understand that he left out nothing whatever which has been hitherto related in these pages and in fact told her one or two little things that i have omitted when he had done she sat quite still a minute or two pale as a statue then she turned to neville and said solemnly you wish to know the truth in this dark matter for dark it is in very sooth neville was much impressed by her manner and answered respectfully yes he desired to knowby all means then take my hand said mercy and kneel down with me sir george looked surprised but obeyed and kneeled down beside her with his hand in hers there was a long pause and then took place a transformation the dovelike eyes were lifted to heaven and gleamed like opals with an inward and celestial light the comely face shone with a higher beauty and the rich voice rose in ardent supplication thou god to whom all hearts be known and no secrets hid from thine eye look down now on thy servant in sore trouble that putteth her trust in thee give wisdom to the simple this day and understanding to the lowly thou that didst reveal to babes and sucklings the great things that were hidden from the wise oh show us the truth in this dark matter enlighten us by thy spirit for his dear sake who suffered more sorrows than i suffer now amen amen then she looked at neville and he said amen with all his heart and the tears in his eyes he had never heard real live prayer before here the little hand gripped his hard as she wrestled and the heart seemed to rise out of the bosom and fly to heaven on the sublime and thrilling voice they rose and she sat down but it seemed as if her eyes once raised to heaven in prayer could not come down again they remained fixed and angelic and her lips still moved in supplication sir george neville though a loose liver was no scoffer he was smitten with reverence for this inspired countenance and retired bowing low and obsequiously he took a long walk and thought it all over one thing was clear and consoling he felt sure he had done wisely to disobey mrs gaunts instructions and make a friend of mercy instead of trying to set his wits against hers ere he returned to the packhorse he had determined to take another step in the right direction he did not like to agitate her with another interview so soon but he wrote her a little letter madamwhen i came here i did not know you and therefore i feared to trust you too far but now i do know you for the best woman in england i take the open way with you know that mrs gaunt said the man would be here with you and she charged me with a few written lines to him she would be angry if she knew that i had shown them to any other yet i take on me to show them to you for i believe you are wiser than any of us if the truth were known i do therefore entreat you to read these lines and tell me whether you think the hand that wrote them can have shed the blood of him to whom they are writ i am madam with profound respect your grateful and very humble servant george neville he very soon received a line in reply written in a clear and beautiful handwriting mercy vint sends you her duty and she will speak to you at nine of the clock tomorrow morning pray for light at the appointed time sir george found her working until her needle his letter lay on the table before her she rose and curtsied to him and called the servant to take away the child for a while she went with her to the door and kissed the bairn several times at parting as if he was going away for good im loath to let him go said she to neville but it weakens a mothers mind to have her babe in the room takes her attention off each moment pray you be seated well sir i have read these lines of mistress gaunt and wept over them methinks i had not done so were they cunningly devised also i lay all night and thought that is just what she does no doubt sir and the upshot is i dont feel as if he was dead thank god that is something said neville but he could not help thinking it was very little especially to produce in a court of justice and now said she thoughtfully you say that the real thomas leicester was seen thereabouts as well as my thomas leicester then answer me one little question what had the real thomas leicester on his feet that night nay i know not was the halfcareless reply bethink you tis a question that must have been often put in your hearing begging your pardon it was never put at all nor do i see what not at the inquest no that is very strange what so many wise heads have bent over this riddle and not one to ask how was you pedlar shod madam said sir george our minds were fixed upon the fate of gaunt many did ask how was the pedlar armed but none how was he shod hath he been seen since not he and that hath an ugly look for the constables are out after him with hue and cry but he is not to be found then said mercy i must een answer my own question i do know how that pedlar was shod with hobnailed shoes sir george bounded from his chair one great ray of daylight broke in upon him ay said mercy she was right women do see clearer in some things than men the pair went from my house to hers he you call griffith gaunt had on a new pair of boots and by the same token twas i did pay for them and there is the receipt in that cupboard he you call thomas leicester went hence in hobnailed shoes i think the body they found was the body of thomas leicester the pedlar may god have mercy on his poor unprepared soul sir george uttered a joyful exclamation but the next moment he had a doubt ay but said he you forget the mole twas on that they built i forget nought said mercy calmly the pedlar had a black mole over his left temple he showed it me in this very room you have found the body of thomas leicester and griffith gaunt is hiding from the law that he hath broken he is afeared of her and her friends if he shows his face in cumberland he is afeared of my folk if he be seen in lancashire ah thomas as if i would let them harm thee sir george neville walked to and fro in grand excitement oh blessed day that i came hither madam you are an angel you will save an innocent brokenhearted lady from death and dishonor your good heart and rare wit have read in a moment the dark riddle that hath puzzled a county george said mercy gravely you have gotten the wrong end of the stick the wise in their own conceit are blinded in cumberland where all this befell they went not to god for light as you and i did george in saying this she gave him her hand to celebrate their success he kissed it devoutly and owned afterward that it was the proudest moment of his life when that sweet puritan gave him her neat hand so cordially with a pressure so gentle yet frank and now came the question how they were to make a cumberland jury see this matter as they saw it he asked her would she come to the trial as a witness at that she drew back with manifest repugnance my shame would be public i must tell who i am and what a ruined woman say rather an injured saint you have nothing to be ashamed of all good men would feel for you mercy shook her head ay but the women shame is shame with us right or wrong goes for little nay i hope to do better for you than that i must find him and send him to deliver her tis his only chance of happiness she then asked him if he would draw up an advertisement of quite a different kind from those he had described to her he assented and between them they concocted the following if thomas leicester who went from the packhorse two months ago will come thither at once mercy will be much beholden to him and tell him strange things that have befallen sir george then at her request rode over to lancaster and inserted the above in the county paper and also in a small sheet that was issued in the city three times a week he had also handbills to the same effect printed and sent into cumberland and westmoreland finally he sent a copy to his man of business in london with orders to insert it in all the journals then he returned to the packhorse and told mercy what he had done the next day he bade her farewell and away for carlisle it was a two days journey he reached carlisle in the evening and went all glowing to mrs gaunt madam said he be of good cheer i bless the day i went to see her she is an angel of wit and goodness he then related to her in glowing terms most that had passed between mercy and him but to his surprise mrs gaunt wore a cold forbidding air this is all very well said she but twill avail me little unless he comes before the judge and clears me and she will never let him do that ay that she willif she can find him if she can find him how simple you are nay madam not so simple but i can tell a good woman from a bad one and a true from a false what when you are in love with her not if you were the wisest of your sex in love with her cried sir george and colored high ay said the lady think you i cannot tell dont deceive yourself you have gone and fallen in love with her at your years not that tis any business of mine well madam said sir george stiffly say what you please on that score but at least welcome my good news mrs gaunt begged him to excuse her petulance and thanked him kindly for all he had just done but the next moment she rose from her chair in great agitation and burst out id as lieve die as owe anything to that woman sir george remonstrated why hate her she does not hate you oh yes she does tis not in nature she should do any other her acts prove the contrary her acts she has done nothing but make fair promises and that has blinded you women of this sort are very cunning and never show their real characters to a man no more prithee mention not her name to me it makes me ill i know he is with her at this moment ah let me die and be forgotten since i am no more beloved the voice was sad and weary now and the tears ran fast poor sir george was moved and melted and set himself to flatter and console this impracticable lady who hated her best friend in this sore strait for being what she was herself a woman and was much less annoyed at being hanged than at not being loved when she was a little calmer he left her and rode off to houseman that worthy was delighted get her to swear to those hobnailed shoes said he and we shall shake them he then let sir george know that he had obtained private information which he would use in crossexamining a principal witness for the crown however he added do not deceive yourself nothing can make the prisoner really safe but the appearance of griffith gaunt he has such strong motives for coming to light he is heir to a fortune and his wife is accused of murdering him the jury will never believe he is alive till they see him that mans prolonged disappearance is hideous it turns my blood cold when i think of it do not despair on that score said neville i believe our good angel will produce him three days only before the assizes came the longexpected letter from mercy vint sir george tore it open but bitter was his disappointment the letter merely said that griffith had not appeared in answer to her advertisements and she was sore grieved and perplexed there were two postscripts each on a little piece of paper first postscript in a tremulous hand pray second postscript in a firm hand drain that water houseman shrugged his shoulders impatiently drain the mere let the crown do that we should but fish up more trouble and prayer quo she tis not prayers we want but evidence he sent his clerk off to travel post night and day and subpoena mercy and bring her back with him to the trial she was to have every comfort on the road and be treated like a duchess the evening before the assizes mrs gaunts apartments were mr housemans headquarters and messages were coming and going all day on matters connected with the defense just at sunset up rattled a postchaise and the clerk got out and came haggard and bloodshot before his employer the witness has disappeared sir left home last tuesday with her child and has never been seen nor heard of since here was a terrible blow they all paled under it it seriously diminished the chances of an acquittal but mrs gaunt bore it nobly she seemed to rise under it she turned to sir george neville with a sweet smile the noble heart sees base things noble no wonder then an artful woman deluded you he has left england with her and condemned me to the gallows in cold blood so be it i shall defend myself she then sat down with mr houseman and went through the written case he had prepared for her and showed him notes she had taken of full a hundred criminal trials great and small while they were putting their heads together sir george sat in a brown study and uttered not a word presently he got up a little brusquely and said im going to hernshaw what at this time of night what to do to obey my orders to drain the mere and who could have ordered you to drain my mere mercy vint sir george uttered this in a very curious way half ashamed half resolute and retired before mrs gaunt could vent in speech the surprise and indignation that fired her eye houseman implored her not to heed sir george and his vagaries but to bend her whole mind on those approved modes of defense with which he had supplied her being now alone with her he no longer concealed his great anxiety we have lost an invaluable witness in that woman said he i was mad to think she would come mrs gaunt shivered with repugnance i would not have her come for all the world said she for heavens sake never mention her name to me i want help from none but friends send mrs houseman to me in the morning and do not distress yourself so i shall defend myself far better than you think i have not studied a hundred trials for nought thus the prisoner cheered up her attorney and soon after insisted on his going home to bed for she saw he was worn out by his exertions and now she was alone all was silent a few short hours and she was to be tried for her life tried not by the allwise judge but by fallible men and under a system most unfavorable to the accused worse than all this she was a papist and as illluck would have it since her imprisonment an alarm had been raised that the pretender meditated another invasion this report had set juries very much against all the romanists in the country and had already perverted justice in one or two cases especially in the north mrs gaunt knew all this and trembled at the peril to come she spent the early part of the night in studying her defense then she laid it quite aside and prayed long and fervently towards morning she fell asleep from exhaustion when she awoke mrs houseman was sitting by her bedside looking at her and crying they were soon clasped in each others arms condoling but presently houseman came and took his wife away rather angrily mrs gaunt was prevailed on to eat a little toast and drink a glass of wine and then she sat waiting her dreadful summons she waited and waited until she became impatient to face her danger but there were two petty larcenies on before her she had to wait at last about noon came a message to say that the grand jury had found a true bill against her then may god forgive them said she soon afterwards she was informed her time drew very near she made her toilet carefully and passed with her attendant into a small room under the court here she had to endure another chilling wait and in a sombre room presently she heard a voice above her cry out the king versus catherine gaunt then she was beckoned to she mounted some steps badly lighted and found herself in the glare of day and greedy eyes in the felons dock in a matter entirely strange we seldom know beforehand what we can do and how we shall carry ourselves mrs gaunt no sooner set her foot in that dock and saw tiny awful front of justice face to face than her tremors abated and all her powers awoke and she thrilled with love of life and bristled with all those fine arts of defense that nature lends to superior women she entered on that defense before she spoke a word for she attacked the prejudices of the court by deportment she curtsied reverently to the judge and contrived to make her reverence seem a wiling homage unmixed with fear she cast her eyes round and saw the court thronged with ladies and gentlemen she knew in a moment she read in their faces that only two or three were on her side she bowed to those only and they returned her courtesy this gave an impression a false one that the gentry sympathized with her after a little murmur of functionaries the clerk of arraigns turned to the prisoner and said in a loud voice catherine gaunt hold up thy hand she held up her hand and he recited the indictment which charged that not having the fear of god before her eyes but being moved by the instigation of the devil she had on the fifteen of october in the tenth year of the reign of his present majesty aided and abetted one thomas leicester in an assault upon one griffith gaunt esq and him the said griffith gaunt did with force and arms assassinate and do to death against the peace of our said lord the king his crown and dignity after reading the indictment the clerk of arraigns turned to the prisoner how sayest thou catherine gaunt art thou guilty of the felony and murder whereof thou standest indictedor not guilty i am not guilty culprit how wilt thou be tried culprit i am none but only accused i will be tried by god and my country god send thee a good deliverance mr whitworth the junior counsel for the crown then rose to open the case but the prisoner with a pale face but most courteous demeanor begged his leave to make a previous motion to the court mr whitworth bowed and sat down my lord said she i have first a favor to ask and that favor methinks you will grant since it is but justice impartial justice my accuser i hear has too counsel both learned and able i am but a woman and no match for their skill therefore i beg your lordship to allow me counsel on my defense to matter of fact as well as of law i know this is not usual but it is just and i am informed it has sometimes been granted in trials of life and death and that your lordship hath the power if you have the will to do me so much justice the judge looked towards mr sergeant wiltshire who was the leader on the other side he rose instantly and replied to this purpose the prisoner is misinformed the truth is that from time immemorial and down to the other day a person indicted for a capital offense was never allowed counsel at all except to matters of law and these must be started by himself by recent practice the rule hath been so far relaxed that counsel have sometimes been permitted to examine and crossexamine witnesses for a prisoner but never to make observations on the evidence nor to draw inferences from it to the point in issue mrs gaunt so then if i be sued for a small sum of money i may have skilled orators to defend me against their like but if i be sued for my life and honor i may not oppose skill to skill but must stand here a child against you that are masters tis a monstrous iniquity and you yourself sir will not deny it sergeant wiltshire madam permit me whether it be a hardship to deny full counsel to prisoners in criminal cases i shall not pretend to say but if it be tis a hardship of the laws making and not of mine nor of my lords and none have suffered by it at least in our day but those who had broken the law the sergeant then stopped a minute and whispered with his junior after which he turned to the judge my lord we that are of counsel for the crown desire to do nothing that is hard where a persons life is at stake we yield to the prisoner any indulgence for which your lordship can find a precedent in your reading but no more and so we leave the matter to you the clerk of arraigns crier proclaim silence the crier oyez oyez oyez his majestys justices do straitly charge all manner of persons to keep silence on pain of imprisonment the judge prisoner what my brother wiltshire says the law is clear in there is no precedent for what you ask and the contrary practice stares us in the face for centuries what seems to you a partial practice and to be frank some learned persons are of your mind must be set against this that in capital cases the burden of proof lies on the crown and not on the accused also it is my duty to give you all the assistance i can and that i shall do thus then it is you can be allowed counsel to examine your own witnesses and crossexamine the witnesses for the crown and speak to points of law to be started by yourselfbut no further he then asked her what gentleman there present he should assign to her for counsel her reply to this inquiry took the whole court by surprise and made her solicitor houseman very miserable none my lord said she half justice is injustice and i will lend it no color i will not set able men to fight for me with their hands tied against men as able whose hands be free counsel on terms so partial i will have none my counsel shall be three and no more yourself my lordmy innocenceand the lord god omniscient these words grandly uttered caused a dead silence in the court but only for a few moments it was broken by the loud mechanical voice of the crier who proclaimed silence and then called the names of the jury that were to try this cause mrs gaunt listened keenly to the names familiar and bourgeois names that now seemed regal for they who owned them held her life in their hands each juryman was sworn in the grand old form now slightly curtailed joseph king look upon the prisoneryou shall well and truly try and true deliverance make between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar whom you shall have in charge and a true verdict give according to the evidence so help you god mr whitworth for the crown then opened the case but did little more than translate the indictment into more rational language he sat down and sergeant wiltshire addressed the court somewhat after this fashion may it please your lordship and you gentlemen of the jury this is a case of great expectation and importance the prisoner at the bar a gentlewoman by birth and education and as you must have already perceived by breeding also stands indicted for no less a crime than murder i need not paint to you the heinousness of this crime you have but to consult your own breasts who ever saw the ghastly corpse of the victim weltering in its blood and did not feel his own blood run cold through his veins has the murderer fled with what eagerness do we pursue with what zeal apprehend with what joy do we bring him to justice even the dreadful sentence of death does not shock us when pronounced upon him we hear it with solemn satisfaction and acknowledge the justice of the divine sentence whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed but if this be the case in every common murder what shall be thought of her who has murdered her husband the man in whose arms she has lain and whom she has sworn at gods altar to love and cherish such a murderer is a robber as well as an assassin for she robs her own children of their father that tender parent who can never be replaced in this world gentlemen it will i fear be proved that the prisoner at the bar hath been guilty of murder in this high degree and though i will endeavor rather to extenuate than to aggravate yet i trust sic i have such a history to open as will shock the ears of all who hear me mr griffith gaunt the unfortunate deceased was a man of descent and worship as to his character it was inoffensive he was known as a worthy kindly gentleman deeply attached to her who now stands accused of his murder they lived happily together for some years but unfortunately there was a thorn in the rose of their wedded life he was of the church of england she was and is a roman catholic this led to disputes and no wonder since the same unhappy difference hath more than once embroiled a nation let alone a single family well gentlemen about a year ago there was a more violent quarrel than usual between the deceased and the prisoner at the bar and the deceased left his home for several months he returned upon a certain day in this year and a reconciliation real or apparent took place he left home again soon afterwards but only for a short period on the th of last october he suddenly returned for good as he intended and here begins the tragedy to which what i have hitherto related was but the prologue scarce an hour before he came one thomas leicester entered the house now this thomas leicester was a creature of the prisoners he had been her gamekeeper and was now a pedlar it was the prisoner who set him up as a pedlar and purchased the wares to start him in his trade gentlemen this pedlar as i shall prove was concealed in the house when the deceased arrived one caroline ryder who is the prisoners gentlewoman was the person who first informed her of leicesters arrival and it seems she was much moved mrs ryder will tell you she fell into hysterics but soon after her husbands arrival was announced and then the passion was of a very different kind so violent was her rage against this unhappy man that for once she forgot all prudence and threatened his life before a witness yes gentlemen we shall prove that this gentlewoman who in appearance and manners might grace a court was so transported out of her usual self that she held up a knifea knife gentlemen and vowed to put it into her husbands heart and this was no mere temporary ebullition of wrath we shall see presently that long after she had time to cool she repeated this menace to the unfortunate mans face the first threat however was uttered in her own bedroom before her confidential servant caroline ryder aforesaid but now the scene shifts she has to all appearance recovered herself and sits smiling at the head of her table for you must know she entertained company that night persons of the highest standing in the county presently her husband all unconscious of the terrible sentiments she entertained towards him and the fearful purpose she had announced enters the room makes obeisance to his guests and goes to take his wifes hand what does she she draws back with so strange a look and such forbidding words that the company were disconcerted consternation fell on all present and ere long they made their excuses and left the house thus the prisoner was left alone with her husband but meantime curiosity had been excited by her strange conduct and some of the servants with foreboding hearts listened at the door of the diningroom what did they hear gentlemen a furious quarrel in which however the deceased was comparatively passive and the prisoner again threatened his life with vehemence her passion it is clear had not cooled now it may fairly be alleged on behalf of the prisoner that the witnesses for the crown were on one side of the door the prisoner and the deceased on the other and that such evidence should be received with caution i grant thiswhere it is not sustained by other circumstances or by direct proofs let us then give the prisoner the benefit of this doubt and let us inquire how the deceased himself understood her he who not only heard the words and the accents but saw the looks whatever they were that accompanied them gentlemen he was a man of known courage and resolution yet he was found after this terrible interview much cowed and dejected he spoke to mrs ryder of his death as an event not far distant and so went to his bedroom in a melancholy and foreboding state and where was that bedroom he was thrust by his wifes orders into a small chamber and not allowed to enter hers he the master of the house her husband and her lord but his interpretation of the prisoners words did not end there he left us a further comment by his actions next ensuing he dared not i beg pardon this is my inference receive it as such he did not remain in that house a single night he bolted his chamberdoor inside and in the very dead of night notwithstanding the fatigues of the days journey for he had ridden some distance he let himself out by the window and reached the ground safely though it was a height of fourteen feet a leap gentlemen that few of us would venture to take but what will not men risk when destruction is at their heels he did not wait even to saddle his horse but fled on foot unhappy man he fled from danger and met his death from the hour when he went up to bed none of the inmates of the house ever saw griffith gaunt alive but one thomas hayes a laborer saw him walking in a certain direction at one oclock that morning and behind him gentlemen there walked another man who was that other man when i have told you and this is an essential feature of the case how the prisoner was employed during the time that her husband lay quaking in his little room waiting an opportunity to escapewhen i tell you this i fear you will divine who it was that followed the deceased and for what purpose gentlemen when the prisoner had threatened her husband in person as i have described she retired to her own room but not to sleep she ordered her maid mrs ryder to bring thomas leicester to her chamber yes gentlemen she received this pedlar at midnight in her bedchamber now an act so strange as this admits i think of but two interpretations either she had a guilty amour with this fellow or she had some extraordinary need of his services her whole character by consent of the witnesses renders it very improbable that she would descend to a low amour moreover she acted too publicly in the matter the man as we know was her tool her creature she had bought his wares for him and set him up as a pedlar she openly summoned him to her presence and kept him there about halfanhour he went from her and very soon after is seen by thomas hayes following griffith gauntat one oclock in the morningthat griffith gaunt who after that hour was never seen alive gentlemen up to this point the evidence is clear connected and cogent but it rarely happens in cases of murder that any human eye sees the very blow struck the penalty is too severe for such an act to be done in the presence of an eyewitness and not one murderer in ton could be convicted without the help of circumstantial evidence the next link however is taken up by an earwitness and in some cases the ear is even better than the eye for instance as to the discharge of firearms for by the eye alone we could not positively tell whether a pistol had gone off or had but flashed in the pan well then gentlemen a few minutes after mr gaunt was last seen alive which was by thomas hayes mrs ryder who had retired to her bedroom heard the said gaunt distinctly cry for help she also heard a pistolshot discharged this took place by the side of a lake or large pond near the house called the mere mrs ryder alarmed the house and she and the other servants proceeded to her masters room they found it bolted from the inside they broke it open mr gaunt had escaped by the window as i have already told you presently in comes the prisoner from out of doors this is at one oclock in the morning how she appears to have seen at once that she must explain her being abroad at that time so she told mrs ryder that she had been outpraying here some people laughed harshly but were threatened severely and silenced is that credible do people go out of doors at one oclock in the morning to pray nay but i fear it was to do an act that years of prayer and penitence cannot efface from that moment mr gaunt was seen no more among living men and what made his disappearance the more mysterious was that he had actually at this time just inherited largely from his namesake mr gaunt of coggleswade and his own interest and that of the other legatees required his immediate presence mr atkins the testators solicitor advertised for this unfortunate gentleman but he did not appear to claim his fortune then plain men began to put this and that together and cried out foul play justice was set in motion at last but embarrassed by the circumstance that the body of the deceased could not be found at last mr atkins the solicitor being unable to get the estate i have mentioned administered for want of proof of griffith gaunts decease entered heartily into this affair on mere civil grounds he asked the prisoner before several witnesses if she would permit him to drag that piece of water by the side of which mr gaunt was heard to cry for help and after that seen no more the prisoner did not reply but mr houseman her solicitor a very worthy man who has i believe or had up to that moment a sincere conviction of her innocence answered for her and told mr atkins he was welcome to drag or drain it then the prisoner said nothing she fainted away after this you may imagine with what expectation the water was dragged gentlemen after hours of fruitless labour a body was found but here an unforeseen circumstance befriended the prisoner it seems that piece of water swarms with enormous pike and other ravenous fish these had so horribly mutilated the deceased that neither form nor feature remained to swear by and as the law wisely and humanely demands that in these eases a body shall be identified beyond doubt justice bade fair to be baffled again but lo as often happens in case of murder providence interposed and pointed with unerring finger to a slight but infallible mark the deceased gentleman was known to have a large mole over his left temple it had been noticed by his servants and his neighbors well gentlemen the greedy fish had spared this mole spared it perhaps by his command who bade the whale swallow jonah yet not destroy him there it was clear and infallible it was examined by several witnesses it was recognized it completed that chain of evidence some of it direct some of it circumstantial which i have laid before you very briefly and every part of which i shall now support by credible witnesses he called thirteen witnesses including mr atkins thomas hayes jane bannister caroline ryder and others and their evidence in chief bore out every positive statement the counsel had made in crossexamining these witnesses mrs gaunt took a line that agreeably surprised the court it was not for nothing she had studied a hundred trials with a womans observation and patient docility she had found out how badly people plead their own causes and had noticed the reasons one of which is that they say too much and stray from the point the line she took with one exception was keen brevity she crossexamined thomas hayes as follows chapter xi you say the pedlar was a hundred yards behind my husband which of the two men was walking fastest thomas hayes considered a moment well i think the squire was walking rather the smartest of the two did the pedlar seem likely to overtake him nay ye see dame squire he walked straight on but the pedlar he took both sides of the road at oust as the saying is the prisoner forgive me thomas but i dont know what you mean hayes compassionately how should ye you are never the worse for liquor the likes of you the prisoner very keenly oh he was in liquor was he hayes come dame you do brew good ale at hernshaw castle ye neednt go to deny that for lord knows tis no sin and a poor fellow may be jolly yet not to say drunk the judge sternly witness attend and answer directly the prisoner nay my lord tis a plain country body and means no ill good thomas be so much my friend as to answer plainly was the man drunk or sober hayes all i know is he went from one side of the road to tother the prisoner thomas hayes as you hope to be saved eternally was the pedlar drunk or sober hayes well if i must tell on my neighbor or else be damned then that there pedlar was as drunk as a lord here notwithstanding the nature of the trial the laughter was irrepressible and mrs gaunt sat quietly down for she was allowed a seat and said no more to the surgeon who had examined the body officially she put this question did you find any signs of violence the surgeon none whatever but then there was nothing to go by except the head and the bones the prisoner have you experience in this kind i mean have you inspected murdered bodies the surgeon yes the prisoner how many the surgeon two before this the prisoner oh pray pray do not say before this i have great hopes no murder at all hath been committed here let us keep to plain cases please you describe the injuries in those two undoubted cases the surgeon in wellyns the skull was fractured in two places in sherretts the right arm was broken and there were some contusions on the head but the cause of death was a stab that penetrated the lungs the prisoner suppose wellyns murderers had thrown his body into the water and the fishes had so mutilated it as they have this one could you by your art have detected the signs of violence the surgeon certainly the mans skull was fractured wellyns i mean the prisoner i put the same question with regard to sherretts the surgeon i cannot answer it here the lungs were devoured by the fishes no signs of lesion can be detected in an organ that has ceased to exist the prisoner this is too partial why select one injury out of several what i ask is this could you have detected violence in sherretts case although the fishes had eaten the flesh of his body the surgeon i answer that the minor injuries of sherrett would have been equally perceptible to wit the bruises on the head and the broken arm but not the perforation of the lungs and that it was killed the man prisoner then so far as you know and can swear about murder more blows have always been struck than one and some of the blows struck in sherretts case and wellyns would have left traces that fishes teeth could not efface the surgeon that is so if i am to be peevishly confined to my small and narrow experience of murdered bodies but my general knowledge of the many ways in which life may be taken by violence the judge stopped him and said that in a case of blood that could hardly be admitted as evidence against his actual experience the prisoner put a drawing of the castle the mere and the bridge into the witnesses hands and elicited that it was correct and also the distances marked on it they had in fact been measured exactly for her the hobnailed shoes were produced and she made some use of them particularly in crossexamining jane bannister prisoner look at those shoes saw you ever the like on mr gaunts feet jane that i never did dame prisoner what not when he came into the kitchen on the th october jane nay he was booted by the same token i saw the boy a cleaning of them for supper prisoner those boots when you broke into his room did you find them jane nay when the man went his boots went as reason was we found nought of his but a soiled glove prisoner had the pedlar boots on jane alas who ever seed a booted pedlar prisoner had he these very shoes on look at them jane i couldnt say for that he had shoon for they did properly clatter on my bricks the judge clatter on her bricks what does she mean prisoner i think she means on the floor of her kitchen tis a brick floor if i remember right the judge good woman say is that what you mean jane ay ant please you my lord prisoner had the pedlar a mole on his forehead jane not that i know on i never took so much notice of the man but la dame now i look at you i dont believe you was ever the one to murder our master wiltshire we dont want your opinion confine yourself to facts prisoner you heard me rating my husband on that night what was it i said about the constablesdo do you remember jane la dame i wouldnt ask that if i was in your place prisoner i am much obliged to you for your advice but answer metruly jane well if you will have it i think you said they should be here in the morning but indeed good gentlemen her bark was always worse than her bite poor soul the judge here that meant at hernshaw castle i presume jane ay my lord an if it please your lordships honors worship mrs gaunt husbanding the patience of the court put no questions at all to several witnesses but she crossexamined mrs ryder very closely this was necessary for ryder was a fatal witness her memory had stored every rash and hasty word the poor lady had uttered and influenced either by animosity or prejudice she put the worst color on every suspicious circumstance she gave her damnatory evidence neatly and clearly and with a seeming candor and regret that disarmed suspicion when her examination in chief concluded there was but one opinion amongst the bar and the auditors in general viz that the maid had hung the mistress mrs gaunt herself felt she had a terrible antagonist to deal with and when she rose to crossexamine her she looked paler than she had done all through the trial she rose but seemed to ask herself how to begin and her pallor and her hesitation while they excited some little sympathy confirmed the unfavorable impression she fixed her eyes upon the witnesses as if to discover where she was most vulnerable mrs ryder returned her gaze calmly the court was hushed for it was evident a duel was coming between two women of no common ability the opening rather disappointed expectation mrs gaunt seemed by her manner desirous to propitiate the witness prisoner very civilly you say you brought thomas leicester to my bedroom on that terrible night ryder civilly yes madam prisoner and you say he stayed there halfanhour ryder yes madam he did prisoner may i inquire how you know he stayed just halfanhour ryder my watch told me that madam i brought him to you at a quarter past eleven and you did not ring for me till a quarter to twelve prisoner and when i did ring for you what then ryder i came and took the man away by your orders prisoner at a quarter to twelve ryder at a quarter to twelve prisoner this leicester was a lover of yours ryder not he prisoner oh fie why he offered you marriage it went so far as that ryder oh that was before you set him up pedlar prisoner twas so but he was single for your sake and he renewed his offer that very night come do not forswear yourself about a trifle ryder trifle indeed why if he did what has that to do with the murder youll do yourself no good madam by going about so wiltshire really madam this is beside the mark prisoner if so it can do your case no harm my lord you did twice interrupt the learned counsel and forebode him to lead his witnesses i not once for i am for stopping no mouths but sifting all to the bottom now i implore you to let me have fair play in my turn and an answer from this slippery witness the judge prisoner i do not quite see your drift but god forbid you should be hampered in your defense witness by virtue of your oath reply directly did this pedlar offer you marriage that night after he left the prisoner ryder my lord he did prisoner and confided to you he had orders to kill mr gaunt ryder not he madam that was not the way to win me prisoner what did not his terrible purpose peep out all the time he was making love to you no reply prisoner you had the kitchen to your two selves come dont hesitate ryder the other servants were gone to bed you kept the man so late prisoner oh i mean no reflection on your prudence you went out of doors with your wooer just to see him off ryder not i what for i had nobody to make away with i just opened the door for him bolted it after him and went straight to my bedroom prisoner how long had you been there when you heard the cry for help ryder scarce ten minutes i had not taken my stays off prisoner if you and thomas hayes speak true that gives half an hour you were making love with the murderer after he left me am i correct the witness now saw whither she had been led and changed her manner she became sullen and watched an opportunity to stab prisoner had he a mole on his brow ryder not that i know of prisoner why where were your eyes then when the murderer saluted you at parting ryders eyes flashed but she felt her temper tried and governed it all the more severely she treated the question with silent contempt prisoner but you pass for a discreet woman perhaps you looked modestly down when the assassin saluted you ryder if he saluted me perhaps i did prisoner in that case you could not see his mole but you must have noticed his shoes were these the shoes he wore look at them well ryder after inspecting them i do not recognise them prisoner will you swear these were not the shoes he had on ryder how can i swear that i know nothing about the mans shoes if you please my lord am i to be kept here all day with her foolish trifling questions the judge all day and all night too if justice requires it the law is not swift to shed blood prisoner my lord and the gentlemen of the jury were here before you and will be kept here after you prithee attend look at that drawing of hernshaw castle and hernshaw mere now take this pencil and mark your bedroom on the drawing the pencil was taken from the prisoner and handed to ryder she waited like a cat till it came close to her then recoiled with an admirable scream me handle a thing hot from the hand of a murderess it makes me tremble all over this cruel stab affected the prisoner visibly she put her hand to her bosom and with tears in her eyes faltered out a request to the judge that she might sit down a minute the judge to be sure you may and you my good woman must not run before the court how do you know what evidence she may have in store at present we have only heard one side be more moderate the prisoner rose promptly to her feet my lord i welcome the insult that has disgusted your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury and won me those good words of comfort to ryderwhat sort of a night was it ryder very little moon but a clear starry night prisoner could you see the mere and the banks ryder nay but so much of it as faced my window prisoner have you marked your window ryder i have prisoner now mark the place where you heard mr gaunt cry for help ryder twas about here under these trees and that is why i could not see him along of the shadow prisoner possibly did you see me on that side the mere ryder no prisoner what colored dress had i on at that time ryder white satin prisoner then you could have seen me even among the trees had i been on that side the mere ryder i cant say however i never said you were on the very spot where the deed was done but you were out of doors prisoner how do you know that ryder why you told me so yourself prisoner then that is my evidence not yours swear to no more than you know had my husband to your knowledge a reason for absconding suddenly ryder yes he had prisoner what was it ryder fear of you prisoner nay i mean had he not something to fear something quite different from that i am charged with ryder you know best madam i would gladly serve you but i cannot guess what you are driving at the prisoner was taken aback by this impudent reply she hesitated to force her servant to expose a husband whom she believed to be living and her hesitation looked like discomfiture and ryder was victorious in that encounter by this time they were both thoroughly embittered and it was war to the knife prisoner you listened to our unhappy quarrel that night ryder quarrel madam twas all on one side prisoner how did you understand what i said to him about the constables ryder constables i never heard you say the word prisoner oh ryder neither when you threatened him with your knife to me nor when you threatened him to his face prisoner take care you forget that jane bannister heard me was her ear nearer the keyhole than yours ryder jane she is a simpleton you could make her think she heard anything i noticed you put the words in her mouth prisoner god forgive you you naughty woman you had better have spoken the truth ryder my lord if you please am i to be miscalledby a murderess the judge come come this is no place for recrimination the prisoner now stooped and examined her papers and took a distinct line of crossexamination prisoner with apparent carelessness at all events you are a virtuous woman mrs ryder ryder yes madam as virtuous as yourself to say the least prisoner still more carelessly married or single ryder single and like to be prisoner yes if i remember right i made a point of that before i engaged you as my maid ryder i believe the question was put prisoner here is the answer in your handwriting is not that your handwriting ryder after inspecting it it is prisoner you came highly recommended by your last mistress a certain mrs hamilton here is her letter describing you as a model ryder well madam hitherto i have given satisfaction to all my mistresses mrs hamilton among the rest my character does not rest on her word only i hope prisoner excuse me i engaged you on her word alone now who is this mrs hamilton ryder a worshipful lady i served for eight months before i came to you she went abroad or i should be with her now prisoner now cast your eye over this paper it was the copy of a marriage certificate between thomas edwards and caroline plunkett who is this caroline plunkett ryder turned very pale and made no reply i ask you who is this caroline plunkett ryder faintly myself the judge why you said you were single ryder so i am as good as single my husband and me we parted eight years ago and i have never seen him since prisoner was it quite eight years ago ryder nearly twas in may prisoner put you have lived with him since ryder never upon my soul prisoner when was your child born ryder my child i have none prisoner in january you left a baby at biggleswade with a woman called churchdid you not ryder panting of course i did it was my sisters prisoner do you mean to call god to witness that child was not yours ryder hesitated prisoner will you swear mrs church did not see you nurse that child in secret and weep over it at this question the perspiration stood visible on ryders brow her checks were ghastly and her black eyes roved like some wild animals round the court she saw her own danger and had no means of measuring her inquisitors information my lord have pity on me i was betrayed abandoned why am i so tormented i have not committed murder so catlike she squealed and scratched at once prisoner what to swear away an innocent life is not that murder the judge prisoner we make allowances for your sex and your peril but you must not remark on the evidence at present examine as severely as you will but abstain from comment till you address the jury on your defense sergeant wiltshire my lord i submit that this line of examination is barbarous and travels out of the case entirely prisoner not so mr sergeant tis done by advice of an able lawyer my life is in peril unless i shake this witnesss credit to that end i show you she is incontinent and practiced in falsehood unchastity has been held in these courts to disqualify a female witness hath it not my lord the judge hardly but to disparage her evidence it has and wisely for she who loses her virtue enters on a life of deceit and lying is a habit that spreads from one thing to many much wisdom there is in ancient words our forefathers taught us to call a virtuous woman an honest woman and the law does but follow in that track still however leaving much to the discretion of the jury prisoner i would show her more mercy than she has shown to me therefore i leave that matter witness be so good as to examine mrs hamiltons letter and compare it with your own the ys and the ss are peculiar in both and yet the same come confess mrs hamiltons is a forgery you wrote it be pleased to hand both letters up to my lord to compare the disguise is but thin ryder forgery there was none there is no mrs hamilton she burst into tears i had my child to provide for and no man to help me what was i to do a servant must live prisoner then why not let her mistress live whose bread she has eaten my lord shall not this false witness be sent hence to prison for perjury wiltshire certainly not what woman on earth is expected to reveal her own shame upon oath twas not fair nor human to put such questions come madam leave torturing this poor creature show some mercy you may need it yourself the prisoner sir tis not mercy i ask but justice according to law but since you do me the honor to make me a request i will comply and ask her but one question more describe my apartment into which you showed thomas leicester that night begin at the outer door ryder first there is the anteroom then the boudoir then theres your bedchamber prisoner into which of those three did you show thomas leicester ryder into the anteroom prisoner then why did you say it was in my chamber i entertained him ryder madam i meant no more than that it was your private apartment upstairs prisoner you contrived to make the gentlemen think otherwise the judge that you did tis down in my notes that she received the pedlar in her bedchamber ryder sobbing god is my witness i did not mean to mislead your lordship and i ask my ladys pardon for not being more exact in that particular at this the prisoner bowed to the judge and sat down with one victorious flash of her grey eye at the witness who was in an abject condition of fear and hung all about the witnessbox limp as a wet towel sergeant wiltshire saw she was so thoroughly cowed she would be apt to truckle and soften her evidence to propitiate the prisoner so he asked her but one question were you and the prisoner on good terms ryder on the best of terms she was always a good and liberal mistress to me wiltshire i will not prolong your sufferings you may go down the judge but you will not leave the court till this trial is ended i have grave doubts whether i ought not to commit you unfortunately for the prisoner ryder was not the last witness for the crown the others that followed were so manifestly honest that it would have been impolitic to handle them severely the prisoner therefore put very few questions to them and when the last witness went down the case looked very formidable the evidence for the crown being now complete the judge retired for some refreshment and the court buzzed like a hum of bees mrs gaunts lips and throat were parched and her heart quaked a woman of quite the lower order thrust forth a great arm and gave her an orange mrs gaunt thanked her sweetly and the juice relieved her throat also this bit of sympathy was of good omen and did her heart good she buried her face in her hands and collected all her powers for the undertaking before her she had noted down the exact order of her topics but no more the judge returned the crier demanded silence and the prisoner rose and turned her eyes modestly but steadily upon those who held her life in their hands and true to the wisdom of her sex the first thing she aimed at wasto please my lord and you gentlemen of the jury i am now to reply to a charge of murder founded on a little testimony and a good deal of false but i must needs say reasonable conjecture i am innocent but unlike other innocent persons who have stood here before me i have no man to complain of the magistrates who committed me proceeded with due caution and humanity they weighed my hitherto unspotted reputation and were in no hurry to prejudge me here in this court i have met with much forbearance the learned counsel for the crown has made me groan under his abilities that was his duty but he said from the first he would do nothing hard and he has kept his word often he might have stopped me i saw it in his face but being a gentleman and a christian as well as a learned lawyer methinks he said to himself this is a poor gentlewoman pleading for her life let her have some little advantage as for my lord he has promised to be my counsel so far as his high station and duty to the crown admit and he has supported and consoled me more than once with words of justice that would not i think have encouraged a guilty person but have comforted and sustained me beyond expression so then i stand here the victim not of mans injustice but of deceitful appearances and of honest but hasty and loose conjectures these conjectures i shall now sift and hope to show you how hollow they are gentlemen in every disputed matter the best way i am told is to begin by settling what both parties are agreed in and so to narrow the matter to use that way then i do heartily agree with the learned counsel that murder is a heinous crime and that black as it is at the best yet it is still more detestable when tis a wife that murders her husband and robs her child of a parent who can never be replaced i also agree with him that circumstantial evidence is often sufficient to convict a murderer and indeed were it not so that most monstrous of crimes would go oftenest unpunished since of all culprits murderers do most shun the eyes of men in their dark deeds and so provide beforehand that direct testimony to their execrable crime there shall be none only herein i am advised to take a distinction that escaped the learned sergeant i say that first of all it ought to be proved directly and to the naked eye that a man has been murdered and then if none saw the crime done let circumstances point out the murderer but here they put the cart before the horse they find a dead body with no marks of violence whatever and labour to prove by circumstantial evidence alone that this mere dead body is a murdered body this i am advised is bad in law and contrary to general precedents and the particular precedents for it are not examples but warnings since both the prisoners so rashly convicted were proved innocent after their execution the judge took a note of this distinction then to go from principles to the facts i agree and admit that in a moment of anger i was so transported out of myself as to threaten my husbands life before caroline ryder but afterwards when i saw him face to face then that i threatened him with violence that i deny the fact is i had just learned that he had committed a capital offense and what i threatened him with was the law this was proved by jane bannister she says she heard me say the constables should come for him next morning for what to murder him the judge give me leave madam shall you prove mr gaunt had committed a capital offense prisoner i could my lord but i am loth to do it for if i did i should cast him into worse trouble than i am in myself the judge shaking his head gravely let me advise you to advance nothing you are not able and willing to prove the prisoner then i confine myself to this it was proved by a witness for the crown that in the diningroom i threatened my husband to his face with the law now this threat and not that other extravagant threat which he never heard you know was clearly the threat which caused him to abscond that night in the next place i agree with the learned counsel that i was out of doors at one oclock that morning but if he will use me as his witness in that matter then he must not pick and choose and mutilate my testimony nay let him take the whole truth and not just so much as he can square with the indictment either believe me that i was out of doors praying or do not believe me that i was out of doors at all gentlemen hear the simple truth you may see in the map on the south side of hernshaw castle a grove of large firtrees tis a reverend place most fit for prayer and meditation here i have prayed a thousand times and more before the fifteenth october hence tis called the dames haunt as i shall prove that am the dame tis called after let it not seem incredible to you that i should pray out of doors in my grove on a fine clear starry night for aught i know protestants may pray only by the fireside but remember i am a catholic we are not so contracted in our praying we do not confine it to little comfortable places nay but for seventeen hundred years and more we have prayed out of doors as much as in doors and this our custom is no fit subject for a shallow sneer how does the learned sergeant know that beneath the vault of heaven at night studded with those angelic eyes the stars is an unfit place to bend the knee and raise the soul in prayer has he ever tried it this sudden appeal to a learned and eminent but by no means devotional sergeant so tickled the gentlemen of the bar that they burst out laughing with singular unanimity this dashed the prisoner who had not intended to be funny and she hesitated and looked distressed the judge proceed madam these remarks of yours are singular but quite pertinent and no fit subject for ridicule gentlemen remember the public looks to you for an example prisoner my lord twas my fault for making that personal which should be general but women they are so tis our foible i pray the good sergeant to excuse me i say then generally that when the sun retires then earth fades but heaven comes out in tenfold glory and i say the starry firmament at night is a temple not built with hands and the bare sight of it subdues the passions chastens the heart and aids the soul in prayer surprisingly my lord as i am a christian woman tis true that my husband had wronged me cruelly and broken the law tis true that i raged against him and he answered me not again tis true as that witness said that my bark is worse than my bite i cooled and then felt i had forgotten the wife and the christian in my wrath i repented and to be more earnest in my penitence i did go and pray out o doors beneath those holy eyes of heaven that seemed to look down with chaste reproach on my ungoverned heat i left my fireside my velvet cushions and all the little comforts made by human hands that adorn our earthly dwellings but distract our eyes from god some applause followed this piece of eloquence exquisitely uttered it was checked and the prisoner resumed with an entire change of manner gentlemen the case against me is like a piece of rotten wood varnished all over it looks fair to the eye but will not bear handling as example of what i say take three charges on which the learned sergeant greatly relied on opening his case st that i received thomas leicester in my bedroom nd that he went hot from me after mr gaunt rd that he was seen following mr gaunt with a bloody intent how ugly these three proofs looked at first sight well but when we squeezed the witnesses ever so little what did these three dwindle down to st that i received thomas leicester in an anteroom which leads to a boudoir and that boudoir leads to my bedroom nd that thomas leicester went from me to the kitchen and there for a good halfhour drank my ale as it appears and made love to his old sweetheart caroline ryder the false witness for the crown and went abroad fresh from her and not from me rd that he was not to speak strictly seen following mr gaunt but just walking on the same road drunk and staggering and going at such a rate that as the crowns own witness swore he could hardly in the nature of things overtake mr gaunt who walked quicker and straighter too than he so then even if a murder has been done they have failed to connect thomas leicester with it or me with thomas leicester two broken links in a chain of but three and now i come to the more agreeable part of my defense i do think there has been no murder at all there is no evidence of a murder a body is found with the flesh eaten by fishes but the bones and the head uninjured they swear a surgeon who has examined the body and certainly he had the presumption to guess it looks like a murdered body but being sifted he was forced to admit that so far as his experience of murdered bodies goes it is not like a murdered body for there is no bone broken nor bruise on the head where is the body found in the water but water by itself is a sufficient cause of death and a common cause too and kills without breaking bones or bruising the head o perversity of the wise for every one creature murdered in england ten are accidentally drowned and they find a dead man in the water which is as much as to say they find the slain in the arms of the slayer yet they do not once suspect the water but go about in search of a strange and monstrous crime mr gaunts cry for help was heard here if it was heard at all which i greatly doubt here by this clump of trees the body was found here hard by the bridge which is by measurement one furlong and sixty paces from that clump of trees as i shall prove there is no current in the mere lively enough to move a body and what there is runs the wrong way so this disconnects the cry for help and the dead body another broken link and now i come to my third defense i say the body is not the body of griffith gaunt the body mutilated it was had two distinguishing marks a mole on the brow and a pair of hobnailed shoes on the feet now the advisers of the crown fix their eyes on that mole but they turn their heads away from the hobnailed shoes but why articles of raiment found on a body are legal evidence of identity how often my lord in cases of murder hath the crown relied on such particulars especially in cases where corruption had obscured the features i shall not imitate this partiality this obstinate prejudice i shall not ask you to shut your eyes on the mole as they do on the shoes but shall meet the whole truth fairly mr gaunt went from my house that morning with boots on his feet and with a mole on his brow thomas leicester went the same road with shoes on his feet and as i shall prove with a mole on his brow to be sure the crown witnesses did not distinctly admit this mole on him but you will remember they dared not deny it on their oaths and so run their heads into an indictment for perjury but gentlemen i shall put seven witnesses into the box who will all swear that they have known thomas leicester for years and that he had a mole upon his left temple one of these witnesses isthe mother that bore him i shall then call witnesses to prove that on the fifteenth of october the bridge over the mere was in bad repair and a portion of the side rail gone and that the body was found within a few yards of that defective bridge and then as thomas leicester went that way drunk and staggering from side to side you may reasonably infer that he fell into the water in passing the bridge to show you this is possible i shall prove the same thing has actually occurred i shall swear the oldest man in the parish who will depose to a similar event that happened in his boyhood he hath said it a thousand times before today and now will swear it he will tell you that on a certain day sixtynine years ago the parson of hernshaw the rev augustus murthwaite went to cross this bridge at night after carousing at hernshaw castle with our greatgrandfather my husbands and mine the then proprietor of hernshaw and tumbled into the water and his body was found gnawed out of the very form of humanity by the fishes within a yard or two of the spot where poor tom leicester was found that hath cost us all this trouble so do the same causes bring round the same events in a cycle of years the only difference is that the parson drank his death in our diningroom and the pedlar in our kitchen no doubt my lord you have observed that sometimes a hasty and involuntary inaccuracy gives quite a wrong color to a thing i assure you i have suffered by this it is said that the moment mr atkins proposed to drag my mere i fainted away in this account there is an omission i shall prove that mr atkins used these wordsand underneath that water i undertake to find the remains of griffith gaunt now gentlemen you shall understand that at this time and indeed until the moment when i saw the shoes upon that poor corpses feet i was in great terror for my husbands life how could it be otherwise caroline ryder had told me she heard his cry for help he had disappeared what was i to think i feared he had fallen in with robbers i feared all manner of things so when the lawyer said so positively he would find his body i was overpowered ah gentlemen wedded love survives many wrongs many angry words i love my husband still and when the man told me so brutally that he was certainly dead i fainted away i confess it shall i be hanged for that but now thank god i am full of hope that he is alive and that good hope has given me the courage to make this great effort to save my own life hitherto i have been able to contradict my accusers positively but now i come to a mysterious circumstance that i own puzzles me most persons accused of murder could if they chose make a clean breast and tell you the whole matter but this is not my case i know shoes from boots and i know kate gaunt from a liar and a murderess but when all is said this is still a dark mysterious business and there are things in it i can only deal with as you do gentlemen by bringing my wits to bear upon them in reasonable conjecture caroline ryder swears she heard mr gaunt cry for help and mr gaunt has certainly disappeared my accusers have somewhat weakened this by trying to palm off the body of thomas leicester on you for the body of mr gaunt but the original mystery remains and puzzles me i might fairly appeal to you to disbelieve the witness she is proved incontinent and a practiced liar and she forswore herself in this court and my lord is in two minds about committing her but a liar does not always lie and to be honest i think she really believes she heard mr gaunt cry for help for she went straight to his bedroom and that looks as if she really thought she heard his voice but a liar may be mistaken do not forget that distance affects the voice and i think the voice she heard was thomas leicesters and the place it came from higher up the mere this my notion will surprise you less when i prove to you that leicesters voice bore a family likeness to mr gaunts i shall call two witnesses who have been out shooting with mr gaunt and tom leicester and have heard leicester halloo in the wood and taken it for mr gaunt must i tell you the whole truth this leicester has always passed for an illegitimate son of mr gaunts father he resembled my husband in form stature and voice he had the gaunt mole and has often spoken of it by that name my husband forgave him many faults for no other reasonand i bought his wares and filled his pack for no other reasonthan this that he was my husbands brother by nature though not in law honi soit qui mal y pense ah that is a royal device yet how often in this business have the advisers of the crown forgotten it my lord and gentlemen of the jury i return from these conjectures to the indisputable facts of my defense mr gaunt may be alive or may be dead he was certainly alive on the fifteenth october and it lies on the crown to prove him dead and not on me to prove him alive but as for the body that forms the subject of this indictment it is the body of thomas leicester who was seen on the sixteenth october at one in the morning drunk and staggering and making for hernshaw bridge which leads to his mothers house and on all his former visits to hernshaw castle he went on to his mothers as i shall prove this time he never reached her as i shall prove but on his way to her did meet his death by the will of god and no fault of man or woman in hernshaw mere swear sarah leicester the judge i think you say you have several witnesses prisoner more than twenty my lord the judge we cannot possibly dispose of them this evening we will hear your evidence tomorrow prisoner this will enable you to consult with your legal advisers and let me urge upon you to prove if you can that mr gaunt has a sufficient motive for hiding and not answering mr atkins invitation to inherit a large estate some such proof is necessary to complete your defense and i am sorry to see you have made no mention of it in your address which was otherwise able prisoner my lord i think i can prove my own innocence without casting a slur upon my husband the judge you think when your life is at stake be not so mad as to leave so large a hole in your defense if you can mend it take advice he said this very solemnly then rose and left the court mrs gaunt was conveyed back to prison and there was soon prostrated by the depression that follows an unnatural excitement mr houseman found her on the sofa pale and dejected and clasping the gaolers wife convulsively who applied hartshorn to her nostrils he proved but a jobs comforter her defense creditable as it was to a novice seemed wordy and weak to him a lawyer and he was horrified at the admissions she had made in her place he would have admitted nothing he could not throughly explain he came to insist on a change of tactics when he saw her sad condition he tried to begin by consoling and encouraging her but his own serious misgivings unfitted him for this task and very soon notwithstanding the state she was in he was almost scolding her for being so mad as to withstand the judge and set herself against his advice there said he my lord kept his word and became counsel for you close that gap in your defense says he and you will very likely be acquitted nay says you i prefer to chance it what madness what injustice injustice to whom to whom why to yourself what may i not be unjust to myself certainly not you have no right to be unjust to anybody dont deceive yourself there is no virtue in this it is mere miserable weakness what right have you to peril an innocent life merely to screen the malefactor from just obloquy alas said mrs gaunt tis more than obloquy they will kill him they will brand him with a hot iron not unless he is indicted and who will indict him sir george neville must be got to muzzle the attorneygeneral and the lancashire jade will not move against him for you say they are living together of course they are and as you say why should i screen him but twill not serve who can combat prejudice if what i have said does not convince them an angels voice would not sir i am a catholic and they will hang me i shall die miserably having exposed my husband who loved me once oh so dearly i trifled with his love i deserve it all you will not die at all if you will only be good and obedient and listen to wiser heads i have subpoenaed caroline ryder as your witness and given her a hint how to escape an indictment for perjury you will find her supple as a glove call a rattlesnake for my witness i have drawn her fangs you will also call sir george neville to prove he saw gaunts picture at the packhorse and heard the other wifes tale wiltshire will object to this as evidence and say why dont you produce mercy vint herself then you will call me to prove that i sent the subpoena to mercy vint come now i cannot eat or sleep till you promise me mrs gaunt sighed deeply spare me said she i am worn out oh that i could die before the trial begins again houseman saw the signs of yielding and persisted come promise now said he then you will feel better i will do whatever you bid me said she only if they let me off i will go into a convent no power shall hinder me you shall go where you like except to the gallows enough tis a promise and i never knew you to break one how i can eat my supper you are a good obedient child and i am a happy attorney and i am the most miserable woman in all england child said the worthy lawyer your spirits have given way because they were strung so high you need repose go to bed now and sleep twelve hours believe me you will wake another woman ah would i could cried mrs gaunt with all the eloquence of despair houseman murmured a few more consoling words and then left her after once more exacting a promise that she would receive no more visits but go to bed directly she was to send all intruders to him at the angel mrs gaunt proceeded to obey his orders and though it was but eight oclock she made preparations for bed and then went to her nightly devotions she was in sore trouble and earthly trouble turns the heart heavenwards yet it was not so with her the deep languor that oppressed her seemed to have reached her inmost soul her beads falling one by one from her hand denoted the number of her supplications but for once they were preces sine mente dict her faith was cold her belief in divine justice was shaken for a time she began to doubt and to despond that bitter hour which david has sung so well and bunyan from experience has described in his biography as well as in his novel sat heavy upon her as it had on many a true believer before her so deep was the gloom so paralysing the languor that at last she gave up all endeavor to utter words of prayer she placed her crucifix at the foot of the wall and laid herself down on the ground and kissed his feet then drawing back gazed upon that effigy of the mortal sufferings of our redeemer o anima christiana respice vulnera patientis sanguinem morientis precem redemptions nostr she had lain thus a good halfhour when a gentle tap came to the door who is that said she mrs menteith the gaolers wife replied softly and asked leave to come in now this mrs menteith had been very kind to her and stoutly maintained her innocence mrs gaunt rose and invited her in madam said mrs menteith what i come for there is a person below who much desires to see you i beg to be excused was the reply he must go to my solicitor at the angel mr houseman mrs menteith retired with that message but in about five minutes returned to say that the young woman declined to go to mr houseman and begged hard to see mrs gaunt and dame said she if i were you id let her come in tis the honestest face and the tears in her soft eyes at your denying her oh dear dear said she i cannot tell my errand to any but her well well said mrs gaunt but what is her business if you ask me i think her business is your business come dame do see the poor thing she is civil spoken and she tells me she has come all the way out of lancashire o purpose mrs gaunt recoiled as if she had been stung from lancashire said she faintly ay madam said mrs menteith and that is a long road and a child upon her arm all the way poor thing her name said mrs gaunt sternly oh she is not ashamed of it she gave it me directly what has she the effrontery to take my name mrs menteith stared at her with utter amazement your name said she tis a simple country body and her name is vintmercy vint mrs gaunt was very much agitated and said she felt quite unequal to see a stranger well im sure i dont know what to do said mrs menteith she says she will lie at your door all night but she will see you tis the face of a friend she may know something it seems hard to thrust her and her child out into the street after their coming all the way from lancashire mrs gaunt stood silent awhile and her intelligence had a severe combat with her deep repugnance to be in the same room with griffith gaunts mistress so she considered her but a certain curiosity came to the aid of her good sense and after all she was a brave and haughty woman and her natural courage began to rise she thought to herself what dare she come to me all this way and shall i shrink from her she turned to mrs menteith with a bitter smile and she said very slowly and clenching her white teeth since you desire it and she insists on it i will receive mistress mercy vint mrs menteith went off and in about five minutes returned ushering in mercy vint in a hood and travellingcloak mrs gaunt received her standing and with a very formal curtsy to which mercy made a quiet obeisance and both women looked one another all over in a moment mrs menteith lingered to know what on earth this was all about but as neither spoke a word and their eyes were fixed on each other she divined that her absence was necessary and so retired slowly looking very much amazed at both of them chapter xii be seated mistress if you please said mrs gaunt with icy civility and let me know to what i owe this extraordinary visit i thank you dame said mercy for indeed i am sore fatigued she sat quietly down why i have come to you it was to serve you and to keep my word with george neville will you be kind enough to explain said mrs gaunt in a freezing tone and with a look of her great grey eye to match mercy felt chilled and was too frank to disguise it alas said she softly tis hard to be received so and me come all the way from lancashire with a heart like lead to do my duty god willing the tears stood in her eyes and her mellow voice was sweet and patient the gentle remonstrance was not quite without effect mrs gaunt colored a little she said stiffly excuse me if i seem discourteous but you and i ought not to be in one room a moment you do not see this apparently but at least i have a right to insist that such an interview shall be very brief and to the purpose oblige me then by telling me in plain terms why you have come hither madam to be your witness at the trial you to be my witness why not if i can clear you what would you rather be condemned for murder than let me show them you are innocent alas how you hate me hate you child said mrs gaunt coloring to her temples of course i hate you we are both of us flesh and blood and hate one another and one of us is honest enough and uncivil enough to say so speak for yourself dame replied mercy quietly for i hate you not and i thank god for it to hate is to be miserable id liever be hated than to hate mrs gaunt looked at her your words are goodly and wise said she your face is honest and your eyes are like a very doves but for all that you hate me quietly with all your heart human nature is human nature tis so but grace is grace mercy was silent a moment then resumed ill not deny i did hate you for a time when first i learned the man i had married had a wife and you were she we that be women are too unjust to each other and too indulgent to a man but i have worn out my hate i wrestled in prayer and the god of love he did quench my most unreasonable hate for twas the man betrayed me you never wronged me nor i you but you are right madam tis true that nature without grace is black as pitch the devil he was busy at my ear and whispered me if the fools in cumberland hang her what fault o thine thou wilt be his lawful wife and thy poor innocent child will be a child of shame no more but by gods grace i did defy him and i do defy him she rose swiftly from her chair and her doves eyes gleamed with celestial light get thee behind me satan i tell thee the hangman shall never have her innocent body nor thou my soul the movement was so unexpected the words and the look so simply noble that mrs gaunt rose too and gazed upon her visitor with astonishment and respectyet still with a dash of doubt she thought to herself if this creature is not sincere what a mistress of deceit she must be but mercy vint soon returned to her quiet self she sat down and said gravely and for the first time a little coldly as one who had deserved well and been received illmistress gaunt you are accused of murdering your husband tis false for two days ago i saw him alive what do you say cried mrs gaunt trembling all over be brave madam you have borne great trouble do not give way under joy he who has wronged us bothhe who wedded you under his own name of griffith gaunt and me under the false name of thomas leicester is no more dead than we are i saw him two days ago and spoke to him and persuaded him to come to carlisle town and do you justice mrs gaunt fell on her knees he is alive he is alive thank god oh thank god he is alive and god bless the tongue that tells me so god bless you eternally mercy vint the tears of joy streamed down her face and then mercys flowed too she uttered a little pathetic cry of joy ah she sobbed the bit of comfort i needed so has come to my heavy heart she has blessed me but she said this very softly and mrs gaunt was in a rapture and did not hear her is it a dream my husband alive and you the one to come and tell me so how unjust i have been to you forgive me why does he not come himself mercy colored at this question and hesitated well dame said she for one thing he has been on the fuddle for the last two months on the fuddle ay he owns he has never been sober a whole day and that takes the heart out of a man as well as the brains and then he has got it into his head that you will never forgive him and that he shall be cast in prison if he shows his face in cumberland why in cumberland more than in lancashire asked mrs gaunt biting her lip mercy blushed faintly she replied with some delicacy but did not altogether mince the matter he knows i shall never punish him for what he has done to me why not i begin to think he has wronged you almost as much as he has me worse madam worse he has robbed me of my good name you are still his lawful wife and none can point the finger at you but look at me i was an honest girl respected by all the parish what has he made of me the man that lay a dying in my house and i saved his life and so my heart did warm to him he blasphemed gods altar to deceive and betray me and here i am a poor forlorn creature neither maid wife nor widow with a child on my arms that i do nothing but cry over ay my poor innocent i left thee down below because i was ashamed she should see thee all me ah me she lifted up her voice and wept mrs gaunt looked at her wistfully and like mercy before her had a bitter struggle with human nature a struggle so sharp that in the midst of it she burst out crying with strange violence but with that burst her great soul conquered she darted out of the room leaving mercy astonished at her abrupt departure mercy was patiently drying her eyes when the door opened and judge her surprise when she saw mrs gaunt glide into the room with her little boy asleep in her arms and an expression upon her face more sublime than anything mercy vint had ever yet seen on earth she kissed the babe softly and becoming infantine as well as angelic by this contact sat herself down in a moment on the floor with him and held out her hand to mercy there said she come sit beside us and see how i hate him no more than you dosweet innocent they looked him all over discussed his every feature learnedly kissed his limbs and extremities after the manner of their sex and comprehending at last that to have been both of them wronged by one man was a bond of sympathy not hate the two wives of griffith gaunt laid his child across their two laps and wept over him together mercy vint took herself to task i am but a selfish woman said she to talk or think of anything but that i came here for she then proceeded to show mrs gaunt by what means she proposed to secure her acquittal without getting griffith gaunt into trouble mrs gaunt listened with keen and grateful attention until she came to that part then she interrupted her eagerly dont spare him for me in your place id trounce the villain finely ay said mercy and then forgive him but i am different i shall never forgive him but i am a poor hand at punishing and revenging i always was my name is mercy you know to tell the truth i was to have been called prudence after my good aunt but she said nay she had lived to hear greed and selfishness and a heap of faults named prudence call the child something that means what it does mean and not after me quoth she so with me hearing mercy mercy called out after me so many years i do think the quality hath somehow got under my skin for i cant abide to see folk smart let alone to strike the blow what shall i take the place of god and punish the evildoers because tis me they wrong nay dame i will never punish him though he hath wronged me cruelly all i shall do is to think very ill of him and shun him and tear his memory out of my heart you look at me do you think i cannot you dont know me i am very resolute when i see clear of course i loved him loved him dearly he was like a husband to me and a kind one but the moment i knew how basely he had deceived us both my heart began to turn against the man and now tis ice to him heaven knows what i am made of for believe me id liever ten times be beside you than beside him my heart it lay like a lump of lead till i heard your story and found i could do you a good turn you that he had wronged as well as me i read your beautiful eyes but nay fear me not im not the woman to pine for the fruit that is my neighbors all i ask for on earth is a few kind words and looks from you you are gentle and i am simple but we are both one flesh and blood and your lovely wet eyes do prove it this moment dame gauntkatei neer was ten miles from home afore and i am come all this weary way to serve thee oh give me the one thing that can do me good in this world the one thing i pine fora little of your love the words were scarce out of her lips when mrs gaunt caught her impetuously round the neck with both hands and laid her on that erring but noble heart of hers and kissed her eagerly they kissed one another again and again and wept over one another and now mrs gaunt who did nothing by halves could not make enough of mercy vint she ordered supper and ate with her to make her eat mrs menteith offered mercy a bed but mrs gaunt said she must lie with her she and her child what said she think you ill let you out of my sight alas who knows when you and i shall ever be together again i know said mercy very gravely in this worldnever they slept in one bed and held each other by the hand all night and talked to one another and in the morning knew each the others story and each the others mind and character better than their oldest acquaintances knew either the one or the other chapter xiii the trial began again and the court was crowded to suffocation all eyes were bent on the prisoner she rose calm and quiet and begged leave to say a few words to the court mr whitworth objected to that she had concluded her address yesterday and called a witness prisoner but i have not examined a witness yet the judge you come somewhat out of time madam but if you will be brief we will hear you prisoner i thank you my lord it was only to withdraw an error the cry for help that was heard by the side of hernshaw mere i said yesterday that cry was uttered by thomas leicester well i find i was mistaken the cry for help was uttered by my husband by that griffith gaunt i am accused of assassinating this extraordinary admission caused a great sensation in court the judge looked grave and sad and sergeant wiltshire who came into court just then whispered his junior she has put the rope round her own neck the jury would never have believed our witness the prisoner i will only add that a person came into the town last night who knows a great deal more about this mysterious business than i do i purpose therefore to alter the plan of my defense and to save your time my lord who have dealt so courteously with me i shall call but a single witness ere the astonishment caused by this sudden collapse of the defense was in any degree abated she called mercy vint there was the usual stir and struggle and then the calm selfpossessed face and figure of a comely young woman confronted the court she was sworn and examined by the prisoner after this fashion where do you live at the packhorse near allerton in lancashire prisoner do you know mr griffith gaunt mercy madam i do prisoner was he at your place in october last mercy yes madam on the thirteenth of october on that day he left for cumberland prisoner on foot or on horseback mercy on horseback prisoner with boots on or shoes mercy he had a pair of new boots on prisoner do you know thomas leicester mercy a pedlar called at our house on the eleventh of october and he said his name was thomas leicester prisoner how was he shod mercy in hobnailed shoes prisoner which way went he on leaving you mercy madam he went northwards i know no more for certain prisoner when did you see mr gaunt last mercy four days ago the judge what is that you saw him alive four days ago mercy ay my lord the last wednesday that ever was at this the people burst out into a loud agitated murmur and their heads went to and fro all the time in vain the crier cried and threatened the noise rose and surged and took its course it went down gradually as amazement gave way to curiosity and then there was a remarkable silence and then the silvery voice of the prisoner and the mellow tones of the witness appeared to penetrate the very walls of the building each syllable of those two beautiful speakers was heard so distinctly prisoner be so good as to tell the court what passed on wednesday last between griffith gaunt and you relative to this charge of murder mercy i let him know one george neville had come from cumberland in search of him and had told me you lay in carlisle gaol charged with his murder i did urge him to ride at once to carlisle and show himself but he refused he made light of the matter then i told him not so the circumstances looked ugly and your life was in peril then he said nay twas in no peril for if you were to be found guilty then he would show himself on the instant then i told him he was not worthy the name of a man and if he would not go i would go you by all means said he and ill give you a writing that will clear her jack houseman will be there that knows my hand and so does the sheriff and half the grand jury at the least prisoner have you that writing mercy to be sure i have here tis prisoner be pleased to read it the judge stay a minute shall you prove it to be his handwriting prisoner ay my lord by as many as you please the judge then let that stand over for the present let me see it it was handed up to him and he showed it to the sheriff who said he thought it was griffith gaunts writing the paper was then read out to the jury it ran as follows know all men that i griffith gaunt esq of bolton hall and hernshaw castle in the county of cumberland am alive and well and the matter which has so puzzled the good folk in cumberland befell as followsi left hernshaw castle in the dead of night upon the fifteenth of october why is no mans business but mine i found the stable locked so i left my horse and went on foot i crossed hernshaw mere by the bridge and had got about a hundred yards as i suppose on the way when i heard some one fall with a great splash into the mere and soon after cry dolefully for help i that am no swimmer ran instantly to the north side to a clump of trees where a boat used always to be kept but the boat was not there then i cried lustily for help and as no one came i fired my pistol and cried murder for i had heard men will come sooner to that cry than to any other but in truth i was almost out of my wits that a fellowcreature should perish miserably so near me whilst i ran wildly to and fro some came out of the castle bearing torches by this time i was at the bridge but saw no signs of the drowning man yet the night was clear then i knew that his fate was sealed and for reasons of my own not choosing to be seen by those who were coming to his aid i hastened from the place my happiness being gone and my conscience smiting me sore and not knowing whither to turn i took to drink and fell into bad ways and lived like a brute and not a man for six weeks or more so that i never knew of the good fortune that had fallen on me when least i deserved it i mean by old mr gaunt of coggleswade making of me his heir but one day at kendal i saw mercy vints advertisement and i went to her and learned that my wife lay in carlisle gaol for my supposed murder but i say that she is innocent and nowise to blame in this matter for i deserved every hard word she ever gave me and as for killing she is a spirited woman with her tongue but hath not the heart to kill a fly she is what she always was the pearl of womankind a virtuous innocent and noble lady i have lost the treasure of her love by my fault not hers but at least i have a right to defend her life and honour whoever molests her after this out of pretended regard for me is a liar and a fool and no friend of mine but my enemy and i histo the death griffith gaunt it was a day of surprises this tribute from the murdered man to his assassin was one of them people looked in one anothers faces openeyed the prisoner looked in the judges and acted on what she saw there that is my defense said she quietly and sat down if a show of hands had been called at that moment she would have been acquitted by acclamation but mr whitworth was a zealous young barrister burning for distinction he stuck to his case and crossexamined mercy vint with severity indeed with asperity whitworth what are you to receive for this evidence mercy anan whitworth oh you know what i mean are you not to be paid for telling us this romance mercy hay sir i ask nought for telling of the truth whitworth you were in the prisoners company yesterday mercy yes sir i did visit her in the gaol last night whitworth and there concerted this ingenious defense mercy well sir for that matter i told her that her man was alive and i did offer to be her witness whitworth for nought mercy for no money or reward if tis that you mean why tis a joy beyond money to clear an innocent body and save her life and that satisfaction is mine this day whitworth sarcastically these are very fine sentiments for a person in your condition confess that mrs gaunt primed you with all that mercy nay sir i left home in that mind else i had not come at all bethink you tis a long journey for one in my way of life and this dear child on my arm all the way mrs gaunt sat boiling with indignation but mercys good temper and meekness parried the attack that time mr whitworth changed his line whitworth you ask the jury to believe that griffith gaunt esquire a gentleman and a man of spirit and honor is alive yet skulks and sends you hither when by showing his face in this court he could clear his wife without a single word spoken mercy yes sir i do hope to be believed for i speak the naked truth but with due respect to you mr gaunt did not send me hither against my will i could not bide in lancashire and let an innocent woman be murdered in cumberland whitworth murdered quotha that is a good jest id have you to know we punish murders here not do them mercy i am glad to hear that sir on the ladys account whitworth come come you pretend you discovered this griffith gaunt alive by means of an advertisement if so produce the advertisement mercy vint colored and cast a swift uneasy glance at mrs gaunt rapid as it was the keen eye of the counsel caught it nay do not look to the culprit for orders said he produce it or confess the truth come you never advertised for him sir i did advertise for him then produce the advertisement sir i will not said mercy calmly then i shall move the court to commit you for what offense if you please for perjury and contempt of court i am guiltless of either god knows but i will not show the advertisement the judge this is very extraordinary perhaps you have it not about you mercy my lord the truth is i have it in my bosom but if i show it it will not make this matter one whit clearer and twill open the wounds of two poor women tis not for myself but oh my lord look at her hath she not gone through grief enow the appeal was made with a quiet touching earnestness that affected every hearer but the judge had a duty to perform witness said he you mean well but indeed you do the prisoner an injury by withholding this paper be good enough to produce it at once the prisoner with a deep sigh obey my lord mercy with a deep sigh there sir may the lord forgive you the useless mischief you are doing whitworth i am doing my duty young woman and yours is to tell the whole truth and not a part only mercy acquiescing that is true sir whitworth why what is this this not mr gaunt you advertise for in these papers tis thomas leicester the judge what is that i dont understand whitworth nor i neither the judge let me see the papers tis thomas leicester sure enough whitworth and you mean to swear that griffith gaunt answered an advertisement inviting thomas leicester mercy i do thomas leicester was the name he went by in our part whitworth what what you are jesting mercy is this a place or a time for jesting i say he called himself thomas leicester here the business was interrupted again by a multitudinous murmur of excited voices everybody was whispering astonishment to his neighbor and the whisper of a great crowd has the effect of a loud murmur whitworth oh he called himself thomas leicester did he then what makes you say he is griffith gaunt mercy well sir the pedlar whose real name was thomas leicester came to our house one day and saw his picture and knew it and said something to a neighbor that raised my suspicions when he came home i took this shirt out of a drawer twas the shirt he wore when he first came to us tis marked g g the shirt was examined said i for gods sake speak the truth what does g g stand for then he told me his real name was griffith gaunt and he had a wife in cumberland go back to her said i and ask her to forgive you then he rode north and i never saw him again till last wednesday whitworth satirically you seem to have been mighty intimate with this thomas leicester whom you now call griffith gaunt may i ask what was or is the nature of your connection with him mercy was silent whitworth i must press for a reply that we may know what value to attach to your most extraordinary evidence were you his wifeor his mistress mercy indeed i hardly know but not his mistress or i should not be here whitworth you dont know whether you were married to the man or not mercy i do not say so but she hesitated and cast a piteous look at mrs gaunt who sat boiling with indignation at this look the prisoner who had long contained herself with difficulty rose with scarlet cheeks and flashing eyes in defense of her witness and flung her prudence to the wind fie sir she cried the woman you insult is as pure as your own mother or mine she deserves the pity the respect the veneration of all good men know my lord that my miserable husband deceived and married her under the false name he had taken she has the marriage certificate in her bosom pray make her show it whether she will or not my lord this mercy vint is more an angel than a woman i am her rival after a manner yet out of the goodness and greatness of her noble heart she came all that way to save me from an unjust death and is such a woman to be insulted i blush for the hired advocate who cannot see his superior in an incorruptible witness a creature all truth piety purity unselfishness and goodness yes sir you began by insinuating that she was as venal as yourself for you are one that can be bought by the first comer and now you would cast a slur on her chastity for shame for shame this is one of those rare women that adorn our whole sex and embellish human nature and so long as you have the privilege of exchanging words with her i shall stand here on the watch to see that you treat her with due respect ay sir with reverence for i have measured you both and she is as much your superior as she is mine this amazing burst was delivered with such prodigious fire and rapidity that nobody was selfpossessed enough to stop it in time it was like a furious gust of words sweeping over the court mr whitworth pale with auger merely said madam the good taste of these remarks i leave the court to decide upon but you cannot be allowed to give evidence in your own defense no but in hers i will said mrs gaunt no power shall hinder me the judge coldly had you not better go on crossexamining the witness whitworth let me see your marriage certificate if you have one it was handed to him well now how do you know that this thomas leicester was griffith gaunt the judge why she has told you he confessed it to her mercy yes my lord and besides he wrote me two letters signed thomas leicester here they are and i desire they may be compared with the paper he wrote last wednesday and signed griffith gaunt and more than that whilst we lived together as man and wife one hamilton a travelling painter took our portraits his and mine i have brought his with me let his friends and neighbors look on this portrait and say whose likeness it is what i say and swear is that on wednesday last i saw and spoke with that thomas leicester or griffith gaunt whose likeness i now show you with that she lifted the portrait up and showed it to all the court instantly there was a roar of recognition it was one of those hard daubs that are nevertheless so monstrously like the originals the judge to mr whitworth young gentleman we are all greatly obliged to you you have made the prisoners case there was but one weak point in it i mean the prolonged absence of griffith gaunt you have now accounted for that you have forced a very truthful witness to depose that this gaunt is himself a criminal and is hiding from fear of the law the case for the crown is a mere tissue of conjectures on which no jury could safely convict even if there was no defense at all under other circumstances i might decline to receive evidence at second hand that griffith gaunt is alive but here such evidence is sufficient for it lies on the crown to prove the man dead but you have only proved that he was alive on the fifteenth of october and that since then somebody is dead with shoes on this somebody appears on the balance of proof to be thomas leicester the pedlar and he has never been heard of since and griffith gaunt has then i say you cannot carry the case farther you have not a leg to stand on what say you brother wiltshire wiltshire my lord i think there is no case against the prisoner and am thankful to your lordship for relieving me of a very unpleasant task the question of guilty or not guilty was then put as a matter of form to the jury who instantly brought the prisoner in not guilty the judge catherine gaunt you leave this court without a stain and with our sincere respect and sympathy i much regret the fear and pain you have been put to you have been terribly punished for a hasty word profit now by this bitter lesson and may heaven enable you to add a wellgoverned spirit to your many virtues and graces he half rose from his seat and bowed courteously to her she curtsied reverently and retired he then said a few words to mercy vint young woman i have no words to praise you as you deserve you have shown us the beauty of the female character and let me add the beauty of the christian religion you have come a long way to clear the innocent i hope you will not stop there but also punish the guilty person on whom we have wasted so much pity me my lord said mercy i would not harm a hair of his head for as many guineas as there be hairs in mine child said my lord thou art too good for this world but go thy ways and god bless thee thus abruptly ended a trial that at first had looked so formidable for the accused the judge now retired for some refreshment and while he was gone sir george neville dashed up to the town hall four in hand and rushed in by the magistrates door with a pedlars pack which he had discovered in the mere a few yards from the spot where the mutilated body was found he learned the prisoner was already acquitted he left the pack with the sheriff and begged him to show it to the judge and went in search of mrs gaunt he found her in the gaolers house she and mercy vint were seated hand in hand he started at first sight of the latter there was a universal shaking of hands and glistening of eyes and when this was over mrs gaunt turned to him and said piteously she will go back to lancashire tomorrow nothing i can say will turn her no dame said mercy quietly cumberland is no place for me my work is done here our paths in this world do lie apart george neville persuade her to go home at once and not trouble about me indeed madam said sir george she speaks wisely she always does my carriage is at the door and the people waiting by thousands in the street to welcome your deliverance mrs gaunt drew herself up with fiery and bitter disdain are they so said she grimly then ill baulk them ill steal away in the dead of night no miserable populace that howls and hisses with the strong against the weak you shall have no part in my triumph tis sacred to my friends you honoured me with your hootings you shall not disgrace me with your acclamations here i stay till mercy vint my guardian angel leaves me for ever she then requested sir george to order his horses hack to the inn and the coachman was to hold himself in readiness to start when the whole town should be asleep meantime a courier was despatched to hernshaw castle to prepare for mrs gaunts reception mrs menteith made a bed up for mercy vint and at midnight when the coast was clear came the parting it was a sad one even mercy who had great selfcommand could not then restrain her tears to apply the sweet and touching words of scripture they sorrowed most of all for this that they should see each others face no more sir george accompanied mrs gaunt to hernshaw she drew back into her corner of the carriage and was very silent and distrait after one or two attempts at conversation he judged it wisest and even most polite to respect her mood at last she burst out i cannot bear it i cannot bear it why what is amiss inquired sir george what is amiss why tis all amiss tis so heartless so ungrateful to let that poor angel go home to lancashire all alone now she has served my turn sir george do not think i undervalue your company but if you would but take her home instead of taking me poor thing she is brave but when the excitement of her good action is over and she goes back the weary road all alone what desolation it will be my heart bleeds for her i know i am an unconscionable woman to ask such a thing but then you are a true chevalier you always were and you saw her merit directly oh do pray leave me to slip unnoticed into hernshaw castle and do you accompany my benefactress to her humble home will you dear sir george twould be such a load off my heart to this appeal uttered with trembling lip and moist eyes sir george replied in character he declined to desert mrs gaunt until he had seen her safe home but that done he would ride back to carlisle and escort mercy home mrs gaunt sighed and said she was abusing his friendship and should kill him with fatigue and he was a good creature if anything could make me easy this would said she you know how to talk to a woman and comfort her i wish i was a man id cure her of griffith before we reached the packhorse and now i think of it you are a very happy man to travel eighty miles with an angel a doveeyed angel i am a happy man to have an opportunity of complying with your desires madam was the demure reply tis not often you do me the honor to lay your orders on me after this nothing of any moment passed until they reached hernshaw castle and then as they drove up to the door and saw the hall blazing with lights mrs gaunt laid her hand softly on sir george and whispered you were right i thank you for not leaving me the servants were all in the hall to receive their mistress and amongst them were those who had given honest but unfavorable testimony at the trial being called by the crown these had consulted together and after many pros and cons had decided that they had better not follow their natural impulse and hide from her face since that might be a fresh offense accordingly these witnesses dressed in their best stood with the others in the hall and made their obeisances quaking inwardly mrs gaunt entered the hall leaning on sir georges arm she scarcely bestowed a look upon the late witnesses for the crown but made them one sweeping curtsy in return and passed on only sir george felt her taper fingers just nip his arm she made him partake of some supper and then this chevalier des dames rode home snatched a few hours sleep put on the yeomans suit in which he had first visited the packhorse and arriving at carlisle engaged the whole inside of the coach for his orders were to console and he did not see his way clear to do that with two or three strangers listening to every word chapter xiv a great change was observable in mrs gaunt after this fiery and chastening ordeal in a short time she had been taught many lessons she had learned that the law will not allow even a woman to say anything and everything with impunity she had been in a court of justice and seen how gravely soberly and fairly an accusation is sifted there and if false annihilated which elsewhere it never is member of a sex that could never have invented a court of justice she had found something to revere and bless in that other sex to which her erring husband belonged finally she had encountered in mercy vint a woman whom she recognised at once as her moral superior the contact of that pure and wellgoverned spirit told wonderfully upon her she began to watch her tongue and to bridle her high spirit she became slower to give offense and slower to take it she took herself to task and made some little excuses even for griffith she was resolved to retire from the world altogether but meantime she bowed her head to the lessons of adversity her features always lovely but somewhat too haughty were now softened and embellished beyond description by a mingled expression of grief humility and resignation she never mentioned her husband but it is not to be supposed she never thought of him she waited the course of events in dignified and patient silence as for griffith gaunt he was in the hands of two lawyers atkins and houseman he waited on the first and made a friend of him i am at your service said he but not if i am to be indicted for bigamy and burned in the hand these fears are idle said atkins mercy vint declared in open court she will not proceed against you ay but theres my wife she will keep quiet i have housemans word for it ay but theres the attorneygeneral oh he will not move unless he is driven we must use a little influence mr houseman is of my mind and he has the ear of the county to be brief it was represented in high quarters that to indict mr gaunt would only open mrs gaunts wounds afresh and do no good and so houseman found means to muzzle the attorneygeneral just three weeks after the trial griffith gaunt esq reappeared publicly the place of his reappearance was coggleswade he came and set about finishing his new mansion with feverish rapidity he engaged an army of carpenters and painters and spent thousands of pounds on the decorating and furnishing of the mansion and laying out the grounds this was duly reported to mrs gaunt who saidnot a word but at last one day came a letter to mrs gaunt in griffiths wellknown handwriting with all her acquired selfpossession her hand trembled as she broke open the seal it contained but these words madami do not ask you to forgive me for if you had done what i have i could never forgive you but for the sake of rose and to stop their tongues i do hope you will do me the honor to live under this my roof i dare not face hernshaw castle your own apartments here are now ready for you the place is large upon my honor i will not trouble you but show myself always as now your penitent and very humble servant griffith gaunt the messenger was to wait for her reply this letter disturbed mrs gaunts sorrowful tranquillity at once she was much agitated and so undecided that she sent the messenger away and told him to call next day then she sent off to father francis to beg his advice but her courier returned late at night to say father francis was away from home then she took rose and said to her my darling papa wants us to go to his new house and leave dear old hernshaw i know not what to say about that what do you say tell him to come to us said bose dictatorially only lowering her little voice very suddenly if he is naughty and wont why then we had better go to him for he amuses me as you please said mrs gaunt and sent her husband this reply sirrose and i are agreed to defer to your judgment and obey your wishes be pleased to let me know what day you will require us and i must trouble you to send a carriage i am sir your faithful wife and humble servant catherine gaunt at the appointed day a carriage and four came wheeling up to the door the vehicle was gorgeously emblazoned and the servants in rich liveries all which finery glittering in the sun and the glossy coats of the horses did mightily please mistress rose she stood on the stone steps and clapped her hands with delight her mother just sighed and said ay tis in pomp and show we must seek our happiness now she leaned back in the carriage and closed her eyes yet not so close but now and then a tear would steal out as she thought of the past they drove up under an avenue to a noble mansion and landed at the foot of some marble steps low and narrow but of vast breadth as they mounted these a hall door through which the carriage could have passed was flung open and discovered the servants all drawn up to do honor to their mistress she entered the hall leading rose by the hand the servants bowed and curtsied down to the ground she received this homage with dignified courtesy and her eye stole round to see if the master of the house was coming to receive her the library door was opened hastily and out came to meet herfather francis welcome madam a thousand times welcome to your new home said he in a stentorian voice with a double infusion of geniality i claim the honour of showing you your part of the house though tis all yours for that matter and he led the way now this cheerful stentorian voice was just a little shaky for once and his eyes were moist mrs gaunt noticed but said nothing before the people she smiled graciously and accompanied him he took her to her apartments they consisted of a sallemanger three delightful bedrooms a boudoir and a magnificent drawingroom fifty feet long with two fireplaces and a baywindow thirty feet wide filled with the choicest flowers an exclamation of delight escaped mrs gaunt then she said one would think i was a queen then she sighed ah said she tis a fine thing to be rich then despondently tell him i think it very beautiful nay madam i hope you will tell him so yourself mrs gaunt made no reply to that she added and it was kind of him to have you here the first day i do not feel so lonely as i should without you she took griffith at his word and lived with rose in her own apartments for some time griffith used to slip away whenever saw her coming one day she caught him at it and beckoned him he came to her you need not run away from me said she i did not come into your house to quarrel with you let us he friends and she gave him her hand sweetly enough but oh so coldly i hope for nothing more said griffith if you ever have a wish give me the pleasure of gratifying itthat is all i wish to retire to a convent said she quietly and desert your daughter i would leave her behind to remind you of days gone by by degrees they saw a little more of one another they even dined together now and then but it brought them no nearer there was no anger with its loving reaction they were friendly enough but an icy barrier stood between them one person set himself quietly to sap this barrier father francis was often at the castle and played the peacemaker very adroitly the line he took might be called the innocent jesuitical he saw that it would be useless to exhort these two persons to ignore the terrible things that happened and to make it up as if it was only a squabble what he did was to repeat to the husband every gracious word the wife let fall and vice versa and to suppress all either said that might tend to estrange them in short he acted the part of mr harmony in the play and acted it to perfection gutta cavat lapidem though no perceptible effect followed his efforts yet there is no doubt that he got rid of some of the bitterness but the coldness remained one day he was sent for all in a hurry by griffith he found him looking gloomy and agitated the cause came out directly griffith had observed at last what all the females in the house had seen two months ago that mrs gaunt was in the familyway he now communicated this to father francis with a voice of agony and looks to match all the better my son said the genial priest twill be another tie between you i hope it will be a fine boy to inherit your estates then observing a certain hideous expression distorting griffiths face he fixed his eyes full on him and said sternly are you not cured yet of that madness of yours no no no said griffith deprecatingly but why did she not tell me you had better ask her not i she will remind me i am nothing to her now and though tis so yet i would not hear it from her lips in spite of this wise resolution the torture he was in drove him to remonstrate with her on her silence she blushed high and excused herself as follows i should have told you as soon as i knew it myself but you were not with me i was all by myselfin carlisle gaol this reply uttered with hypocritical meekness went through griffith like a knife he turned white and gasped for breath but said nothing he left her with a deep groan and never ventured to mention the matter again all he did in that direction was to redouble his attentions and solicitude for her health the relation between these two was now more anomalous than ever even father francis who had seen strange things in families used to watch mrs gaunt rise from table and walk heavily to the door and her husband dart to it and open it obsequiously and receive only a very formal reverence in returnand wonder how all this was to end however under this icy surface a change was gradually going on and one afternoon to his great surprise mrs gaunts maid came to ask griffith if he would come to mrs gaunts apartment he found her seated in her bay window among her flowers she seemed another woman all of a sudden and smiled on him her exquisite smile of days gone by come sit beside me said she in this beautiful window that you have given me sit beside you kate said griffith nay let me kneel at your knees that is my place as you will said she softly and continued in the same tone now listen to me you and i are two fools we have been very happy together in days gone by and we should both of us like to try again but we neither of us know how to begin you are afraid to tell me you love me and i am ashamed to own to you or anybody else that i love you in spite of it alli do though you love me a wretch like me kate tis impossible i cannot be so happy child said mrs gaunt love is not reason love is not common sense tis a passion like your jealousy poor fool i love you as a mother loves her child all the more for all you have made me suffer i might not say as much if i thought we should be long together but something tells me i shall die this time i never felt so before i want you to bury me at hernshaw after all i spent more happy years there than most wives ever know i see you are very sorry for what you have done how could i die and leave thee in doubt of my forgiveness and my love kiss me poor jealous fool for i do forgive thee and love thee with all my sorrowful heart and even with the words she bowed herself and sank quietly into his arms and he kissed her and cried bitterly over her bitterly but she was comparatively calm for she said to herself the end is at hand griffith instead of poohpoohing his wifes forebodings set himself to baffle them he used his wealth freely and besides the county doctor had two very eminent practitioners from london one of whom was a greyheaded man the other singularly young for the fame he had obtained but then he was a genuine enthusiast in his art chapter xv griffith white as a ghost and unable to shake off the forebodings catherine had communicated to him walked incessantly up and down the room and at his earnest request one or other of the four doctors in attendance was constantly coming to him with information the case proceeded favorably and to griffiths surprise and joy a healthy boy was born about two oclock in the morning the mother was reported rather feverish but nothing to cause alarm griffith threw himself on two chairs and fell fast asleep towards morning lie found himself shaken and there was ashley the young doctor standing beside him with a very grave face griffith started up and cried what is wrong in gods name i am sorry to say there has been a sudden hemorrhage and the patient is much exhausted she is dying she is dying cried griffith in anguish not dying but she will infallibly sink unless some unusual circumstance occur to sustain vitality griffith laid hold of him oh sir take my whole fortune but save her save her save her mr gaunt said the young doctor be calm or you will make matters worse there is one chance to save her but my professional brethren are prejudiced against it however they have consented at my earnest request to refer my proposal to you she is sinking for want of blood if you consent to my opening a vein and transfusing healthy blood from a living subject into hers i will undertake the operation you had better come and see her you will be more able to judge let me lean on you said griffith and the strong wrestler went tottering up the stairs there they showed him poor kate white as the bedclothes breathing hard and with a pulse that hardly moved griffith looked at her horrorstruck death has got hold of my darling he screamed snatch her away for gods sake snatch her from him the young doctor whipped off his coat and bared his arm there he cried mr gaunt consents now come be quick with the lancet and hold this tube as i tell you warm it first in that water here came an interruption griffith gaunt griped the young doctors arm and with an agonized and ugly expression of countenance cried out what your blood what right have you to lose blood for her the right of a man who loves his art better than his blood cried ashley with enthusiasm griffith tore off his coat and waistcoat and bared his arm to the elbow take every drop i have no mans blood shall enter her veins but mine and the creature seemed to swell to double his size as with flushed cheek and sparkling eyes he held out a bare arm corded like a blacksmiths and white as a duchesss the young doctor eyed the magnificent limb a moment with rapture then fixed his apparatus and performed an operation which then as now was impossible in theory only he did it he sent some of griffith gaunts bright red blood smoking hot into kate gaunts veins this done he watched his patient closely and administered stimulants from time to time she hung between life and death for hours but at noon next day she spoke and seeing griffith sitting beside her pale with anxiety and loss of blood she said my dear do not thou fret i died last night i knew i should but they gave me another life and now i shall live to a hundred they showed her the little boy and at sight of him the whole woman made up her mind to live and live she did and what is very remarkable her convalescence was more rapid than on any former occasion it was from a talkative nurse she first learned that griffith had given his blood for her she said nothing at the time but lay with an angelic happy smile thinking of it the first time she saw him after that she laid her hand on his arm and looking heaven itself into his eyes she said my life is very dear to me now tis a present from thee she wanted a good excuse for loving him as frankly as before and now he had given her one she used to throw it in his teeth in the prettiest way whenever she confessed a fault she was sure to turn slyly round and say but what could one expect of me i have his blood in my veins but once she told father francis quite seriously that she had never been quite the same woman since she lived by griffiths blood she was turned jealous and moreover it had given him a fascinating power over her and she could tell blindfold when he was in the room which last fact indeed she once proved by actual experiment but all this i leave to such as study the occult sciences in this profound age of ours starting with this advantage time the great curer gradually healed a wound that looked incurable mrs gaunt became a better wife than she had ever been before she studied her husband and found he was not hard to please she made his home bright and genial and so he never went abroad for the sunshine he could have at home and he studied her he added a chapel to the house and easily persuaded francis to become the chaplain thus they had a peacemaker and a friend in the house and a man severe in morals but candid in religion and an inexhaustible companion to them and their children and so after that terrible storm this pair pursued the even tenour of a peaceful united life till the olive branches rising around them and the happy years gliding on almost obliterated that one dark passage and made it seem a mere fantastical incredible dream mercy vint and her child went home in the coach it was empty at starting and as mrs gaunt had foretold a great sense of desolation fell upon her she leaned back and the patient tears coursed steadily down her comely cheeks at the first stage a passenger got down from the outside and entered the coach what george neville said mercy the same said he she expressed her surprise that he should be going her way tis strange said he but to me most agreeable and to me too for that matter said she sir george observed her eyes were red and to divert her mind and keep up her spirits launched into a flow of small talk in the midst of it mercy leaned back in the coach and began to cry bitterly so much for that mode of consolation upon this he faced the situation and begged her not to grieve he praised the good action she had done and told her how everybody admired her for it especially himself at that she gave him her hand in silence and turned away her pretty head he carried her hand respectfully to his lips and his manly heart began to yearn over this suffering virtue so grave so dignified so meek he was no longer a young man he began to talk to her like a friend this tone and the soft sympathetic voice in which a gentleman speaks to a woman in trouble unlocked her heart and for the first time in her life she was led to talk about herself she opened her heart to him she told him she was not the woman to pine for any man her youth her health and love of occupation would carry her through what she mourned was the loss of esteem and the blot upon her child at that she drew the baby with inexpressible tenderness and yet with a half defiant air closer to her bosom sir george assured her she would lose the esteem of none but fools as for me said he i always respected you but now i revere you you are a martyr and an angel george said mercy gravely be you my friend not my enemy why madam said he sure you cant think me such a wretch i mean our flatterers are our enemies sir george took the hint given as it was very gravely and decidedly and henceforth showed her his respect by his acts he paid her as much attention as if she had been a princess he handed her out and handed her in and coaxed her to eat here and to drink there and at the inn where the passengers slept for the night he showed his long purse and secured her superior comforts console her he could not but he broke the sense of utter desolation and loneliness with which she started from carlisle she told him so in the inn and descanted on the goodness of god who had sent her a friend in that bitter hour you have been very kind to me george said she now heaven bless you for it and give you many happy days and well spent this from one who never said a word she did not mean sank deep into sir georges heart and he went to sleep thinking of her and asking himself was there nothing he could do for her next morning sir george handed mercy and her babe into the coach and the villain tried an experiment to see what value she set on him he did not get in so mercy thought she had seen the last of him farewell good kind george said she alas theres nought but meeting and parting in this weary world the tears stood in her sweet eyes and she thanked him not with words only but with the soft pressure of her womanly hand he slipped up behind the coach and was ashamed of himself and his heart warmed to her more and more as soon as the coach stopped my lord opened the door for mercy to alight her eyes were very red he saw that she started and beamed with surprise and pleasure why i thought i had lost you for good said she whither are you going to lancaster not quite so far i am going to the packhorse mercy opened her eyes and blushed high sir george saw and to divert her suspicions told her merrily to beware of making objections i am only a sort of servant in the matter twas mrs gaunt ordered me i might have guessed it said mercy bless her she knew i should be lonely she was not easy till she had got rid of me i assure you said sir george so let us make the best ont for she is a lady that likes to have her own way she is a noble creature george i shall never regret anything i have done for her and she will not be ungrateful oh the sting of ingratitude i have felt that have you no said sir george i have escaped that by never doing any good actions i doubt you are telling me a lie said mercy vint she now looked upon sir george as mrs gaunts representative and prattled freely to him only now and then her trouble came over her and then she took a quiet cry without ceremony as for sir george he sat and studied and wondered at her never in his life had he met such a woman as this who was as candid with him as if he had been a woman she seemed to have a window in her bosom through which he looked and saw the pure and lovely soul within in the afternoon they reached a little town whence a cart conveyed them to the packhorse here mercy vint disappeared and busied herself with sir georges comforts he sat by himself in the parlor and missed his gentle companion in the morning mercy thought of course he would go but instead of that he stayed and followed her about and began to court her downright but the warmer he got the cooler she and at last she said mighty drily this is a very dull place for the likes of you tis the sweetest place in england said he at least to me for it containsthe woman i love mercy drew back and colored rosy red i hope not said she i loved you the first day i saw you and heard your voice and now i love you ten times more let me dry thy tears for ever sweet mercy be my wife you are mad said mercy what would you wed a woman in my condition i am more your friend than to take you at your word and what do you think i am made of to go from one man to another like that take your time sweetheart only give me your hand george said mercy very gravely i am beholden to you but my duty it lies another way there is a young man in these parts sir george groaned that was my follower for two years and better i wronged him for one i never name now i must marry that poor lad and make him happy or else live and die as i am sir george turned pale one word do you love him i have a regard for him do you love him hardly but i wronged him and i owe him amends i shall pay my debt sir george bowed and retired sick at heart and deeply mortified mercy looked after him and sighed next day as he walked disconsolate up and down she came to him and gave him her hand you were a good friend to me that bitter day said she now let me be yours do not bide here twill but vex you i am going madam said sir george stiffly i but wait to see the man you prefer to me if he is not too unworthy of you ill go and trouble you no more i have learned his name mercy blushed for she knew paul carrick would bear no comparison with george neville the next day sir george took leave to observe that this paul carrick did not seem to appreciate her preference so highly as he ought i understand he has never been here mercy colored but made no reply and sir george was sorry he had taunted her he followed her about and showed her great attention but not a word of love there were fine trout streams in the neighborhood and he busied himself fishing and in the evening read aloud to mercy and waited to see paul carrick paul never came and from a word mercy let drop he saw that she was mortified then being no tyro in love he told her he had business in lancaster and must leave her for a few days but he would return and by that time perhaps paul carrick would be visible now his main object was to try the effect of correspondence every day he sent her a long loveletter from lancaster paul carrick who in absenting himself for a time had acted upon his sisters advice rather than his own natural impulse learned that mercy received a letter every day this was a thing unheard of in that parish so then paul defied his sisters advice and presented himself to mercy when the following dialogue took place welcome home mercy thank you paul well im single still lass so i hear im come to say let bygones be bygones so be it said mercy drily you have tried a gentleman now try a farrier i have and he did not stand the test anan why did you not come near mo for ten days paul blushed up to the eyes well said he ill tell you the truth twas our jess advised me to leave you quiet just at first ay ay i was to be humbled and made to smart for my fault and then i should be thankful to take you my lad if ever you should be really in love take a friends advice listen to your own heart and not to shallow advisers you have mortified a poor sorrowful creature who was going to make a sacrifice for you and you have lost her for ever what dye mean i mean that ye are to think no more of mercy vint then it is true ye jade yeve gotten a fresh lover already say no more than you know if you were the only man on earth i would not wed you paul carrick paul carrick retired home and blew up his sister and told her that she had gotten him the sack again the next day sir george came back from lancaster and mercy lowered her lashes for once at sight of him well said he has this carrick shown a sense of your goodness he has comeand gone she then with her usual frankness told him what had passed and said she with a smile you are partly to blame for how could i help comparing your behavior to me with his you came to my side when i was in trouble and showed me respect when i expected scorn from all the world a friend in need is a friend indeed reward me reward me said sir george gaily you know the way nay but i am too much your friend said mercy be less my friend then and more my darling he pressed her he urged her he stuck to her he pestered her she snubbed and evaded and parried and liked him all the better for his pestering her at last one day she said if mrs gaunt thinks it will be for your happiness i willin six months time but you shall not marry in haste to repent at leisure and i must have time to learn two thingswhether you can be constant to a simple woman like me and whether i can love again as tenderly as you deserve to be loved all his endeavors to shake this determination were vain mercy vint had a terrible deal of quiet resolution he retired to cumberland and in a long letter asked mrs gaunts advice she replied characteristically she began very soberly to say that she should be the last to advise a marriage between persons of different conditions in life but then said she this mercy is altogether an exception if a flower grows on a dunghill tis still a flower and not a part of the dunghill she has the essence of gentility and indeed her manners are better bred than most of our ladies there is too much affectation abroad and that is your true vulgarity tack my lady on to mercy vint and that dignified and quiet simplicity of hers will carry her with credit through every court in europe then think of her virtueshere the writer began to lose her temperwhere can you hope to find such another she is a moral genius and acts well no matter under what temptation as surely as claude and raphael paint well why sir what do you seek in a wife wealth title family but you possess them already you want something in addition that will make you happy well take that angelic goodness into your house and you will find by your own absolute happiness how ill your neighbors have wived for my part i see but one objection the child well if you are man enough to take the mother i am woman enough to take the babe in one word he who has the sense to fall in love with such an angel and has not the sense to marry it if he can is a fool postscriptmy poor friend to what end think you i sent you down in the coach with her sir george thus advised acted as he would have done had the advice been just the opposite he sent mercy a loveletter by every post and he often received one in return only his were passionate and hers gentle and affectionate but one day came a letter that was a mere cry of distress george my child is dying what shall i do he mounted his horse and rode to her he came too late the little boy had died suddenly of croup and was to be buried next morning the poor mother received him upstairs and her grief was terrible she clung sobbing to him and could not be comforted yet she felt his coming but a mothers anguish overpowered all crushed by this fearful blow her strength gave way for a time and she clung to george neville and told him she had nothing left but him and one day implored him not to die and leave her sir george said all he could think of to comfort her and at the end of a fortnight persuaded her to leave the packhorse and england as his wife she had little power to resist now and indeed little inclination they were married by special license and spent a twelvemonth abroad at the end of that time they returned to nevilles court and mercy took her place there with the same dignified simplicity that had adorned her in a humbler station sir george had given her no lessons but she had observed closely for his sake and being already well educated and very quick and docile she seldom made him blush except with pride they were the happiest pair in cumberland her merciful nature now found a larger field for its exercise and backed by her husbands purse she became the lady bountiful of the parish and the county the day after she reached nevilles court came an exquisite letter to her from mrs gaunt she sent an affectionate reply but the gaunts and the nevilles did not meet in society sir george neville and mrs gaunt being both singularly brave and haughty people rather despised this arrangement but it seems that one day when they were all four in the town hall folk whispered and looked and both griffith gaunt and lady neville surprised these glances and determined by one impulse it should never happen again hence it was quite understood that the nevilles and the gaunts were not to be asked to the same party or ball the wives however corresponded and lady neville easily induced mrs gaunt to cooperate with her in her benevolent acts especially in saving young women who had been betrayed from sinking deeper living a good many miles apart lady neville could send her stray sheep to service near mrs gaunt and vice versa and so merciful but discriminating they saved many a poor girl who had been weak not wicked so then though they could not eat nor dance together in earthly mansions they could do good together and methinks in the eternal world where years of social intercourse will prove less than cobwebs these their joint acts of mercy will be links of a bright strong chain to bind their souls in everlasting amity it was a remarkable circumstance that the one child of lady nevilles unhappy marriage died but her nine children by sir george all grew to goodly men and women that branch of the nevilles became remarkable for high principle and good sense and this they owe to mercy vint and to sir georges courage in marrying her this mercy was granddaughter to one of cromwells ironsides and brought her rare personal merit into their house and also the best blood of the old puritans than which there is no blood in europe more rich in male courage female chastity and all the virtues the

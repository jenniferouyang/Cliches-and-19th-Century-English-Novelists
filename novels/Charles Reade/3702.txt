transcribers note italics are indicated by the underscore character accent marks are ignored foul play by charles reade and dion boucicault chapter i there are places which appear at first sight inaccessible to romance and such a place was mr wardlaws diningroom in russell square it was very large had sickly green walls picked out with aldermen full length heavy maroon curtains mahogany chairs a turkey carpet an inch thick and was lighted with wax candles only in the center bristling and gleaming with silver and glass was a round table at which fourteen could have dined comfortably and at opposite sides of this table sat two gentlemen who looked as neat grave precise and unromantic as the place merchant wardlaw and his son wardlaw senior was an elderly man tall thin irongray with a round head a short thick neck a good brown eye a square jowl that betokened resolution and a complexion so sallow as to be almost cadaverous hard as iron but a certain stiff dignity and respectability sat upon him and became him arthur wardlaw resembled his father in figure but his mother in face he had and has haycolored hair a forehead singularly white and delicate pale blue eyes largish ears finely chiseled features the under lip much shorter than the upper his chin oval and pretty but somewhat receding his complexion beautiful in short what nineteen people out of twenty would call a handsome young man and think they had described him both the wardlaws were in full dress according to the invariable custom of the house and sat in a dead silence that seemed natural to the great sober room this however was not for want of a topic on the contrary they had a matter of great importance to discuss and in fact this was why they dined teteatete but their tongues were tied for the present in the first place there stood in the middle of the table an epergne the size of a putney laureltree neither wardlaw could well see the other without craning out his neck like a rifleman from behind his tree and then there were three live suppressors of confidential intercourse two gorgeous footmen and a somber sublime and in one word episcopal butler all three went about as softly as cats after a robin and conjured one plate away and smoothly insinuated another and seemed models of grave discretion but were known to be all ears and bound by a secret oath to carry down each crumb of dialogue to the servants hall for curious dissection and boisterous ridicule at last however those three smug hypocrites retired and by good luck transferred their suffocating epergne to the sideboard so then father and son looked at one another with that conscious air which naturally precedes a topic of interest and wardlaw senior invited his son to try a certain decanter of rare old port by way of preliminary while the young man fills his glass hurl we in his antecedents at school till fifteen and then clerk in his fathers office till twentytwo and showed an aptitude so remarkable that john wardlaw who was getting tired determined sooner or later to put the reins of government into his hands but he conceived a desire that the future head of his office should be a university man so he announced his resolution and to oxford went young wardlaw though he had not looked at greek or latin for seven years he was however furnished with a private tutor under whom he recovered lost ground rapidly the reverend robert penfold was a firstclass man and had the gift of teaching the house of wardlaw had peculiar claims on him for he was the son of old michael penfold wardlaws cashier he learned from young wardlaw the stake he was playing for and instead of merely giving him one hours lecture per day as he did to his other pupils he used to come to his rooms at all hours and force him to read by reading with him he also stood his friend in a serious emergency young wardlaw you must know was blessed or cursed with mimicry his powers in that way really seemed to have no limit for he could imitate any sound you liked with his voice and any form with his pen or pencil now we promise you he was one man under his fathers eye and another down at oxford so one night this gentleman being warm with wine opens his window and seeing a group of undergraduates chattering and smoking in the quadrangle imitates the peculiar grating tones of mr champion vicepresident of the college and gives them various reasons why they ought to disperse to their rooms and study but perhaps says he in conclusion you are too blind drunk to read bosh in crooked letters by candlelight in that case and he then gave them some very naughty advice how to pass the evening still in the exact tones of mr champion who was a very very strict moralist and this unexpected sally of wit caused shrieks of laughter and mightily tickled all the hearers except champion ipse who was listening and disapproving at another window he complained to the president then the ingenious wardlaw not having come down to us in a direct line from bayard committed a great mistakehe denied it it was brought home to him and the president who had laughed in his sleeve at the practical joke looked very grave at the falsehood rustication was talked of and even expulsion then wardlaw came sorrowfully to penfold and said to him i must have been awfully cut for i dont remember all that i had been wining at christchurch i do remember slanging the fellows but how can i tell what i said i say old fellow it will be a bad job for me if they expel me or even rusticate me my father will never forgive me i shall be his clerk but never his partner and then he will find out what a lot i owe down here im done for im done for penfold uttered not a word but grasped his hand and went off to the president and said his pupil had wined at christchurch and could not be expected to remember minutely mimicry was unfortunately a habit with him he then pleaded for the milder construction with such zeal and eloquence that the highminded scholar he was addressing admitted that construction was possible and therefore must be received so the affair ended in a written apology to mr champion which had all the smoothness and neatness of a merchants letter arthur wardlaw was already a master in that style six months after this and one fortnight before the actual commencement of our tale arthur wardlaw well crammed by penfold went up for his final examination throbbing with anxiety he passed and was so grateful to his tutor that when the advowson of a small living near oxford came into the market he asked wardlaw senior to lend robert penfold a sum of money much more than was needed and wardlaw senior declined without a moments hesitation this slight sketch will serve as a key to the dialogue it has postponed and to subsequent incidents well arthur and so you have really taken your degree no sir but i have passed my examination the degree follows as a matter of coursethat is a mere question of fees oh then now i have something to say to you try one more glass of the port stop youll excuse me i am a man of business i dont doubt your word heaven forbid but do you happen to have any document you can produce in further confirmation of what you state namely that you have passed your final examination at the university certainly sir replied young wardlaw my testamur what is that the young gentleman put his hand in his pocket and produced his testamur or we bear witness a short printed document in latin which may be thus translated we bear witness that arthur wardlaw of st lukes college has answered our questions in humane letters george richardson arthur smythe edward merivale examiners wardlaw senior took it laid it beside him on the table inspected it with his double eyeglass and not knowing a word of latin was mightily impressed and his respect for his son rose forty or fortyfive per cent very well sir said he now listen to me perhaps it was an old mans fancy but i have often seen in the world what a stamp these universities put upon a man to send you back from commerce to latin and greek at twoandtwenty was trying you rather hard it was trying you doubly your obedience and your ability into the bargain well sir you have stood the trial and i am proud of you and so now it is my turn from this day and from this hour look on yourself as my partner in the old established house of wardlaw my balancesheet shall be prepared immediately and the partnership deed drawn you will enter on a flourishing concern sir and you will virtually conduct it in written communication with me for i have had fiveandforty years of it and then my liver you know watson advises me strongly to leave my desk and try country air and rest from business and its cares he paused a moment and the young man drew a long breath like one who was in the act of being relieved of some terrible weight as for the old gentleman he was not observing his son just then but thinking of his own career a certain expression of pain and regret came over his features but he shook it off with manly dignity come come said he this is the law of nature and must be submitted to with a good grace wardlaw junior fill your glass at the same time he stood up and said stoutly the setting sun drinks to the rising sun but could not maintain that artificial style and ended with god bless you my boy and may you stick to business avoid speculation as i have done and so hand the concern down healthy to your son as my father there pointing to a picture handed it down to me and i to you his voice wavered slightly in uttering this benediction but only for a moment he then sat quietly down and sipped his wine composedly not so the other his color came and went violently all the time his father was speaking and when he ceased he sank into his chair with another sigh deeper than the last and two halfhysterical tears came to his pale eyes but presently feeling he was expected to say something he struggled against all this mysterious emotion and faltered out that he should not fear the responsibility if he might have constant recourse to his father for advice why of course was the reply my country house is but a mile from the station you can telegraph for me in any case of importance when would you wish me to commence my new duties let me see it will take six weeks to prepare a balancesheet such as i could be content to submit to an incoming partner say two months young wardlaws countenance fell meantime you shall travel on the continent and enjoy yourself thank you said young wardlaw mechanically and fell into a brown study the room now returned to what seemed its natural state and its silence continued until it was broken from without a sharp knocking was heard at the street door and resounded across the marble hall the wardlaws looked at one another in some little surprise i have invited nobody said the elder some time elapsed and then a footman made his appearance and brought in a card mr christopher adams now that mr christopher adams should call on john wardlaw in his private room at nine oclock in the evening seemed to that merchant irregular presumptuous and monstrous tell him he will find me at my place of business tomorrow as usual said he knitting his brows the footman went off with this message and soon after raised voices were heard in the hall and the episcopal butler entered the room with an injured countenance he says he must see you he is in great anxiety yes i am in great anxiety said a quavering voice at his elbow and mr adams actually pushed by the butler and stood hat in hand in those sacred precincts pray excuse me sir said he but it is very serious i cant be easy in my mind till i have put you a question this is very extraordinary conduct sir said mr wardlaw do you think i do business here and at all hours oh no sir it is my own business i am come to ask you a very serious question i couldnt wait till morning with such a doubt on my mind well sir i repeat this is irregular and extraordinary but as you are here pray what is the matter he then dismissed the lingering butler with a look mr adams cast uneasy glances on young wardlaw oh said the elder you can speak before him this is my partner that is to say he will be as soon as the balancesheet can be prepared and the deed drawn wardlaw junior this is mr adams a very respectable bill discounter the two men bowed to each other and arthur wardlaw sat down motionless sir did you draw a note of hand today inquired adams of the elder merchant i dare say i did did you discount one signed by me yes sir we did well sir you have only to present it at maturity wardlaw son will provide for it i dare say this with the lofty nonchalance of a rich man who had never broken an engagement in his life ah that i know they will if it is all right but suppose it is not what dye mean asked wardlaw with some astonishment oh nothing sir it bears your signature that is good for twenty times the amount and it is indorsed by your cashier only what makes me a little uneasy your bills used to be always on your own forms and so i told my partner he discounted it gentlemen i wish you would just look at it of course we will look at it show it arthur first his eyes are younger than mine mr adams took out a large billbook extracted the note of hand and passed it across the table to wardlaw junior he took it up with a sort of shiver and bent his head very low over it then handed it back in silence adams took it to wardlaw senior and laid it before him by the side of arthurs testamur the merchant inspected it with his glasses the writing is mine apparently i am very glad of it said the billbroker eagerly stop a bit said mr wardlaw why what is this for two thousand pounds and as you say not my form i have signed no note for two thousand pounds this week dated yesterday you have not cashed it i hope i am sorry to say my partner has well sir not to keep you in suspense the thing is not worth the stamp it is written on mr wardlawsirgood heavens then it is as i feared it is a forgery i should be puzzled to find any other name for it you need not look so pale arthur we cant help some clever scoundrel imitating our hands and as for you adams you ought to have been more cautious but sir your cashiers name is penfold faltered the holder clinging to a straw may he not have drawnis the indorsement forged as well mr wardlaw examined the back of the bill and looked puzzled no said he my cashiers name is michael penfold but this is indorsed robert penfold do you hear arthur why what is the matter with you you look like a ghost i say there is your tutors name at the back of this forged note that is very strange just look and tell me who wrote these two words robert penfold young wardlaw took the document and tried to examine it calmly but it shook visibly in his hand and a cold moisture gathered on his brow his pale eyes roved to and fro in a very remarkable way and he was so long before he said anything that both the other persons present began to eye him with wonder at last he faltered out this robert penfold seems to me very like his own handwriting but then the rest of the writing is equally like yours sir i am sure robert penfold never did anything wrong mr adams please oblige me let this go no further till i have seen him and asked him whether he indorsed it now dont you be in a hurry said the elder wardlaw the first question is who received the money mr adams replied that it was a respectablelooking man a young clergyman ah said wardlaw with a world of meaning father said young wardlaw imploringly for my sake say no more tonight robert penfold is incapable of a dishonest act it becomes your years to think so young man but i have lived long enough to see what crimes respectable men are betrayed into in the hour of temptation and now i think of it this robert penfold is in want of money did he not ask me for a loan of two thousand pounds was not that the very sum cant you answer me why the application came through you receiving no reply from his son but a sort of agonized stare he took out his pencil and wrote down robert penfolds address this he handed the billbroker and gave him some advice in a whisper which mr christopher adams received with a profusion of thanks and bustled away leaving wardlaw senior excited and indignant wardlaw junior ghastly pale and almost stupefied scarcely a word was spoken for some minutes and then the younger man broke out suddenly robert penfold is the best friend i ever had i should have been expelled but for him and i should never have earned that testamur but for him the old merchant interrupted him you exaggerate but to tell the truth i am sorry now i did not lend him the money you asked for for mark my words in a moment of temptation that miserable young man has forged my name and will be convicted of the felony and punished accordingly no no oh god forbid shrieked young wardlaw i couldnt bear it if he did he must have intended to replace it i must see him i will see him directly he got up all in a hurry and was going to penfold to warn him and get him out of the way till the money should be replaced but his father started up at the same moment and forbade him in accents that he had never yet been able to resist sit down sir this instant said the old man with terrible sternness sit down i say or you will never be a partner of mine justice must take its course what business and what right have we to protect a felon i would not take your part if you were one indeed it is too late now for the detectives will be with him before you could reach him i gave adams his address at this last piece of information wardlaw junior leaned his head on the table and groaned aloud and a cold perspiration gathered in beads upon his white forehead chapter ii that same evening sat over their tea in norfolk street strand another couple who were also father and son but in this pair the wardlaws were reversed michael penfold was a reverend gentle creature with white hair blue eyes and great timidity why if a stranger put to him a question he used to look all round the room before he ventured to answer robert his son was a young man with a large brown eye a mellow voice square shoulders and a prompt and vigorous manner cricketer scholar parson they were talking hopefully together over a living robert was going to buy it was near oxford he said and would not prevent his continuing to take pupils but father said he it will be a place to take my wife to if i ever have one and meantime i hope you will run down now and then saturday to monday that i will robert ah how proud she would have been to hear you preach it was always her dream poor thing let us think she can hear me said robert and i have got you still the proceeds of this living will help me to lodge you more comfortably you are very good robert i would rather see you spend it upon yourself but dear me what a manager you must be to dress so beautifully as you do and send your old father presents as you do and yet put by fourteen hundred pounds to buy this living you are mistaken sir i have only saved four hundred the odd thousand but that is a secret for the present oh i am not inquisitive i never was they then chatted about things of no importance whatever and the old gentleman was just lighting his candle to go to bed when a visitor was ushered into the room the penfolds looked a little surprised but not much they had no street door all to themselves no liveried dragons to interpose between them and unseasonable or unwelcome visitors the man was well dressed with one exception he wore a gold chain he had a hooked nose and a black piercing eye he stood at the door and observed every person and thing in the room minutely before he spoke a word then he said quietly mr michael penfold i believe at your service sir and mr robert penfold i am robert penfold what is your business pray is the robert penfold at the back of this note your writing certainly it is they would not cash it without that oh you got the money then of course i did you have not parted with it have you no all the better he then turned to michael and looked at him earnestly a moment the fact is sir said he there is a little irregularity about this bill which must be explained or your son might be called on to refund the cash irregularity abouta bill cried michael penfold in dismay who is the drawer let me see it oh dear me something wrong about a bill indorsed by you robert and the old man began to shake piteously why father said robert what are you afraid of if the bill is irregular i can but return the money it is in the house the best way will be for mr robert penfold to go at once with me to the billbroker he lives but a few doors off and you sir must stay here and be responsible for the funds till we return robert penfold took his hat directly and went off with this mysterious visitor they had not gone many steps when roberts companion stopped and getting in front of him said we can settle this matter here at the same time a policeman crossed the way and joined them and another man who was in fact a policeman in plain clothes emerged from a doorway and stood at robert penfolds back the detective having thus surrounded him threw off his disguise my man said he i ought to have done this job in your house but i looked at the worthy old gentleman and his gray hairs i thought id spare him all i could i have a warrant to arrest you for forgery forgery arrest me for forgery said robert penfold with some amazement but little emotion for he hardly seemed to take it in in all its horrible significance the next moment however he turned pale and almost staggered under the blow we had better go to mr wardlaw said he i entreat you to go to him with me cant be done said the detective wardlaw has nothing to do with it the bill is stopped you are arrested by the gent that cashed it here is the warrant will you go quietly with us or must i put the darbies on robert was violently agitated there is no need to arrest me he cried i shall not run from my accuser hands off i say im a clergyman of the church of england and you shall not lay hands on me but one of the policemen did lay hands on him then the reverend robert penfold shook him furiously off and with one active bound sprang into the middle of the road the officers went at him incautiously and the head detective as he rushed forward received a heavy blow on the neck and jaw that sounded along the street and sent him rolling in the mud this was followed by a quick succession of staggering facers administered right and left on the eyes and noses of the subordinates these however though bruised and bleeding succeeded at last in grappling their man and all came to the ground together and there struggled furiously every window in the street was open by this time and at one the white hair and reverend face of michael penfold looked out on this desperate and unseemly struggle with hands that beat the air in helpless agony and inarticulate cries of terror the detective got up and sat upon robert penfolds chest and at last the three forced the handcuffs upon him and took him in a cab to the stationhouse next day before the magistrate wardlaw senior proved the note was a forgery and mr adamss partner swore to the prisoner as the person who had presented and indorsed the note the officers attended two with black eyes apiece and one with his jaw bound up and two sound teeth in his pocket which had been driven from their sockets by the prisoner in his desperate attempt to escape their evidence hurt the prisoner and the magistrate refused bail the reverend robert penfold was committed to prison to be tried at the central criminal court on a charge of felony wardlaw senior returned home and told wardlaw junior who said not a word he soon received a letter from robert penfold which agitated him greatly and he promised to go to the prison and see him but he never went he was very miserable a prey to an inward struggle he dared not offend his father on the eve of being made partner yet his heart bled for robert penfold he did what might perhaps have been expected from that pale eye and receding chinhe temporized he said to himself before that horrible trial comes on i shall be the house of wardlaw and able to draw a check for thousands ill buy off adams at any price and hush up the whole matter so he hoped and hoped but the accountant was slow the public prosecutor unusually quick and to young wardlaws agony the partnership deed was not ready when an imploring letter was put into his hands urging him by all that men hold sacred to attend at the court as the prisoners witness this letter almost drove young wardlaw mad he went to adams and entreated him not to carry the matter into court but adams was inexorable he had got his money but would be revenged for the fright baffled here young wardlaw went down to oxford and shut himself up in his own room a prey to fear and remorse he sported his oak and never went out all his exercise was that of a wild beast in its den walking restlessly up and down but all his caution did not prevent the prisoners solicitor from getting to him one morning at seven oclock a clerk slipped in at the heels of his scout and coming to young wardlaws bedside awoke him out of an uneasy slumber by serving him with a subpoena to appear as robert penfolds witness this last stroke finished him his bodily health gave way under his mental distress gastric fever set in and he was lying tossing and raving in delirium while robert penfold was being tried at the central criminal court the trial occupied six hours and could easily be made rather interesting but for various reasons with which it would not be good taste to trouble the reader we decide to skim it the indictment contained two counts one for forging the note of hand the other for uttering it knowing it to be forged on the first count the crown was weak and had to encounter the evidence of undercliff the distinguished expert who swore that the hand which wrote robert penfold was not in his opinion the hand that had written the body of the instrument he gave many minute reasons in support of this and nothing of any weight was advanced contra the judge directed the jury to acquit the prisoner on that count but on the charge of uttering the evidence was clear and on the question of knowledge it was perhaps a disadvantage to the prisoner that he was tried in england and could not be heard in person as he could have been in a foreign court above all his resistance to the officers eked out the presumption that he knew the note had been forged by some person or other who was probably his accomplice the absence of his witness wardlaw junior was severely commented on by his counsel indeed he appealed to the judge to commit the said wardlaw for contempt of court but wardlaw senior was recalled and swore that he had left his son in a burning fever not expected to live and declared with genuine emotion that nothing but a high sense of public duty had brought him hither from his dying sons bedside he also told the court that arthurs inability to clear his friend had really been the first cause of his illness from which he was not expected to recover the jury consulted together a long time and at last brought in a verdict of guilty but recommended him to mercy on grounds which might fairly have been alleged in favor of his innocence but if guilty rather aggravated his crime then an officer of the court inquired in a sort of chant or recitative whether the prisoner had anything to say why judgment should not be given in accordance with the verdict it is easy to divest words of their meaning by false intonation and prisoners in general receive this bit of singsong in dead silence for why the chant conveys no idea to their ears and they would as soon think of replying to the notes of a cuckoo but the reverend robert penfold was in a keen agony that sharpened all his senses he caught the sense of the words in spite of the speaker and clung wildly to the straw that monotonous machine held out my lord my lord he cried ill tell you the real reason why young wardlaw is not here the judge put up his hand with a gesture that enforced silence prisoner said he i cannot go back to facts the jury have dealt with them judgment can be arrested only on grounds of law on these you can be heard but if you have none to offer you must be silent and submit to your sentence he then without a pause proceeded to point out the heinous character of the offense but admitted there was one mitigating circumstance and in conclusion he condemned the culprit to five years penal servitude at this the poor wretch uttered a cry of anguish that was fearful and clutched the dock convulsively now a prisoner rarely speaks to a judge without revolting him by bad law or bad logic or hot words but this wild cry was innocent of all these and went straight from the heart in the dock to the heart on the judgment seat and so his lordships voice trembled for a moment and then became firm again but solemn and humane but said he my experience tells me this is your first crime and may possibly be your last i shall therefore use my influence that you may not be associated with more hardened criminals but may be sent out of this country to another where you may begin life afresh and in the course of years efface this dreadful stain give me hopes of you begin your repentance where now you stand by blaming yourself and no other man no man constrained you to utter a forged note and to receive the money it was found in your possession for such an act there can be no defense in law morality or religion these words overpowered the culprit he burst out crying with great violence but it did not last long he became strangely composed all of a sudden and said god forgive all concerned in thisbut onebut one he then bowed respectfully and like a gentleman to the judge and the jury and walked out of the dock with the air of a man who had parted with emotion and would march to the gallows now without flinching the counsel for the crown required that the forged document should be impounded i was about to make the same demand said the prisoners counsel the judge snubbed them both and said it was a matter of course robert penfold spent a year in separate confinement and then to cure him of its salutary effect if any was sent on board the hulk vengeance and was herded with the greatest miscreants in creation they did not reduce him to their level but they injured his mind and before half his sentence had expired he sailed for a penal colony a man with a hot coal in his bosom a creature imbittered poisoned hoping little believing little fearing little and hating much he took with him the prayerbook his mother had given him when he was ordained deacon but he seldom read beyond the flyleaf there the poor lady had written at large her mothers heart and her pious soul aspiring heavenward for her darling son this when all seemed darkest he would sometimes run to with moist eyes for he was sure of his mothers love but almost doubted the justice of his god chapter iii mr wardlaw went down to his son and nursed him he kept the newspapers from him and on his fever abating had him conveyed by easy stages to the seaside and then sent him abroad the young man obeyed in gloomy silence he never asked after robert penfold now never mentioned his name he seemed somehow thankful to be controlled mind and body but before he had been abroad a month he wrote for leave to return home and to throw himself into business there was for once a nervous impatience in his letters and his father who pitied him deeply and was more than ever inclined to reward and indulge him yielded readily enough and on his arrival signed the partnership deed and poloniuslike gave him much good counsel then retired to his country seat at first he used to run up every three days and examine the daybook and ledger and advise his junior but these visits soon became fewer and at last he did little more than correspond occasionally arthur wardlaw held the reins and easily paid his oxford debts out of the assets of the firm not being happy in his mind he threw himself into commerce with feverish zeal and very soon extended the operations of the house one of his first acts of authority was to send for michael penfold into his room now poor old michael ever since his sons misfortune as he called it had crept to his desk like a culprit expecting every day to be discharged when he received this summons he gave a sigh and went slowly to the young merchant arthur wardlaw looked up at his entrance then looked down again and said coldly mr penfold you have been a faithful servant to us many years i raise your salary fifty pounds a year and you will keep the ledger the old man was dumfounded at first and then began to give vent to his surprise and gratitude but wardlaw cut him short almost fiercely there there there said he without raising his eyes let me hear no more about it and above all never speak to me of that cursed business it was no fault of yours nor mine neither theregoi want no thanks do you hear leave me mr penfold if you please the old man bowed low and retired wondering much at his employers goodness and a little at his irritability wardlaw juniors whole soul was given to business night and day and he soon became known for a very ambitious and rising merchant but by and by ambition had to encounter a rival in his heart he fell in love deeply in love and with a worthy object the young lady was the daughter of a distinguished officer whose merits were universally recognized but not rewarded in proportion wardlaws suit was favorably received by the father and the daughter gradually yielded to an attachment the warmth sincerity and singleness of which were manifest and the pair would have been married but for the circumstance that her father partly through wardlaws influence by the by had obtained a lucrative post abroad which it suited his means to accept at all events for a time he was a widower and his daughter could not let him go alone this temporary separation if it postponed a marriage led naturally to a solemn engagement and arthur wardlaw enjoyed the happiness of writing and receiving affectionate letters by every foreign post love worthily bestowed shed its balm upon his heart and under its soft but powerful charm he grew tranquil and complacent and his character and temper seemed to improve such virtue is there in a pure attachment meanwhile the extent of his operations alarmed old penfold but he soon reasoned that worthy down with overpowering conclusions and superior smiles he had been three years the ruling spirit of wardlaw son when some curious events took place in another hemisphere and in these events which we are now to relate arthur wardlaw was more nearly interested than may appear at first sight robert penfold in due course applied to lieutenantgeneral rolleston for a ticket of leave that functionary thought the application premature the crime being so grave he complained that the system had become too lax and for his part he seldom gave a ticketofleave until some suitable occupation was provided for the applicant will anybody take you as a clerk if so ill see about it robert penfold could find nobody to take him into a post of confidence all at once and wrote the general an eloquent letter begging hard to be allowed to labor with his hands fortunately general rollestons gardener had just turned him off so he offered the post to his eloquent correspondent remarking that he did not much mind employing a ticketofleave man himself though he was resolved to protect his neighbors from their relapses the convict then came to general rolleston and begged leave to enter on his duties under the name of james seaton at that general rolleston hemd and hawd and took a note but his final decision was as follows if you really mean to change your character why the name you have disgraced might hang round your neck well ill give you every chance but said this old warrior suddenly compressing his resolute lips just a little if you go a yard off the straight path now look for no mercy jemmy seaton so the convict was rechristened at the tail of a threat and let loose among the warriors tulips his appearance was changed as effectually as his name even before he was seatoned he had grown a silky mustache and beard of singular length and beauty and what with these and his workingmans clothes and his cheeks and neck tanned by the sun our readers would never have recognized in this hale bearded laborer the pale prisoner that had trembled raged wept and submitted in the dock of the central criminal court our universities cure men of doing things by halves be the things mental or muscular so seaton gardened much more zealously than his plebeian predecessor up at five and did not leave till eight but he was unpopular in the kitchenbecause he was always out of it taciturn and bitter he shunned his fellowservants yet working among the flowers did him good these his pretty companions and nurslings had no vices one day as he was rolling the grass upon the lawn he heard a soft rustle at some distance and looking round saw a young lady on the gravel path whose calm but bright face coming so suddenly literally dazzled him she had a clear cheek blooming with exercise rich brown hair smooth glossy and abundant and a very light hazel eye of singular beauty and serenity she glided along tranquil as a goddess smote him with beauty and perfume and left him staring after her receding figure which was in its way as captivating as her face she was walking up and down for exercise briskly but without effort once she passed within a few yards of him and he touched his hat to her she inclined her head gently but her eyes did not rest an instant on her gardener and so she passed and repassed unconsciously sawing this solitary heart with soft but penetrating thrills at last she went indoors to luncheon and the lawn seemed to miss the light music of her rustling dress and the sunshine of her presence and there was a painful void but that passed and a certain sense of happiness stole over james seatonan unreasonable joy that often runs before folly and trouble the young lady was helen rolleston just returned home from a visit she walked in the garden every day and seaton watched her and peeped at her unseen behind trees and bushes he fed his eyes and his heart upon her and by degrees she became the sun of his solitary existence it was madness but its first effect was not unwholesome the daily study of this creature who though by no means the angel he took her for was at all events a pure and virtuous woman soothed his sore heart and counteracted the demoralizing influence of his late companions every day he drank deeper of an insane but purifying and elevating passion he avoided the kitchen still more and that by the by was unlucky for there he could have learned something about miss helen rolleston that would have warned him to keep at the other end of the garden whenever that charming face and form glided to and fro among the minor flowers a beautiful face fires our imagination and we see higher virtue and intelligence in it than we can detect in its owners head or heart when we descend to calm inspection james seaton gazed on miss rolleston day after day at so respectful a distance that she became his goddess if a day passed without his seeing her he was dejected when she was behind her time he was restless anxious and his work distasteful and then when she came out at last he thrilled all over and the lawn ay the world itself seemed to fill with sunshine his adoration timid by its own nature was doubly so by reason of his fallen and hopeless condition he cut nosegays for her but gave them to her maid wilson for her he had not the courage to offer them to herself one evening as he went home a man addressed him familiarly but in a low voice seaton looked at him attentively and recognized him at last it was a convict called butt who had come over in the ship with him the man offered him a glass of ale seaton declined it butt a very clever rogue seemed hurt so then seaton assented reluctantly butt took him to a public house in a narrow street and into a private room seaton started as soon as he entered for there sat two repulsive ruffians and by a look that passed rapidly between them and butt he saw plainly that they were waiting for him he felt nervous the place was so uncouth and dark the faces so villainous however they invited him to sit down roughly but with an air of good fellowship and very soon opened their business over their ale we are all bound to assist our fellowcreatures when it can be done without trouble and what they asked of him was a simple act of courtesy such as in their opinion no man worthy of the name could deny to his fellow it was to give general rollestons watchdog a piece of prepared meat upon a certain evening and in return for this trifling civility they were generous enough to offer him a full share of any light valuables they might find in the generals house seaton trembled and put his face in his hands a moment i cannot do it said he why not he has been too good to me a coarse laugh of derision greeted this argument it seemed so irrelevant to these pure egotists seaton however persisted and on that one of the men got up and stood before the door and drew his knife gently seaton glanced his eyes round in search of a weapon and turned pale do you mean to split on us mate said one of the ruffians in front of him no i dont but i wont rob my benefactor you shall kill me first and with that he darted to the fireplace and in a moment the poker was high in air and the way he squared his shoulders and stood ready to hit to the on or cut to the off was a caution come drop that said butt grimly and put up your knife bob cant a pal be out of a job and yet not split on them that is in it why should i split said robert penfold has the law been a friend to me but i wont rob my benefactorand his daughter that is square enough said butt why pals there are other cribs to be cracked besides that old blokes finish the ale mate and part friends if you will promise me to crack some other crib and let that one alone a sullen assent was given and seaton drank their healths and walked away butt followed him soon after and affected to side with him and intimated that he himself was capable of not robbing a mans house who had been good to him or to a pal of his indeed this plausible person said so much and his sullen comrades had said so little that seaton rendered keen and anxious by love invested his savings in a colts revolver and ammunition he did not stop there after the hint about the watchdog he would not trust that faithful but too carnivorous animal he brought his blankets into the little toolhouse and lay there every night in a sort of dogs sleep this toolhouse was erected in a little back garden separated from the lawn only by some young trees in single file now miss rollestons window looked out upon the lawn so that seatons watchtower was not many yards from it then as the toolhouse was only lighted from above he bored a hole in the wooden structure and through this he watched and slept and watched he used to sit studying theology by a farthing rushlight till the ladys bedtime and then he watched for her shadow if it appeared for a few moments on the blind he gave a sigh of content and went to sleep but awaked every now and then to see that all was well after a few nights his alarms naturally ceased but his love increased fed now from this new source the sweet sense of being the secret protector of her he adored meantime miss rollestons ladys maid wilson fell in love with him after her fashion she had taken a fancy to his face at once and he had encouraged her a little unintentionally for he brought the nosegays to her and listened complacently to her gossip for the sake of the few words she let fall now and then about her young mistress as he never exchanged two sentences at a time with any other servant this flattered sarah wilson and she soon began to meet and accost him oftener and in cherriercolored ribbons than he could stand so then he showed impatience and then she reading him by herself suspected some vulgar rival suspicion soon bred jealousy jealousy vigilance and vigilance detection her first discovery was that so long as she talked of miss helen rolleston she was always welcome her second was that seaton slept in the toolhouse she was not romantic enough to connect her two discoveries together they lay apart in her mind until circumstances we are about to relate supplied a connecting link one thursday evening james seatons goddess sat alone with her papa andbeing a young lady of fair abilities who had gone through her course of music and other studies taught brainlessly and who was now going through a course of monotonous pleasures and had not accumulated any great store of mental resourcesshe was listless and languid and would have yawned forty times in her papas face only she was too wellbred she always turned her head away when it came and either suppressed it or else hid it with a lovely white hand at last as she was a good girl she blushed at her behavior and roused herself up and said she papa shall i play you the new quadrilles papa gave a start and a shake and said with wellfeigned vehemence ay do my dear and so composed himselfto listen and helen sat down and played the quadrilles the composer had taken immortal melodies some gay some sad and had robbed them of their distinctive character and hashed them till they were all one monotonous rattle but general rolleston was little the worse for all this as apollo saved horace from hearing a poetasters rhymes so did somnus another beneficent little deity rescue our warrior from his daughters music she was neither angry nor surprised a delicious smile illumined her face directly she crept to him on tiptoe and bestowed a kiss light as a zephyr on his gray head and in truth the bending attitude of this supple figure clad in snowy muslin the virginal face and light hazel eyes beaming love and reverence and the airy kiss had something angelic she took her candle and glided up to her bedroom and the moment she got there and could gratify her somnolence without offense need we say she became wideawake she sat down and wrote long letters to three other young ladies gushing affection asking questions of the kind nobody replies to painting with a young ladys colors the male being to whom she was shortly to be married wishing her dear friends a like demigod if perchance earth contained two and so to the last new bonnet and preacher she sat over her paper till one oclock and seaton watched and adored her shadow when she had done writing she opened her window and looked out upon the night she lifted those wonderful hazel eyes toward the stars and her watcher might well be pardoned if he saw in her a celestial being looking up from an earthly resting place toward her native sky at two oclock she was in bed but not asleep she lay calmly gazing at the southern cross and other lovely stars shining with vivid but chaste fire in the purple vault of heaven while thus employed she heard a slight sound outside that made her turn her eyes toward a young tree near her window its top branches were waving a good deal though there was not a breath stirring this struck her as curious very curious while she wondered suddenly an arm and a hand came in sight and after them the whole figure of a man going up the tree helen sat up now glaring with terror and was so paralyzed she did not utter a sound about a foot below her window was a lead flat that roofed the baywindow below it covered an area of several feet and the man sprang on to it with perfect ease from the tree helen shrieked with terror at that very instant there was a flash a pistolshot and the mans arms went whirling and he staggered and fell over the edge of the flat and struck the grass below with a heavy thud shots and blows followed and all the sounds of a bloody struggle rung in helens ears as she flung herself screaming from the bed and darted to the door she ran and clung quivering to her sleepy maid wilson the house was alarmed lights flashed footsteps pattered there was universal commotion general rolleston soon learned his daughters story from wilson and aroused his male servants one of whom was an old soldier they searched the house first but no entrance had been effected so they went out on the lawn with blunderbuss and pistol they found a man lying on his back at the foot of the bay window they pounced on him and to their amazement it was the gardener james seaton insensible general rolleston was quite taken aback for a moment then he was sorry but after a little reflection he said very sternly carry the blackguard indoors and run for an officer seaton was taken into the hall and laid flat on the floor all the servants gathered about him brimful of curiosity and the female ones began to speak all together but general rolleston told them sharply to hold their tongues and to retire behind the man somebody sprinkle him with cold water said he and be quiet all of you and keep out of sight while i examine him he stood before the insensible figure with his arms folded amid a dead silence broken only by the stifled sobs of sarah wilson and of a sociable housemaid who cried with her for company and now seaton began to writhe and show signs of returning sense next he moaned piteously and sighed but general rolleston could not pity him he waited grimly for returning consciousness to subject him to a merciless interrogatory he waited just one second too long he had to answer a question instead of putting one the judgment is the last faculty a man recovers when emerging from insensibility and seaton seeing the general standing before him stretched out his hands and said in a faint but earnest voice before eleven witnesses is she safe oh is she safe chapter iv sarah wilson left off crying and looked down on the ground with a very red face general rolleston was amazed is she safe is who safe said he he means my mistress replied wilson rather brusquely and flounced out of the hall she is safe no thanks to you said general rolleston what were you doing under her window at this time of night and the harsh tone in which this question was put showed seaton he was suspected this wounded him and he replied doggedly lucky for you all i was there that is no answer to my question said the general sternly it is all the answer i shall give you then i shall hand you over to the officer without another word do sir do said seaton bitterly but he added more gently you will be sorry for it when you come to your senses at this moment wilson entered with a message if you please sir miss rolleston says the robber had no beard miss have never noticed seatons face but his beard she have and oh if you please sir she begged me to ask himwas it you that fired the pistol and shot the robber the delivery of this ungrammatical message but rational query was like a ray of light streaming into a dark place it changed the whole aspect of things as for seaton he received it as if heaven was speaking to him through wilson his sullen air relaxed the water stood in his eyes he smiled affectionately and said in a low tender voice tell her i heard some bad characters talking about this housethat was a month agoso ever since then i have slept in the toolhouse to watch yes i shot the robber with my revolver and i marked one or two more but they were three to one i think i must have got a blow on the head for i felt nothing here he was interrupted by a violent scream from wilson she pointed downward with her eyes glaring and a little blood was seen to be trickling slowly over seatons stocking and shoe wounded said the generals servant tom in the businesslike accent of one who had seen a thousand wounds oh never mind that said seaton it cant be very deep for i dont feel it then fixing his eyes on general rolleston he said in a voice that broke down suddenly there stands the only man who has wounded me tonight to hurt me the way general rolleston received this pointblank reproach surprised some persons present who had observed only the imperious and iron side of his character he hung his head in silence a moment then being discontented with himself he went into a passion with his servants for standing idle run away you women said he roughly now tom if you are good for anything strip the man and stanch his wound andrew a bottle of port quick then leaving him for a while in friendly hands he went to his daughter and asked her if she saw any objection to a bed being made up in the house for the wounded convict oh papa said she why of course not i am all gratitude what is he like wilson for it is a most provoking thing i never noticed his face only his beautiful beard glittering in the sunshine ever so far off poor young man oh yes papa send him to bed directly and we will all nurse him i never did any good in the world yet and so why not begin at once general rolleston laughed at this squirt of enthusiasm from his staid daughter and went off to give the requisite orders but wilson followed him immediately and stopped him in the passage if you please sir i think you had better not i have something to tell you she then communicated to him by degrees her suspicion that james seaton was in love with his daughter he treated this with due ridicule at first but she gave him one reason after another till she staggered him and he went downstairs in a most mixed and puzzled frame of mind inclined to laugh inclined to be angry inclined to be sorry the officer had just arrived and was looking over some photographs to see if james seaton was one of his birds such alas was his expression at sight of this rolleston colored up but extricated himself from the double difficulty with some skill hexham said he this poor fellow has behaved like a man and got himself wounded in my service you are to take him to the infirmary but mind they must treat him like my own son and nothing he asks for be denied him seaton walked with feeble steps and leaning on two men to the infirmary and general rolleston ordered a cup of coffee lighted a cigar and sat cogitating over this strange business and asking himself how he could get rid of this young madman and yet befriend him as for sarah wilson she went to bed discontented and wondering at her own bad judgment she saw too late that if she had held her tongue seaton would have been her patient and her prisoner and as for miss rolleston when it came to the point why she would never have nursed him except by proxy and the proxy would have been sarah wilson however the blunder blind passion had led her into was partially repaired by miss rolleston herself when she heard next day where seaton was gone she lifted up her hands in amazement what could papa be thinking of to send our benefactor to a hospital and after meditating awhile she directed wilson to cut a nosegay and carry it to seaton he is a gardener said she innocently of course he will miss his flowers sadly in that miserable place and she gave the same order every day with a constancy that you must know formed part of this young ladys character soup wine and jellies were sent from the kitchen every other day with equal pertinacity wilson concealed the true donor of all those things and took the credit to herself by this means she obtained the patients gratitude and he showed it so frankly she hoped to steal his love as well but no his fancy and his heart remained true to the cold beauty he had served so well and she had forgotten him apparently this irritated wilson at last and she set to work to cure him with wholesome but bitter medicine she sat down beside him one day and said cheerfully we are all on the keyfeet just now miss rollestons beau is come on a visit the patient opened his eyes with astonishment miss rollestons beau ay her intended what didnt you know she is engaged to be married she engaged to be married gasped seaton wilson watched him with a remorseless eye why james said she after awhile did you think the likes of her would go through the world without a mate seaton made no reply but a moan and lay back like one dead utterly crushed by this cruel blow a buxom middleaged nurse now came up and said with a touch of severity come my good girl no doubt you mean well but you are doing ill you had better leave him to us for the present on this hint wilson bounced out and left the patient to his misery at her next visit she laid a nosegay on his bed and gossiped away talking of everything in the world except miss rolleston at last she came to a pause and seaton laid his hand on her arm directly and looking piteously in her face spoke his first word does she love him what still harping on her said wilson well she doesnt hate him i suppose or she would not marry him for pitys sake dont trifle with me does she love him la james how can i tell she maynt love him quite as much as i could love a man that took my fancy here she cast a languishing glance on seaton but i see no difference between her and other young ladies miss is very fond of her papa for one thing and he favors the match ay and she likes her partner well enough she is brighter like now he is in the house and she reads all her friends letters to him ever so lovingly and i do notice she leans on him out walking a trifle more than there is any need for at this picture james seaton writhed in his bed like some agonized creature under vivisection but the woman spurred by jealousy and also by egotistical passion had no mercy left for him and why not continued she he is young and handsome and rich and he dotes on her if you are really her friend you ought to be glad she is so well suited at this admonition the tears stood in seatons eyes and after awhile he got strength to say i know i ought i know it if he is only worthy of her as worthy as any man could be that he is james why ill be bound you have heard of him it is young mr wardlaw seaton started up in bed who wardlaw what wardlaw what wardlaw why the great london merchant his son leastways he manages the whole concern now i hear the old gentleman he is retired by all accounts curse him curse him curse him yelled james seaton with his eyes glaring fearfully and both hands beating the air sarah wilson recoiled with alarm that angel marry him shrieked seaton never while i live ill throttle him with these hands first what more his ungovernable fury would have uttered was interrupted by a rush of nurses and attendants and wilson was bundled out of the place with little ceremony he contrived however to hurl a word after her accompanied with a look of concentrated rage and resolution never i tell youwhile i live at her next visit to the hospital wilson was refused admission by order of the head surgeon she left her flowers daily all the same after a few days she thought the matter might have cooled and having a piece of news to communicate to seaton with respect to arthur wardlaw she asked to see that patient left the hospital this morning was the reply what cured why not we have cured worse cases than his where has he gone to pray tell me oh certainly and inquiry was made but the reply was left no address sarah wilson like many other women of high and low degree had swift misgivings of mischief to come she was taken with a fit of trembling and had to sit down in the hall and to tell the truth she had cause to tremble for that tongue of hers had launched two wild beastsjealousy and revenge when she got better she went home and cowardlike said not a word to living soul that day arthur wardlaw dined with general rolleston and helen they were to be alone for a certain reason and he came half an hour before dinner helen thought he would and was ready for him on the lawn they walked arminarm talking of the happiness before them and regretting a temporary separation that was to intervene he was her fathers choice and she loved her father devotedly he was her male property and young ladies like that sort of property especially when they see nothing to dislike in it he loved her passionately and that was her due and pleased her and drew a gentle affection if not a passion from her in return yes that lovely forehead did come very near young wardlaws shoulder more than once or twice as they strolled slowly up and down on the soft mossy turf and on the other side of the hedge that bounded the lawn a man lay crouched in the ditch and saw it all with gleaming eyes just before the affianced ones went in helen said i have a little favor to ask you dear the poor man seaton who fought the robbers and was woundedpapa says he is a man of education and wanted to be a clerk or something could you find him a place i think i can said wardlaw indeed i am sure a line to white co will do it they want a shipping clerk oh how good you are said helen and lifted her face all beaming with thanks the opportunity was tempting the lover fond two faces met for a single moment and one of the two burned for five minutes after the basilisk eyes saw the soft collision but the owner of those eyes did not hear the words that earned him that torture he lay still and bided his time general rollestons house stood clear of the town at the end of a short but narrow and tortuous lane this situation had tempted the burglars whom seaton baffled and now it tempted seaton wardlaw must pass that way on leaving general rollestons house at a bend of the lane two twin elms stood out a foot or two from the hedge seaton got behind these at about ten oclock and watched for him with a patience and immobility that boded ill his preparations for this encounter were singular he had a closeshutting inkstand and a pen and one sheet of paper at the top of which he had written sydney and the day of the month and year leaving the rest blank and he had the revolver with which he had shot the robber at helen rollestons window and a barrel of that arm was loaded with swan shot chapter v the moon went down the stars shone out clearer eleven oclock boomed from a church clock in the town wardlaw did not come and seaton did not move from his ambush twelve oclock boomed and wardlaw never came and seaton never moved soon after midnight general rollestons hall door opened and a figure appeared in a flood of light seatons eye gleamed at the light for it was young wardlaw with a footman at his back holding a lighted lamp wardlaw however seemed in no hurry to leave the house and the reason soon appeared he was joined by helen rolleston and she was equipped for walking the watcher saw her serene face shine in the light the general himself came next and as they left the door out came tom with a blunderbuss and brought up the rear seaton drew behind the trees and postponed but did not resign his purpose steps and murmurings came and passed him and receded the only words he caught distinctly came from wardlaw as he passed it is nearly high tide i fear we must make haste seaton followed the whole party at a short distance feeling sure they would eventually separate and give him his opportunity with wardlaw they went down to the harbor and took a boat seaton came nearer and learned they were going on board the great steamer bound for england that loomed so black with monstrous eyes of fire they put off and seaton stood baffled presently the black monster with enormous eyes of fire spouted her steam like a leviathan and then was still next the smoke puffed the heavy paddles revolved and she rushed out of the harbor and seaton sat down upon the ground and all seemed ended helen gone to england wardlaw gone with her love and revenge had alike eluded him he looked up at the sky and played with the pebbles at his feet stupidly stupidly he wondered why he was born why he consented to live a single minute after this his angel and his demon gone home together and he left here he wrote a few lines on the paper he had intended for wardlaw sprinkled them with sand and put them in his bosom then stretched himself out with a weary moan like a dying dog to wait the flow of the tide and with it death whether or not his resolution or his madness could have carried him so far cannot be known for even as the water rippled in and trickling under his back chilled him to the bone a silvery sound struck his ear he started to his feet and life and its joys rushed back upon him it was the voice of the woman he loved so madly helen rolleston was on the water coming ashore again in the little boat he crawled like a lizard among the boats ashore to catch a sight of her he did see her was near her unseen himself she landed with her father so wardlaw was gone to england without her seaton trembled with joy presently his goddess began to lament in the prettiest way papa papa she sighed why must friends part in this sad world poor arthur is gone from me and by and by i shall go from you my own papa and at that prospect she wept gently why you foolish child said the old general tenderly what matters a little parting when we are all to meet again in dear old england well then there have a cry it will do you good he patted her head tenderly as she clung to his warlike breast and she took him at his word the tears ran swiftly and glistened in the very starlight but oh how seatons heart yearned at all this what mustnt he say a word to comfort her he who at that moment would have thought no more of dying to serve her or to please her than he would of throwing one of those pebbles into that slimy water well her pure tears somehow cooled his hot brain and washed his soul and left him wondering at himself and his misdeeds this night his guardian angel seemed to go by and wave her dewy wings and fan his hot passions as she passed he kneeled down and thanked god he had not met arthur wardlaw in that dark lane then he went home to his humble lodgings and there buried himself and from that day seldom went out except to seek employment he soon obtained it as a copyist meantime the police were on his track employed by a person with a gentle disposition but a tenacity of purpose truly remarkable great was seatons uneasiness when one day he saw hexham at the foot of his stair greater still when the officers quick eye caught sight of him and his light foot ascended the stairs directly he felt sure hexham had heard of his lurking about general rollestons premises however he prepared to defend himself to the uttermost hexham came into his room without ceremony and looking mighty grim well my lad so we have got you after all what is my crime now asked seaton sullenly james said the officer very solemnly it is an unheardof crime this time you have been running away from a pretty girl now that is a mistake at all times but when she is as beautiful as an angel and rich enough to slip a flyer into dick hexhams hands and lay him on your track what is the use letter for you my man seaton took the letter with a puzzled air it was written in a clear but feminine hand and slightly scented the writer in a few polished lines excused herself for taking extraordinary means to find mr seaton but hoped he would consider that he had laid her under a deep obligation and that gratitude will sometimes be importunate she had the pleasure to inform him that the office of shipping clerk at messrs white cos was at his service and she hoped he would take it without an hours further delay for that she was assured that many persons had risen to wealth and consideration in the colony from such situations then as this wary but courteous young lady had no wish to enter into a correspondence with her exgardener she added mr seaton need not trouble himself to reply to this note a simple yes to mr hexham will be enough and will give sincere pleasure to mr seatons obedient servant and wellwisher helen anne rolleston seaton bowed his head over this letter in silent but deep emotion hexham respected that emotion and watched him with a sort of vague sympathy seaton lifted his head and the tears stood thick in his eyes said he in a voice of exquisite softness scarce above a whisper tell her yes and god bless her goodby i want to go on my knees and pray god to bless her as she deserves goodby hexham took the hint and retired softly chapter vi white co stumbled on a treasure in james seaton your colonial clerk is not so narrow and apathetic as your london clerk whose two objects seem to be to learn one department only and not to do too much in that but seaton a gentleman and a scholar eclipsed even colonial clerks in this that he omitted no opportunity of learning the whole business of white co and was also animated by a feverish zeal that now and then provoked laughter from clerks but was agreeable as well as surprising to white co of that zeal his incurable passion was partly the cause fortunes had been made with great rapidity in sydney and seaton now conceived a wild hope of acquiring one by some lucky hit before wardlaw could return to helen rolleston and yet his common sense said if i was as rich as croesus how could she ever mate with me a stained man and yet his burning heart said dont listen to reason listen only to me try and so he worked double tides and in virtue of his university education had no snobbish notions about never putting his hand to manual labor he would lay down his pen at any moment and bear a hand to lift a chest or roll a cask old white saw him thus multiply himself and was so pleased that he raised his salary one third he never saw helen rolleston except on sunday on that day he went to her church and sat half behind a pillar and feasted his eyes and his heart upon her he lived sparingly saved money bought a strip of land by payment of ten pounds deposit and sold it in forty hours for one hundred pounds profit and watched keenly for similar opportunities on a larger scale and all for her struggling with a mountain hoping against reason and the world white co were employed to ship a valuable cargo on board two vessels chartered by wardlaw son the shannon and proserpine both these ships lay in sydney harbor and had taken in the bulk of their cargoes but the supplement was the cream for wardlaw in person had warehoused eighteen cases of gold dust and ingots and fifty of lead and smelted copper they were all examined and branded by mr white who had duplicate keys of the gold cases but the contents as a matter of habit and prudence were not described outside but were marked proserpine and shannon respectively the mate of the proserpine who was in wardlaws confidence had written instructions to look carefully to the stowage of all these cases and was in and out of the store one afternoon just before closing and measured the cubic contents of the cases with a view to stowage in the respective vessels the last time he came he seemed rather the worse for liquor and seaton who accompanied him having stepped out for a minute for something or other was rather surprised on his return to find the door closed and it struck him mr wylie that was the mates name might be inside the more so as the door closed very easily with a spring bolt but it could only be opened by a key of peculiar construction seaton took out his key opened the door and called to the mate but received no reply however he took the precaution to go round the store and see whether wylie rendered somnolent by liquor might not be lying oblivious among the cases wylie however was not to be seen and seaton finding himself alone did an unwise thing he came and contemplated wardlaws cases of metal and specie men will go too near the thing that causes their pain he eyed them with grief and with desire and could not restrain a sigh at these material proofs of his rivals wealththe wealth that probably had smoothed his way to general rollestons home and to his daughters heart for wealth can pave the way to hearts ay even to hearts that cannot be downright bought this reverie no doubt lasted longer than he thought for presently he heard the loud rattle of shutters going up below it was closing time he hastily closed and locked the iron shutters and then went out and shut the door he had been gone about two hours and that part of the street so noisy in business hours was hushed in silence all but an occasional footstep on the flags outside when something mysterious occurred in the warehouse now as dark as pitch at an angle of the wall stood two large cases in a vertical position with smaller cases lying at their feet these two cases were about eight feet high more or less well behind these cases suddenly flashed a feeble light and the next moment two brown and sinewy hands appeared on the edge of one of the casesthe edge next the wall the case vibrated and rocked a little and the next moment there mounted on the top of it not a cat nor a monkey as might have been expected but an animal that in truth resembles both these quadrupeds viz a sailor and need we say that sailor was the mate of the proserpine he descended lightly from the top of the case behind which he had been jammed for hours and lighted a dark lantern and went softly groping about the store with it this was a mysterious act and would perhaps have puzzled the proprietors of the store even more than it would a stranger for a stranger would have said at once this is burglary or else arson but those acquainted with the place would have known that neither of those crimes was very practicable this enterprising sailor could not burn down this particular store without roasting himself the first thing and indeed he could not burn it down at all for the roof was flat and was in fact one gigantic iron tank like the roof of mr godings brewery in london and by a neat contrivance of american origin the whole tank could be turned in one moment to a showerbath and drown a conflagration in thirty seconds or thereabouts nor could he rifle the place the goods were greatly protected by their weight and it was impossible to get out of the store without raising an alarm and being searched but not to fall into the error of writers who underrate their readers curiosity and intelligence and so deluge them with comments and explanations we will now simply relate what wylie did leaving you to glean his motives as this tale advances his jacket had large pockets and he took out of them a bunch of eighteen bright steel keys numbered a set of new screwdrivers a flask of rum and two ship biscuits he unlocked the eighteen cases marked proserpine etc and peering in with his lantern saw the gold dust and small ingots packed in parcels and surrounded by australian wool of the highest possible quality it was a luscious sight he then proceeded to a heavier task he unscrewed one after another eighteen of the cases marked shannon and the eighteen so selected perhaps by private marks proved to be packed close and on a different system from the gold viz in pigs or square blocks three or in some cases four to each chest now these two ways of packing the specie and the baser metal respectively had the effect of producing a certain uniformity of weight in the thirtysix cases wylie was inspecting otherwise the gold cases would have been twice the weight of those that contained the baser metal for lead is proverbially heavy but under scientific tests is to gold as five to twelve or thereabouts in his secret and mysterious labor wylie was often interrupted whenever he heard a step on the pavement outside he drew the slide of his lantern and hid the light if he had examined the iron shutters he would have seen that his light could never pierce through them into the street but he was not aware of this notwithstanding these occasional interruptions he worked so hard and continuously that the perspiration poured down him ere he had unscrewed those eighteen chests containing the pigs of lead however it was done at last and then he refreshed himself with a draught from his flask the next thing was he took the three pigs of lead out of one of the cases marked shannon etc and numbered fifteen and laid them very gently on the floor then he transferred to that empty case the mixed contents of a case branded proserpine etc and this he did with the utmost care and nicety lest gold dust spilled should tell tales and so he went on and amused himself by shifting the contents of the whole eighteen cases marked proserpine etc into eighteen cases marked shannon etc and refilling them with the shannons lead frolicsome mr wylie then he sat down on one of the cases proserpined and ate a biscuit and drank a little rum not much for at this part of his career he was a very sober man though he could feign drunkenness or indeed anything else the gold was all at his mercy yet he did not pocket an ounce of it not even a pennyweight to make a weddingring for nancy rouse mr wylie had a conscience and a very original one it was and above all he was very true to those he worked with he carefully locked the gold cases up again and resumed the screwdriver for there was another heavy stroke of work to be done and he went at it like a man he carefully screwed down again one after another all those eighteen cases marked shannon which he had filled with gold dust and then heating a sailors needle redhot over his burning wick he put his own secret marks on those eighteen casesmarks that no eye but his own could detect by this time though a very powerful man he felt much exhausted and would gladly have snatched an hours repose but consulting his watch by the light of his lantern he found the sun had just risen he retired to his place of concealment in the same catlike way he had come out of itthat is to say he mounted on the high cases and then slipped down behind them into the angle of the wall as soon as the office opened two sailors whom he had carefully instructed overnight came with a boat for the cases the warehouse was opened in consequence but they were informed that wylie must be present at the delivery oh he wont be long said they told us he would meet us here there was a considerable delay and a good deal of talking and presently wylie was at their back and put in his word seaton was greatly surprised at finding him there and asked him where he had sprung from me said wylie jocosely why i hailed from davy joness locker last i never heard you come in said seaton thoughtfully well sir replied wylie civilly a man does learn to go like a cat on board ship that is the truth i came in at the door like my betters but i thought i heard you mention my name so i made no noise well here i am anyway andjack how many trips can we take these thundering chests in let us see eighteen for the proserpine and forty for the shannon is that correct sir perfectly then if you will deliver them ill check the delivery aboard the lighter there and then well tow her alongside the ships seaton called up two more clerks and sent one to the boat and one on board the barge the barge was within hail so the cases were checked as they passed out of the store and checked again at the small boat and also on board the lighter when they were all cleared out wylie gave seaton his receipt for them and having a steamtug in attendance towed the lighter alongside the shannon first seaton carried the receipt to his employer but sir said he is this regular for an officer of the proserpine to take the shannons cargo from us no it is not regular said the old gentleman and he looked through a window and summoned mr hardcastle hardcastle explained that the proserpine shipped the gold which was the more valuable consignment and that he saw no harm in the officer who was so highly trusted by the merchant on this and on former occasions taking out a few tons of lead and copper to the shannon well sir said seaton suppose i was to go out and see the chests stowed in those vessels i think you are making a fuss about nothing said hardcastle mr white was of the same opinion but being too wise to check zeal and caution told seaton he might go for his own satisfaction seaton with some difficulty got a little boat and pulled across the harbor he found the shannon had shipped all the chests marked with her name and the captain and mate of the proserpine were beginning to ship theirs he paddled under the proserpines stern captain hudson a rough salt sang out and asked him roughly what he wanted there oh it is all right said the mate he is come for your receipt and hewitts be smart now men two on board sixteen to come seaton saw the chests marked proserpine stowed in the proserpine and went ashore with captain hewitts receipt for forty cases on board the shannon and captain hudsons of eighteen on board the proserpine as he landed he met lloyds agent and told him what a valuable freight he had just shipped that gentleman merely remarked that both ships were underwritten in sydney by the owners but the freight was insured in london no doubt there was still something about this business seaton did not quite like perhaps it was in the haste of the shipments or in the manner of the mate at all events it was too slight and subtle to be communicated to others with any hope of convincing them and moreover seaton could not but own to himself that he hated wardlaw and was perhaps no fair judge of his acts and even of the acts of his servants and soon a blow fell that drove the matter out of his head and his heart miss helen rolleston called at the office and standing within a few feet of him handed hardcastle a letter from arthur wardlaw directing that the ladies cabin on board the shannon should be placed at her disposal hardcastle bowed low to beauty and station and promised her the best possible accommodation on board the shannon bound for england next week as she retired she cast one quiet glance round the office in search of seatons beard but he had reduced its admired luxuriance and trimmed it to a narrow mercantile point she did not know his other features from adam and little thought that young man bent double over his paper was her preserver and protege still less that he was at this moment cold as ice and quivering with misery from head to foot because her own lips had just told him she was going to england in the shannon heartbroken but still loving nobly seaton dragged himself down to the harbor and went slowly on board the shannon to secure miss rolleston every comfort then sick at heart as he was he made inquiries into the condition of the vessel which was to be trusted with so precious a freight and the old boatman who was rowing him hearing him make these inquiries told him he himself was always about and had noticed the shannons pumps were going every blessed night seaton carried this intelligence directly to lloyds agent he overhauled the ship and ordered her into the graving dock for repairs then seaton for white co wrote to miss rolleston that the shannon was not seaworthy and could not sail for a month at the least the lady simply acknowledged messrs whites communication and seaton breathed again wardlaw had made miss rolleston promise him faithfully to sail that month in his ship the shannon now she was a slave to her word and constant of purpose so when she found she could not sail in the shannon she called again on messrs white and took her passage in the proserpine the essential thing to her mind was to sail when she had promised and to go in a ship that belonged to her lover the proserpine was to sail in ten days seaton inquired into the state of the proserpine she was a good sound vessel and there was no excuse for detaining her then he wrestled long and hard with the selfish part of his great love instead of turning sullen he set himself to carry out helen rollestons will he went on board the proserpine and chose her the best stern cabin general rolleston had ordered helens cabin to be furnished and the agent had put in the usual things such as a standing bedstead with drawers beneath chest of drawers small table two chairs washstand lookingglass and swinging lamp but seaton made several visits to the ship and effected the following arrangements at his own cost he provided a neat cocoamat for her cabin deck for comfort and foothold he unshipped the regular sixpaned stern windows and put in singlepane plate glass he fitted venetian blinds and hung two little rosecolored curtains to each of the windows all so arranged as to be easily removed in case it should be necessary to ship deadlights in heavy weather he glazed the door leading to her bathroom and quarter gallery with plate glass he provided a light easychair slung and fitted with grommets to be hung on hooks screwed into the beams in the midship of the cabin on this helen could sit and read and so become insensible to the motion of the ship he fitted a small bookcase with a button which could be raised when a book might be wanted he fixed a strikebell in her maids cabin communicating with two strikers in helens cabin he selected books taking care that the voyages and travels were prosperous ones no seamans recorder lifeboat journal or shipwrecks and disasters in the british navy her cabin was the aftercabin on the starboard side was entered through the cuddy had a door communicating with the quarter gallery two stern windows and a deadeye on deck the maids cabin was the port aftercabin doors opened into cuddy and quartergallery and a fine trouble miss rolleston had to get a maid to accompany her but at last a young woman offered to go with her for high wages demurely suppressing the fact that she had just married one of the sailors and would have gladly gone for nothing her name was jane holt and her husbands michael donovan in one of seatons visits to the proserpine he detected the mate and the captain talking together and looking at him with unfriendly eyesscowling at him would hardly be too strong a word however he was in no state of mind to care much how two animals in blue jackets received his acts of selfmartyrdom he was there to do the last kind offices of despairing love for the angel that had crossed his dark path and illumined it for a moment to leave it now forever at last the fatal evening came her last in sydney then seatons fortitude sustained no longer by the feverish stimulus of doing kindly acts for her began to give way and he desponded deeply at nine in the evening he crept upon general rollestons lawn where he had first seen her he sat down in sullen despair upon the very spot then he came nearer the house there was a lamp in the diningroom he looked in and saw her she was seated at her fathers knee looking up at him fondly her hand was in his the tears were in their eyes she had no mother he no son they loved one another devotedly this their tender gesture and their sad silence spoke volumes to any one that had known sorrow poor seaton sat down on the dewy grass outside and wept because she was weeping her father sent her to bed early seaton watched as he had often done before till her light went out and then he flung himself on the wet grass and stared at the sky in utter misery the mind is often clearest in the middle of the night and all of a sudden he saw as if written on the sky that she was going to england expressly to marry arthur wardlaw at this revelation he started up stung with hate as well as love and his tortured mind rebelled furiously he repeated his vow that this should never be and soon a scheme came into his head to prevent it but it was a project so wild and dangerous that even as his heated brain hatched it his cooler judgment said fly madman fly or this love will destroy you he listened to the voice of reason and in another minute he was out of the premises he fluttered to his lodgings when he got there he could not go in he turned and fluttered about the streets not knowing or caring whither his mind was in a whirl and what with his bodily fever and his boiling heart passion began to overpower reason that had held out so gallantly till now he found himself at the harbor staring with wild and bloodshot eyes at the proserpine he who an hour ago had seen that he had but one thing to doto try and forget young wardlaws bride he groaned aloud and ran wildly back into the town he hurried up and down one narrow street raging inwardly like some wild beast in its den byandby his mood changed and he hung round a lamppost and fell to moaning and lamenting his hard fate and hers a policeman came up took him for a maudlin drunkard and halfadvised halfadmonished him to go home at that he gave a sort of fierce despairing snarl and ran into the next street to be alone in this street he found a shop open and lighted though it was but five oclock in the morning it was a barbers whose customers were working people haircutting sixpence easy shaving threepence hot coffee fourpence the cup seatons eye fell upon this shop he looked at it fixedly a moment from the opposite side of the way and then hurried on he turned suddenly and came back he crossed the road and entered the shop the barber was leaning over the stove removing a can of boiling water from the fire to the hob he turned at the sound of seatons step and revealed an ugly countenance rendered sinister by a squint seaton dropped into a chair and said i want my beard taken off the man looked at him if it could be called looking at him and said dryly oh do ye how much am i to have for that job you know your own charge of course i do threepence a chin very well be quick then stop a bit that is my charge to working folk i must have something more off you very well man ill pay you double my price to you is ten shillings why what is that for asked seaton in some alarm he thought in his confusion the man must have read his heart ill tell ye why said the squinting barber no i wont ill show ye he brought a small mirror and suddenly clapped it before seatons eyes seaton started at his own image wild ghastly and the eyes so bloodshot the barber chuckled this start was an extorted compliment to his own sagacity now wasnt i right said he did i ought to take the beard off such a mug as thatfor less than ten shillings i see groaned seaton you think i have committed some crime one man sees me weeping with misery he calls me a drunkard another sees me pale with the anguish of my breaking heart he calls me a felon may gods curse light on him and you and all mankind all right said the squinting barber apathetically my price is ten bob whether or no seaton felt in his pockets i have not got the money about me said he oh im not particular leave your watch seaton handed the squinting vampire his watch without another word and let his head fall upon his breast the barber cut his beard close with the scissors and made trivial remarks from time to time but received no reply at last extortion having put him in a good humor he said dont be so downhearted my lad you are not the first that has got into trouble and had to change faces seaton vouchsafed no reply the barber shaved him clean and was astonished at the change and congratulated him nobody will ever know you said he and ill tell you why your mouth it is inclined to turn up a little now a mustache it bends down and that alters such a mouth as yours entirely but ill tell you what taking off this beard shows me something you are a gentleman make it a sovereign sir seaton staggered out of the place without a word sulky eh muttered the barber he gathered up some of the long hair he had cut off seatons chin with his scissors admired it and put it away in paper while thus employed a regular customer looked in for his cup of coffee it was the policeman who had taken seaton for a convivial soul chapter vii general rollestons servants made several trips to the proserpine carrying boxes etc but helen herself clung to the house till the last moment oh papa she cried i need all my resolution all my good faith to keep my word with arthur and leave you why why did i promise why am i such a slave to my word because said the old general with a voice not so firm as usual i have always told you that a lady is not to be inferior to a gentleman in any virtue except courage ive heard my mother say so often and ive taught it to my helen and my girl where would be the merit of keeping our word if we only kept it when it cost us nothing he promised to come after in three months at furthest and the brave girl dried her tears as well as she could not to add to the sadness he fought against as gallantly as he had often fought the enemies of his country the proserpine was to sail at two oclock at a little before one a gentleman boarded her and informed the captain that he was a missionary the rev john hazel returning home after a fever and wished to take a berth in the proserpine the mate looked him full in the face and then told him there was very little accommodation for passengers and it had all been secured by white co for a young lady and her servants mr hazel replied that his means were small and moderate accommodation would serve him but he must go to england without delay captain hudson put in his gracious word then jump off the jetty at high tide and swim there no room for black coats in my ship mr hazel looked from one to the other piteously show me some mercy gentlemen my very life depends on it very sorry sir said the mate but it is impossible theres the shannon you can go in her but she is under repairs so i am told well there are a hundred and fifty carpenters on to her and she will come out of port in our wake now sir said hudson roughly bundle down the ships side again if you please this is a busy time hyrig the whip heres the lady coming off to us the missionary heaved a deep sigh and went down into the boat that had brought him but he was no sooner seated than he ordered the boatmen somewhat peremptorily to pull ashore as fast as they could row his boat met the rollestons father and daughter coming out and he turned his pale face and eyed them as he passed helen rolleston was struck with that sorrowful countenance and whispered her father that poor clergyman has just left the ship she made sure he had been taking leave of some beloved one bound for england general rolleston looked round but the boats had passed each other and the wan face was no longer visible they were soon on board and received with great obsequiousness helen was shown her cabin and observing the minute and zealous care that had been taken of her comfort she said somebody who loves me has been here and turned her brimming eyes on her father he looked quite puzzled but said nothing father and daughter were then left alone in the cabin till the ship began to heave her anchor she lay just at the mouth of the harbor and then the boatswain was sent to give general rolleston warning helen came up with him pale and distressed they exchanged a last embrace and general rolleston went down the ships side helen hung over the bulwarks and waved her last adieu though she could hardly see him for her tears at this moment a fouroared boat swept alongside and mr hazel came on board again he presented hudson a written order to give the rev john hazel a passage in the small berth abreast the main hatches it was signed for white co james seaton and was indorsed with a stamped acknowledgment of the passage money twentyseven pounds hudson and wylie the mate put their heads together over this the missionary saw them consulting and told them he had mentioned their mysterious conduct to messrs white co and that mr seaton had promised to stop the ship if their authority was resisted and i have paid my passage money and will not be turned out now except by force said the reverend gentleman quietly wylies head was turned away from mr hazels and on its profile a most gloomy vindictive look so much so that mr hazel was startled when the man turned his front face to him with a jolly genial air and said well sir the truth is we seamen dont want passengers aboard ships of this class they get in our way whenever it blows a capful however since you are here make yourself as comfortable as you can there that is enough palaver said the captain in his offensive way hoist the parsons traps aboard and sheer off you anchors apeak he then gave his orders in stentorian roars the anchor was hove up catted and fished one sail went up after another the proserpines head came round and away she bore for england with a fair wind general rolleston went slowly and heavily home and often turned his head and looked wistfully at the ship putting out wing upon wing and carrying off his child like a tiny prey to change the comparison it was only a tender vine detached from a great sturdy elm yet the tree thus relieved of its delicate encumbrance felt bare and a soft thing was gone that seeking protection had bestowed warmth had nestled and curled between the worlds cold wind and that stalwart stem as soon as he got home he lighted a cigar and set to work to console himself by reflecting that it was but a temporary parting since he had virtually resigned his post and was only waiting in sydney till he should have handed his papers in order over to his successor and settled one or two private matters that could not take three months when he had smoked his cigar and reasoned away his sense of desolation nature put out her hand and took him by the breast and drew him gently upstairs to take a look at his beloved daughters bedroom by way of seeing the last of her the room had one window looking south and another west the latter commanded a view of the sea general rolleston looked down at the floor littered with odds and endsthe dead leaves of dress that fall about a lady in the great process of packingand then gazed through the window at the flying proserpine he sighed and lighted another cigar before he had half finished it he stooped down and took up a little bow of ribbon that lay on the ground and put it quietly in his bosom in this act he was surprised by sarah wilson who had come up to sweep all such waifs and strays into her own box la sir said she rather crossly why didnt you tell me and id have tidied the room it is all huggermugger with miss aleaving and with this she went to the washstand to begin general rollestons eye followed her movements and he observed the water in one of the basins was rather red what said he has she had an accident cut her finger no sir said wilson her nose been bleeding then no sir not from her fingernor let me look he examined the basin narrowly and his countenance fell good heavens said he i wish i had seen this before she should not have gone today was it the agitation of parting oh no sir said wilson dont go to fancy that why it is not the first time by a many not the first faltered rolleston in heavens name why was i never told of this indeed sir said wilson eagerly you must not blame me sir it was as much as my place was worth to tell you miss is a young lady that will be obeyed and she gave me strict orders not to let you know but she is gone now and i always thought it was a pity she kept it so dark but as i was saying sir she would be obeyed kept what so dark why sir her spitting of blood at times and turning so thin by what she used to be poor dear young lady general rolleston groaned aloud and this she hid from me from me he said no more but kept looking bewildered and helpless first at the basin discolored by his daughters blood and then at the proserpine that was carrying her away perhaps forever and at the double sight his iron features worked with cruel distress anguish so mute and male that the woman wilson though not good for much sat down and shed genuine tears of pity but he summoned all his fortitude told wilson he could not say she was to blame she had but obeyed her mistresss orders and we must all obey orders but now said he it is me you ought to obey tell me does any doctor attend her none ever comes here sir but one day she let fall that she went to dr valentine him that has the name for disorders of the chest in a very few minutes general rolleston was at dr valentines house and asked him bluntly what was the matter with his daughter disease of the lungs said the doctor simply the unhappy father then begged the doctor to give him his real opinion as to the degree of danger and dr valentine told him with some feeling that the case was not desperate but was certainly alarming remonstrated with for letting the girl undertake a sea voyage he replied rather evasively at first that the air of sydney disagreed with his patient and a sea voyage was more likely to do her good than harm provided the weather was not downright tempestuous and who is to insure me against that asked the afflicted father why it is a good time of year said dr valentine and delay might have been fatal then after a slight hesitation the fact is sir said he i gathered from her servant that a husband awaits miss rolleston in england and i must tell you what of course i did not tell her that the sooner she enters the married state the better in fact it is her one chance in my opinion general rolleston pressed the doctors hand and went away without another word only he hurried his matters of business and took his passage in the shannon it was in something of a warriors spirit that he prepared to follow his daughter and protect her but often he sighed at the invisible insidious nature of the foe and wished it could have been a fair fight of bullets and bayonets and his own the life at stake the shannon was soon ready for sea but the gentleman who was to take general rollestons post met with something better and declined it general rolleston though chafing with impatience had to give up going home in the shannon but an influential friend mr adolphus savage was informed of his difficulty and obtained a years leave of absence for him and permission to put young savage in as his locum tenens which by the by is how politic men in general serve their friends the shannon sailed but not until an incident had occurred that must not be entirely passed over old mr white called on general rolleston with a long face and told him james seaton had disappeared stolen anything not a shilling indeed the last thing the poor fellow did was to give us a proof of his honesty it seems a passenger paid him twentyseven pounds for a berth in the proserpine just before she sailed well sir he might have put this in his pocket and nobody been the wiser but no he entered the transaction and the numbers of the notes and left the notes themselves in an envelope addressed to me what i am most afraid of is that some harm has come to him poor lad what day did he disappear the th of november the day my daughter sailed for england said general rolleston thoughtfully was it sir yes i remember she went in the proserpine general rolleston knitted his brows in silence for some time then he said ill set the detectives on his track not to punish him general we do not want him punished to punish him protect him or avenge him as the case may require was the reply uttered very gravely mr white took his leave general rolleston rang the bell and directed his servant to go for hexham the detective he then rang the bell again and sent for sarah wilson he put some searching questions to this woman and his interrogatory had hardly concluded when hexham was announced general rolleston dismissed the girl and looking now very grave indeed asked the detective whether he remembered james seaton that i do sir he has levanted taken much sir not a shilling gone to the diggings that you must find out what day was he first missed sir eleventh of november the very day miss rolleston left hexham took out a little greasy notebook and examined it eleventh of november said he then i almost think i have got a clew sir but i shall know more when i have had a word with two parties with this he retired but he came again at night and brought general rolleston some positive information with this however we shall not trouble the reader just here for general rolleston himself related it and the person to whom he did relate it and the attendant circumstances gave it a peculiar interest suffice it to say here that general rolleston went on board the shannon charged with curious information about james seaton and sailed for england in the wake of the proserpine and about two thousand miles astern chapter viii wardlaw was at home before this with his hands full of business and it is time the reader should be let into one secret at least which this merchant had contrived to conceal from the city of london and from his own father and from every human creature except one poor simple devoted soul called michael penfold there are men who seem stupid yet generally go right there are also clever men who appear to have the art of blundering wiselysapienter descendunt in infernum as the ancients have it and some of these latter will even lie on their backs after a fall and lift up their voices and prove to you that in the nature of things they ought to have gone up and their being down is monstrous illusory arthur wardlaw was not quite so clever as all that still he misconducted the business of the firm with perfect ability from the first month he entered on it like those ambitious railways which ruin a goodly trunk with excess of branches not to say twigs he set to work extending and extending and sent the sap of the healthy old concern flying to the ends of the earth he was not only too ambitious and not cool enough he was also unlucky or under a curse or something for things well conceived broke down in his hands under petty accidents and besides his new correspondents and agents hit him cruelly hard then what did he why shot good money after bad and lost both he could not retrench for his game was concealment his father was kept in the dark and drew his four thousand a year as usual and upon any hesitation in that respect would have called in an accountant and wound up the concern but this tax upon the receipts though inconvenient was a trifle compared with the series of heavy engagements that were impending the future was so black that wardlaw junior was sore tempted to realize twenty thousand pounds which a man in his position could easily do and fly the country but this would have been to give up helen rolleston and he loved her too well his brain was naturally subtle and fertile in expedients so he brought all its powers to bear on a double problemhow to marry helen and restore the concern he had mismanaged to its former state for this a large sum of money was needed not less than ninety thousand pounds the difficulties were great but he entered on this project with two advantages in the first place he enjoyed excellent credit in the second he was not disposed to be scrupulous he had been cheated several times and nothing undermines feeble rectitude more than that such a man as wardlaw is apt to establish a sort of account current with humanity several fellowcreatures have cheated me well i must get as much back by hook or by crook from several fellowcreatures after much hard thought he conceived his double masterstroke and it was to execute this he went out to australia we have seen that he persuaded helen rolleston to come to england and be married but as to the other part of his project that is a matter for the reader to watch as it develops itself his first act of business on reaching england was to insure the freights of the proserpine and the shannon he sent michael penfold to lloyds with the requisite vouchers including the receipts of the gold merchants penfold easily insured the shannon whose freight was valued at only six thousand pounds the proserpine with her cargo and a hundred and thirty thousand pounds of specie to boot was another matter some underwriters had an objection to specie being subject to theft as well as shipwreck other underwriters applied to by penfold acquiesced others called on wardlaw himself to ask a few questions and he replied to them courteously but with a certain nonchalance treating it as an affair which might be big to them but was not of particular importance to a merchant doing business on his scale to one underwriter condell with whom he was on somewhat intimate terms he said i wish i could insure the shannon at her value but that is impossible the city of london could not do it the proserpine brings me some cases of specie but my true treasure is on board the shannon she carries my bride sir oh indeed miss rolleston ah i remember you have seen her then you will not be surprised at a proposal i shall make you underwrite the shannon a million pounds to be paid by you if harm befalls my helen you need not look so astonished i was only joking you gentlemen deal with none but substantial values and as for me a million would no more compensate me for losing her than for losing my own life the tears were in his pale eyes as he said these words and mr condell eyed him with sympathy but he soon recovered himself and was the man of business again oh the specie on board the proserpine well i was in australia you know and bought that specie myself of the merchants whose names are attached to the receipts i deposited the cases with white co at sydney penfold will show you the receipt i instructed joseph wylie mate of the proserpine and a trustworthy person to see them stowed away in the proserpine by white co hudson is a good seaman and the proserpine a new ship built by mare we have nothing to fear but the ordinary perils of the sea so one would think said mr condell and took his leave but at the door he hesitated and then looking down a little sheepishly said mr wardlaw may i offer you a piece of advice certainly then double the insurance on the shannon if you can with these words he slipped out evidently to avoid questions he did not intend to answer wardlaw stared after him stupidly at first and then stood up and put his hand to his head in a sort of amazement then he sat down again ashy pale and with the dew on his forehead and muttered faintly doublethe insuranceof theshannon men who walk in crooked paths are very subject to such surprises doomed like ahab to be pierced through the joints of their armor by random shafts by words uttered in one sense but conscience interprets them in another it took a good many underwriters to insure the proserpines freight but the business was done at last then wardlaw who had feigned insouciance so admirably in that part of his interview with condell went without losing an hour and raised a large sum of money on the insured freight to meet the bills that were coming due for the gold for he had paid for most of it in paper at short dates and also other bills that were approaching maturity this done he breathed again safe for a month or two from everything short of a general panic and full of hope from his coming masterstroke but two months soon pass when a man has a flock of kites in the air pass they fly so now he looked out anxiously for his australian ships and went to lloyds every day to hear if either had been seen or heard of by steamers or by faster vessels than themselves and though condell had underwritten the proserpine to the tune of eight thousand pounds yet still his mysterious words rang strangely in the merchants ears and made him so uneasy that he employed a discreet person to sound condell as to what he meant by double the insurance of the shannon it turned out to be the simplest affair in the world condell had secret information that the shannon was in bad repairs so he had advised his friend to insure her heavily for the same reason he declined to underwrite her freight himself with respect to those ships our readers already know two things of which wardlaw himself nota bene had no idea namely that the shannon had sailed last instead of first and that miss rolleston was not on board of her but in the proserpine two thousand miles ahead to that your superior knowledge we posters of the sea and land are about to make a large addition and relate things strange but true while that anxious and plotting merchant strains his eyes seaward trying hard to read the future we carry you in a moment of time across the pacific and board the leading vessel the good ship proserpine homeward bound the ship left sydney with a fair wind but soon encountered adverse weather and made slow progress being close hauled which was her worst point of sailing she pitched a good deal and that had a very ill effect on miss rolleston she was not seasick but thoroughly out of sorts and in one week became perceptibly paler and thinner than when she started the young clergyman mr hazel watched her with respectful anxiety and this did not escape her feminine observation she noted quietly that those dark eyes of his followed her with a mournful tenderness but withdrew their gaze when she looked at him clearly he was interested in her but had no desire to intrude upon her attention he would bring up the squabs for her and some of his own wraps when she stayed on deck and was prompt with his arm when the vessel lurched and showed her those other little attentions which are called for on board ship but without a word yet when she thanked him in the simplest and shortest way his great eyes flashed with pleasure and the color mounted to his very temples engaged young ladies are for various reasons more sociable with the other sex than those who are still on the universal mockdefensive a ship like a distant country thaws even english reserve and women in general are disposed to admit ecclesiastics to certain privileges no wonder then that miss rolleston after a few days met mr hazel halfway and they made acquaintance on board the proserpine in monosyllables at first but the ice once fairly broken the intercourse of mind became rather rapid at first it was a mere intellectual exchange but one very agreeable to miss rolleston for a fine memory and omnivorous reading from his very boyhood with the habit of taking notes and reviewing them had made mr hazel a walking dictionary and a walking essayist if required but when it came to something which most of all the young lady had hoped from this temporary acquaintance viz religious instruction she found him indeed as learned on that as on other topics but cold and devoid of unction so much so that one day she said to him i can hardly believe you have ever been a missionary but at that he seemed so distressed that she was sorry for him and said sweetly excuse me mr hazel my remark was in rather bad taste i fear not at all said he of course i am unfit for missionary work or i should not be here miss rolleston took a good look at him but said nothing however his reply and her perusal of his countenance satisfied her that he was a man with very little petty vanity and petty irritability one day they were discoursing of gratitude and mr hazel said he had a poor opinion of those persons who speak of the burden of gratitude and make a fuss about being laid under an obligation as for me said he i have owed such a debt and found the sense of it very sweet but perhaps you were always hoping to make a return said helen that i was hoping against hope do you think people are grateful in general no miss rolleston i do not well i think they are to me at least why i have experienced gratitude even in a convict it was a poor man who had been transported for something or other and he begged papa to take him for his gardener papa did and he was so grateful that do you know he suspected our house was to be robbed and he actually watched in the garden night after night and what do you think the house was attacked by a whole gang but poor mr seaton confronted them and shot one and was wounded cruelly but he beat them off for us and was not that gratitude while she was speaking so earnestly mr hazels blood seemed to run through his veins like heavenly fire but he said nothing and the lady resumed with gentle fervor well we got him a clerks place in a shippingoffice and heard no more of him but he did not forget us my cabin here was fitted up with every comfort and every delicacy i thanked papa for it but he looked so blank i saw directly he knew nothing about it and now i think of it it was mr seaton i am positive it was poor fellow and i should not even know him if i saw him mr hazel observed in a low voice that mr seatons conduct did not seem wonderful to him still said he one is glad to find there is some good left even in a criminal a criminal cried helen rolleston firing up pray who says he was a criminal mr hazel once for all no friend of mine ever deserves such a name as that a friend of mine may commit some great error or imprudence but that is all the poor grateful soul was never guilty of any downright wickedness that stands to reason mr hazel did not encounter this feminine logic with his usual ability he muttered something or other with a trembling lip and left her so abruptly that she asked herself whether she had inadvertently said anything that could have offended him and awaited an explanation but none came the topic was never revived by mr hazel and his manner at their next meeting showed he liked her none the worse that she stood up for her friends the wind steady from the west for two whole days and the proserpine showed her best sailing qualities and ran four hundred and fifty miles in that time then came a dead calm and the sails flapped lazily and the masts described an arc and the sun broiled and the sailors whistled and the captain drank and the mate encouraged him during this calm miss rolleston fell downright ill and quitted the deck then mr hazel was very sad borrowed all the books in the ship and read them and took notes and when he had done this he was at leisure to read men and so began to study hiram hudson joseph wylie and others and take a few notes about them from these we select some that are better worth the readers attention than anything we could relate in our own persons at this stagnant part of the story passages from mr hazels diary characters on board the proserpine there are two sailors messmates who have formed an antique friendship their names are john welch and samuel cooper welch is a very able seaman and a chatterbox cooper is a good sailor but very silent only what he does say is much to the purpose the gabble of welch is agreeable to the silent cooper and welch admires coopers taciturnity i asked welch what made him like cooper so much and he said why you see sir he is my messmate for one thing and a seaman that knows his work and then he has been well eddycated and he knows when to hold his tongue does sam i asked cooper why he was so fond of welch he only grunted in an uneasy way at first but when i pressed for a reply he let out two wordscapital company and got away from me their friendship though often roughly expressed is really a tender and touching sentiment i think either of these sailors would bare his back and take a dozen lashes in place of his messmate i too once thought i had made such a friend eheu both cooper and welch seem by their talk to consider the ship a living creature cooper chews welch only smokes and often lets his pipe out he is so voluble captain hudson is quite a character or i might say two characters for he is one man when he is sober and another when he is the worse for liquor and that i am sorry to see is very often captain hudson sober is a rough bearish seaman with a quick experienced eye that takes in every rope in the ship as he walks up and down his quarterdeck he either evades or bluntly declines conversation and gives his whole mind to sailing his ship captain hudson drunk is a garrulous man who seems to have drifted back into the past he comes up to you and talks of his own accord and always about himself and what he did fifteen or twenty years since he forgets whatever has occurred half an hour ago and his eye which was an eagles is now a moles he no longer sees what his sailors are doing alow or aloft to be sure he no longer cares his present ship may take care of herself while he is talking of his past ones but the surest indicia of inebriety in hudson are these two first his nose is red secondly he discourses upon a seamans duty to his employers ebrius rings the changes on his duty to his employers till drowsiness attacks his hearers cicero de officiis was all very well at a certain period of ones life but bibulus nauta de officiis is rather too much n bexcept when his nose is red not a word about his duty to his employers that phrase like a fine lady never ventures into the morning air it is purely postprandial and sacred to occasions when he is utterly neglecting his duty to his employers and to everybody else all this is ridiculous enough but somewhat alarming to think that her precious life should be intrusted to the care and skill of so unreliable a captain joseph wylie the mate is less eccentric but even more remarkable he is one of those powerfully built fellows whom nature one would think constructed to gain all their ends by force and directness but no such thing he goes about as softly as a cat is always popping out of holes and corners and i can see he watches me and tries to hear what i say to her he is civil to me when i speak to him yet i notice he avoids me quietly altogether there is something about him that puzzles me why was he so reluctant to let me on board as a passenger why did he tell a downright falsehood for he said there was no room for me yet even now there are two cabins vacant and he has taken possession of them the mate of this ship has several barrels of spirits in his cabin or rather cabins and it is he who makes the captain drunk i learned this from one of the boys this looks ugly i fear wylie is a bad designing man who wishes to ruin the captain and so get his place but meantime the ship might be endangered by this drunkards misconduct i shall watch wylie closely and perhaps put the captain on his guard against this false friend last night a breeze got up about sunset and h r came on deck for half an hour i welcomed her as calmly as i could but i felt my voice tremble and my heart throb she told me the voyage tired her much but it was the last she should have to make how strange how hellish god forgive me for saying so it seems that she should love him but does she love him can she love him could she love him if she knew all know him she shall before she marries him for the present be still my heart she soon went below and left me desolate i wandered all about the ship and at last i came upon the inseparables welch and cooper they were squatted on the deck and welchs tongue was going as usual he was talking about this wylie and saying that in all his ships he had never known such a mate as this why the captain was under his thumb he then gave a string of captains each of whom would have given his mate a round dozen at the gangway if he had taken so much on him as this one does grog suggested cooper in extenuation welch admitted wylie was liberal with that and friendly enough with the men but still he preferred to see a ship commanded by the captain and not by a lubber like wylie i expressed some surprise at this term and said i had envied wylies nerves in a gale of wind we encountered early in the voyage the talking sailor explained in course he has been to sea afore this and weathered many a gale but so has the cook that dont make a man a sailor you ask him how to send down a togallant yard or gammon a bowsprit or even mark a lead line and hell stare at ye like old nick when the angel caught him with the redhot tongs and questioned him out of the church catechism ask sam there if ye dont believe me sam what do you think of this wylie for a seaman cooper could not afford anything so precious in his estimate of things as a word but he lifted a great brawny hand and gave a snap with his finger and thumb that disposed of the mates pretensions to seamanship more expressively than words could have done it the breeze has freshened and the ship glides rapidly through the water bearing us all homeward h r has resumed her place upon the deck and all seems bright again i ask myself how we existed without the sight of her this morning the wind shifted to the southwest the captain surprised us by taking in sail but his sober eye had seen something more than ours for at noon it blew a gale and by sunset it was deemed prudent to bring the ships head to the wind and we are now lying to the ship lurches and the wind howls through the bare rigging but she rides buoyantly and no danger is apprehended last night as i lay in my cabin unable to sleep i heard some heavy blows strike the ships side repeatedly causing quite a vibration i felt alarmed and went out to tell the captain but i was obliged to go on my hands and knees such was the force of the wind passing the mates cabin i heard sounds that made me listen acutely and i then found the blows were being struck inside the ship i got to the captain and told him oh said he ten to one its the mate nailing down his chests or the like but i assured him the blows struck the side of the ship and at my earnest request he came out and listened he swore a great oath and said the lubber would be through the ships side he then tried the cabin door but it was locked the sounds ceased directly we called to the mate but received no reply for a long time at last wylie came out of the gunroom looking rather pale and asked what was the matter i told him he ought to know best for the blows were heard where he had just come from blows said he i believe you why a tierce of butter had got adrift and was bumping up and down the hold like thunder he then asked us whether that was what we had disturbed him for entered his cabin and almost slammed the door in our faces i remarked to the captain on his disrespectful conduct the captain was civil and said i was right he was a crossgrained unmanageable brute and he wished he was out of the ship but you see sir he has got the ear of the merchant ashore and so i am obliged to hold a candle to the devil as the saying is he then fired a volley of oaths and abuse at the offender and not to encourage foul language i retired to my cabin the wind declined toward daybreak and the ship recommenced her voyage at a m but under treble reefed topsails and reefed courses i caught the captain and mate talking together in the friendliest way possible that hudson is a humbug there is some mystery between him and the mate today h r was on deck for several hours conversing sweetly and looking like the angel she is but happiness soon flies from me a steamer came in sight bound for sydney she signaled us to heave to and send a boat this was done and the boat brought back a letter for her it seems they took us for the shannon in which ship she was expected the letter was from him how her cheek flushed and her eye beamed as she took it and oh the sadness the agony that stood beside her unheeded i left the deck i could not have contained myself what a thing is wealth by wealth that wretch can stretch out his hand across the ocean and put a letter into her hand under my very eye away goes all that i have gained by being near her while he is far away he is not in england nowhe is here his odious presence has driven me from her oh that i could be a child again or in my grave to get away from this hell of love and hate at this point we beg leave to take the narrative into our own hands again mr hazel actually left the deck to avoid the sight of helen rollestons flushed cheek and beaming eyes reading arthur wardlaws letter and here we may as well observe that he retired not merely because the torture was hard to bear he had some disclosures to make on reaching england but his good sense told him this was not the time or the place to make them nor helen rolleston the person to whom in the first instance they ought to be made while he tries to relieve his swelling heart by putting its throbs on paper and in truth this is some faint relief for want of which many a less unhappy man than hazel has gone mad let us stay by the ladys side and read her letter with her russell square dec my dear lovehearing that the antelope steampacket was going to sydney by way of cape horn i have begged the captain who is under some obligations to me to keep a good lookout for the shannon homeward bound and board her with these lines weather permitting of course the chances are you will not receive them at sea but still you possibly may and my heart is so full of you i seize any excuse for overflowing and then i picture to myself that bright face reading an unexpected letter in midocean and so i taste beforehand the greatest pleasure my mind can conceivethe delight of giving you pleasure my own sweet helen news i have little you know how deeply and devotedly you are belovedknow it so well that i feel words are almost wasted in repeating it indeed the time i hope is at hand when the word love will hardly be mentioned between us for my part i think it will be too visible in every act and look and word of mine to need repetition we do not speak much about the air we live in we breathe it and speak with it not of it i suppose all lovers are jealous i think i should go mad if you were to give me a rival but then i do not understand that illnatured jealousy which would rob the beloved object of all affections but the one i know my helen loves her fatherloves him perhaps as well or better than she does me well in spite of that i love him too do you know i never see that erect form that model of courage and probity come into a room but i say to myself here comes my benefactor but for this man there would be no helen in the world well dearest an unexpected circumstance has given me a little military influence these things do happen in the city and i really believe that what with his acknowledged merits i am secretly informed a very high personage said the other day he had not received justice and the influence i speak of a post will shortly be offered to your father that will enable him to live henceforth in england with comfort i might say affluence perhaps he might live with us that depends upon himself looking forward to this and my own still greater happiness diverts my mind awhile from the one everpressing anxiety but alas it will return by this time my helen is on the seasthe terrible the treacherous the cruel seas that spare neither beauty nor virtue nor the longing hearts at home i have conducted this office for some years and thought i knew care and anxiety but i find i knew neither till now i have two ships at sea the shannon and the proserpine the proserpine carries eighteen chests of specie worth a hundred and thirty thousand pounds i dont care one straw whether she sinks or swims but the shannon carries my darling and every gust at night awakens me and every day i go into the great room at lloyds and watch the anemometer o god be merciful and bring my angel safe to me o god be just and strike her not for my offenses besides the direct perils of the sea are some others you might escape by prudence pray avoid the night air for my sake who could not live if any evil befell you and be careful in your diet you were not looking so well as usual when i left would i had words to make you know your own value then you would feel it a duty to be prudent but i must not sadden you with my fears let me turn to my hopes how bright they are what joy what happiness is sailing toward me nearer and nearer every day i ask myself what am i that such paradise should be mine my love when we are one shall we share every thought or shall i keep commerce speculation and its temptations away from your pure spirit sometimes i think i should like to have neither thought nor occupation unshared by you and that you would purify trade itself by your contact at other times i say to myself oh never soil that angel with your miserable business but go home to her as if you were going from earth to heaven for a few blissful hours but you shall decide this question and every other must i close this letter must i say no more though i have scarcely begun yes i will end since perhaps you will never see it when i have sealed it i mean to hold it in my clasped hands and so pray the almighty to take it safe to you and to bring you safe to him who can never know peace nor joy till he sees you once more your devoted and anxious lover arthur wardlaw helen rolleston read this letter more than once she liked it none the less for being disconnected and unbusinesslike she had seen her arthurs business letters models of courteous conciseness she did not value such compositions this one she did she smiled over it all beaming and blushing she kissed it and read it again and sat with it in her lap but by and by her mood changed and when mr hazel ventured upon deck again he found her with her forehead sinking on her extended arm and the lax hand of that same arm holding the letter she was crying the whole drooping attitude was so lovely so feminine yet so sad that hazel stood irresolute looking wistfully at her she caught sight of him and by a natural impulse turned gently away as if to hide her tears but the next moment she altered her mind and said with a quiet dignity that came naturally to her at times why should i hide my care from you sir mr hazel may i speak to you as a clergyman certainly said mr hazel in a somewhat faint voice she pointed to a seat and he sat down near her she was silent for some time her lip quivered a little she was struggling inwardly for that decent composure which on certain occasions distinguishes the lady from the mere woman and it was with a pretty firm voice she said what follows i am going to tell you a little secret one i have kept from my own father it isthat i have not very long to live her hazel eye rested calmly on his face while she said these words quietly he received them with amazement at first amazement that soon deepened into horror what do you mean he gasped what words are these thank you for minding so much said she sweetly i will tell you i have fits of coughing not frequent but violent and then blood very often comes from my lungs that is a bad sign you know i have been so for four months now and i am a good deal wasted my hand used to be very plump look at it now poor arthur she turned away her head to drop a gentle unselfish tear or two and hazel stared with increasing alarm at the lovely but wasted hand she still held out to him and glanced too at arthur wardlaws letter held slightly by the beloved fingers he said nothing and when she looked round again he was pale and trembling the revelation was so sudden pray be calm sir said she we need speak of this no more but now i think you will not be surprised that i come to you for religious advice and consolation short as our acquaintance is i am in no condition to give them said hazel in great agitation i can think of nothing but how to save you may heaven help me and give me wisdom for that this is idle said helen rolleston gently but firmly i have had the best advice for months and i get worse and mr hazel i shall never be better so aid me to bow to the will of heaven sir i do not repine at leaving the world but it does grieve me to think how my departure will affect those whose happiness is very very dear to me she then looked at the letter blushed and hesitated a moment but ended by giving it to him whom she had applied to as her religious adviser oblige me by reading that and when you have i think you will grant me a favor i wish to ask you poor fellow so full of hopes that i am doomed to disappoint she rose to hide her emotion and left arthur wardlaws letter in the hands of him who loved her if possible more devotedly than arthur wardlaw did and she walked the deck pensively little dreaming how strange a thing she had done as for hazel he was in a situation poignant with agony only the heavy blow that had just fallen had stunned and benumbed him he felt a natural repugnance to read this letter but she had given him no choice he read it in reading it he felt a mortal sickness come over him but he persevered he read it carefully to the end and he was examining the signature keenly when miss rolleston rejoined him and taking the letter from him placed it in her bosom before his eyes he loves me does he not said she wistfully hazel looked half stupidly in her face for a moment then with a candor which was part of his character replied doggedly yes the man who wrote that letter loves you then you can pity him and i may venture to ask you the favor to it will be a bitter grief and disappointment to him will you break it to him as gently as you can will you say that his helen will you tell him what i have told you i decline this pointblank refusal surprised helen rolleston all the more that it was uttered with a certain sullenness and even asperity she had never seen till then in this gentle clergyman it made her fear she had done wrong in asking it and she looked ashamed and distressed however the explanation soon followed my business said he is to prolong your precious life and making up your mind to die is not the way you shall have no encouragement in such weakness from me pray let me be your physician thank you said helen coldly i have my own physician no doubt but he shows me his incapacity by allowing you to live on pastry and sweets things that are utter poison to you disease of the lungs is curable but not by drugs and unwholesome food mr hazel said the lady we will drop the subject if you please it has taken an uninteresting turn to you perhaps but not to me excuse me sir if you took that real friendly interest in me and my condition i was vain enough to think you might you would hardly have refused me the first favor i ever asked you and drawing herself up proudly need i say the last you are unjust said hazel sadly unjust beyond endurance i refuse you anything that is for your good i who would lay down my life with unmixed joy for you mr hazel and she drew back from him with a haughty stare learn the truth why i cannot and will not talk to arthur wardlaw about you for one thing he is my enemy and i am his his enemy my arthurs his mortal enemy and i am going to england to clear an innocent man and expose arthur wardlaws guilt indeed said helen with lofty contempt and pray what has he done to you he had a benefactor a friend he entrapped him into cashing a note of hand which he must have known or suspected to be forged then basely deserted him at the trial and blasted his friends life forever arthur wardlaw did that he did and that very james seaton was his victim her delicate nostrils were expanded with wrath and her eyes flashed fire mr hazel you are a liar and a slanderer the man gave a kind of shudder as if cold steel had passed through his heart but his fortitude was great he said doggedly time will show time and a jury of our countrymen i will be his witness i will say this is the malice of a rival yes sir you forget that you have let out the motive of this wicked slander you love me yourself heaven forgive me for profaning the name of love heaven forgive you for blaspheming the purest fondest love that ever one creature laid at the feet of another yes helen rolleston i love you and will save you from the grave and from the villain wardlaw both from one and the other oh said helen clinching her teeth i hope this is true i hope you do love me you wretch then i may find a way to punish you for belying the absent and stabbing me to the heart through him her throat swelled with a violent convulsion and she could utter no more for a moment and she put her white handkerchief to her lips and drew it away discolored slightly with blood ah you love me she cried then know for your comfort that you have shortened my short life a day or two by slandering him to my face you monster look there at your love and see what it has done for me she put the handkerchief under his eyes with hate gleaming in her own mr hazel turned ashy pale and glared at it with horror he could have seen his own shed with stoical firmness but a mortal sickness struck his heart at the sight of her blood his hands rose and quivered in a peculiar way his sight left him and the strong man but tender lover staggered and fell heavily on the deck in a dead swoon and lay at her feet pale and motionless she uttered a scream and sailors came running they lifted him with rough sympathy and helen rolleston retired to her cabin panting with agitation but she had little or no pity for the slanderer she read arthur wardlaws letter again kissed it wept over it reproached herself for not having loved the writer enough and vowed to repair that fault poor slandered arthur said she from this hour i will love you as devotedly as you love me chapter ix after this helen rolleston and mr hazel never spoke she walked past him on the deck with cold and haughty contempt he quietly submitted to it and never presumed to say one word to her again only as his determination was equal to his delicacy miss rolleston found one day a paper on her table containing advice as to the treatment of disordered lungs expressed with apparent coldness and backed by a string of medical authorities quoted memoriter she sent this back directly indorsed with a line in pencil that she would try hard to live now she had a friend to protect from calumny but should use her own judgment as to the means yet women will be women she had carefully taken a copy of his advice before she cast it out with scorn he replied live with whatever motive you please only live to this she vouchsafed no answer nor did this unhappy man trouble her again until an occasion of a very different kind arose one fine night he sat on the deck with his back against the mainmast in deep melancholy and listlessness and fell at last into a doze from which he was wakened by a peculiar sound below it was a beautiful and stilly night all sounds were magnified and the father of all rats seemed to be gnawing the ship down below hazels curiosity was excited and he went softly down the ladder to see what the sound really was but that was not so easy for it proved to be below decks but he saw a light glimmering through a small scuttle abaft the mates cabin and the sounds were in the neighborhood of that light it now flashed upon mr hazel that this was the very quarter where he had heard that mysterious knocking when the ship was lying to in the gale upon this a certain degree of vague suspicion began to mingle with his curiosity he stood still a moment listening acutely then took off his shoes very quietly and moved with noiseless foot toward the scuttle the gnawing still continued he put his head through the scuttle and peered into a dark dismal place whose very existence was new to him it was in fact a vacant space between the cargo and the ships run this wooden cavern was very narrow but not less than fifteen feet long the candle was at the further end and between it and hazel a man was working with his flank turned toward the spectator this partly intercepted the light but still it revealed in a fitful way the huge ribs of the ship and her inner skin that formed the righthand partition so to speak of this black cavern and close outside those gaunt timbers was heard the wash of the sea there was something solemn in the close proximity of that tremendous element and the narrowness of the wooden barrier the bare place and the gentle monotonous wash of the liquid monster on that calm night conveyed to mr hazels mind a thought akin to davids as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death judge whether that thought grew weaker or stronger when after straining his eyes for some time to understand what was going on at that midnight hour in that hidden place he saw who was the workman and what was his occupation it was joseph wylie the mate his profile was illuminated by the candle and looked ghastly he had in his hands an auger of enormous size and with this he was drilling a great hole through the ships side just below the watermark an act the effect of which would be to let the sea bodily into the ship and sink her with every soul on board to the bottom of the pacific ocean i was stupefied and my hairs stood on end and my tongue clove to my jaws thus does one of virgils characters describe the effect his mind produced upon his body in a terrible situation mr hazel had always ridiculed that trite line as a pure exaggeration but he altered his opinion after that eventful night when he first saw what wylie was doing obstupuit he was merely benumbed but as his mind realized the fiendish nature of the act and its tremendous consequences his hair actually bristled and for a few minutes at least he could not utter a word in that interval of stupor matters took another turn the auger went in up to the haft then wylie caught up with his left hand a wooden plug he had got ready jerked the auger away caught up a hammer and swiftly inserted the plug rapid as he was a single jet of water came squirting viciously in but wylie lost no time he tapped the plug smartly with his hammer several times and then lifting a mallet with both hands rained heavy blows on it that drove it in and shook the ships side then hazel found his voice and he uttered an ejaculation that made the mate look round he glared at the man who was glaring at him and staggering backward trod on the light and all was darkness and dead silence all but the wash of the sea outside and that louder than ever but a short interval sufficed to restore one of the parties to his natural selfpossession lord sir said wylie how you startled me you should not come upon a man at his work like that we might have had an accident what were you doing said hazel in a voice that quavered in spite of him repairing the ship found a crack or two in her inner skin there let me get a light and ill explain it to you sir he groped his way out and invited mr hazel into his cabin there he struck a light and with great civility tendered an explanation the ship he said had labored a good deal in the last gale and he had discovered one or two flaws in her which were of no immediate importance but experience had taught him that in calm weather a ship ought to be kept tight as they say ashore a stitch in time saves nine but drilling holes in her is not the way said hazel sternly the mate laughed why sir said he what other way is there we cannot stop an irregular crack we can frame nothing to fit it the way is to get ready a plug measured a trifle larger than the aperture you are going to make then drill a round hole and force in the plug i know no other way than that and i was a ships carpenter for ten years before i was a mate this explanation and the manner in which it was given removed mr hazels apprehensions for the time being it was very alarming said he but i suppose you know your business nobody better sir said wylie why it is not one seaman in three that would trouble his head about a flaw in a ships inner skin but im a man that looks ahead will you have a glass of grog sir now you are here i keep that under my eye too between ourselves if the skipper had as much in his cabin as i have here that might be worse for us all than a crack or two in the ships inner skin mr hazel declined to drink grog at that time in the morning but wished him goodnight and left him with a better opinion of him than he had ever had till then wylie when he was gone drew a tumbler of neat spirits drank half and carried the rest back to his work yet wylie was a very sober man in a general way rum was his tool not his master when hazel came to think of it all next day he did not feel quite so easy as he had done the inner skin but when wylie withdrew his auger the water had squirted in furiously he felt it hard to believe that this keen jet of water could be caused by a small quantity that had found its way between the skin of the ship and her copper or her top booting it seemed rather to be due to the direct pressure of the liquid monster outside he went to the captain that afternoon and first told him what he had seen offering no solution the captain on that occasion was in an amphibious state neither wet nor dry and his reply was altogether exceptional he received the communication with pompous civility then swore a great oath and said he would put the mate in irons confound the lubber he will be through the ships bottom but stop a moment said mr hazel it is only fair you should also hear how he accounts for his proceeding the captain listened attentively to the explanation and altered his tone oh that is a different matter said he you need be under no alarm sir the thundering lubber knows what he is about at that work why he has been a ships carpenter all his life him a seaman if anything ever happens to me and joe wylie is set to navigate this ship then you may say your prayers he isnt fit to sail a washtub across a duckpond but ill tell you what it is added this worthy with more pomposity than neatness of articulation heres a respeckable passenger brought me a report do my duty to m employers andtake a look at the well he accordingly chalked a plumbline and went and sounded the well there were eight inches of water hudson told him that was no more than all ships contained from various causes in fact said he our pumps suck and will not draw at eight inches then suddenly grasping mr hazels hand he said in tearful accents dont you trouble your head about joe wylie or any such scum im skipper of the proserpine and a man that does his duty to z employers mr hazel sir id come to my last anchor in that well this moment if my duty to m employers required it d my eyes if i wouldnt lie down there this minute and never move to all eternity and a day after if it was my duty to m employers no doubt said hazel dryly but i think you can serve your employers better in other parts of the ship he then left him with a piece of advice to keep his eye upon that wylie mr hazel kept his own eye on wylie so constantly that at eleven oclock pm he saw that worthy go into the captains cabin with a quart bottle of rum the coast was clear the temptation great these men then were still deceiving him with a feigned antagonism he listened at the keyhole not without some compunction which however became less and less as fragments of the dialogue reached his ear for a long time the only speaker was hudson and his discourse ran upon his own exploits at sea but suddenly wylies voice broke in with an unmistakable tone of superiority belay all that chat and listen to me it is time we settled something ill hear what you have got to say and then youll do what i say better keep your hands off the bottle a minute you have had enough for the present this is business i know you are good for jaw but what are you game to do for the governor s money anything more than you have ever seen or heard tell of ye lubber replied the irritated skipper who has ever served his employers like hiram hudson keep that song for your quarterdeck retorted the mate contemptuously no on second thoughts just tell me how you have served your employers you old humbug give me chapter and verse to choose from come now the neptune well the neptune she caught fire a hundred leagues from land how came she to do that that is my business well i put her head before the wind and ran for the azores and i stuck to her sir till she was as black as a coal and we couldnt stand on deck but kept hopping like parched peas and fire belching out of her portholes forward then we took to the boats and saved a few bales of silk by way of sample of her cargo and got ashore and shed have come ashore too next tide and told tales but somebody left a keg of gunpowder in the cabin with a long fuse and blew a hole in her old ribs that the water came in and down she went hissing like ten thousand sarpints and nobody the wiser who lighted the fuse i wonder said wylie didnt i tell ye it was somebody said hudson hand me the stiff he replenished his glass and after taking a sip or two asked wylie if he had ever had the luck to be boarded by pirates no said wylie have you ay and they rescued me from a watery grave as the lubbers call it ye see i was employed by downes co down at the havanna and cleared for vera cruz with some boxes of old wornout printers type to print psalmbooks for the darkies no doubt suggested wylie insured as specie continued hudson ignoring the interruption well just at daybreak one morning all of a sudden there was a rakishlooking craft on our weatherbow lets fly a ninepounder across our forefoot and was alongside before my men could tumble up from below i got knocked into the sea by the boom and fell between the ships and the pirate he got hold of me and poured hot grog down my throat to bring me to my senses that is not what you use it for in general said wylie civil sort of pirate though pirate be dd that was my consort rigged out with a black flag and mounted with four ninepounders on one side and five dummies on the other he blustered a bit and swore and took our type and our cabbages i complained to downes ashore about the vagabond taking the vegetables and ordered us to leeward under all canvas and we never saw him againnot till he had shaved off his mustaches and called on downes to condole and say the varmint had chased his ship fifty leagues out of her course but he had got clear of him downes complimented me publicly says he this skipper boarded the pirate singlehanded only he jumped short and fell between the two ships and here he is by a miracle then he takes out his handkerchief and flops his head on my shoulder his merciful preservation almost reconciles me to the loss of my gold says the thundering crocodile cleared seventy thousand dollars he did out of the manhattan marine and gave the pirate and me but two hundred pounds between us both the rose said wylie what a hurry you are in pass the grog well the rose she lay off ushant we canted her to wash the decks lucky she had a careful commander not like kempenfelt whose eye was in his pocket and his fingers held the pen so he went to the bottom with lord knows how many men i noticed the squalls came very sudden so i sent most of my men ashore and got the boats ready in case of accident a squall did strike her and she was on her beamends in a moment we pulled ashore with two bales of silk by way of salvage and sample of what warnt in her hold when she settled down we landed and the frenchmen were dancing about with excitement captain says one you have much sang fraw insured munseer says i bone says he then there was the antelope lost in charge of a pilot off the hooghly i knew the water as well as he did we were on the port tack standing toward the shoal weather it as we should have done next tack and i should have failed in my duty to my employers anything but that look out said i pilot she forereaches in stays pilot was smoking those sandhead pilots smoke in bed and asleep he takes his cigar out of his mouth for one moment ready about says he hands bout ship helms alee raise tacks and sheets round she was coming like a top pilot smoking just as he was going to haul the mainsel somebody tripped against him and shoved the hot cigar in his eye he sung out and swore and there was no mainsel haul ship in irons tide running hard on to the shoal and before we could clear away for anchoring bumpthere she was hard and fast a stiff breeze got up at sunrise and she broke up next day i was sipping my grog and reading the bengal courier and it told the disastrous wreck of the brig antelope wrecked in charge of a pilot but no lives lost and the owners fully insured then there was the bark sally why you saw her yourself distressed on a lee shore yes said wylie i was in that tub the grampus and we contrived to claw off the scillies yet you in your smart sally got ashore what luck luck be blowed cried hudson angrily somebody got into the chains to sound and cut the weather halyards next tack the masts went over the side and i had done my duty lives were lost that time eh said wylie gravely what is that to you replied hudson with the sudden ire of a drunken man mind your own business pass me the bottle yes lives was lost and always will be lost in seagoing ships where the skipper does his duty there was a sight more lost at trafalgar owing to every man doing his duty lives lost ye lubber and why not mine because their time was come and mine wasnt for ill tell you one thing joe wylieif she takes fire and runs before the wind till she is as black as coal and belching flame through all her portholes and then explodes and goes aloft in ten thousand pieces no bigger than my hat or your knowledge of navigation hudson is the last man to leave her duty if she goes on her beamends and founders hudson sees the last of her and reports it to his employers duty if she goes grinding on scilly hudson is the last man to leave her bones duty some day perhaps i shall be swamped myself along with the craft i have escaped till now owing to not being insured but if ever my time should come and you should get clear promise me joe to see the owners and tell em hudson did his duty here a few tears quenched his noble ardor for a moment but he soon recovered and said with some little heat you have got the bottle again i never saw such a fellow to get hold of the bottle come heres duty to our employers and now ill tell you how we managed with the carysbrook and the amelia this promise was followed by fresh narratives in particular of a vessel he had run upon the florida reef at night where wreckers had been retained in advance to look out for signals and come on board and quarrel on pretense and set fire to the vessel insured at thrice her value hudson got quite excited with the memory of these exploits and told each successive feat louder and louder but now it was wylies turn well said he very gravely all this was childs play there was a pause that marked hudsons astonishment then he broke out childs play ye lubber if you had been there your gills would have been as white as your sunday shirt and a dd deal whiter come be civil said wylie i tell you all the ways you have told me are too suspicious our governor is a highflyer he pays like a prince and in return he must not be blown on if it is ever so little wylie says he a breath of suspicion would kill me make it so much says i and that breath shall never blow on you no no skipper none of those ways will do for us they have all been worked twice too often it must be done in fair weather and in a way fill your glass and ill fill mine capital rum this you talk of my gills turning white before long we shall see whose keeps their color best mine or yours my boy there was a silence during which hudson was probably asking himself what wylie meant for presently he broke out in a loud but somewhat quivering voice why you mad drunken devil of a ships carpenter redhot from hell i see what you are at now you are going hush cried wylie alarmed in his turn is this the sort of thing to bellow out for the watch to hear whisper now this was followed by the earnest mutterings of two voices in vain did the listener send his very soul into his ear to hear he could catch no single word yet he could tell by the very tones of the speakers that the dialogue was one of mystery and importance here was a situation at once irritating and alarming but there was no help for it the best thing now seemed to be to withdraw unobserved and wait for another opportunity he did so and he had not long retired when the mate came out staggering and flushed with liquor and that was a thing that had never occurred before he left the cabin door open and went into his own room soon after sounds issued from the cabinpeculiar sounds something between grunting and snoring mr hazel came and entered the cabin there he found the captain of the proserpine in a position very unfavorable to longevity his legs were crooked over the seat of his chair and his head was on the ground his handkerchief was tight round his neck and the man himself dead drunk and purple in the face mr hazel instantly undid his stock on which the gallant seaman muttered inarticulately he then took his feet off the chair and laid them on the ground and put the empty bottle under the animals neck but he had no sooner done all this than he had a serious misgiving would not this mans death have been a blessing might not his life prove fatal the thought infuriated him and he gave the prostrate figure a heavy kick that almost turned it over and the words duty to employers gurgled out of its mouth directly it really seemed as if these sounds were independent of the mind and resided at the tip of hudsons tongue so that a thorough good kick could at any time shake them out of his inanimate body thus do things ludicrous and things terrible mingle in the real world only to those who are in the arena the ludicrous passes unnoticed being overshadowed by its terrible neighbor and so it was with hazel he saw nothing absurd in all this and in that prostrate insensible hog commanding the ship forsooth and carrying all their lives in his hands he saw the mysterious and alarming only saw them so and felt them that he lay awake all night thinking what he should do and early next day he went into the mates cabin and said to him mr wylie in any other ship i should speak to the captain and not to the mate but here that would be no use for you are the master and he is your servant dont tell him so sir for he doesnt think small beer of himself i shall waste no more words on him it is to you i speak and you know i speak the truth here is a ship in which for certain reasons known to yourself the captain is under the mate well sir said wylie goodhumoredly it is no use trying to deceive a gentleman like you our skipper is an excellent seaman but he has got a fault then wylie imitated with his hand the action of a person filling his glass and you are here to keep him sober eh wylie nodded then why do you ply him with liquor i dont sir you do i have seen you do it a dozen times and last night you took rum into his room and made him so drunk he would have died where he lay if i had not loosed his handkerchief i am sorry to hear that sir but he was sober when i left him the fool must have got to the bottle the moment i was gone but that bottle you put in his way i saw you and what was your object to deaden his conscience with liquor his and your own while you made him your fiendish proposal man man do you believe in god and in a judgment to come for the deeds done in the body that you can plan in cold blood to destroy a vessel with nineteen souls on board besides the live stock the innocent animals that god pitied and spared when he raised his hand in wrath over nineveh of old while the clergyman was speaking with flashing eyes and commanding voice the seaman turned ashy pale and drew his shoulders together like a cat preparing to defend her life i plan to destroy a vessel sir you never heard me say such a word and dont you hint such a thing in the ship or you will get yourself into trouble that depends on you how so sir i have long suspected you you need not tell me that sir but i have not communicated my suspicions and now that they are certainties i come first to you in one word will you forego your intention since it is found out how can i forego what never was in my head said wylie cast away the ship why theres no land within two thousand miles founder a vessel in the pacific do you think my life is not as sweet to me as yours is to you wylie eyed him keenly to see the effect of these words and by a puzzled expression that came over his face saw at once he had assumed a more exact knowledge than he really possessed hazel replied that he had said nothing about foundering the ship but there were many ways of destroying one for instance said he i know how the neptune was destroyedand so do you how the rose and the antelope were cast awayand so do you at this enumeration wylie lost his color and selfpossession for a moment he saw hazel had been listening hazel followed up his blow promise me now by all you hold sacred to forego this villainy and i hold my tongue attempt to defy me or to throw dust in my eyes and i go instantly among the crew and denounce both you and hudson to them good heavens cried wylie in unfeigned terror why the men would mutiny on the spot i cant help that said hazel firmly and took a step toward the door stop a bit said the mate dont be in such a nation hurry for if you do it will be bad for me but worse for you the above was said so gravely and with such evident sincerity that mr hazel was struck and showed it wylie followed up that trifling advantage sit down a minute sir if you please and listen to me you never saw a mutiny on board ship ill be bound it is a worse thing than any gale that ever blew begins fair enough sometimes but how does it end in breaking into the spiritroom and drinking to madness plundering the ship ravishing the women and cutting a throat or so for certain you dont seem so fond of the picture as you was of the idea and then they might turn a deaf ear to you after all ship is well found in all stores provisions served out freely men in good humor and i have got their ear and now ill tell you why it wont suit your little game to blacken me to the crew upon the bare chance of a mutiny he paused for a moment then resumed in a lower tone and revealed himself the extraordinary man he was you see sir said he when a man is very ready to suspect me i always suspect him now you was uncommon ready to suspect me you didnt wait till you came on board you began the game ashore oh what that makes you open one eye does it you thought i didnt know you again knew you my man the moment you came aboard i never forget a face and disguises dont pass on me it was now hazels turn to look anxious and discomposed so then the moment i saw you suspected me i was down upon you well you come aboard under false colors we didnt want a chap like you in the ship but you would come what is the bloke after says i and watches you was so intent suspecting me of this that and tother that you unguarded yourself and that is common too im blowed if it isnt the lady you are after with all my heart only she might do better and i dont see how she could do worse unless she went to old nick for a mate now ill tell you what it is my man ive been in trouble myself and dont want to be hard on a poor devil just because he sails under an alias and lies as near the wind as he can to weather on the beaks and the bobbies but one good turn deserves another keep your dirty suspicions to yourself for if you dare to open your lips to the men in five minutes or less than that you shall be in irons and confined to your cabin and well put you ashore at the first port that flies the british flag and hand you over to the authorities till one of her majestys cruisers sends in a boat for you at this threat mr hazel hung his head in confusion and dismay come get out of my cabin parson alias shouted the mate and belay your foul tongue in this ship and dont make an enemy of joe wylie a man that will eat you up else and spit you out again and never brag sheer off i say and be dd to you mr hazel with a pale face and sick heart looked aghast at this dangerous man who could be fox or tiger as the occasion demanded surprised alarmed outwitted and outmenaced he retired with disordered countenance and uneven steps and hid himself in his own cabin the more he weighed the whole situation the more clearly did he see that he was utterly powerless in the hands of wylie a skipper is an emperor and hudson had the power to iron him and set him on shore at the nearest port the right to do it was another matter but even on that head wylie could furnish a plausible excuse for the act retribution if it came at all would not be severe and would be three or four years coming and who fears it much when it is so dilatory and so weak and so doubtful into the bargain he succumbed in silence for two days and then in spite of wylies threat he made one timid attempt to approach the subject with welch and cooper but a sailor came up instantly and sent them forward to reef topsails and whenever he tried to enter into conversation with the pair some sailor or other was sure to come up and listen then he saw that he was spotted or as we say nowadays picketed he was at his wits end he tried his last throw he wrote a few lines to miss rolleston requesting an interview aware of the difficulties he had to encounter here he stilled his heart by main force and wrote in terms carefully measured he begged her to believe he had no design to intrude upon her without absolute necessity and for her own good respect for her own wishes forbade this and also his selfrespect but said he i have made a terrible discovery the mate and the captain certainly intend to cast away this ship no doubt they will try and not sacrifice their own lives and ours but risk them they must in the very nature of things before troubling you i have tried all i could in the way of persuasion and menace but am defeated so now it rests with you you alone can save us all i will tell you how if you will restrain your repugnance and accord me a short interview need i say that no other subject shall be introduced by me in england should we ever reach it i may perhaps try to take measures to regain your good opinion but here i am aware that is impossible and i shall make no attempt in that direction upon my honor to this came a prompt and feminine reply the ship is mr arthur wardlaws the captain and the mate are able men appointed by him your suspicions of these poor men are calumnies and of a piece with your other monstrous slanders i really must insist on your holding no further communications of any sort with one to whom your character is revealed and odious h r this letter benumbed his heart at first a letter it was a blow a blow from her he loved and she hated him his longsuffering love gave way at last what folly and cruelty combined he could no longer make allowances for the spite of a woman whose lover had been traduced rage and despair seized him he bit his nails and tore his hair with fury and prayed heaven to help him hate her as she deserved the blind insolent idiot yes these bitter words actually came out of his mouth in a torrent of injury but to note down all he said in his rage would be useless and might mislead for this was a gust of fury and while it lasted the longsuffering man was no longer himself as a proof how little this state of mind was natural to him it stirred up all the bile in his body and brought on a severe attack of yellow jaundice accompanied by the settled dejection that marks that disorder meantime the proserpine glided on with a fair wind and a contented crew she was well found in stores and they were served out ungrudgingly every face on board beamed with jollity except poor hazels he crept about yellow as a guinea a very scarecrow the surgeon a humane man urged him to drink sherry and take strong exercise but persons afflicted with that distressing malady are obstinately set against those things which tend to cure it this is a feature of the disease mr hazel was no exception and then his heart had received so many blows it had no power left to resist the depressing effect of his disorder he took no exercise he ate little food he lay listless and dejected about the deck and let disease do what it pleased with him the surgeon shook his head and told hudson the parson was booked and good riddance of bad rubbish was that worthys gracious comment the ship now encountered an adverse gale and for three whole days was under closereefed topsails she was always a wet ship under stress of weather and she took in a good deal of water on this occasion on the fourth day it fell calm and captain hudson having examined the well and found three feet of water ordered the men to the pumps after working through one watch the well was sounded again and the water was so much reduced that the gangs were taken off and the ship being now becalmed and the weather lovely the men were allowed to dance upon deck to the boatswains fiddle while this pastime went on the sun large and red reached the horizon and diffused a roseate light over the entire ocean not one of the current descriptions of heaven approached the actual grandeur and beauty of the blue sky flecked with ruby and gold and its liquid mirror that lay below calm dimpled and glorified by that translucent rosy tint while the eye was yet charmed with this enchanting bridal of the sea and sky and the ear amused with the merry fiddle and the nimble feet that tapped the sounding deck so deftly at every note cooper who had been sounding the well ran forward all of a sudden and flung a thunderbolt in the midst a leak chapter x the fiddle ended in midtune and the men crowded aft with anxious faces the captain sounded the well and found three feet and a half water in it he ordered all hands to the pumps they turned to with a good heart and pumped watch and watch till daybreak their exertions counteracted the leak but did no more the water in the well was neither more nor less perceptibly this was a relief to their minds so far but the situation was a very serious one suppose foul weather should come and the vessel ship water from above as well now all those who were not on the pumps set to work to find out the leak and stop it if possible with candles in their hands they crept about the ribs of the ship narrowly inspecting every corner and applying their ears to every suspected place if haply they might hear the water coming in the place where hazel had found wylie at work was examined along with the rest but neither there nor anywhere else could the leak be discovered yet the water was still coming in and required unremitting labor to keep it under it was then suggested by wylie and the opinion gradually gained ground that some of the seams had opened in the late gale and were letting in the water by small but numerous apertures faces began to look cloudy and hazel throwing off his lethargy took his spell at the main pump with the rest when his gang was relieved he went away bathed in perspiration and leaning over the well sounded it while thus employed the mate came behind him with his catlike step and said see what has come on us with your forebodings it is the unluckiest thing in the world to talk about losing a ship when she is at sea you are a more dangerous man on board a ship than i am was hazels prompt reply the well gave an increase of three inches mr hazel now showed excellent qualities he worked like a horse and finding the mate skulking he reproached him before the men and stripping himself naked to the waist invited him to do a mans duty the mate thus challenged complied with a scowl they labored for their lives and the quantity of water they discharged from the ship was astonishing not less than hundred and ten tons every hour they gained upon the leakonly two inches but in the struggle for life this was an immense victory it was the turn of the tide a slight breeze sprung up from the southwest and the captain ordered the men from the buckets to make all sail on the ship the pumps still going when this was done he altered the ships course and put her right before the wind steering for the island of juan fernandez distant eleven hundred miles or thereabouts probably it was the best thing he could do in that awful waste of water but its effect on the seamen was bad it was like giving in they got a little disheartened and flurried and the cold passionless water seized the advantage it is possible too that the motion of the ship through the sea aided the leak the proserpine glided through the water all night like some terrorstricken creature and the incessant pumps seemed to be her poor heart beating loud with breathless fear at daybreak she had gone a hundred and twenty miles but this was balanced by a new and alarming feature the water from the pumps no longer came up pure but mixed with what appeared to be blood this got redder and redder and struck terror into the more superstitious of the crew even cooper whose heart was stout leaned over the bulwarks and eyed the red stream gushing into the sea from the lee scuppers and said aloud ay bleed to death ye bitch we shant be long behind ye hazel inquired and found the ship had a quantity of dyewood among her cargo he told the men this and tried to keep up their hearts by his words and his example he succeeded with some but others shook their heads and by and by even while he was working double tides for them as well as for himself ominous murmurs met his ear parson aboard man aboard with tother world in his face and there were sinister glances to match he told this with some alarm to welch and cooper they promised to stand by him and welch told him it was all the mates doings he had gone among the men and poisoned them the wounded vessel with her everbeating heart had run three hundred miles on the new tack she had almost ceased to bleed but what was as bad or worse small fragments of her cargo and stores came up with the water and their miscellaneous character showed how deeply the sea had now penetrated this and their great fatigue began to demoralize the sailors the pumps and buckets were still plied but it was no longer with the uniform manner of brave and hopeful men some stuck doggedly to their work but others got flurried and ran from one thing to another now and then a man would stop and burst out crying then to work again in a desperate way one or two lost heart altogether and had to be driven finally one or two succumbed under the unremitting labor despair crept over others their features began to change so much so that several countenances were hardly recognizable and each looking in the others troubled face saw his own fate pictured there six feet water in the hold the captain who had been sober beyond his time now got dead drunk the mate took the command on hearing this welch and cooper left the pumps wylie ordered them back they refused and coolly lighted their pipes a violent altercation took place which was brought to a close by welch it is no use pumping the ship said he she is doomed dye think we are blind my mate and me you got the longboat ready for yourself before ever the leak was sprung now get the cutter ready for my mate and me at these simple words wylie lost color and walked aft without a word next day there were seven feet water in the hold and quantities of bread coming up through the pumps wylie ordered the men from the pumps to the boats the longboat was provisioned and lowered while she was towing astern the cutter was prepared and the ship left to fill all this time miss rolleston had been kept in the dark not as to the danger but as to its extent great was her surprise when mr hazel entered her cabin and cast an ineffable look of pity on her she looked up surprised and then angry how dare you she began he waved his hand in a sorrowful but commanding way oh this is no time for prejudice or temper the ship is sinking we are going into the boats pray make preparations here is a list i have written of the things you ought to take we may be weeks at sea in an open boat then seeing her dumfounded he caught up her carpetbag and threw her workbox into it for a beginning he then laid hands upon some of her preserved meats and marmalade and carried them off to his own cabin his mind then flew back to his reading and passed in rapid review all the wants that men had endured in open boats he got hold of welch and told him to be sure and see there was plenty of spare canvas on board and sailing needles scissors etc also three bags of biscuit and above all a cask of water he himself ran all about the ship including the mates cabin in search of certain tools he thought would be wanted then to his own cabin to fill his carpetbag there was little time to spare the ship was low in the water and the men abandoning her he flung the things into his bag fastened and locked it strapped up his blankets for her use flung on his peajacket and turned the handle of his door to run out the door did not open he pushed it it did not yield he rushed at it it was fast he uttered a cry of rage and flung himself at it horror it was immovable chapter xi the fearful the sickening truth burst on him in all its awful significance some miscreant or madman had locked the door and so fastened him to the sinking ship at a time when in the bustle the alarm the selfishness all would be apt to forget him and leave him to his death he tried the door in every way he hammered at it he shouted he raged he screamed in vain unfortunately the door of this cabin was of very unusual strength and thickness then he took up one of those great augers he had found in the mates cabin and bored a hole in the door through this hole he fired his pistol and then screamed for help i am shut up in the cabin i shall be drowned oh for christs sake save me save me and a cold sweat of terror poured down his whole body what is that the soft rustle of a womans dress oh how he thanked god for that music and the hope it gave him it comes toward him it stops the key is turned the dress rustles away swift as a winged bird he dashes at the door it flies open nobody was near he recovered his courage in part fetched out his bag and his tools and ran across to the starboard side there he found the captain lowering miss rolleston with due care into the cutter and the young lady crying not at being shipwrecked if you please but at being deserted by her maid jane holt at this trying moment had deserted her mistress for her husband this was natural but as is the rule with persons of that class she had done this in the silliest and cruelest way had she given half an hours notice of her intention donovan might have been on board the cutter with her and her mistress but no being a liar and a fool she must hide her husband to the last moment and then desert her mistress the captain then was comforting miss rolleston and telling her she should have her maid with her eventually when hazel came he handed down his own bag and threw the blankets into the sternsheets then went down himself and sat on the midship thwart shove off said the captain and they fell astern but cooper with a boathook hooked on to the longboat and the dying ship towed them both five minutes more elapsed and the captain did not come down so wylie hailed him there was no answer hudson had gone into the mates cabin wylie waited a minute then hailed again hy on deck there hullo cried the captain at last why didnt you come in the cutter the captain crossed his arms and leaned over the stern dont you know that hiram hudson is always the last to leave a sinking ship well you are the last said wylie so now come on board the longboat at once i dare not tow in her wake much longer to be sucked in when she goes down come on board your craft and desert my own said hudson disdainfully know my duty to m employers better these words alarmed the mate curse it all he cried the fool has been and got some more rum fifty guineas to the man that will shin up the towrope and throw that madman into the sea then we can pick him up he swims like a cork a sailor instantly darted forward to the rope but unfortunately hudson heard this proposal and it enraged him he got to his cutlass the sailor drew the boat under the ships stern but the drunken skipper flourished his cutlass furiously over his head board me ye pirates the first that lays a finger on my bulwarks off goes his hand at the wrist suiting the action to the word he hacked at the towrope so vigorously that it gave way and the boats fell astern helen rolleston uttered a shriek of dismay and pity oh save him she cried make sail cried cooper and in a few seconds they got all her canvas set upon the cutter it seemed a hopeless chase for these shells to sail after that dying monster with her cloud of canvas all drawing alow and aloft but it did not prove so the gentle breeze was an advantage to light craft and the dying proserpine was full of water and could only crawl after a few moments of great anxiety the boats crept up the cutter on her port and the longboat on her starboard quarter wylie ran forward and hailing hudson implored him in the friendliest tones to give himself a chance then tried him by his vanity come and command the boats old fellow how can we navigate them on the pacific without you hudson was now leaning over the taffrail utterly drunk he made no reply to the mate but merely waved his cutlass feebly in one hand and his bottle in the other and gurgled out duty to m employers then cooper without a word double reefed the cutters mainsail and told welch to keep as close to the ships quarter as he dare wylie instinctively did the same and the three craft crawled on in solemn and deadly silence for nearly twenty minutes the wounded ship seemed to receive a deathblow she stopped dead and shook the next moment she pitched gently forward and her bows went under the water while her afterpart rose into the air and revealed to those in the cutter two splintered holes in her run just below the waterline the next moment her stern settled down the sea yawned horribly the great waves of her own making rushed over her upper deck and the lofty masts and sails remaining erect went down with sad majesty into the deep and nothing remained but the bubbling and foaming of the voracious water that had swallowed up the good ship and her cargo and her drunken master all stood up in the boats ready to save him but either his cutlass sunk him or the suction of so great a body drew him down he was seen no more in this world a loud sigh broke from every living bosom that witnessed that terrible catastrophe it was beyond words and none were uttered except by cooper who spoke so seldom yet now three words of terrible import burst from him and uttered in his loud deep voice rang like the sunk ships knell over the still bubbling water scuttledby god chapter xii hold your tongue said welch with an oath mr hazel looked at miss rolleston and she at him it was a momentary glance and her eyes sank directly and filled with patient tears for the first few minutes after the proserpine went down the survivors sat benumbed as if awaiting their turn to be ingulfed they seemed so little and the proserpine so big yet she was swallowed before their eyes like a crumb they lost for a few moments all idea of escaping but true it is that while theres life theres hope and as soon as their hearts began to beat again their eyes roved round the horizon and their elastic minds recoiled against despair this was rendered easier by the wonderful beauty of the weather there were men there who had got down from a sinking ship into boats heaving and tossing against her side in a gale of wind and yet been saved and here all was calm and delightful to be sure in those other shipwrecks land had been near and their greatest peril was over when once the boats got clear of the distressed ship without capsizing here was no immediate peril but certain death menaced them at an uncertain distance their situation was briefly this should it come on to blow a gale these open boats small and loaded could not hope to live therefore they had two chances for life and no more they must either make landor be picked up at seabefore the weather changed but how the nearest known land was the group of islands called juan fernandez and they lay somewhere to leeward but distant at least nine hundred miles and should they prefer the other chance then they must beat three hundred miles and more to windward for hudson underrating the leak as is supposed had run the proserpine fully that distance out of the track of trade now the ocean is a highwayin law but in fact it contains a few highways and millions of byways and once a cockleshell gets into those byways small indeed is its chance of being seen and picked up by any seagoing vessel wylie who was leading lowered his sail and hesitated between the two courses we have indicated however on the cutter coming up with him he ordered cooper to keep her head northeast and so run all night he then made all the sail he could in the same direction and soon outsailed the cutter when the sun went down he was about a mile ahead of her just before sunset mr hazel made a discovery that annoyed him very much he found that welch had put only one bag of biscuit a ham a keg of spirit and a small barrel of water on board the cutter he remonstrated with him sharply welch replied that it was all right the cutter being small he had put the rest of her provisions on board the longboat on board the longboat said hazel with a look of wonder you have actually made our lives depend upon that scoundrel wylie again you deserve to be flung into the sea you have no forethought yourself yet you will not be guided by those that have it welch hung his head a little at these reproaches however he replied rather sullenly that it was only for one night they could signal the longboat in the morning and get the other bags and the cask out of her but mr hazel was not to be appeased the morning why she sails three feet to our two how do you know he wont run away from us i never expect to get within ten miles of him again we know him and he knows we know him cooper got up and patted mr hazel on the shoulder soothingly boathook aft said he to welch he then by an ingenious use of the boathook and some of the spare canvas contrived to set out a studdingsail on the other side of the mast hazel thanked him warmly but oh cooper cooper said he id give all i have in the world if that bread and water were on board the cutter instead of the longboat the cutter had now two wings instead of one the water bubbling loud under her bows marked her increased speed and all fear of being greatly outsailed by her consort began to subside a slight seafret came on and obscured the sea in part but they had a good lantern and compass and steered the course exactly all night according to wylies orders changing the helmsman every four hours mr hazel without a word put a rug round miss rollestons shoulders and another round her feet oh not both sir please said she am i to be disobeyed by everybody said he then she submitted in silence and in a certain obsequious way that was quite new and well calculated to disarm anger sooner or later all slept except the helmsman at daybreak mr hazel was wakened by a loud hail from a man in the bows all the sleepers started up longboat not in sight it was too true the ocean was blank not a sail large or small in sight many voices spoke at once he has carried on till he has capsized her he has given us the slip unwilling to believe so great a calamity every eye peered and stared all over the sea in vain not a streak that could be a boats hull not a speck that could be a sail the little cutter was alone upon the ocean alone with scarcely two days provisions nine hundred miles from land and four hundred miles to leeward of the nearest searoad hazel seeing his worst forebodings realized sat down in moody bitter and boding silence of the other men some raged and cursed some wept aloud the lady more patient put her hands together and prayed to him who made the sea and all that therein is yet her case was the cruelest for she was by nature more timid than the men yet she must share their desperate peril and then to be alone with all these men and one of them had told her he loved her and hated the man she was betrothed to shame tortured this delicate creature as well as fear happy for her that of late and only of late she had learned to pray in earnest qui precari novit premi potest non potest opprimi it was now a race between starvation and drowning and either way death stared them in the face chapter xiii the longboat was at this moment a hundred miles to windward of the cutter the fact is that wylie the evening before had been secretly perplexed as to the best course he had decided to run for the island but he was not easy under his own decision and at night he got more and more discontented with it finally at nine oclock pm he suddenly gave the order to luff and tack and by daybreak he was very near the place where the proserpine went down whereas the cutter having run before the wind all night was at least a hundred miles to leeward of him not to deceive the reader or let him for a moment think we do business in monsters we will weigh this act of wylies justly it was just a piece of iron egotism he preferred for himself the chance of being picked up by a vessel he thought it was about a hairs breadth better than running for an island as to whose bearing he was not very clear after all but he was not sure he was taking the best or safest course the cutter might be saved after all and the longboat lost meantime he was not sorry of an excuse to shake off the cutter she contained one man at least who knew he had scuttled the proserpine and therefore it was allimportant to him to get to london before her and receive the three thousand pounds which was to be his reward for that abominable act but the way to get to london before mr hazel or else to the bottom of the pacific before him was to get back into the searoad at all hazards he was not aware that the cutters water and biscuit were on board his boat nor did he discover this till noon next day and on making this fearful discovery he showed himself human he cried out with an oath what have i done i have damned myself to all eternity he then ordered the boat to be put before the wind again but the men scowled and not one stirred a finger and he saw the futility of this and did not persist but groaned aloud and then sat staring wildly finally like a true sailor he got to the rum and stupefied his agitated conscience for a time while he lay drunk at the bottom of the boat his sailors carried out his last instructions beating southward right in the winds eye five days they beat to windward and never saw a sail then it fell dead calm and so remained for three days more the men began to suffer greatly from cramps owing to their number and confined position during the calm they rowed all day and with this and a light westerly breeze that sprung up they got into the searoad again but having now sailed three hundred and fifty miles to the southward they found a great change in the temperature the nights were so cold that they were fain to huddle together to keep a little warmth in their bodies on the fifteenth day of their voyage it began to rain and blow and then they were never a whole minute out of peril hand forever on the sheet eye on the waves to ease her at the right moment and with all this care the spray eternally flying half way over her mast and often a body of water making a clean breach over her and the men bailing night and day with their very hats or she could not have lived an hour at last when they were almost dead with wet cold fatigue and danger a vessel came in sight and crept slowly up about two miles to windward of the distressed boat with the heave of the waters they could see little more than her sails but they ran up a bright bandanna handkerchief to their masthead and the ship made them out she hoisted dutch colors andcontinued her course then the poor abandoned creatures wept and raved and cursed in their frenzy glaring after that cruel shameless man who could do such an act yet hoist a color and show of what nation he was the nativeand the disgrace but one of them said not a word this was wylie he sat shivering and remembered how he had abandoned the cutter and all on board loud sighs broke from his laboring breast but not a word yet one word was ever present to his mind and seemed written in fire on the night of clouds and howled in his ears by the windretribution and now came a dirty nightto men on ships a fearful night to men in boats the sky black the sea on fire with crested billows that broke over them every minute their light was washed out their provisions drenched and spoiled bail as they would the boat was always filling up to their knees in water cold as ice blinded with spray deafened with roaring billows they tossed and tumbled in a fiery foaming hell of waters and still though despairing clung to their lives and bailed with their hats unceasingly day broke and the first sight it revealed to them was a brig to windward staggering along and pitching under closereefed topsails they started up and waved their hats and cried aloud but the wind carried their voices to leeward and the brig staggered on they ran up their little signal of distress but still the ship staggered on then the miserable men shook hands all round and gave themselves up for lost but at this moment the brig hoisted a vivid flag all stripes and stars and altered her course a point or two she crossed the boats track a mile ahead and her people looked over the bulwarks and waved their hats to encourage those tossed and desperate men having thus given them the weathergage the brig hove to for them they ran down to her and crept under her lee down came ropes to them held by friendly hands and friendly faces shone down at them eager grasps seized each as he went up the ships side and so in a very short time they sent the woman up and the rest being all sailors and clever as cats they were safe on board the whaling brig maria captain slocum of nantucket u s their log compass and instruments were also saved the boat was cast adrift and was soon after seen bottom upward on the crest of a wave the good samaritan in command of the maria supplied them with dry clothes out of the ships stores good food and medical attendance which was much needed their legs and feet being in a deplorable condition and their own surgeon crippled a southeasterly gale induced the american skipper to give cape horn a wide berth and the maria soon found herself three degrees south of that perilous coast there she encountered fieldice in this labyrinth they dodged and worried for eighteen days until a sudden chop in the wind gave the captain a chance of which he promptly availed himself and in forty hours they sighted terra del fuego during this time the rescued crew having recovered from the effects of their hardships fell into the work of the ship and took their turns with the yankee seamen the brig was shorthanded but now trimmed and handled by a full crew with the proserpines men who were firstclass seamen and worked with a will because work was no longer a duty she exhibited a speed the captain had almost forgotten was in the craft now speed at sea means economy for every day added to a voyage is so much off the profits slocum was part owner of the vessel and shrewdly alive to the value of the seamen when about three hundred miles south of buenos ayres wylie proposed that they should be landed there from whence they might be transshipped to a vessel bound for home this was objected to by slocum on the ground that by such a deviation from his course he must lose three days and the port dues at buenos ayres were heavy wylie undertook that the house of wardlaw son should indemnify the brig for all expenses and losses incurred still the american hesitated at last he honestly told wylie he wished to keep the men he liked them they liked him he had sounded them and they had no objection to join his ship and sign articles for a three years whaling voyage provided they did not thereby forfeit the wages to which they would be entitled on reaching liverpool wylie went forward and asked the men if they would take service with the yankee captain all but three expressed their desire to do so these three had families in england and refused the mate gave the others a release and an order on wardlaw co for their full wages for the voyage then they signed articles with captain slocum and entered the american mercantile navy two days after this they sighted the high lands at the mouth of the rio de la plata at pm and lay to for a pilot after three hours delay they were boarded by a pilotboat and then began to creep into the port the night was very dark and a thin white fog lay on the water wylie was sitting on the taffrail and conversing with slocum when the lookout forward sung out sail ho another voice almost simultaneously yelled out of the fog port your helm suddenly out of the mist and close aboard the maria appeared the hull and canvas of a large ship the brig was crossing her course and her great bowsprit barely missed the brigs mainsail it stood for a moment over wylies head he looked up and there was the figurehead of the ship looming almost within his reach it was a colossal green woman one arm extended grasped a golden harp the other was pressed to her head in the attitude of holding back her wild and flowing hair the face seemed to glare down upon the two men in another moment the monster gliding on just missing the brig was lost in the fog that was a narrow squeak said slocum wylie made no answer but looked into the darkness after the vessel he had recognized her figurehead it was the shannon chapter xiv before the maria sailed again with the men who formed a part of wylies crew he made them sign a declaration before the english consul at buenos ayres this document set forth the manner in which the proserpine foundered it was artfully made up of facts enough to deceive a careless listener but when wylie read it over to them he slurred over certain parts which he took care also to express in language above the comprehension of such men of course they assented eagerly to what they did not understand and signed the statement conscientiously so wylie and his three men were shipped on board the boadicea bound for liverpool in old england while the others sailed with captain slocum for nantucket in new england the boadicea was a clipper laden with hides and a miscellaneous cargo for seventeen days she flew before a southerly gale being on her best sailing point and after one of the shortest passages she had ever made she lay to outside the bar off the mersey it wanted but one hour to daylight the tide was flowing the pilot sprang aboard what do you draw he asked of the master fifteen feet barely was the reply that will do and the vessels head was laid for the river they passed a large bark with her topsails backed ay remarked the pilot she has waited since the halfebb there aint more than four hours in the twentyfour that such craft as that can get in what is she an american liner asked wylie peering through the gloom no said the pilot shes an australian ship shes the shannon from sydney the mate started looked at the man then at the vessel twice the shannon had thus met him as if to satisfy him that his object had been attained and each time she seemed to him not an inanimate thing but a silent accomplice a chill of fear struck through the mans frame as he looked at her yes there she lay and in her hold were safely stowed pounds in gold marked lead and copper wylie had no luggage nor effects to detain him on board he landed and having bestowed his three companions in a sailors boardinghouse he was hastening to the shipping agents of wardlaw son to announce his arrival and the fate of the proserpine he had reached their offices in water street before he recollected that it was barely half past five oclock and though broad daylight on that july morning merchants offices are not open at that hour the sight of the shannon had so bewildered him that he had not noticed that the shops were all shut the streets deserted then a thought occurred to himwhy not be a bearer of his own news he did not require to turn the idea twice over but resolved for many reasons to adopt it as he hurried to the railway station he tried to recollect the hour at which the early train started but his confused and excited mind refused to perform the function of memory the shannon dazed him at the railwaystation he found that a train had started at am and there was nothing until this check sobered him a little and he went back to the docks he walked out to the farther end of that noble line of berths and sat down on the verge with his legs dangling over the water he waited an hour it was six oclock by the great dial at st georges dock his eyes were fixed on the shannon which was moving slowly up the river she came abreast to where he sat the few sails requisite to give her steerage fell her anchorchain rattled and she swung round with the tide the clock struck the halfhour a boat left the side of the vessel and made straight for the steps near where he was seated a tall noblelooking man sat in the sternsheets beside the coxswain he was put ashore and after exchanging a few words with the boats crew he mounted the steps which led him to wylies side followed by one of the sailors who carried a portmanteau he stood for a single moment on the quay and stamped his foot on the broad stones then heaving a deep sigh of satisfaction he murmured thank god he turned toward wylie can you tell me my man at what hour the first train starts for london there is a slow train at and an express at the express will serve me and give me time for breakfast at the adelphi thank you good morning and the gentleman passed on followed by the sailor wylie looked after him he noted that erect military carriage and crisp gray hair and thick white mustache he had a vague idea that he had seen that face before and the memory troubled him at wylie started for london the military man followed him in the express at and caught him up at rugby together they arrived at the station at euston square it was a quarter to three wylie hailed a cab but before he could struggle through the crowd to reach it a railway porter threw a portmanteau on its roof and his military acquaintance took possession of it all right said the porter what address sir wylie did not hear what the gentleman said but the porter shouted it to the cabman and then he did hear it no russell square it was the house of arthur wardlaw wylie took off his hat rubbed his frowzy hair and gaped after the cab he entered another cab and told the driver to go to no fenchurch street it was the office of wardlaw son chapter xv our scene now changes from the wild ocean and its perils to a snug room in fenchurch street the inner office of wardlaw son a large apartment paneled with fine old mellow spanish oak and all the furniture in keeping the carpet a thick axminster of sober colors the chairs of oak and morocco very substantial a large officetable with oaken legs like very columns substantial two milner safes a globe of unusual size with a handsome tent over it made of roan leather figured the walls hung with long oak boxes about eight inches broad containing rolled maps of high quality and great dimensions to consult which oaken scepters tipped with brass hooks stood ready with these the great maps could be drawn down and inspected and on being released flew up into their wooden boxes again besides these were hung up a few drawings representing outlines and inner sections of vessels and on a smaller table lay models almanacs etc the great officetable was covered with writing materials and papers all but a square space inclosed with a little silver rail and inside that space lay a purple morocco case about ten inches square it was locked and contained an exquisite portrait of helen rolleston this apartment was so situated and the frames of the plateglass windows so well made and substantial that let a storm blow a thousand ships ashore it could not be felt nor heard in wardlaws inner office but appearances are deceitful and who can wall out a sea of troubles and the tempests of the mind the inmate of that office was battling for his commercial existence under accumulated difficulties and dangers like those who sailed the proserpines longboat upon that dirty night which so nearly swamped her his eye had now to be on every wave and the sheet forever in his hand his measures had been ably taken but as will happen when clever men are driven into a corner he had backed events rather too freely against time had allowed too slight a margin for unforeseen delays for instance he had averaged the shannons previous performances and had calculated on her arrival too nicely she was a fortnight overdue and that delay brought peril he had also counted upon getting news of the proserpine but not a word had reached lloyds as yet at this very crisis came the panic of overend and gurney broke and wardlaws experience led him to fear that sooner or later there would be a run on every bank in london now he had borrowed pounds at one bank and pounds at another and without his ships could not possibly pay a quarter of the money if the banks in question were run upon and obliged to call in all their resources his credit must go and this in his precarious position was ruin he had concealed his whole condition from his father by false bookkeeping indeed he had only two confidants in the world poor old michael penfold and helen rollestons portrait and even to these two he made half confidences he dared not tell either of them all he had done and all he was going to do his redeeming feature was as bright as ever he still loved helen rolleston with a chaste constant and ardent affection that did him honor he loved money too well but he loved helen better in all his troubles and worries it was his one consolation to unlock her portrait and gaze on it and purify his soul for a few minutes sometimes he would apologize to it for an act of doubtful morality how can i risk the loss of you was his favorite excuse no he must have credit he must have money she must not suffer by his past imprudences they must be repaired at any costfor her sake it was ten oclock in the morning mr penfold was sorting the letters for his employer when a buxom young woman rushed into the outer office crying oh mr penfold and sank into a chair breathless dear heart what is the matter now said the old gentleman i have had a dream sir i dreamed i saw joe wylie out on the seas in a boat and the wind it was a blowing and the sea a roaring to that degree as joe looked at me and says he pray for me nancy rouse so i says oh dear joe what is the matter and what ever is become of the proserpine gone to hell says he which he knows i object to foul language gonethere says he and i am sailing in her wake oh pray for me nancy rouse with that i tries to pray in my dream and screams instead and wakes myself oh mr penfold do tell me have you got any news of the proserpine this morning what is that to you inquired arthur wardlaw who had entered just in time to hear this last query what is it to me cried nancy firing up it is more to me perhaps than it is to you for that matter penfold explained timidly sir mrs rouse is my landlady which i have never been to church with any man yet of the name of rouse leastways not in my waking hours edged in the lady miss rouse i should say said penfold apologizing i beg pardon but i thought mrs might sound better in a landlady please sir mr wylie the mate of the proserpine is herhersweetheart not he leastways he is only on trial after a manner of course sironly after a manner added penfold sadly perplexed miss rouse is incapable of anything else but if you please mm i dont presume to know the exact relation and then with great reserve but you know you are anxious about him miss rouse sniffed and threw her nose in the airas if to throw a doubt even on that view of the matter well madam says wardlaw i am sorry to say i can give you no information i share your anxiety for i have got pounds of gold in the ship you might inquire at lloyds direct her there mr penfold and bring me my letters with this he entered his inner office sat down took out a golden key opened the portrait of helen gazed at it kissed it uttered a deep sigh and prepared to face the troubles of the day penfold brought in a leathern case like an enormous billbook it had thirty vertical compartments and the names of various cities and seaports with which wardlaw son did business were printed in gold letters on some of these compartments on others the names of persons and on two compartments the word miscellaneous michael brought this machine in filled with a correspondence enough to break a mans heart to look at this was one of the consequences of wardlaws position he durst not let his correspondence be read and filtered in the outer office he opened the whole mass sent some back into the outer office then touched a handbell and a man emerged from the small apartment adjoining his own this was mr atkins his shorthand writer he dictated to this man some twenty letters which were taken down in shorthand the man retired to copy them and write them out in duplicate from his own notes and this reduced the number to seven these wardlaw sat down to write himself and lock up the copies while he was writing them he received a visitor or two whom he dispatched as quickly as his letters he was writing his last letter when he heard in the outer office a voice he thought he knew he got up and listened it was so of all the voices in the city this was the one it most dismayed him to hear in his office at the present crisis he listened on and satisfied himself that a fatal blow was coming he then walked quietly to his table seated himself and prepared to receive the stroke with external composure penfold announced mr burtenshaw show him in said wardlaw quietly mr burtenshaw one of the managers of morlands bank came in and wardlaw motioned him courteously to a chair while he finished his letter which took only a few moments while he was sealing it he half turned to his visitor and said no bad news morlands is safe of course well said burtenshaw there is a run upon our banka severe one we could not hope to escape the effects of the panic he then after an uneasy pause and with apparent reluctance added i am requested by the other directors to assure you it is their present extremity alone that in short we are really compelled to beg you to repay the amount advanced to you by the bank wardlaw showed no alarm but great surprise this was clever for he felt great alarm and no surprise the pounds said he why that advance was upon the freight of the proserpine fortyfive thousand ounces of gold she ought to be here by this time she is in the channel at this moment no doubt excuse me she is overdue and the underwriters uneasy i have made inquiries at any rate she is fully insured and you hold the policies besides the name of wardlaw on your books should stand for bullion burtenshaw shook his head names are at a discount today sir we cant pay you down on the counter why our depositors look cross at bank of england notes to an inquiry half ironical whether the managers really expected him to find pounds cash at a few hours notice burtenshaw replied sorrowfully that they felt for his difficulty while deploring their own but that after all it was a debt and in short if he could find no means of paying it they must suspend payment for a time and issue a statementand he hesitated to complete his sentence and wardlaw did it for him and ascribe your suspension to my inability to refund this advance said he bitterly i am afraid that is the construction it will bear wardlaw rose to intimate he had no more to say burtenshaw however was not disposed to go without some clear understanding may i say we shall hear from you sir yes and so they wished each other goodmorning and wardlaw sank into his chair in that quiet dialogue ruin had been inflicted and received without any apparent agitation ay and worse than ruinexposure morlands suspension on account of money lost by wardlaw son would at once bring old wardlaw to london and the affairs of the firm would be investigated and the sons false system of bookkeeping be discovered he sat stupefied awhile then put on his hat and rushed to his solicitor on the way he fell in with a great talker who told him there was a rumor the shannon was lost in the pacific at this he nearly fainted in the street and his friend took him back to his office in a deplorable condition all this time he had been feigning anxiety about the proserpine and concealing his real anxiety about the shannon to do him justice he lost sight of everything in the world now but helen he sent old penfold in hot haste to lloyds to inquire for news of the ship and then he sat down sick at heart and all he could do now was to open her portrait and gaze at it through eyes blinded with tears even a vague rumor which he hoped might be false had driven all his commercial maneuvers out of him and made all other calamities seem small and so they all are small compared with the death of the creature we love while he sat thus in a stupor of fear and grief he heard a wellknown voice in the outer office and next after burtenshaws it was the one that caused him the most apprehension it was his fathers wardlaw senior rarely visited the office now and this was not his hour so arthur knew something extraordinary had brought him up to town and he could not doubt that it was the panic and that he had been to morlands or would go there in course of the day but indeed it was more probable that he had already heard something and was come to investigate wardlaw senior entered the room goodmorning arthur said he ive got good news for you arthur was quite startled by an announcement that accorded so little with his expectations good newsfor me said he in a faint incredulous tone ay glorious news havent you been anxious about the shannon i have more anxious than i would own arthur started up the shannon god bless you father she lies at anchor in the mersey roared the old man with all a fathers pride at bringing such good news why the rollestons will be in london at see here is his telegram at this moment in ran penfold to tell them that the shannon was up at lloyds had anchored off liverpool last night there was hearty shaking of hands and arthur wardlaw was the happiest man in londonfor a little while got the telegram at elmtrees this morning and came up by the first express said wardlaw senior the telegram was from sir edward rolleston reached liverpool last night will be at euston twofifteen not a word from her oh there was no time to write and ladies do not use the telegram he added slyly perhaps she thought coming in person would do as well or better eh but why does he telegraph you instead of me i am sure i dont know what does it matter yes i do know it was settled months ago that he and helen should come to me at elmtrees so i was the proper person to telegraph ill go and meet them at the station there is plenty of time but i say arthur have you seen the papers bartley brothers obliged to wind up maple cox of liverpool gone atlantic trading terry brown suspended international credit gone old friends some of these hopley timms railway contractors failed sir liabilities seven hundred thousand pounds and more yes sir said arthur pompously will long be remembered for its revelations of commercial morality the old gentleman on this asked his son with excusable vanity whether he had done ill in steering clear of speculation he then congratulated him on having listened to good advice and stuck to legitimate business i must say arthur added be your books are models for any trading firm arthur winced in secret under this praise for it occurred to him that in a few days his father would discover those books were all a sham and the accounts a fabrication however the unpleasant topic was soon interrupted and effectually too for michael looked in with an air of satisfaction on his benevolent countenance and said gentlemen such an arrival here is miss rouses sweetheart that she dreamed was drowned what is the man to me said arthur peevishly he did not recognize wylie under that title la mr arthur why he is the mate of the proserpine said penfold what wylie joseph wylie cried arthur in a sudden excitement that contrasted strangely with his previous indifference what is that cried wardlaw senior the proserpine show him in at once now this caused arthur wardlaw considerable anxiety for obvious reasons he did not want his father and this sailor to exchange a word together however that was inevitable now the door opened and the bronzed face and sturdy figure of wylie clad in a rough peajacket came slouching in arthur went hastily to meet him and gave him an expressive look of warning even while he welcomed him in cordial accents glad to see you safe home said wardlaw senior thank ye guvnor said wylie had a squeak for it this time where is your ship wylie shook his head sorrowfully bottom of the pacific good heavens what is she lost that she is sir foundered at sea twelve hundred miles from the horn and more and the freight the gold put in arthur with wellfeigned anxiety not an ounce saved said wylie disconsolately a hundred and sixty thousand pounds gone to the bottom good heavens ye see sir said wylie the ship encountered one gale after another and labored a good deal first and last and we all say her seams must have opened for we never could find the leak that sunk her and he cast a meaning glance at arthur wardlaw no matter how it happened said the old merchant are we insured to the full that is the first question to the last shilling well done arthur but still it is most unlucky some weeks must elapse before the insurances can be realized and a portion of the gold was paid for in bills at short date the rest in cash cash and merchandise then there is the proper margin draw on my private account at the bank of england these few simple words showed the struggling young merchant a way out of all his difficulties his heart leaped so he dared not reply lest he should excite the old gentlemans suspicions but ere he could well draw his breath for joy came a freezer mr burtenshaw sir bid him wait said arthur aloud and cast a look of great anxiety on penfold which the poor old man with all his simplicity comprehended well enough burtenshaw from morlands what does he want of us said wardlaw senior knitting his brows arthur turned cold all over perhaps to ask me not to draw out my balance it is less than usual but they are run upon and as you are good enough to let me draw on you by the by perhaps you will sign a check before you go to the station how much do you want i really dont know till i have consulted penfold the gold was a large and advantageous purchase sir no doubt no doubt ill give you my signature and you can fill in the amount he drew a check in favor of arthur wardlaw signed it and left him to fill in the figures he then looked at his watch and remarked they would barely have time to get to the station good heavens cried arthur and i cant go i must learn the particulars of the loss of the proserpine and prepare the statement at once for the underwriters well never mind i can go but what will she think of me i ought to be the first to welcome her ill make your excuses no no say nothing after all it was you who received the telegram so you naturally meet her but you will bring her here father you wont whisk my darling down to elmtrees till you have blessed me with the sight of her i will not be so cruel fond lover said old wardlaw laughing and took up his hat and gloves to go arthur went to the door with him in great anxiety lest he should question burtenshaw but peering into the outer office he observed burtenshaw was not there michael had caught his employers anxious look and conveyed the banker into the small room where the shorthand writer was at work but burtenshaw was one of a struggling firm to him every minute was an hour he had sat fuming with impatience so long as he heard talking in the inner office and the moment it ceased he took the liberty of coming in so that he opened the side door just as wardlaw senior was passing through the center door instantly wardlaw junior whipped before him to hide his figure from his retreating father wyliewho all this time had been sitting silent looking from one to the other and quietly puzzling out the game as well as he couldobserved this movement and grinned as for arthur wardlaw he saw his father safe out then gave a sigh of relief and walked to his office table and sat down and began to fill in the check burtenshaw drew near and said i am instructed to say that fifty thousand pounds on account will be accepted perhaps if this proposal had been made a few seconds sooner the ingenious arthur would have availed himself of it but as it was he preferred to take the high and mighty tone i decline any concession said he mr penfold take this check to the bank of england pounds s that is the amount capital and interest up to noon this day hand the sum to mr burtenshaw taking his receipt or if he prefers it pay it across his counter to my credit that will perhaps arrest the run burtenshaw stammered out his thanks wardlaw cut him short goodmorning sir said he i have business of importance goodday and bowed him out this is a highflier thought burtenshaw wardlaw then opened the side door and called his shorthand writer mr atkins please step into the outer office and dont let a soul come in to me mind i am out for the day except to miss rolleston and her father he then closed all the doors and sunk exhausted into a chair muttering thank heaven i have got rid of them all for an hour or two now wylie wylie seemed in no hurry to enter upon the required subject said he evasively why guvnor it seems to me you are among the breakers here yourself nothing of the sort if you have managed your work cleverly come tell me all before we are interrupted again tell ye all about it why theres part ont i am afraid to think on let alone talk about it spare me your scruples and give me your facts said wardlaw coldly first of all did you succeed in shifting the bullion as agreed the sailor appeared relieved by this question oh that is all right said he i got the bullion safe aboard the shannon marked for lead and the lead on board the proserpine ay shipped as bullion without suspicion not quite great heaven who one clerk at the shipping agents scented something queer i think james seaton that was the name he went by could he prove anything nothing he knew nothing for certain and what he guessed wont never be known in england now and wylie fidgeted in his chair notwithstanding this assurance wardlaw looked grave and took a note of that clerks name then he begged wylie to go on give me all the details said he leave me to judge their relative value you scuttled the ship dont say that dont say that cried wylie in a low but eager voice stone walls have ears then rather more loudly than was necessary ship sprung a leak that neither the captain nor i nor anybody could find to stop me and my men we all think her seams opened with stress of weather then lowering his voice again try and see it as we do and dont you ever use such a word as that what come out of your lips just now we pumped her hard but twarnt no use she filled and we had to take to the boats stop a moment was there any suspicion excited not among the crew and suppose there was i could talk em all over or buy em all over what few of em is left ive got em all with me in one house and they are all square dont you fear well but you said among the crew whom else can we have to fear why nobody to be sure one of the passengers was down on me but what does that matter now it matters greatlyit matters terribly who was this passenger he called himself the reverend john hazel he suspected something or other and what with listening here and watching there he judged the ship was never to see england and i always fancied he told the lady what was there a lady there ay worse luck sir and a pretty girl she was coming home to england to die of consumption so our surgeon told me well never mind her the clergyman this fills me with anxiety a clerk suspecting us at sydney and a passenger suspecting us in the vessel there are two witnesses against us already no only one how do you make that out why whites clerk and the parson they was one man wardlaw stared in utter amazement dont ye believe me said wylie i tell ye that there clerk boarded us under an alias he had shaved off his beard but bless your heart i knew him directly he came to verify his suspicions suggested wardlaw in a faint voice not he he came for love of the sick girl and nothing else and youll never see either him or her if that is any comfort to you be good enough to conceal nothing facts must be faced that is too true sir well we abandoned her and took to the boats i commanded one and hudson the other hudson no why how was that and what has become of him what has become of hudson said wylie with a start theres a question and not a drop to wet my lips and warm my heart is this a tale to tell dry cant ye spare a drop of brandy to a poor devil that has earned ye pounds and risked his life and wrecked his soul to do it wardlaw cast a glance of contempt on him but got up and speedily put a bottle of old brandy a tumbler and a caraffe of water on the table before him wylie drank a wineglassful neat and gave a sort of sigh of satisfaction and then ensued a dialogue in which curiously enough the brave man was agitated and the timid man was cool and collected but one reason was the latter had not imagination enough to realize things unseen though he had caused them wylie told him how hudson got to the bottle and would not leave the ship i think i see him now with his cutlass in one hand and his rum bottle in the other and the waves running over his poor silly face as she went down poor hiram he and i had made many a trip together before we took to this and wylie shuddered and took another gulp at the brandy while he was drinking to drown the picture wardlaw was calmly reflecting on the bare fact hum said he we must use that circumstance ill get it into the journals heroic captain went down with the ship who can suspect hudson in the teeth of such a fact now pray go on my good wylie the boats well sir i had the surgeon and ten men and the ladys maid on board the longboat and there was the parson the sick lady and five sailors aboard the cutter we sailed together till night steering for juan fernandez then a fog came on and we lost sight of the cutter and i altered my mind and judged it best to beat to winard and get into the track of ships which we did and were nearly swamped in a sou wester but by good luck a yankee whaler picked us up and took us to buenos ayres where we shipped for england what was left of us only four besides myself but i got the signatures of the others to my tale of the wreck it is all as square as a die i tell you well done well done but stop the other boat with that sham parson on board who knows all she will be picked up too perhaps there is no chance for that she was out of the tracks of trade and ill tell ye the truth sir he poured out half a tumbler of brandy and drank a part of it and now for the first time his hand trembled as he lifted the glass some fool had put the main of her provisions aboard the longboat that is what sticks to me and wont let me sleep we took a chance but we didnt give one i think i told you there was a woman aboard the cutter that sick girl sir oh but it was hard lines for her poor thing i see her pale and calm oh lord so pale and calm every night of my life she kneeled aboard the cutter with her white hands aclasped together praying certainly it is all very shocking said wardlaw but then you know if they had escaped they would have exposed us believe me it is all for the best wylie looked at him with wonder ay said he after staring at him a long time you can sit here at your ease and doom a ship and risk her peoples lives but if you had to do it and see it and then lie awake thinking of it youd wish all the gold on earth had been in hell before you put your hand to such a piece of work wardlaw smiled a ghastly smile in short said he you dont mean to take the three thousand pounds i pay you for this little job oh yes i do but for all the gold in victoria i wouldnt do such a job again and you mark my words sir we shall get the money and nobody will ever be the wiser wardlaw rubbed his hands complacently his egotism coupled with his want of imagination nearly blinded him to everything but the pecuniary feature of the business but continued wylie we shall never thrive on it we have sunk a good ship and we have as good as murdered a poor dying girl hold your tongue ye fool cried wardlaw losing his sangfroid in a moment for he heard somebody at the door it opened and there stood a military figure in a travelingcapgeneral rolleston chapter xvi as some eggs have actually two yolks so arthur wardlaw had two hearts and at sight of helens father the baser one ceased to beat for a while he ran to general rolleston shook him warmly by the hand and welcomed him to england with sparkling eyes it is pleasant to be so welcomed and the stately soldier returned his grasp in kind is helen with you sir said wardlaw making a movement to go to the door for he thought she must be outside in the cab no she is not said general rolleston there now said arthur that cruel father of mine has broken his promise and carried her off to elmtrees at this moment wardlaw senior returned to tell arthur he had been just too late to meet the rollestons oh here he is said he and there were fresh greetings well but said arthur where is helen i think it is i who ought to ask that question said rolleston gravely i telegraphed you at elmtrees thinking of course she would come with you to meet me at the station it does not much matter a few hours but her not coming makes me uneasy for her health was declining when she left me how is my child mr wardlaw pray tell me the truth both the wardlaws looked at one another and at general rolleston and the elder wardlaw said there was certainly some misunderstanding here we fully believed that your daughter was coming home with you in the shannon come home with me why of course not she sailed three weeks before me good heavens has she not arrived no replied old wardlaw we have neither seen nor heard of her why what ship did she sail in said arthur in the proserpine chapter xvii arthur wardlaw fixed on the speaker a gaze full of horror his jaw fell a livid pallor spread over his features he echoed in a hoarse whisper the proserpine and turned his scared eyes upon wylie who was himself leaning against the wall his stalwart frame beginning to tremble the sick girl murmured wylie and a cold sweat gathered on his brow general rolleston looked from one to another with strange misgivings which soon deepened into a sense of some terrible calamity for now a strong convulsion swelled arthur wardlaws heart his face worked fearfully and with a sharp and sudden cry he fell forward on the table and his fathers arm alone prevented him from sinking like a dead man on the floor yet though crushed and helpless he was not insensible that blessing was denied him general rolleston implored an explanation wylie with downcast and averted face began to stammer a few disconnected and unintelligible words but old wardlaw silenced him and said with much feeling let none but a father tell him my poor poor friendthe proserpine how can i say it lost at sea groaned wylie at these fatal words the old warriors countenance grew rigid his large bony hands gripped the back of the chair on which he leaned and were white with their own convulsive force and he bowed his head under the blow without one word his was an agony too great and mute to be spoken to and there was silence in the room broken only by the hysterical moans of the miserable plotter who had drawn down this calamity on his own head he was in no state to be left alone and even the bereaved father found pity in his desolate heart for one who loved his lost child so well and the two old men took him home between them in a helpless and pitiable condition chapter xviii but this utter prostration of his confederate began to alarm wylie and rouse him to exertion certainly he was very sorry for what he had done and would have undone it and forfeited his three thousand pounds in a moment if he could but as he could not undo the crime he was all the more determined to reap the reward why that three thousand pounds for aught he knew was the price of his soul and he was not the man to let his soul go gratis he finished the rest of the brandy and went after his men to keep them true to him by promises but the next day he came to the office in fenchurch street and asked anxiously for wardlaw wardlaw had not arrived he waited but the merchant never came and michael told him with considerable anxiety that this was the first time his young master had missed coming this five years in course of the day several underwriters came in with long faces to verify the report which had now reached lloyds that the proserpine had foundered at sea it is too true said michael and poor mr wylie here has barely escaped with his life he was mate of the ship gentlemen upon this each visitor questioned wylie and wylie returned the same smooth answer to all inquiries one heavy gale after another had so tried the ship that her seams had opened and let in more water than all the exertions of the crew and passengers could discharge at last they had taken to the boats the longboat had been picked up the cutter had never been heard of since they nearly all asked after the ships log i have got it safe at home said he it was in his pocket all the time some asked him where the other survivors were he told them five had shipped on board the maria and three were with him at poplar one disabled by the hardships they had all endured one or two complained angrily of mr wardlaws absence at such a time well good gentlemen said wylie ill tell ye mr wardlaws sweetheart was aboard the ship he is amost brokenhearted he vallied her more than all the gold that you may take your oath on this stroke coming from a rough fellow in a peajacket who looked as simple as he was cunning silenced remonstrance and went far to disarm suspicion and so pleased michael penfold that he said mr wylie you are interested in this business would you mind going to mr wardlaws house and asking what we are to do next ill give you his address and a line begging him to make an effort and see you business is the hearts best ointment eh dear mr wylie i have known grief too and i think i should have gone mad when they sent my poor son away but for business especially the summing up of long columns etc wylie called at the house in russell square and asked to see mr wardlaw the servant shook his head you cant see him he is very ill very ill said wylie im sorry for that well but i shant make him any worse and mr penfold says i must see him it is very particular i tell you he wont thank you for refusing me when he comes to hear of it he said this very seriously and the servant after a short hesitation begged him to sit down in the passage a moment he then went into the diningroom and shortly reappeared holding the door open out came not wardlaw junior but wardlaw senior my son is in no condition to receive you said he gravely but i am at your service what is your business wylie was taken off his guard and stammered out something about the shannon the shannon what have you to do with her you belong to the proserpine ay sir but i had his orders to ship forty chests of lead and smelted copper on board the shannon well ye see sir said wylie mr wardlaw was particular about them and i feel responsible like having shipped them aboard another vessel have you not the captains receipt that i have sir at home but you could hardly read it for salt water well said wardlaw senior i will direct our agent at liverpool to look after them and send them up at once to my cellars in fenchurch street forty chests of lead and copper i think you said and he took a note of this directly wylie was not a little discomfited at this unexpected turn things had taken but he held his tongue now for fear of making bad worse wardlaw senior went on to say that he should have to conduct the business of the firm for a time in spite of his old age and failing health this announcement made wylie perspire with anxiety and his three thousand pounds seemed to melt away from him but never mind said old wardlaw i am very glad you came in fact you are the very man i wanted to see my poor afflicted friend has asked after you several times be good enough to follow me he led the way into the diningroom and there sat the sad father in all the quiet dignity of calm unfathomable sorrow another gentleman stood upon the rug with his back to the fire waiting for mr wardlaw this was the family physician who had just come down from arthurs bedroom and had entered by another door through the drawingroom well doctor said wardlaw anxiously what is your report not so good as i could wish but nothing to excite immediate alarm overtaxed brain sir weakened and unable to support this calamity however we have reduced the fever the symptoms of delirium have been checked and i think we shall escape brain fever if he is kept quiet i could not have said as much this morning the doctor then took his leave with a promise to call next morning and as soon as he was gone wardlaw turned to general rolleston and said here is wylie sir come forward my man and speak to the general he wants to know if you can point out to him on the chart the very spot where the proserpine was lost well sir said wylie i think i could the great chart of the pacific was then spread out upon the table and rarely has a chart been examined as this was with the bleeding heart as well as the straining eye the rough sailor became an oracle the others hung upon his words and followed his brown finger on the chart with fearful interest ye see sir said he addressing the old merchantfor there was something on his mind that made him avoid speaking directly to general rollestonwhen we came out of sydney the wind being south and by west hudson took the northerly course instead of running through cooks straits the weather freshened from the same quarter so that with one thing and another by when we were a month out she was five hundred miles or so norard of her true course but that wasnt all when the leak gained on us hudson ran the ship three hundred miles by my reckoning to the noreast and i remember the day before she foundered he told me she was in latitude forty and easter island bearing due north here is the spot then said general rolleston and placed his finger on the spot ay sir said wylie addressing the merchant but she ran about eightyfive miles after that on a northerly coursenowind on her starboard quarterand being deep in the water shed make lee waysay eightytwo miles noreast by east the general took eightytwo miles off the scale with a pair of dividers and set out that distance on the chart he held the instrument fixed on the point thus obtained wylie eyed the point and after a moments consideration nodded his head there or thereabouts he said in a low voice and looking at the merchant a pause ensued and the two old men examined the speck pricked on the map as if it were the waters covering the proserpine now sir said rolleston trace the course of the boats and he handed wylie a pencil the sailor slowly averted his head but stretched out his hand and took it and traced two lines the one short and straight running nearly northeast thats the way the cutter headed when we lost her in the night the other line ran parallel to the first for half an inch then turning bent backward and ran due south this was our course said wylie general rolleston looked up and said why did you desert the cutter the mate looked at old wardlaw and after some hesitation replied after we lost sight of her the men with me declared that we could not reach either juan fernandez or valparaiso with our stock of provisions and insisted on standing for the seatrack of australian liners between the horn and sydney this explanation was received in dead silence wylie fidgeted and his eye wandered round the room general rolleston applied his compasses to the chart i find that the proserpine was not one thousand miles from easter island why did you not make for that land we had no charts sir said wylie to the merchant and im no navigator i see no land laid down hereaway northeast of the spot where the ship went down no replied wylie thats what the men said when they made me bout ship then why did you lead the way northeast at all im no navigator answered the man sullenly he then suddenly stammered out ask my men what we went through why sir to wardlaw i can hardly believe that i am alive and sit here talking to you about this cursed business and nobody offers me a drop of anything wardlaw poured him out a tumbler of wine his brown hand trembled a little and he gulped the wine down like water general rolleston gave mr wardlaw a look and wylie was dismissed he slouched down the street all in a cold perspiration but still clinging to his three thousand pounds though small was now his hope of ever seeing it when he was gone general rolleston paced that large and gloomy room in silence wardlaw eyed him with the greatest interest but avoided speaking to him at last he stopped short and stood erect as veterans halt and pointed down at the chart ill start at once for that spot said he ill go in the next ship bound to valparaiso there ill charter a small vessel and ransack those waters for some trace of my poor lost girl can you think of no better way than that said old wardlaw gently and with a slight tone of reproach nonot at this moment oh yes by the by the greyhound and dreadnaught are going out to survey the islands of the pacific i have interest enough to get a berth in the greyhound what go in a government ship under the orders of a man under the orders of another man under the orders of a board why if you heard our poor girl was alive upon a rock the dreadnaught would be sure to run up a bunch of redtape to the fore that moment to recall the greyhound and the greyhound would go back no said he rising suddenly and confronting the general and with the color mounting for once in his sallow face you sail in no bottom but one freighted by wardlaw son and the captain shall be under no orders but yours we have bought the steamsloop springbok seven hundred tons ill victual her for a year man her well and you shall go out in her in less than a week i give you my hand on that they grasped hands but this sudden warmth and tenderness coming from a man habitually cold overpowered the stout general what sir he faltered your own son lies in danger yet your heart goes so with mesuch goodnessit is too much for me no no faltered the merchant affected in his turn it is nothing your poor girl was coming home in that cursed ship to marry my son yes he lies ill for love of her god help him and me too but you most of all dont general dont we have got work to do we must be brave sir brave i say and compose ourselves ah my friend you and i are of one age and this is a heavy blow for us and we are friends no more it has made us brothers she was to be my child as well as yours well now she is my child and our hearts they bleed together at this the truth must be told the two stout old men embraced one another like two women and cried together a little but that was soon over with such men as these they sat together and plunged into the details of the expedition and they talked themselves into hope in a week the springbok steamed down the channel on an errand inspired by love not reason to cross one mighty ocean and grope for a lost daughter in another chapter xix we return to the cutter and her living freight after an anxious but brief consultation it was agreed that their best chance was to traverse as many miles of water as possible while the wind was fair by this means they would increase their small chance of being picked up and also of falling in with land and would at all events sail into a lovely climate where intense cold was unknown and gales of wind uncommon mr hazel advised them to choose a skipper and give him absolute power especially over the provisions they assented to this he then recommended cooper for that post but they had not fathomed the sterling virtues of that taciturn seaman so they offered the command to welch instead me put myself over sam cooper said he not likely then their choice fell upon michael morgan the other sailors names were prince fenner and mackintosh mr hazel urged morgan to put the crew and passengers on short allowance at once viz two biscuits a day and four tablespoonfuls of water but morgan was a common sailor he could not see clearly very far ahead and moreover his own appetite counteracted this advice he dealt out a pound of biscuit and an ounce of ham to each person night and morning and a pint of water in course of the day mr hazel declined his share of the ham and begged miss rolleston so earnestly not to touch it that she yielded a silent compliance on the fourth day the sailors were all in good spirits though the provisions were now very low they even sang and spun yarns this was partly owing to the beauty of the weather on the fifth day morgan announced that he could only serve out one biscuit per day and this sudden decline caused some dissatisfaction and alarm next day the water ran so low that only a teaspoonful was served out night and morning there were murmurs and forebodings in all heavy trials and extremities some man or other reveals great qualities that were latent in him ay hidden from himself and this general observation was verified on the present occasion as it had been in the indian mutiny and many other crises hazel came out he encouraged the men out of his multifarious stores of learning he related at length stories of wrecks and sufferings at sea which though they had long been in print were most of them new to these poor fellows he told them among the rest what the men of the bona dea waterlogged at sea had sufferedtwelve days without any food but a rat and a kittenyet had all survived he gave them some details of the wager the grosvenor the corbin the medusa but above all a most minute account of the bounty and blighs wonderful voyage in an open boat short of provisions he moralized on this and showed his fellowsufferers it was discipline and selfdenial from the first that had enabled those hungry specters to survive and to traverse two thousand eight hundred miles of water in those very seas and that in spite of hunger thirst disease and rough weather by these means he diverted their minds in some degree from their own calamity and taught them the lesson they most needed the poor fellows listened with more interest than you could have thought possible under the pressure of bodily distress and helen rollestons hazel eye dwelled on the narrator with unceasing wonder yes learning and fortitude strengthened by those great examples learning furnishes maintained a superiority even in the middle of the pacific and not the rough sailors only but the lady who had rejected and scorned his love hung upon the brave students words she was compelled to look up with wonder to the man she had hated and despised in her hours of ease on the sixth day the provisions failed entirely not a crust of bread not a drop of water at p m several flyingfish driven into the air by the dolphins and catfish fell into the sea again near the boat and one struck the sail sharply and fell into the boat it was divided and devoured raw in a moment the next morning the wind fell and by noon the ocean became like glass the horrors of a storm have been often painted but who has described or can describe the horrors of a calm to a boatload of hungry thirsty creatures whose only chances of salvation or relief are wind and rain the beautiful remorseless sky was one vault of purple with a great flaming jewel in the center whose vertical rays struck and parched and scorched the living sufferers and blistered and baked the boat itself so that it hurt their hot hands to touch it the beautiful remorseless ocean was one sheet of glass that glared in their bloodshot eyes and reflected the intolerable heat of heaven upon these poor wretches who were gnawed to death with hunger and their raging thirst was fiercer still toward afternoon of the eighth day mackintosh dipped a vessel in the sea with the manifest intention of drinking the salt water stop him cried hazel in great agitation and the others seized him and overpowered him he cursed them with such horrible curses that miss rolleston put her fingers in her ears and shuddered from head to foot even this was new to her to hear foul language a calm voice rose in the midst and said let us pray there was a dead silence and mr hazel kneeled down and prayed loud and fervently and while he prayed the furious cries subsided for a while and deep groans only were heard he prayed for food for rain for wind for patience the men were not so far gone but they could just manage to say amen he rose from his knees and gathered the pale faces of the men together in one glance and saw that intense expression of agony which physical pain can mold with mens features and then he strained his eyes over the brassy horizon but no cloud no veil of vapor was visible water water everywhere but never a drop to drink we must be mad he cried to die of thirst with all this water round us his invention being stimulated by this idea and his own dire need he eagerly scanned everything in the boat and his eyes soon lighted on two objects disconnected in themselves but it struck him he could use them in combination these were a common glass bottle and miss rollestons lifepreserving jacket that served her for a couch he drew this garment over his knees and considered it attentively then untwisted the brass nozzle through which the jacket was inflated and so left a tube some nine inches in length hanging down from the neck of the garment he now applied his breath to the tube and the jacket swelling rapidly proved that the whole receptacle was airtight he then allowed the air to escape next he took the bottle and filled it with water from the sea then he inserted with some difficulty and great care the neck of the bottle into the orifice of the tube this done he detached the wire of the brass nozzle and whipped the tube firmly round the neck of the bottle now light a fire he cried no matter what it costs the forethwart was chopped up and a fire soon spluttered and sparkled for ten eager hands were feeding it the bottle was then suspended over it and in due course the salt water boiled and threw off vapor and the belly of the jacket began to heave and stir hazel then threw cold water upon the outside to keep it cool and while the men eagerly watched the bubbling bottle and swelling bag his spirits rose and he took occasion to explain that what was now going on under their eyes was after all only one of the great processes of nature done upon a small scale the clouds said he are but vapors drawn from the sea by the heat of the sun these clouds are composed of fresh water and so the steam we are now raising from salt water will be fresh we cant make whisky or brew beer lads but thank heaven we can brew water and it is worth all other liquors ten times told a wild hurrah greeted these words but every novel experiment seems doomed to fail or meet with some disaster the water in the bottle had been reduced too low by vaporism and the bottle burst suddenly with a loud report that report was followed by a piteous wail hazel turned pale at this fatal blow but recovering himself he said that is unfortunate but it was a good servant while it lasted give me the baler and miss rolleston can you lend me a thimble the tube of the lifepreserver was held over the baler and out trickled a small quantity of pure water two thimblefuls apiece even that as it passed over their swelling tongues and parched swallows was a heavenly relief but alas the supply was then exhausted next day hunger seemed uppermost and the men gnawed and chewed their tobaccopouches and two caps that had been dressed with the hair on were divided for food none was given to mr hazel or miss rolleston and this to do the poor creatures justice was the first instance of injustice or partiality the sailors had shown the lady though tormented with hunger was more magnanimous she offered to divide the contents of her little medicine chest and the globules were all devoured in a moment and now their tortures were aggravated by the sight of abundance they drifted over coral rocks at a considerable depth but the water was so exquisitely clear that they saw five fathoms down they discerned small fish drifting over the bottom they looked like a driving cloud so vast was their number and every now and then there was a scurry among them and porpoises and dogfish broke in and feasted on them all this they saw yet could not catch one of those billions for their lives thus they were tantalized as well as starved the next day was like the last with this difference that the sufferers could no longer endure their torments in silence the lady moaned constantly the sailors groaned lamented and cursed the sun baked and blistered and the water glared the sails being useless the sailors rigged them as an awning and salt water was constantly thrown over them mr hazel took a baler and drenched his own clothes and miss rollestons upon their bodies this relieved the hell of thirst in some degree but the sailors could not be persuaded to practice it in the afternoon hazel took miss rollestons bible from her wasted hands and read aloud the fortysecond psalm when he had done one of the sailors asked him to pass the bible forward he did so and in half an hour the leaves were returned him the vellum binding had been cut off divided and eaten he looked piteously at the leaves and after a while fell upon his knees and prayed silently he rose and with miss rollestons consent offered the men the leaves as well it is the bread of life for mens souls not their bodies said he but god is merciful i think he will forgive you for your need is bitter cooper replied that the binding was mans but the pages were gods and either for this or another more obvious reason the leaves were declined for food all that afternoon hazel was making a sort of rough spoon out of a fragment of wood the night that followed was darker than usual and about midnight a hand was laid on helen rollestons shoulder and a voice whisperedhush say nothing i have got something for you at the same time something sweet and deliciously fragrant was put to her lips she opened her mouth and received a spoonful of marmalade never did marmalade taste like that before it dissolved itself like ambrosia over her palate and even relieved her parched throat in some slight degree by the saliva it excited nature could not be resisted her body took whatever he gave but her high mind rebelled oh how base i am said she and wept why it is your own said he soothingly i took it out of your cabin expressly for you at least oblige me by eating some yourself sir said helen or with a sudden burst i will die ere i touch another morsel i feel the threat miss rolleston but i do not need it for i am very very hungry but no if i take any i must divide it all with them but if you will help me unrip the jacket i will suck the insideafter you helen gazed at him and wondered at the man and at the strange love which had so bitterly offended her when she was surrounded by comforts but now it extorted her respect they unripped the jacket and found some moisture left they sucked it and it was a wonderful and incredible relief to their parched gullets the next day was a fearful one not a cloud in the sky to give hope of rain the air so light it only just moved them along and the sea glared and the sun beat on the poor wretches now tortured into madness with hunger and thirst the body of man in this dire extremity can suffer internal agony as acute as any that can be inflicted on its surface by the knife and the cries the screams the groans the prayers the curses intermingled that issued from the boat were not to be distinguished from the cries of men horribly wounded in battle or writhing under some terrible operation in hospitals oh it was terrible and piteous to see and hear the boatload of ghastly victims with hollow cheeks and wildbeast eyes go groaning cursing and shrieking loud upon that fair glassy sea below that purple vault and glorious sun toward afternoon the sailors got together forward and left hazel and miss rolleston alone in the stern this gave him an opportunity of speaking to her confidentially he took advantage of it and said miss rolleston i wish to consult you am i justified in secreting the marmalade any longer there is nearly a spoonful apiece no said helen divide it among them all oh if i had only a woman beside me to pray with and cry with and die with for die we must i am not so sure of that said hazel faintly but with a cool fortitude all his own experience proves that the human body can subsist a prodigious time on very little food and saturating the clothes with water is i know the best way to allay thirst and women thank heaven last longer than men under privations i shall not last long sir said helen look at their eyes what do you mean i mean that those men there are going to kill me chapter xx hazel thought her reason was going and instead of looking at the mens eyes it was hers he examined but no the sweet cheek was white the eyes had a fearful hollow all round them but out of that cave the light hazel eye preternaturally large but calm as ever looked out full of fortitude resignation and reason dont look at me said she quietly but take an opportunity and look at them they mean to kill me hazel looked furtively round and being enlightened in part by the womans intelligence he observed that some of the men were actually glaring at himself and helen rolleston in a dreadful way there was a remarkable change in their eyes since he looked last the pupils seemed diminished the whites enlarged and in a word the characteristics of humanity had somehow died out of those bloodshot orbs and the animal alone shone in them now the wild beast driven desperate by hunger what he saw coupled with helens positive interpretation of it was truly sickening these men were six and he but one they had all claspknives and he had only an old penknife that would be sure to double up or break off if a blow were dealt with it he asked himself in utter terror what on earth he should do the first thing seemed to be to join the men and learn their minds it might also be as well to prevent this secret conference from going further he went forward boldly though sick at heart and said well my lads what is it the men were silent directly and looked sullenly down avoiding his eye yet not ashamed in a situation so terrible the senses are sharpened and hazel dissected in his mind this sinister look and saw that morgan prince and mackintosh were hostile to him but welch and cooper he hoped were still friendly sir said fenner civilly but doggedly we are come to this now that one must die for the others to live and the greater part of us are for casting lots all round and let every man and every woman too take their chance that is fair sam isnt it it is fair said cooper with a terrible doggedness but it is hard he added harder that seven should die for one said mackintosh no no one must die for the seven hazel represented with all the force language possesses that what they meditated was a crime the fatal result of which was known by experience but they heard in ominous silence hazel went back to helen rolleston and sat down right before her well said she with supernatural calmness you were mistaken said he then why have you placed yourself between them and me no no their eyes have told me they have singled me out but what does it matter we poor creatures are all to die and that one is the happiest that dies first and dies unstained by such a crime i heard every word you said sir hazel cast a piteous look on her and finding he could no longer deceive her as to their danger and being weakened by famine fell to trembling and crying helen rolleston looked at him with calm and gentle pity for a moment the patient fortitude of a woman made her a brave mans superior night came and for the first time hazel claimed two portions of the rum one for himself and one for miss rolleston he then returned aft and took the helm he loosened it so as to be ready to unship it in a moment and use it as a weapon the men huddled together forward and it was easy to see that the boat was now divided into two hostile camps hazel sat quaking with his hand on the helm fearing an attack every moment both he and helen listened acutely and about three oclock in the morning a new incident occurred of a terrible nature mackintosh was heard to say serve out the rum no allowance and the demand was instantly complied with by morgan then hazel touched miss rolleston on the shoulder and insisted on her taking half what was left of the marmalade and he took the other half the time was gone for economy what they wanted now was strength in case the wild beasts maddened by drink as well as hunger should attack them already the liquor had begun to tell and wild hallos and yells and even fragments of ghastly songs mingled with the groans of misery in the doomed boat at sunrise there was a great swell upon the water and sharp gusts at intervals and on the horizon to windward might be observed a black spot in the sky no bigger than a fly but none saw that hazels eye never left the raving wretches in the forepart of the boat cooper and welch sat in gloomy despair amidships and the others were huddled together forward encouraging each other to a desperate act it was about eight oclock in the morning helen rolleston awoke from a brief doze and said mr hazel i have had a strange dream i dreamed there was food and plenty of it on the outside of this boat while these strange words were yet in her mouth three of the sailors suddenly rose up with their knives drawn and eyes full of murder and staggered aft as fast as their enfeebled bodies could hazel uttered a loud cry welch cooper will you see us butchered and unshipping the helm rose to his feet cooper put out his arm to stop mackintosh but was too late he did stop morgan however and said come none of that no foul play irritated by this unexpected resistance and maddened by drink morgan turned on cooper and stabbed him he sank down with a groan on this welch gave morgan a fearful gash dividing his jugular and was stabbed in return by prince but not severely these two grappled and rolled over one another stabbing and cursing at the bottom of the boat meantime mackintosh was received by hazel with a point blank thrust in the face from the helm that staggered him though a very powerful man and drove him backward against the mast but in delivering this thrust hazels foot slipped and he fell with great violence on his head and arm mackintosh recovered himself and sprang upon the stern thwart with his knife up and gleaming over helen rolleston hazel writhed round where he lay and struck him desperately on the knee with the helm the poor woman knew only how to suffer she cowered a little and put up two feeble hands the knife descended but not upon that cowering figure chapter xxi a purple rippling line upon the water had for some time been coming down upon them with great rapidity but bent on bloody work they had not observed it the boat heeled over under the sudden gust but the ruffian had already lost his footing under hazels blow and the boom striking him almost at the same moment he went clean over the gunwale into the sea he struck it with his knife first all their lives were now gone if cooper who had already recovered his feet had not immediately cut the sheet with his knife there was no time to slack it and even as it was the lower part of the sail was drenched and the boat full of water ship the helm he roared the boat righted directly the sheet was cut the wet sail flapped furiously and the boat having way on her yielded to the helm and wriggled slowly away before the whistling wind mackintosh rose a few yards astern and swam after the boat with great glaring eyes the loose sail was not drawing but the wind moved the boat onward however mackintosh gained slowly and hazel held up an oar like a spear and shouted to him that he must promise solemnly to forego all violence or he should never come on board alive mackintosh opened his mouth to reply but at the same moment his eyes suddenly dilated in a fearful way and he went under water with a gurgling cry yet not like one drowning but with a jerk the next moment there was a great bubbling of the water as if displaced by some large creatures struggling below and then the surface was stained with blood and lest there should be any doubt as to the wretched mans fate the huge black fin of a monstrous shark came soon after gliding round and round the rolling boat awaiting the next victim now while the water was yet stained with his lifeblood who hurrying to kill had met with a violent death the unwounded sailor fenner excited by the fracas broke forth into singing and so completed the horror of a wild and awful scene for still while he shouted laughed and sang the shark swam calmly round and round and the boat crept on her white sail bespattered with bloodwhich was not so beforeand in her bottom lay one man dead as a stone and two poor wretches prince and welch their shortlived feud composed forever sat openly sucking their bleeding wounds to quench for a moment their intolerable thirst oh little do we who never pass a single day without bite or sup know the animal man in these dire extremities chapter xxii at last cooper ordered fenner to hold his jaw and come aft and help sail the boat but the man being now stark mad took no notice of the order his madness grew on him and took a turn by no means uncommon in these cases he saw before him sumptuous feasts and streams of fresh water flowing these he began to describe with great volubility and rapture smacking his lips and exulting and so he went on tantalizing them till noon meantime cooper asked mr hazel if he could sail the boat i can steer said he but that is all my right arm is benumbed the silvery voice of helen rolleston then uttered brave and welcome words i will do whatever you tell me mr cooper long life to you miss said the wounded seaman he then directed her how to reef the sail and splice the sheet which he had been obliged to cut and in a word to sail the boat which she did with some little assistance from hazel and so they all depended upon her whom some of them had been for killing and the bloodstained boat glided before the wind at two p m fenner jumped suddenly up and looking at the sea with rapture cried out aha my boys heres a beautiful green meadow and theres a sweet brook with bulrushes green green green lets have a roll among the daisies and in a moment ere any of his stiff and wounded shipmates could put out a hand he threw himself on his back upon the water and sunk forever with inexpressible rapture on his corpselike face a feeble groan was the only tribute those who remained behind could afford him at three p m mr hazel happened to look over the weatherside of the boat as she heeled to leeward under a smart breeze and he saw a shell or two fastened to her side about eleven inches above keel he looked again and gave a loud hurrah barnacles barnacles he cried i see them sticking he leaned over and with some difficulty detached one and held it up it was not a barnacle but a curious oblong shellfish open at one end at sight of this the wounded forgot their wounds and leaned over the boats side detaching the shellfish with their knives they broke them with the handles of their knives and devoured the fish they were as thick as a mans finger and about an inch long and as sweet as a nut it seems that in the long calm these shellfish had fastened on the boat more than a hundred of them were taken off her weatherside and evenly divided miss rolleston at hazels earnest request ate only six and these very slowly and laid the rest by but the sailors could not restrain themselves and prince in particular gorged himself so fiercely that he turned purple in the face and began to breathe very hard that black speck on the horizon had grown by noon to a beetle and by three oclock to something more like an elephant and it now diffused itself into a huge black cloud that gradually overspread the heavens and at last about half an hour before sunset came a peculiar chill and then in due course a drop or two fell upon the parched wretches they sat less like animals than like plants all stretching toward their preserver their eyes were turned up to the clouds so were their open mouths and their arms and hands held up toward it the drops increased in number and praise went up to heaven in return patter patter patter down came a shower a raina heavy steady rain with cries of joy they put out every vessel to catch it they lowered the sail and putting ballast in the center bellied it into a great vessel to catch it they used all their spare canvas to catch it they filled the watercask with it they filled the keg that had held the fatal spirit and all the time they were sucking the wet canvas and their own clothes and their very hands and garments on which the lifegiving drops kept falling then they set their little sail again and prayed for land to him who had sent the wind and rain chapter xxiii the breeze declined at sunset but it rained at intervals during the night and by morning they were somewhat chilled death had visited them again during the night prince was discovered dead and cold his wounds were mere scratches and there seems to be no doubt that he died by gorging himself with more food than his enfeebled system could possibly digest thus dismally began a day of comparative bodily comfort but mental distress especially to miss rolleston and mr hazel now that this lady and gentleman were no longer goaded to madness by physical suffering their higher sensibilities resumed their natural force and the miserable contents of the bloodstained boat shocked them terribly two corpses and two wounded men mr hazel however soon came to one resolution and that was to read the funeral service over the dead and then commit them to the deep he declared this intention and cooper who though wounded and apparently sinking was still skipper of the boat acquiesced readily mr hazel then took the dead mens knives and their money out of their pockets and read the burial service over them they were then committed to the deep this sad ceremony performed he addressed a few words to the survivors my friends and brothers in affliction we ought not to hope too much from divine mercy for ourselves or we should come soon to forget divine justice but we are not forbidden to hope for others those who are now gone were guilty of a terrible crime but then they were tempted more than their flesh could bear and they received their punishment here on earth we may therefore hope they will escape punishment hereafter and it is for us to profit by their fate and bow to heavens will even when they drew their knives food in plenty was within their reach and the signs of wind were on the sea and of rain in the sky let us be more patient than they were and place our trust what is that upon the water to leeward a piece of wood floating welch stood up and looked cant make it out steer alongside it miss if you please and he crept forward presently he became excited and directed those in the stern how to steer the boat close to the object without going over it he begged them all to be silent he leaned over the boat side as they neared it he clutched it suddenly with both hands and flung it into the boat with a shout of triumph but sank exhausted by the effort it was a young turtle and being asleep on the water or inexperienced had allowed them to capture it this was indeed a godsendtwelve pounds of succulent meat it was instantly divided and mr hazel contrived with some difficulty to boil a portion of it he enjoyed it greatly but miss rolleston showed a curious and violent antipathy to it scarcely credible under the circumstances not so the sailors they devoured it raw what they could get at all cooper could only get down a mouthful or two he had received his deathwound and was manifestly sinking he revived however from time to time and spoke cheerfully whenever he spoke at all welch informed him of every incident that took place however minute then he would nod or utter a syllable or two on being told that they were passing through seaweed he expressed a wish to see some of it and when he had examined it he said to hazel keep up your heart sir you are not a hundred miles from land he added gently after a pause but i am bound for another port about five in the afternoon welch came aft with the tears in his eyes to say that sam was just going to slip his cable and had something to say to them they went to him directly and hazel took his hand and exhorted him to forgive all his enemies haint a got none was the reply hazel then after a few words of religious exhortation and comfort asked him if he could do anything for him ay said cooper solemnly got pen and ink aboard any of ye i have a pencil said helen earnestly then tearfully oh dear it is to make his will she opened her prayerbook which had two blank leaves under each cover the dying man saw them and rose into that remarkable energy which sometimes precedes the departure of the soul write said he in his deep full tones i samuel cooper able seaman am going to slip my cable and sail into the presence of my maker he waited till this was written and so i speak the truth the ship proserpine was destroyed willful the men had more allowance than they signed for the mate was always plying the captain with liquor two days before ever the ship leaked the mate got the longboat ready when the proserpine sank we was on her port quarter aboard the cutter was me and my messmate tom welch we saw two augerholes in her stern about two inches diameter them two holes was made from within for the splinters showed outside she was a good ship and met with no stress of weather to speak of on that voyage joe wylie scuttled her and destroyed her people dn his eyes mr hazel was shocked at this finale but he knew what sailors are and how little meaning there is in their set phrases however as a clergyman he could not allow these to be coopers last words so he said earnestly yes but my poor fellow you said you forgave all your enemies we all need forgiveness you know that is true sir and you forgive this wylie do you not oh lord yes said cooper faintly i forgive the lubber dn him having said these words with some difficulty he became lethargic and so remained for two hours indeed he spoke but once more and that was to welch though they were all about him then messmate said he in a voice that was now faint and broken you and i must sail together on this new voyage im going out of port first but in a whisper of inconceivable tenderness and simple cunning ill lie to outside the harbor till you come out my boy then he paused a moment then he added softly for i love you tom these sweet words were the last of that rugged silent sailor who never threw a word away and whose rough breast inclosed a friendship as of the ancient world tender true and everlasting that sweetened his life and ennobled his death as he deserved mourners so he had true ones his last words went home to the afflicted hearts that heard them and the lady and gentleman whose lives he had saved at cost of his own wept aloud over their departed friend but his messmates eye was dry when all was over he just turned to the mourners and said gravely thank ye sir thank ye kindly maam and then he covered the body decently with the spare canvas and lay quietly down with his own head pillowed upon those loved remains toward afternoon seals were observed sporting on the waters but no attempt was made to capture them indeed miss rolleston had quite enough to do to sail the boat with mr hazels assistance the night passed and the morning brought nothing new except that they fell in with seaweed in such quantities the boat could hardly get through it mr hazel examined this seaweed carefully and brought several kinds upon deck among the varieties was one like thin green strips of spinach very tender and succulent his botanical researches included seaweed and he recognized this as one of the edible rockweeds there was very little of it comparatively but he took great pains and in two hours time had gathered as much as might fill a goodsized slopbasin he washed it in fresh water and then asked miss rolleston for a pockethandkerchief this he tied so as to make a bag and contrived to boil it with the few chips of fuel that remained on board after he had boiled it ten minutes there was no more fuel except a bowl or two and the boathook one pair of oars and the midship and stern thwarts he tasted it and found it glutinous and delicious he gave miss rolleston some and then fed welch with the rest he poor fellow enjoyed this sea spinach greatly he could no longer swallow meat while hazel was feeding him a flight of ducks passed over their heads high in the air welch pointed up at them ah said helen if we had but their wings presently a bird was seen coming in the same direction but flying very low it wabbled along toward them very slowly and at last to their great surprise came flapping and tried to settle on the gunwale of the boat welch with that instinct of slaughter which belongs to men struck the boathook into the birds back and it was soon dispatched it proved to be one of that very flock of ducks that had passed over their heads and a crab was found fastened to its leg it is supposed that the bird to break its long flight had rested on some reef and perhaps been too busy fishing and caught this tartar hazel pounced upon it heaven has sent this for you because you cannot eat turtle but the next moment he blushed and recovered his reason see said he referring to her own words this poor bird had wings yet death overtook her he sacrificed a bowl for fuel and boiled the duck and the crab in one pot and miss rolleston ate demurely but plentifully of both of the crabs shell he made a little drinkingvessel for miss rolleston cooper remained without funeral rites all this time the reason was that welch lay with his head pillowed upon his dead friend and hazel had not the heart to disturb him but it was the survivors duty to commit him to the deep and so hazel sat down by welch and asked him kindly whether he would not wish the services of the church to be read over his departed friend in course sir said welch but the next moment he took hazels meaning and said hurriedly no no i cant let sam be buried in the sea ye see sir sam and i we are used to one another and i cant abide to part with him alive or dead ah said hazel the best friends must part when death takes one ay ay when tother lives but lord bless you sir i shant be long astarn of my messmate here cant you see that heaven forbid said hazel surprised and alarmed why you are not wounded mortally as cooper was have a good heart man and we three will all see old england yet well sir said welch coolly ill tell ye me and my shipmate prince was a cutting at one another with our knives a smart time and i do properly wonder when i think of that days work for i liked the man well enough but rum atop of starvation plays hell with seafaring men well sir as i was a saying he let more blood out of me than i could afford to lose under the circumstances and ye see i cant make fresh blood because my throat is so swelled by the drought i cant swallow much meat so im safe to lose the number of my mess and another thing my heart isnt altogether set toward living sam here he give me an order what didnt ye hear him ill lie to outside the bar says he till you come out he expects me to come out in his wake dont ye samthat was and he laid his hand gently on the remains now sir i shall ax the lady and you a favor i want to lie alongside sam but if you bury him in the sea and me ashore why dn my eyes if i shant be a thousand years or so before i can find my own messmate etarnity is a nation big place im told a hundred times as big as both oceans no sir youll make land by sams reckoning tomorrow or next day wind and tide permitting ill take care of sams hull till then and well lie together till the angel blows that there trumpet and then well go aloft together and as soon as ever we have made our scrape to our betters well both speak a good word for you and the lady a very pretty lady she is and a goodhearted and the best plucked one i ever did see in any distressed craft now dont ye cry miss dont ye cry your trouble is pretty near over he said you was not a hundred miles from land i dont know how he knew that he was always a better seaman than i be but say it he did and that is enough for he was a man as never told a lie nor wasted a word welch could utter no more just then for the glands of his throat were swollen and he spoke with considerable difficulty what could hazel reply the judgment is sometimes ashamed to contradict the heart with cold reasons he only said with a sigh that he saw no signs of land and believed they had gone on a wrong course and were in the heart of the pacific welch made no answer but a look of goodnatured contempt the idea of this parson contradicting sam cooper the sun broke and revealed the illimitable ocean themselves a tiny speck on it mr hazel whispered miss rolleston that cooper must be buried today at ten pm they passed through more seaweed but this time they had to eat the sea spinach raw and there was very little of it at noon the sea was green in places welch told them this was a sign they were nearing land at four pm a bird about the size and color of a woodpecker settled on the boats mast their glittering eyes fastened on it and welch said come theres a supper for you as you can eat it no poor thing said helen rolleston you are right said hazel with a certain effort of selfrestraint let our sufferings make us gentle not savage that poor bird is lost like us upon this ocean it is a landbird how do you know waterbirds have webbed feetto swim with the bird having rested flew to the northwest helen by one of those inspired impulses her sex have altered the boats course directly and followed the bird half an hour before sunset helen rolleston whose vision was very keen said she saw something at the verge of the horizon like a hair standing upright hazel looked but could not see anything in ten minutes more helen rolleston pointed it out again and then hazel did see a vertical line more like a ships mast than anything else one could expect to see there their eyes were now strained to make it out and as the boat advanced it became more and more palpable though it was hard to say exactly what it was five minutes before the sun set the air being clearer than ever it stood out clean against thesky a treea lofty solitary tree with a tall stem like a column and branches only at the top a palmtreein the middle of the pacific chapter xxiv and but for the landbird which rested on their mast and for their own mercy in sparing it they would have passed to the eastward and never seen that giant palmtree in midocean oh let us put out all our sails and fly to it cried helen welch smiled and said no miss ye mustnt lord love ye what run on to a land ye dont know happy go lucky in the dark like that lay her head for the tree and welcome but you must lower the mainsel and treblereef the foresel and so creep on a couple of knots an hour and by daybreak youll find the island close under your lee then you can look out for a safe landingplace the island mr welch said helen there is no island or i should have seen it oh the island was hull down why you dont think as palmtrees grow in the water you do as i say or youll get wrecked on some thundering reef or other upon this mr hazel and miss rolleston set to work and with considerable difficulty lowered the mainsail and treblereefed the foresail that is right said welch tomorrow youll land in safety and bury my messmate and me oh no cried helen rolleston we must bury him but we mean to cure you they obeyed welchs instructions and so crept on all night and so well had this able seaman calculated distance and rate of sailing that when the sun rose sure enough there was an island under their lee distant about a league though it looked much less but the palmtree was more than twice that distance owing to wind and current they had made leeway all night and that tree stood on the most westerly point of the island hazel and miss rolleston stood up and hurrahed for joy then fell on their knees in silent gratitude welch only smiled the breeze had freshened and though there were no great waves at sea yet breakers formidable to such a craft as theirs were seen foaming over long disjointed reefs ahead that grinned black and dangerous here and there they then consulted welch and he told them they must tack directly and make a circuit of the island he had to show them how to tack and the sea rising they got thoroughly wetted and miss rolleston rather frightened for here was a peril they had wonderfully escaped hitherto however before eleven oclock they had stood out to sea and coasted the whole south side of the island they then put the boat before the wind and soon ran past the east coast which was very narrowin fact a sort of bluffheadand got on the north side of the island here the water was comparatively smooth and the air warm and balmy they ranged along the coast at about a miles distance looking out for a good landing here was no longer an unbroken line of cliffs but an undulating shore with bulging rocks and lines of reef after a mile or two of that the coast ran out seaward and they passed close to a most extraordinary phenomenon of vegetation great tangled woods crowned the shore and the landward slopes and their grand foliage seemed to flow over into the sea for here was a broad rocky flat intersected with a thousand little channels of the sea and the thousand little islets so formed were crowded covered and hidden with luxuriant vegetation huge succulent leaves of the richest hue hung over the water and some of the most adventurous of them showed by the crystals that sparkled on their green surface that the waves had actually been kissing them at high tide this ceased and they passed right under a cliff wooded nearly to the point this cliff was broad and irregular and in one of its cavities a cascade of pure fresh water came sparkling leaping and tumbling down to the foot of the rock there it had formed a great basin of water cool deep transparent which trickled over on to a tongue of pink sand and went in two crystal gutters to the sea great and keen was the rapture this sight caused our poor parched voyagers and eager their desire to land at once if possible and plunge their burning lips and swelling throats and fevered hands into that heavenly liquid but the next moment they were diverted from that purpose by the scene that burst on them this wooded cliff with its wonderful cascade was the very gate of paradise they passed it and in one moment were in a baya sudden bay wonderfully deep for its extent and sheltered on three sides broad sands with rainbow tints all sparkling and dotted with birds some white as snow some gorgeous a peaceful sea of exquisite blue kissing these lovely sands with myriad dimples and from the land side soft emerald slopes embroidered with silver threads of water came to the very edge of the sands so that from all those glorious hues that flecked the prismatic and sparkling sands the eye of the voyagers passed at once to the vivid yet sweet and soothing green of nature and over this paradise the breeze they could no longer feel wafted spicy but delicate odors from unseen trees even welch raised himself in the boat and sniffed the heavenly air and smiled at the heavenly spot heres a blessed haven said he down sail and row her ashore chapter xxv they rowed more than a mile so deep was the glorious bay and then their oars struck the ground but hazel with the boathook propelled the boat gently over the pellucid water that now seemed too shallow to float a canoe and at last looked like the mere varnish of that picture the prismatic sands below yet still the little craft glided over it till it gently grazed the soft sand and was stationary so placidly ended that terrible voyage mr hazel and miss rolleston were on shore in a moment and it was all they could do not to fall upon the land and kiss it never had the sea disgorged upon that fairy isle such ghastly specters they looked not like people about to die but that had died and been buried and just come out of their graves to land on that blissful shore we should have started back with horror but the birds of that virgin isle merely stepped out of their way and did not fly they had landed in paradise even welch yielded to that universal longing men have to embrace the land after perils at sea and was putting his leg slowly over the gunwale when hazel came back to his assistance he got ashore but was contented to sit down with his eyes on the dimpled sea and the boat waiting quietly till the tide should float his friend to his feet again the seabirds walked quietly about him and minded him not miss rolleston ascended a green slope very slowly for her limbs were cramped and was lost to view hazel now went up the beach and took a more minute survey of the neighborhood the west side of the bay was varied half of it presented the soft character that marked the bay in general but a portion of it was rocky though streaked with vegetation and this part was intersected by narrow clefts into which in some rare tempests and high tides combined tongues of the sea had entered licking the sides of the gullies smooth and these occasional visits were marked by the sand and broken shells and other debris the tempestuous and encroaching sea had left behind the true highwater mark was several feet lower than these debris and was clearly marked on the land above the cliffs he found a tangled jungle of tropical shrubs into which he did not penetrate but skirted it and walking eastward came out upon a delicious down or grassy slope that faced the center of the bay it was a gentlemans lawn of a thousand acres with an extremely gentle slope from the center of the island down to the sea a river flowing from some distant source ran eastward through this down but at its verge and almost encircled it hazel traversed the lawn until this river taking a sudden turn toward the sea intercepted him at a spot which he immediately fixed on as helen rollestons future residence four short thick umbrageous trees stood close to the stream on this side and on the eastern side was a grove of gigantic palmtrees at whose very ankles the river ran indeed it had undermined one of these palmtrees and that giant at this moment lay all across the stream leaving a gap through which hazels eye could pierce to a great depth among those grand columns for they stood wide apart and there was not a vestige of brushwood jungle or even grass below their enormous crowns he christened the place st helens on the spot he now dipped his baler into the stream and found it pure and tolerably cool he followed the bend of the stream it evaded the slope and took him by its own milder descent to the sands over these it flowed smooth as glass into the sea hazel ran to welch to tell him all he had discovered and to give him his first water from the island he found a roancolored pigeon with a purplish neck perched on the sick mans foot the bird shone like a rainbow and cocked a saucy eye at hazel and flew up into the air a few yards but it soon appeared that fear had little to do with this movement for after an airy circle or two he fanned hazels cheek with his fastflapping wings and lighted on the very edge of the baler and was for sipping oh look here welch cried hazel an ecstasy of delight ay sir said he poor things they haint a found us out yet the talking puzzled the bird if it did not alarm him and he flew up to the nearest tree and perching there inspected these new and noisy bipeds at his leisure hazel now laid his hand on welchs shoulder and reminded him gently they had a sad duty to perform which could not be postponed right you are sir said welch and very kind of you to let me have my way with him poor sam i have found a place said hazel in a low voice we can take the boat close to it but where is miss rolleston oh she is not far off she was here just now and brought me this here little cocoanut and patted me on the back she did then off again on a cruise bless her little heart hazel and welch then got into the boat and pushed off without much difficulty and punted across the bay to one of those clefts we have indicated it was now nearly high water and they moored the boat close under the cleft hazel had selected then they both got out and went up to the extremity of the cleft and there with the ax and with pieces of wood they scraped out a restingplace for cooper this was light work for it was all stones shells fragments of coral and dried seaweed lying loosely together but now came a hard task in which welch could not assist hazel unshipped a thwart and laid the body on it then by a great effort staggered with the burden up to the grave and deposited it he was exhausted by the exertion and had to sit down panting for some time as soon as he was recovered he told welch to stand at the head of the grave and he stood at the foot bareheaded and then from memory he repeated the service of our church hardly missing or displacing a word this was no tame recital the scene the circumstances the very absence of the book made it tender and solemn and then welch repeated those beautiful words after hazel and hazel let him and how did he repeat them in such a hearty loving tone as became one who was about to follow and all this but a short leavetaking so uttered for the living as well as the dead those immortal words had a strange significance and beauty and presently a tender silvery voice came down to mingle with the deep and solemn tones of the male mourners it was helen rolleston she had watched most of their movements unseen herself and now standing at the edge of the ravine and looking down on them uttered a soft but thrilling amen to every prayer when it was over and the men prepared to fill in the grave she spoke to welch in an undertone and begged leave to pay her tribute first and with this she detached her apron and held it out to them hazel easily climbed up to her and found her apron was full of sweetsmelling bark and aromatic leaves whose fragrance filled the air i want you to strew these over his poor remains she said oh not common earth he saved our lives and his last words were i love you tom oh dear oh dear oh dear and with that she gave him the apron and turned her head away to hide her tears hazel blessed her for the thought which indeed none but a lady would have had and welch and he with the tears in their eyes strewed the spicy leaves first and soon a ridge of shingle neatly bound with seaweed marked the sailors grave hazels next care and that a pressing one was to provide shelter for the delicate girl and the sick man whom circumstances had placed under his care he told miss rolleston welch and he were going to cross the bay again and would she be good enough to meet them at the bend of the river where she would find four trees she nodded her head and took that road accordingly hazel rowed eastward across the bay and it being now high water he got the boat into the river itself near the edge of the shore and as this river had worn a channel he contrived with the boathook to propel the boat up the stream to an angle in the bank within forty yards of the four trees he could get no farther the stream being now not only shallow but blocked here and there with great and rough fragments of stone hazel pushed the boat into the angle out of the current and moored her fast he and welch then got ashore and miss rolleston was standing at the four trees he went to her and said enthusiastically this is to be your house is it not a beautiful site yes it is a beautiful site butforgive mei really dont see the house was her reply but you see the framework helen looked all about and then said ruefully i suppose i am blind sir or else you are dreaming for i see nothing at all why heres a roof ready made and the frame of a wall we have only to wattle a screen between these four uprights only to wattle a screen but i dont know what wattling a screen is who does why you get some of the canes that grow a little farther up the river and a certain long wiry grass i have marked down and then you fix and weave till you make a screen from tree to tree this could be patched with wet clay i know where there is plenty of that meantime see what is done to our hands the crown of this great palmtree lies at the southern aperture of your house and blocks it entirely up that will keep off the only cold wind the south wind from you tonight then look at these long spiky leaves interlaced over your head these trees are screw pines there is a roof ready made you must have another roof underneath that but it will do for a day or two but you will wattle the screen directly said helen begin at once please i am anxious to see a screen wattled well said welch who had joined them landsmen are queer folk the best of em why miss it would take him a week to screen you with rushes and reeds and them sort of weeds and id do it in half an hour if i was the tom welch i used to be why theres spare canvas enough in the boat to go between these four trees breast high and then theres the foresel besides the mainsel is all you and me shall want sir oh excuse me said miss rolleston i will not be sheltered at the expense of my friends welch you are a trump said hazel and ran off for the spare canvas he brought it and the carpenters basket of tools they went to work and miss rolleston insisted on taking part in it finding her so disposed hazel said that they had better divide their labors since the time was short accordingly he took the ax and chopped off a great many scales of the palmtree and lighted a great fire between the trees while the other two worked on the canvas this is to dry the soil as well as cook our provisions said he and now i must go and find food is there anything you fancy he turned his head from the fire he was lighting and addressed this question both to welch and miss rolleston miss rolleston stared at this question then smiled and in the true spirit of a lady said i think i should like a good large cocoanut if you can find one she felt sure there was no other eatable thing in the whole island i wants a cabbage said welch in a loud voice oh mr welch we are not at home said miss rolleston blushing at the preposterous demand no miss in capericorn whereby we shant have to pay nothing for this here cabbage ill tell ye miss when a sailor comes ashore he always goes in for green vegetables for why he has eaten so much junk and biscuit nature sings out for greens me and my shipmates was paid off at portsmouth last year and six of us agreed to dine together and each order his dish blest if six boiled legs of mutton did not come up smoking hot three was with cabbage and three with turmots mine was with turmots but them i dont ask so nigh the line dont ye go to think because im sick and the lady and you is so kind to me and to him that is a waiting outside them there shoals for me as im onreasonable turmots i wish you both and plenty of em when some whaler gets driven out of her course and picks you up and carries you into northern latitudes where turmots grow but cabbage is my right cabbage is my due being paid off in a manner for the ship is foundered and im ashore cabbage i ask for as a seaman that has done his duty and a man that wont live to eat many more of em and losing his temper if you are the man i take you for youll run and fetch me a cabbage fresh from the tree recovering his temper i know i didnt ought to ax a parson to shin up a tree for me but lord bless you there aint no sarcy little boys alooking on and heres a poor fellow mostly dying for it miss rolleston looked at mr hazel with alarm in every feature and whispered cabbage from the tree is he wandering hazel smiled no said he he has picked up a fable of these seas that there is a tree which grows cabbages welch heard him and said with due warmth of course there is a tree on all these islands that grows cabbages that was known a hundred years before you was born and shipmates of mine have eaten them excuse me what those old admirals and buccaneers that set the legend afloat were so absurd as to call a cabbage and your shipmates may have eaten for one is nothing on earth but the last years growth of the palmtree palmtree be said welch and thereupon ensued a hot argument which helens good sense cut short mr hazel said she can you by any possibility get our poor friend the thing he wants oh that is quite within the bounds of possibility said hazel dryly well then suppose you begin by getting him the thing then i will boil the thing and he will eat the thing and after all that it will be time to argue about the name we shall give to the thing the good sense of this struck mr hazel forcibly he started off at once armed with the ax and a net bag welch had made since he became unfit for heavy labor he called back to them as he went to put the pots on welch and miss rolleston complied and then the sailor showed the lady how to sew sailorwise driving the large needle with the palm of the hand guarded by a piece of leather they had nailed two breadths of canvas to the trees on the north and west sides and run the breadths rapidly together and the water was boiling and bubbling in the balers when miss rolleston uttered a scream for hazel came running over the prostrate palmtree as if it was a proper bridge and lighted in the midst of them lot one said he cheerfully and produced from his net some limes two cocoanuts and a landturtle from this last esculent miss rolleston withdrew with undisguised horror and it was in vain he assured her it was a great delicacy no matter it is a reptile oh please send it away the queen of the island reprieves you said he and put down the terrapin which went off very leisurely for a reprieved reptile then hazel produced a fine bream which he had found struggling in a rockpool the tide having turned and three sea crayfish bigger than any lobster he chopped their heads off outside and threw their tails into the pots he stuck a piece of pointed wood through the bream and gave it to welch to toast but welch waved it aside i see no cabbage said he grimly oh i forgot but that is soon found said hazel here give me the fish and you take the saw and examine the head of the palmtree which lies at miss rollestons door saw away the succulent part of last years growth and bring it here welch got up slowly ill go with you mr welch said miss rolleston she will not be alone with me for a moment if she can help it thought hazel and sat moody by the fire but he shook off his sadness and forced on a cheerful look the moment they came back they brought with them a vegetable very like the heart of a cabbage only longer and whiter there said welch what dye call that the last years growth of the palm said hazel calmly this vegetable was cut in two and put into the pots there take the toastingfork again said hazel to welch and drew out from his net three huge scallop shells soupplates said he and washed them in the running stream then put them before the fire to dry while the fish and vegetable were cooking he went and cut off some of the leafy piunuated branches of the palmtree and fastened them horizontally above the strips of canvas each palm branch traversed a whole side of the bower this closed the northern and western sides on the southern side the prostrate palmtree on striking the ground had so crushed its boughs and leaves together as to make a thick wall of foliage then he took to making forks and primitive ones they were he selected a bough the size of a thick walkingstick sawed it off the tree sawed a piece six inches long off it peeled that split it in four and with his knife gave each piece three points by merely tapering off and serrating one end and so he made a fork a minute then he brought all the rugs and things from the boat and the ground being now thoroughly dried by the fire placed them for seats gave each person a large leaf for a plate besides a scallopshell and served out supper it was eaten with rare appetite the palmtree vegetable in particular was delicious tasting between a cabbage and a cocoanut when they had supped hazel removed the plates and went to the boat he returned dragging the foremast and foresail which were small and called welch out they agreed to rig the mainsail tarpaulinwise and sleep in the boat accordingly they made themselves very busy screening the east side of miss rollestons new abode with the foresail and fastened a loop and drove a nail into the tree and looped the sail to it then suddenly bade her goodnight in cheerful tones and were gone in a moment leaving her to her repose as they imagined hazel in particular having used all his ingenuity to secure her personal comfort was now too bent on showing her the most delicate respect and forbearance to think of anything else but justly counting on the delicacy he had forgotten the timidity of her sex and her first night in the island was a terribly trying one thrice she opened her mouth to call welch and hazel back but could not yet when their footsteps were out of hearing she would have given the world to have them between her and the perils with which she felt herself surrounded tigers snakes scorpions savages what would become of her during the long night she sat and cowered before the hot embers she listened to what seemed the angry roar of the sea what with the stillness of the night and her sharpened senses she heard it all round the island she seemed environed with peril and yet surrounded by desolation no one at hand to save her in time from a wild beast no one anywhere near except a sick sailor and one she would almost rather die than call singly to her aid for he had once told her he loved her oh papa oh arthur she cried are you praying for your poor helen then she wept and prayed and half nerved herself to bear the worst finally her vague fears completely overmastered her then she had recourse to a stratagem that belongs to her sexshe hid herself from the danger and the danger from her she covered herself face and all and so lay trembling and longing for the day at the first streak of dawn she fled from her place of torture and after plunging her face and hands in the river which did her a world of good she went off and entered the jungle and searched it closely so far as she could penetrate it soon she heard miss rolleston called in anxious tones but she tossed her little head and revenged herself for her night of agony by not replying however nature took her in hand imperious hunger drew her back to her late place of torture and there she found a fire and hazel cooking crayfish she ate the crayfish heartily and drank cocoanut milk out of half a cocoanut which the ingenious hazel had already sawn polished and mounted for her after that hazels whole day was occupied in stripping a tree that stood on the high western promontory of the bay and building up the materials of a bonfire a few yards from it that if any whaler should stray that way they might not be at a loss for means to attract her attention welch was very ill all day and miss rolleston nursed him he got about toward evening and miss rolleston asked him rather timidly if he could put her up a bellrope why yes miss said welch that is easy enough but i dont see no bell oh she did not want a bellshe only wanted a bellrope hazel came up during this conversation and she then gave her reason because then if mr welch is ill in the night and wants me i could come to him or finding herself getting near the real reason she stopped short or what inquired hazel eagerly she replied to welch when tigers and things come to me i can let you know mr welch if you have any curiosity about the result of their visit tigers said hazel in answer to this side slap there are no tigers here no large animals of prey exist in the pacific what makes you think that it is notorious naturalists are agreed but i am not i heard noises all night and little i expected that anything of me would be left this morning except perhaps my back hair mr welch you are clever at rigging thingsthat is what you call itand so please rig me a bellrope then i shall not be eaten alive without creating some little disturbance ill do it miss said welch this very night hazel said nothing but pondered accordingly that very evening a piece of stout twine with a stone at the end of it hung down from the roof of helens house and this twine clove the air until it reached a ring upon the mainmast of the cutter thence it descended and was to be made fast to something or somebody the young lady inquired no further the very sight of this bellrope was a great comfort to her it reunited her to civilized life that night she lay down and quaked considerably less yet she woke several times and an hour before daylight she heard distinctly a noise that made her flesh creep it was like the snoring of some great animals this horrible sound was faint and distant but she heard it between the roll of the waves and that showed it was not the sea roaring she hid herself in her rugs and cowered till daybreak a score of times she was minded to pull her bellrope but always a womanly feeling strong as her love of life withheld her time to pull that bellrope when the danger was present or imminent she thought to herself the thing will come smelling about before it attacks me and then i will pull the bell and so she passed an hour of agony next morning at daybreak hazel met her just issuing from her hut and pointing to his net told her he was going to forage and would she be good enough to make the fire and have boiling water ready he was sorry to trouble her but poor welch was worse this morning miss rolleston cut short his excuses pray do not take me for a child of course i will light the fire and boil the water only i have no lucifer matches here are two said he i carry the box wrapped in oilskin for if anything happen to them heaven help us he crossed the prostrate palmtree and dived into the wood it was a large beautiful wood and except at the western edge the trees were all of the palmtree genus but contained several species including the cocoanut tree the turf ran under these trees for about forty yards and then died gradually away under the same thick shade which destroyed all other vegetation in this wood and made it so easy to see and travel he gathered a few cocoanuts that had burst out of their ripe pods and fallen to the ground and ran on till he reached a belt of trees and shrubs that bounded the palm forest here his progress was no longer easy but he found trees covered with a small fruit resembling quinces in every particular of look taste and smell and that made him persevere since it was most important to learn the useful products of the island presently he burst through some brushwood into a swampy bottom surrounded by low trees and instantly a dozen large birds of the osprey kind rose flapping into the air like windmills rising he was quite startled by the whirring and flapping and not a little amazed at the appearance of the place here was a very charnelhouse so thick lay the shells skeletons and loose bones of fish here too he found three terrapin killed but not eaten and also some fish more or less pecked aha my worthy executioners much obliged said he you have saved me that job and into the bag went the terrapin and two plump fish but slightly mutilated before he had gone many yards back came the sailing wings and the birds settled again before his eyes the rest of the low wood was but thin and he soon emerged upon the open country but it was most unpromising and fitter for geese than men a vast sedgy swamp with water in the middle thin fringes of great ferntrees and here and there a disconsolate tree like a weepingwillow and at the end of this lake and swamp which all together formed a triangle was a barren hill without a blade of vegetation on it and a sort of jagged summit hazel did not at all like the look of volcanic somewhat dismayed at finding so large a slice of the island worthless he returned through the wood guiding himself due west by his pocketcompass and so got down to the shore where he found scallops and crayfish in incredible abundance literally he had only to go into the water and gather them but enough is as good as a feast he ran to the pots with his miscellaneous bag and was not received according to his deserts miss rolleston told him a little severely the water had been boiling a long time then he produced his provender by way of excuse tortoises again said she and shuddered visibly but the quinces and cocoanuts were graciously received welch however cried out for cabbage what am i to do said hazel for every such cabbage a king must die goodness me a monarch of the grove oh a king log why then down with them all of course sooner than dear mr welch shall go without his cabbage he cast a look of admiration on her which she avoided and very soon his ax was heard ringing in the wood hard by then came a loud crash then another hazel came running with the cabbage and a cocoapod there said he and there are a hundred more about while you cook that for welch i will store them accordingly he returned to the wood with his net and soon came back with five pods in it each as big as a large pumpkin he chucked these one at a time across the river and then went for more it took him all the afternoon to get all the pods across the river he was obliged to sit down and rest but a suggestion of helens soon set him to work again you were kind enough to say you would store these for me could you not store them so as to wall out those terrible beasts with them what terrible beasts that roar so all night and dont eat us only because they have not found out we are here yet but they will i deny their existence said hazel but ill wall them out all the same said he pray do said helen wall them out first and disprove them afterward i shall be better able to believe they dont exist when they are well walled outmuch hazel went to work and with her assistance laid cocoapods two wide and three deep outside the northern and western sides of her leafy bower and he promised to complete the walls by the same means in two days more they all then supped together and to oblige him she ate a little of the terrapin and when they parted for the night she thanked him and said with a deep blush you have been a good friend to meof late he colored high and his eyes sparkled with delight and she noticed and almost wished she had kept her gratitude to herself that night what with her bellrope and her little bit of a wall she was somewhat less timorous and went to sleep early but even in sleep she was watchful and she was awakened by a slight sound in the neighborhood of the boat she lay watching but did not stir presently she heard a footstep with a stifled cry she bounded up and her first impulse was to rush out of the tent but she conquered this and gliding to the south side of her bower she peered through the palmleaves and the first thing she saw was the figure of a man standing between her and the boat she drew her breath hard the outline of the man was somewhat indistinct but it was not a savage the man was clothed and his stature betrayed him he stood still for some time he is listening to see if i am awake said helen to herself the figure moved toward her bower then all in a moment she became another woman she did not rely on her bellrope she felt it was fast to nothing that could help her she looked round for no weapon she trusted to herself she drew herself hastily up and folded her arms her bosom panted but her cheek never paled her modesty was alarmed her blood was up and life or death were nothing to her the footsteps came nearer they stopped at her door they went north they came back south they kept her in this highwrought attitude for half an hour then they retired softly and when they were gone she gave way and fell on her knees and began to cry hysterically then she got calmer and then she wondered and puzzled herself but she slept no more that night in the morning she found that the fire was lighted on a sort of shelf close to the boat mr hazel had cut the shelf and lighted the fire there for welchs sake who had complained of cold in the night while hazel was gone for the crayfish welch asked helen to go for her prayerbook she brought it directly and turned the leaves to find the prayers for the sick but she was soon undeceived as to his intention sam had it wrote down how the proserpine was foundered and i should like to lie alongside my messmate on that there paper as well as in tother place meaning the grave begin as sam did that this is my last word oh i hope not oh mr welch pray do not leave me well well then never mind that but just put down as i heard sam and his dying words that the parson took down were the truth i have written that and that the two holes was on her portside and seven foot from her stainpost and i say them very augers that is in our cutter made them holes set down that it is down then ill put my mark under it and you are my witness helen anxious to please him in everything showed him where to put his mark he did so and she signed her name as his witness and now mr welch said she do not you fret about the loss of the ship you should rather think how good providence has been to us in saving us three out of so many that sailed in that poor ship that wylie was a wicked man but he is drowned or starved no doubt and there is an end of him you are alive and we are all three to see old england again but to live you must eat and so now do pray make a good breakfast today tell me what you can fancy a cabbage what you own it is a cabbage of course i do said helen coaxing you must excuse mr hazel these learned men are so crotchety in some things and go by books but you and i go by our senses and to us a cabbage is a cabbage grow where it will will you have one no miss not this morning what i wants this morning very bad indeed it isi wants a drink made of the sweetsmelling leaves like as you strewed over my messmatethe lord in heaven bless you for it oh mr welch that is a curious fancy but you shall not ask me twice for anything the jungle is full of them and ill fetch you some in five minutes so you must boil the water she scudded away to the jungle and soon returned with some aromatic leaves while they were infusing hazel came up and on being informed of welchs fancy made no opposition but on the contrary said that such men had sometimes very happy inspirations he tasted it however and said the smell was the best part of it in his opinion he then put it aside to cool for the sick mans use they ate their usual breakfast and then welch sipped his spiced tea as he called it morning and afternoon he drank copious draughts of it and seemed to get suddenly better and told them not to hang about him any longer but go to their work he was all right now to humor him they went off in different directions hazel with his ax to level cocoanut trees and helen to search for fruits in the jungle she came back in about an hour very proud of some pods she had found with nutmegs inside them she ran to welch he was not in the boat she saw his waistcoat however folded and lying on the thwart so she knew he could not be far off and concluded he was in her bower but he was not there and she called to mr hazel he came to the side of the river laden with cocoanuts is he with you said helen who welch no well then he is not here oh dear something is the matter hazel came across directly and they both began to run anxiously to every part whence they could command a view to any distance they could not see him anywhere and met with blank faces at the bower then helen made a discovery this very day while hanging about the place hazel had torn up from the edge of the river an old trunk whose roots had been loosened by the water washing away the earth that held them and this stump he had set up in her bower for a table after sawing the roots down into legs well on the smooth part of this table lay a little pile of money a ring with a large pearl in it and two gold earrings helen had often noticed in welchs ears she pointed at these and turned pale then suddenly waving her hand to hazel to follow her she darted out of the bower and in a moment she was at the boat there she found beside his waistcoat his knife and a little pile of money placed carefully on the thwart and underneath it his jacket rolled up and his shoes and sailors cap all put neatly and in order hazel found her looking at them he began to have vague misgivings what does this mean he said faintly what does it mean cried helen in agony dont you see a legacy the poor thing has divided his little all oh my heart what has become of him then with one of those inspirations her sex have she cried ah coopers grave hazel though not so quick as she was caught her meaning at a word and flew down the slope to the seashore the tide was out a long irregular track of footsteps indented the sand he stopped a moment and looked at them they pointed toward that cleft where the grave was he followed them all across the sand they entered the cleft and did not return full of heavy foreboding he rushed into the cleft yes his arms hanging on each side of the grave and his cheek laid gently on it there lay tom welch with a loving smile on his dead face only a man yet faithful as a dog hazel went back slowly and crying of all men living he could best appreciate fidelity and mourn its fate but as he drew near helen he dried his eyes for it was his duty to comfort her she had at first endeavored to follow him but after a few steps her knees smote together and she was fain to sit down on the grassy slope that overlooked the sea the sun was setting huge and red over that vast and peaceful sea she put her hands to her head and sick at heart looked heavily at that glorious and peaceful sight hazel came up to her she looked at his face and that look was enough for her she rocked herself gently to and fro yes said he in a broken voice he was therequite dead he sat gently down by her side and looked at that setting sun and illimitable ocean and his heart felt deadly sad he is goneand we are aloneon this island the man said this in one sense only but the woman heard it in more than one alone she glanced timidly round at him and without rising edged a little away from him and wept in silence chapter xxvi after a long silence hazel asked her in a low voice if she could be there in half an hour she said yes in the same tone but without turning her head on reaching the graves she found that hazel had spared her a sad sight nothing remained but to perform the service when it was over she went slowly away in deep distress on more accounts than one in due course hazel came to her bower but she was not there then he lighted the fire and prepared everything for supper and he was so busy and her foot so light he did not hear her come but by and by lifting his head he saw her looking wistfully at him as if she would read his soul in his minutest actions he started and brightened all over with pleasure at the sudden sight of her and said eagerly your supper is quite ready thank you sir said she sadly and coldly she had noted that expression of joy i have no appetite do not wait for me and soon after strolled away again hazel was dumfounded there was no mistaking her manner it was chilly and reserved all of a sudden it wounded him but he behaved like a man what i keep her out of her own house do i said he to himself he started up took a fish out of the pot wrapped it in a leaf and stalked off to his boat then he ate a little of the fish threw the rest away and went down upon the sands and paced them in a sad and bitter mood but the night calmed him and some hours of tranquil thought brought him fortitude patience and a clear understanding he went to his boat elevated by generous and delicate resolutions now worthy resolves are tranquilizing and he slept profoundly not so she whose sudden but very natural change of demeanor had hurt him when she returned and found he was gone for the night she began to be alarmed at having offended him for this and other reasons she passed the night in sore perplexity and did not sleep till morning and so she overslept her usual time however when she was up she determined to find her own breakfast she felt it would not do to be too dependent and on a person of uncertain humor such for the moment she chose to pretend to herself was hazel accordingly she went down to the sea to look for crayfish she found abundance there they lay in the water you had but to stoop and pick them up but alas they were black lively viperish she went with no great relish for the task to take one up it wriggled maliciously she dropped it and at that very moment by a curious coincidence remembered she was sick and tired of crayfish she would breakfast on fruits she crossed the sand took off her shoes and paddled through the river and having put on her shoes again was about to walk up through some rank grass to the big wood when she heard a voice behind her and it was mr hazel she bit her lip it was broad daylight now and prepared quietly to discourage this excessive assiduity he came up to her panting a little and taking off his hat said with marked respect i beg your pardon miss rolleston but i know you hate reptiles now there are a few snakes in that long grass not poisonous ones snakes cried helen let me get home thereill go without my breakfast oh i hope not said hazel ruefully why i have been rather fortunate this morning and it is all ready that is a different thing said helen graciously you must not have your trouble for nothing i suppose directly after breakfast hazel took his ax and some rope from the boat and went off in a great hurry to the jungle in half an hour or so he returned dragging a large conical shrub armed with spikes for leaves incredibly dense and prickly there said he theres a vegetable porcupine for you this is your best defense against that roaring bugbear that little tree said helen the tiger would soon jump over that ay but not over this and sixty more a wall of stilettos dont touch it please he worked very hard all day and brought twelve of these prickly trees to the bower by sunset he was very dissatisfied with his days work seemed quite mortified this comes of beginning at the wrong end he said i went to work like a fool i should have begun by making a cart but you cant do that said helen soothingly no gentleman can make a cart oh surely anybody can make a cart by a little thinking said he i wish said helen listlessly you would think of something for me to do i begin to be ashamed of not helping hum you can plait yes as far as seven strands then you need never be unemployed we want ropes and shall want large mats for the rainy weather he went to the place where he had warned her of the snakes and cut a great bundle of long silky grass surprisingly tough yet neither harsh nor juicy he brought it her and said he should be very glad of a hundred yards of light cord three ply and five ply she was charmed with the grass and the very next morning she came to breakfast with it nicely prepared and a good deal of cord made and hanging round her neck she found some preparations for carpenters work lying about is that great log for the cart said she yes it is a section of a sagotree what our sago the basis see in the center it is all soft pith he got from the boat one of the augers that had scuttled the proserpine and soon turned the pith out they pound that pith in water and run it through linen then set the water in the sun to evaporate the sediment is the sago of commerce and sad insipid stuff it is oh please dont call anything names one has eaten in england said helen sorrowfully after a hasty meal she and mr hazel worked for a wager her taper fingers went like the wind and though she watched him and asked questions she never stopped plaiting mr hazel was no carpenter he was merely brains spurred by necessity he went to work and sawed off four short disks of the sagolog now what are those pray asked helen the wheelsprimeval wheels and here are the linchpins made of hard wood i wattled them at odd times he then produced two young limetrees he had rooted up that morning and sawed them into poles in a minute then he bored two holes in each pole about four inches from either extremity and fitted his linchpins then he drew out his linchpins passed each pole first through one disk and then through another and fastened his linchpins then he ran to the boat and came back with the stern and midship thwarts he drilled with his centerbit three rows of holes in these two inches from the edge and now helens work came in her grass rope bound the thwarts tight to the horizontal poles leaving the disks room to play easily between the thwarts and the linchpins but there was an open space thirteen inches broad between the thwarts this space hazel herringboned over with some of helens rope drawn as tight as possible the cart was now made time occupied in its production three hours and forty minutes the coachmaker was very hot and helen asked him timidly whether he had not better rest and eat no time for that said he the day is not half long enough for what i have to do he drank copiously from the stream put the carpenters basket into the cart got the towrope from the boat and fastened it to the cart in this shape a putting himself in the center so now the coachmaker was the horse and off they went rattling and creaking to the jungle helen turned her stool and watched this pageant enter the jungle she plaited on but not so merrily hazels companionship and bustling way somehow kept her spirits up but whenever she was left alone she gazed on the blank ocean and her heart died within her at last she strolled pensively toward the jungle plaiting busily as she went and hanging the rope round her neck as fast as she made it at the edge of the jungle she found hazel in a difficulty he had cut down a wagon load of prickly trees and wanted to get all this mass of noli me tangere on to that wretched little cart but had not rope enough to keep it together she gave him plenty of new line and partly by fastening a small rope to the big rope and so making the big rope a receptacle partly by artful tying they dragged home an incredible load to be sure some of it draggled half along the ground and came after like a peacocks tail he made six trips and then the sun was low so he began to build he raised a rampart of these prickly trees a rampart three feet wide and eight feet high but it only went round two sides and a half of the bower so then he said he had failed again and lay down worn out by fatigue helen rolleston though dejected herself could not help pitying him for his exhaustion in her service and for his bleeding hands she undertook the cooking and urged him kindly to eat of every dish and when he rose to go she thanked him with as much feeling as modesty for the great pains he had taken to lessen those fears of hers which she saw he did not share these kind words more than repaid him he went to his little den in a glow of spirits and the next morning went off in a violent hurry and for once seemed glad to get away from her poor mr hazel said she softly and watched him out of sight then she got her plait and went to the high point where he had barked a tree and looked far and wide for a sail the air was wonderfully clear the whole ocean seemed in sight but all was blank a great awe fell upon her and sickness of heart and then first she began to fear she was out of the known world and might die on that island or never be found by the present generation and this sickening fear lurked in her from that hour and led to consequences that will be related shortly she did not return for a long while and when she did she found hazel had completed her fortifications he invited her to explore the western part of the island but she declined thank you said she not today there is something to be done at home i have been comparing my abode with yours and the contrast makes me uncomfortable if it doesnt you oblige me by building yourself a house what in an afternoon why not you made a cart in a forenoon how can i tell your limits you are quite out of my poor little depth well at all events you must roof the boat or something come be good for once and think a little of yourself there ill sit by andwhat shall i do while you are working to oblige me make a fishingnet of cocoanut fiber four feet deep heres plenty of material all prepared why mr hazel you must work in your sleep no but of course i am not idle when i am alone and luckily i have made a spade out of hard wood at odd hours or all the afternoon would go in making that a spade you are going to dig a hole in the ground and call it a house that will not do for me you will see said hazel the boat lay in a little triangular creek the surrounding earth was alluvial clay a sort of black cheesy mould stiff but kindly to work with the spade hazel cut and chiseled it out at a grand rate and throwing it to the sides raised by degrees two mud banks one on each side the boat and at last he dug so deep that he was enabled to draw the boat another yard inland as helen sat by netting and forcing a smile now and then though sad at heart he was on his mettle and the mud walls he raised in four hours were really wonderful he squared their inner sides with the spade when he had done the boat lay in a hollow the walls of which half natural half artificial were five feet above her gunwale and of course eight feet above her bottom in which hazel used to lie at night he then made another little wall at the boats stern and laid palmbranches over all and a few huge bananaleaves from the jungle got a dozen large stones out of the river tied four yardslengths of helens grassrope from stone to stone and so passing the ropes over the roof confined it otherwise a sudden gust of wind might lift it there said he am i not as well off as youi a great tough man abominable waste of time i call it hum said helen doubtfully all this is very clever but i doubt whether it will keep out much rain more than yours will said hazel and that is a very serious thing i am afraid you little know how serious but tomorrow if you please i will examine our resources and lay our whole situation before you and ask your advice as to your bugbear let him roar his heart out his reign is over will you not come and see your wooden walls he then took helen and showed her the tremendous nature of her fortification and assured her that no beast of prey could face it nor even smell at it with impunity and as to the door here the defense was double and treble but attached to four grass cords two passed into the abode round each of the screw pinetrees at the east side and were kept in their places by pegs driven into the trees when you are up said hazel you pull these four cords steadily and your four guards will draw back right and left with all their bayonets and you can come out helen was very much pleased with this arrangement and did not disguise her gratitude she slept in peace and comfort that night hazel too profited by the mud walls and leafy roof she had compelled him to rear for this night was colder as it happened than any preceding night since they came ashore in the morning hazel saw a green turtle on the shore which was unusual at that time of year he ran and turned her with some difficulty then brought down his cart cut off her head with a blow and in due course dragged her up the slope she weighed two hundred pounds he showed miss rolleston the enormous shell gave her a lecture on turtles and especially on the four species known to south sea navigatorsthe trunk turtle the loggerhead the green turtle and the hawksbill from which last and not from any tortoise he assured her came the tortoiseshell of commerce and now said he will you not give up or suspend your reptile theory and eat a little green turtle the king of them all i think i must after all that said she and rather relished it that morning he kept his word and laid their case before her he said we are here on an island that has probably been seen and disregarded by a few whalers but is not known to navigators nor down on any chart there is a wide range of vegetation proving a delightful climate on the whole and one particularly suited to you whose lungs are delicate but then comparing the beds of the rivers with the banks a tremendous fall of rain is indicated the rainy months in these latitudes are at hand and if these rains catch us in our present condition it will be a calamity you have walls but no roof to keep it out i tremble when i think of it this is my main anxiety my next is about our sustenance during the rains we have no stores under cover no fuel no provisions but a few cocoanuts we use two lucifer matches a day and what is to become of us at that rate in theory fire can be got by rubbing two pieces of wood together selkirk is said to have so obtained it from pimento wood on juan fernandez but in fact i believe the art is confined to savages i never met a civilized man who could do it and i have questioned scores of voyagers as for my weapons they consist of a boathook and an ax no gun no harpoon no bow no lance my tools are a blunt saw a blunter ax a wooden spade two great augers that i believe had a hand in bringing us here but have not been any use to us since a centerbit two planes a hammer a pair of pincers two bradawls three gimlets two scrapers a plumblead and line a large pair of scissors and you have a small pair two gauges a screwdriver five claspknives a few screws and nails of various sizes two small barrels two bags two tin bowls two wooden bowls and the shell of this turtle and that is a very good souptureen only we have no meat to make soup with well sir said miss rolleston resignedly we can but kneel down and die that would be cutting the gordian knot indeed said hazel what die to shirk a few difficulties no i propose an amendment to that after the words kneel down insert the words and get up again trusting in that merciful providence which has saved us so far but expects us to exert ourselves too it is good and pious advice said helen and let us follow it this moment now said hazel i have three propositions to lay before you st that i hereby give up walking and take to running time is so precious d that we both work by night as well as day d that we each tell the other our principal wants so that there may be four eyes on the lookout as we go instead of two i consent said helen pray what are your wants iron oil salt tar a bellows a pickax planks thread nets light matting for roofs bricks chimneypots jars glass animal food some variety of vegetable food and so on ill write down the entire list for you you will be puzzled to do that without ink or paper not in the least i shall engrave it in altorilievo make the words with pebbles on the turf just above highwater mark now tell me your wants well i wantimpossibilities enumerate them what is the use it is the method we have agreed upon oh very well then i wanta sponge good what next i have broken my comb good im glad you think so i wantoh mr hazel what is the usewell i should like a mattress to lie on hair or wool i dont care which and it is a shame to ask you for either go on i want a lookingglass great heaven what for oh never mind i want one and some more towels and some soap and a few hairpins and some elastic bands and some pen ink and paper to write my feelings down in this island for nobody ever to see when she began hazel looked bright but the list was like a wasp its sting lay in its tail however he put a good face on it ill try and get you all those things only give me time do you know i am writing a dictionary on a novel method that means on the sand no the work is suspended for the present but two of the definitions in it aredifficultiesthings to be subdued impossibilitiesthings to be trampled on well subdue mine trample ona sponge for me that is just what i was going to do said he opened a claspknife and jumped coolly into the river helen screamed faintly but after all the water was only up to his knees he soon cut a large sponge off a piece of slimy rock and held it up to her there said he why there are a score of them at your very door and you never saw them oh excuse me i did see them and shuddered i thought they were reptiles dormant and biding their time when he was out of the river again she thought a little and asked him whether old iron would be of any use to him oh certainly said he what do you know of any i think i saw some one day ill go and look for it she took the way of the shore and he got his cart and spade and went posthaste to his claypit he made a quantity of bricks and brought them home and put them to dry in the sun he also cut great pieces of the turtle and wrapped them in fresh bananaleaves and inclosed them in clay he then tried to make a large narrownecked vessel and failed utterly so he made the clay into a great rude platter like a shallow milkpan then he peeled the sagolog off which he had cut his wheels and rubbed it with turtle fat and using it as a form produced two clay cylinders these he set in the sun with bricks round them to keep them from falling leaving all these to dry and set before he baked them he went off to the marsh for fernleaves the soil being so damp the trees were covered with a brownishred substance scarce distinguishable from wool this he had counted on but he also found in the same neighborhood a long cypresshaired moss that seemed to him very promising he made several trips and raised quite a stack of fernleaves by this time the sun had operated on his thinner pottery so he laid down six of his large thick tiles and lighted a fire on them with dry bananaleaves and cocoanut etc and such light combustibles until he had heated and hardened the clay then he put the ashes on one side and swept the clay clean then he put the fire on again and made it hotter and hotter till the clay began to redden while he was thus occupied miss rolleston came from the jungle radiant carrying vegetable treasures in her apron first she produced some golden apples with reddish leaves there said she and they smell delicious hazel eyed them keenly you have not eaten any of them what by myself said helen thank heaven said hazel turning pale these are the manchanilla the poison apple of the pacific poison said helen alarmed in her turn well i dont know that they are poison but travelers give them a very bad name the birds never peck them and i have read that even the leaves falling into still water have killed the fish you will not eat anything here till you have shown it me will you said he imploringly no no said helen and sat down with her hand to her heart a minute and i was so pleased when i found them she said they reminded me of home i wonder whether these are poison too and she opened her apron wide and showed him some long yellow pods with red specks something like a very large banana ah that is a very different affair said hazel delighted these are plantains and the greatest find we have made yet the fruit is meat the wood is thread and the leaf is shelter and clothes the fruit is good raw and better baked as you shall see and i believe this is the first time the dinner and the dish were both baked together he cleared the now heated hearth put the meat and fruit on it then placed his great platter over it and heaped fire round the platter and light combustibles over it while this was going on helen took him to her bower and showed him three rusty iron hoops and a piece of rotten wood with a rusty nail and the marks where others had been there said she that is all i could find why it is a treasure cried he you will see i have found something too he then showed her the vegetable wool and vegetable hair he had collected and told her where they grew she owned they were wonderful imitations and would do as well as the real things and ere they had done comparing notes the platter and the dinner under it were both baked hazel removed the platter or milkpan and served the dinner in it if hazel was inventive helen was skillful and quick at any kind of womans work and the following is the result of the three weeks work under his direction she had made as follows thick mattress stuffed with the vegetable hair and wool described above the mattress was only two feet six inches wide for helen found that she never turned in bed now she slept as she had never slept before this mattress was made with plantainleaves sewed together with the thread furnished by the tree itself and doubled at the edges a long shallow net four feet deepcocoafiber a great quantity of stout grass rope and light but close matting for the roof and some cocoanut matting for the ground and to go under the mattress but hazel instructed by her had learned to plaitrather clumsilyand he had a hand in the matting hazel in the meantime heightened his own mud banks in the center and set up brick fireplaces with hearth and chimney one on each side and now did all the cooking for he found the smoke from wood made miss rolleston cough he also made a number of pigeonholes in his mud walls and lined them with clay one of these he dried with fire and made a pottery door to it and there kept the luciferbox he made a vast number of bricks but did nothing with them after several failures he made two large pots and two great pans that would all four bear fire under them and in the pans he boiled seawater till it all evaporated and left him a sediment of salt this was a great addition to their food and he managed also to put by a little but it was a slow process he made a huge pair of bellows with a little assistance from miss rolleston the spout was a sagostick with the pith driven out and the substitute for leather was the skin of a huge eel he found stranded at the east point having got his bellows and fixed them to a post he drove into the ground he took for his anvil a huge flint stone and a smaller one for hammer heated his old iron to a white heat and hammered it with a world of trouble into straight lengths and at last with a portion of it produced a long saw without teeth but one side sharper than the other this by repeated experiments of heating and immersing in water he at last annealed and when he wanted to saw he blew his embers to a white heat he kept the fire alive now night and day heated his original saw redhot and soon sawed through the oleaginous woods of that island if he wanted to cut down a tree in the jungle he put the bellows and a pot of embers on his cart with other fuel and came and lighted the fire under the tree and soon had it down he made his pickax in half an hour but with his eyes rather than his hands he found a young tree growing on the rock or at least on soil so shallow that the root was half above ground and at right angles to the stem he got this tree up shortened the stem shaped the root shod the point with some of his late old iron and with this primitive tool and a thick stake baked at the point he opened the ground to receive twelve stout uprights and he drove them with a tremendous mallet made upon what might be called the compendious or hazelian method it was a section of a hard tree with a thick shoot growing out of it which shoot being shortened served for the handle by these arts he at last saw a goal to his labors animal food oil pitch ink paper were still wanting but fish were abundant and plantains and cocoanuts stored above all helens hut was now weathertight stout horizontal bars were let into the trees and being bound to the uprights they mutually supported each other smaller horizontal bars at intervals kept the prickly ramparts from being driven in by a sudden gust the canvas walls were removed and the nails stored in a pigeonhole and a stout network substituted to which huge plantain leaves were cunningly fastened with plantain thread the roof was double first that extraordinary mass of spiked leaves which the four trees threw out then several feet under that the huge piece of matting the pair had made this was strengthened by double strips of canvas at the edges and in the center and by single strips in other parts a great many cords and strings made of that wonderful grass were sewn to the canvasstrengthened edges and so it was fastened to the trees and fastened to the horizontal bars when this work drew close to its completion hazel could not disguise his satisfaction but he very soon had the mortification of seeing that she for whom it was all done did not share his complacency a change took place in her she often let her work fall and brooded she spoke sometimes sharply to mr hazel and sometimes with strained civility she wandered away from him and from his labors for her comfort and passed hours at telegraph point eying the illimitable ocean she was a riddle all sweetness at times but at others irritable moody and scarce mistress of herself hazel was sorry and perplexed and often expressed a fear she was ill the answer was always in the negative he did not press her but worked on for her hoping the mood would pass and so it would no doubt if the cause had not remained matters were still in this uncomfortable and mysterious state when hazel put his finishing stroke to her abode he was in high spirits that evening for he had made a discovery he had at last found time for a walk and followed the river to its source a very remarkable lake in a hilly basin near this was a pond the water of which he had tasted and found it highly bituminous and making further researches he had found at the bottom of a rocky ravine a very wonderful thinga dark resinous fluid bubbling up in quite a fountain which however fell down again as it rose and hardly any overflowed it was like thin pitch of course in another hour he was back there with a great pot and half filled it it was not like water it did not bubble so high when some had been taken so he just took what he could get pursuing his researches a little further he found a range of rocks with snowy summits apparently but the snow was the guano of centuries he got to the western extremity of the island saw another deep bay or rather branch of the sea and on the other side of it a tongue of high land running out to sea on that promontory stood a gigantic palmtree he recognized that with a certain thrill but was in a great hurry to get home with his pot of pitch for it was in truth a very remarkable discovery though not without a parallel he could not wait till morning so with embers and cocoanut he made a fire in the bower and melted his pitch which had become nearly solid and proceeded to smear the inside of the matting in places to make it thoroughly watertight helen treated the discovery at first with mortifying indifference but he hoped she would appreciate natures bounty more when she saw the practical use of this extraordinary production he endeavored to lead her to that view she shook her head sorrowfully he persisted she met him with silence he thought this peevish and ungrateful to heaven we have all different measures of the wonderful and to him a fountain of pitch was a thing to admire greatly and thank god for he said as much to helen it was nasty stuff and who cares where it came from she conveyed as much by a shrug of the shoulders and then gave a sigh that told her mind was far away he was a little mortified and showed it one word led to another and at last what had been long fermenting came out mr hazel said she you and i are at cross purposes you mean to live here i do not hazel left off working and looked greatly perplexed the attack was so sudden in its form though it had been a long time threatening he found nothing to say and she was impatient now to speak her mind so she replied to his look you are making yourself at home here you are contented contented you are happy in this horrible prison and why not said hazel but he looked rather guilty here are no traitors no murderers the animals are my friends and the one human being i see makes me better to look at her mr hazel i am in a state of mind that romantic nonsense jars on me be honest with me and talk to me like a man i say that you beam all over with happiness and content and that you now answer me one question why have you never lighted the bonfire on telegraph point indeed i dont know said he submissively i have been so occupied you have and how not in trying to deliver us both from this dreadful situation but to reconcile me to it yes sir under pretense that is a harsh word but i cant help it of keeping out the rain your rain is a bugbear it never rains it never will rain you are killing yourself almost to make me comfortable in this place comfortable she began to tremble all over with excitement long restrained and do you really suppose you can make me live on like this by building me a nice hut do you think i am all body and no soul that shelter and warmth and enough to eat can keep my heart from breaking and my cheeks from blushing night and day when i wake in the morning i find myself blushing to my fingers ends then she walked away from him then she walked back oh my dear father why did i ever leave you keep me here make me live months and years on this island have you sisters have you a mother ask yourself is it likely no if you will not help me and they dont love me enough to come and find me and take me home ill go to another home without your help or any mans then she rose suddenly to her feet ill tie my clothes tight round me and fling myself down from that point on to the sharp rocks below ill find a way from this place to heaven if theres no way from it to those i love on earth then she sank down and rocked herself and sobbed hard the strong passion of this hitherto gentle creature quite frightened her unhappy friend who knew more of books than women he longed to soothe her and comfort her but what could he say he cried out in despair my god can i do nothing for her she turned on him like lightning you can do anythingeverything you can restore us both to our friends you can save my life my reason for that will go first i think what had i done what had i ever done since i was born to be so brought down was ever an english lady and then i have such an irritation on my skin all over me i sometimes wish the tiger would come and tear me all to pieces yes all to pieces and with that her white teeth clicked together convulsively do said she darting back to the point as swiftly as she had rushed away from it why put down that nasty stuff and leave off inventing fifty little trumpery things for me and do one great thing instead oh do not fritter that great mind of yours away in painting and patching my prison but bring it all to bear on getting me out of my prison call sea and land to our rescue let them know a poor girl is here in unheardof unfathomable miseryhere in the middle of this awful ocean hazel sighed deeply no ships seem to pass within sight of us he muttered what does that matter to you you are not a common man you are an inventor rouse all the powers of your mind there must be some way think for me think think or my blood will be on your head hazel turned pale and put his head in his hands and tried to think she leaned toward him with great flashing eyes of purest hazel the problem dropped from his lips a syllable at a time to diffuseintelligencea hundred leagues from a fixed pointan island she leaned toward him with flashing expectant eyes but he groaned and said that seems impossible then trample on it said she bringing his own words against him for she used to remember all he said to her in the day and ponder it at nighttrample on it subdue it or never speak to me again ah i am an ungrateful wretch to speak so harshly to you it is my misery not me good kind mr hazel oh pray pray pray bring all the powers of that great mind to bear on this one thing and save a poor girl to whom you have been so kind so considerate so noble so delicate so forbearing now save me from despair hysterical sobs cut her short here and hazel whose loving heart she had almost torn out of his body could only falter out in a broken voice that he would obey her ill work no more for you at present said he sweet as it has been i will think instead i will go this moment beneath the stars and think all night the young woman was now leaning her head languidly back against one of the trees weak as water after her passion he cast a look of ineffable love and pity on her and withdrew slowly to think beneath the tranquil stars love has set men hard tasks in his time whether this was a light one our reader shall decide to diffuse intelligence from a fixed island over a hundred leagues of ocean chapter xxvii the perplexity into which hazel was thrown by the outburst of his companion rendered him unable to reduce her demand at once to an intelligible form for some moments he seriously employed his mind on the problem until it assumed this shape firstly i do not know where this island is having no means of ascertaining either its latitude or longitude secondly if i had such a description of its locality how might the news be conveyed beyond the limits of the place as the wildness of helens demand broke upon his mind he smiled sadly and sat down upon the bank of the little river near his boathouse and buried his head in his hands a deep groan burst from him and the tears at last came through his fingers as in despair he thought how vain must be any effort to content or to conciliate her impatient with his own weakness he started to his feet when a hand was laid gently upon his arm she stood beside him mr hazel she said hurriedlyher voice was huskydo not mind what i have said i am unreasonable and i am sure i ought to feel obliged to you for all the hazel turned his face toward her and the moon glistened on the tears that still flowed down his cheeks he tried to check the utterance of her apology but ere he could master his voice the girls cold and constrained features seemed to melt she turned away wrung her hands and with a sharp quivering cry she broke forth oh sir oh mr hazel do forgive me i am not ungrateful indeed indeed i am not but i am mad with despair judge me with compassion at this moment those who are very very dear to me are awaiting my arrival in london and when they learn the loss of the proserpine how great will be their misery well that misery is added to mine then my poor papa he will never know how much he loved me until this news reaches him and to think that i am dead to them yet living living here helplessly helplessly dear dear arthur how you will suffer for my sake oh papa papa shall i never see you again and she wept bitterly i am helpless either to aid or to console you miss rolleston by the act of a divine providence you were cast upon this desolate shore and by the same will i was appointed to serve and to provide for your welfare i pray god that he will give me health and strength to assist you goodnight she looked timidly at him for a moment then slowly regained her hut he had spoken coldly and with dignity she felt humbled the more so that he had only bowed his acknowledgment to her apology for more than an hour she watched him as he paced up and down between the boathouse and the shore then he advanced a little toward her shelter and she shrank into her bed after gently closing the door in a few moments she crept again to peep forth and to see if he were still there but he had disappeared the following morning helen was surprised to see the boat riding at anchor in the surf and hazel busily engaged on her trim he was soon on shore and by her side i am afraid i must leave you for a day miss rolleston he said i wish to make a circuit of the island indeed i ought to have done so many days ago is such an expedition necessary surely you have had enough of the sea it is very necessary you have urged me to undertake this enterprise you see it is the first step toward announcing to all passing vessels our presence in this place i have commenced operations already see on yonder bluff which i have called telegraph point i have mounted the boats ensign and now it floats from the top of the tree beside the bonfire i carried it there at sunrise do you see that pole i have shipped on board the boat that is intended as a signal which shall be exhibited on your great palmtree the flag will then stand for a signal on the northern coast and the palmtree thus accoutered will serve for a similar purpose on the western extremity of the island as i pass along the southern and eastern shores i propose to select spots where some mark can be erected such as may be visible to ships at sea but will they remark such signals be assured they will if they come within sight of the place hazel knew that there was little chance of such an event but it was something not to be neglected he also explained that it was necessary he should arrive at a knowledge of the island the character of its shores and from the sea he could rapidly obtain a plan of the place ascertain what small rivers there might be and indeed see much of its interior for he judged it to be not more than ten miles in length and scarce three in width helen felt rather disappointed that no trace of the emotion he displayed on the previous night remained in his manner or in the expression of his face she bowed her permission to him rather haughtily and sat down to breakfast on some baked yams and some rough oysters which he had raked up from the bay while bathing that morning the young man had regained an elasticity of hearing an independence of tone to which she was not at all accustomed his manners were always soft and deferential but his expression was more firm and she felt that the reins had been gently removed from her possession and there was a will to guide her which she was bound to acknowledge and obey she did not argue in this wise for it is not human to reason and to feel at the same moment she felt then instinctively that the man was quietly asserting his superiority and the child pouted hazel went about his work briskly the boat was soon laden with every requisite helen watched these preparations askance vexed with the expedition which she had urged him to make then she fell to reflecting on the change that seemed to have taken place in her character she who was once so womanly so firm so reasonablewhy had she become so petulant childish and capricious the sail was set and all ready to run the cutter into the surf of the rising tide when taking a sudden resolution as it were helen came rapidly down and said i will go with you if you please half in command and half in doubt hazel looked a little surprised but very pleased and then she added i hope i shall not be in your way he assured her on the contrary that she might be of great assistance to him and now with double alacrity he ran out the little vessel and leaped into the prow as she danced over the waves he taught her how to bring the boats head round with the help of an oar and when all was snug left her at the helm on reaching the mouth of the bay if it could so be called he made her remark that it was closed by reefs except to the north and to the west the wind being southerly he had decided to pass to the west and so they opened the sea about half a mile from the shore for about three miles they perceived it consisted of a line of bluffs cleft at intervals by small narrow bays the precipitous sides of which were lined with dense foliage into these fissures the sea entered with a mournful sound that died away as it crept up the yellow sands with which these nooks were carpeted an exclamation from helen attracted his attention to the horizon on the northwest where a long line of breakers glittered in the sun a reef or low sandy bay appeared to exist in that direction about fifteen miles away and something more than a mile in length as they proceeded he marked roughly on the side of his tin baler with the point of a pin borrowed from helen the form of the coast line an hour and a half brought them to the northwestern extremity of the island as they cleared the shelter of the land the southerly breeze coming with some force across the open sea caught the cutter and she lay over in a way to inspire helen with alarm she was about to let go the tiller when hazel seized it accidentally inclosing her hand under the grasp of his own as he pressed the tiller hard to port steady please dont relinquish your hold it is all rightno fear he cried as he kept his eye on their sail he held this course for a mile or more and then judging with a long tack he could weather the southerly side of the island he put the boat about he took occasion to explain to helen how this operation was necessary and she learned the alphabet of navigation the western end of their little land now lay before them it was about three miles in breadth for two miles the bluff coast line continued unbroken then a deep bay a mile in width and two miles in depth was made by a long tongue of sand projecting westerly on its extremity grew the gigantic palm well recognized as helens landmark hazel stood up in the boat to reconnoiter the coast he perceived the sandy shore was dotted with multitudes of dark objects ere long these objects were seen to be in motion and pointing them out to helen with a smile he said beware miss rolleston yonder are your bugbearsand in some force too those dark masses moving upon the hillocks of sand or rolling on the surf are sealionsthe phoca leonina or lionseal helen strained her eyes to distinguish the forms but only descried the dingy objects while thus engaged she allowed the cutter to fall off a little and ere hazel had resumed his hold upon the tiller they were fairly in the bay the great palmtree on their starboard bow you seem determined to make the acquaintance of your nightmares he remarked you perceive that we are embayed her consternation amused him she saw that if they held their present course the cutter would take the beach about a mile ahead where these animals were densely crowded at this moment something dark bulged up close beside her in the sea and the rounded back of a monster rolled over and disappeared hazel let drop the sail for they were now fairly in the smooth water of the bay and close to the sandy spit the gigantic stem of the palmtree was on their quarter about half a mile off he took to the oars and rowed slowly toward the shore a small seal rose behind the boat and followed them playing with the blade its gambols resembling that of a kitten he pointed out to helen the mild expression of the creatures face and assured her that all this tribe were harmless animals and susceptible of domestication the cub swam up to the boat quite fearlessly and he touched its head gently he encouraged her to do the like but she shrank from its contact they were now close ashore and hazel throwing out his anchor in two feet of water prepared to land the beam of wood he had brought to decorate the palmtree as a signal the huge stick was soon heaved overboard and he leaped after it he towed it to the nearest landing to the tree and dragged it high up on shore scarcely had he disposed it conveniently intending to return in a day or two with the means of affixing it in a prominent and remarkable manner in the form of a spar across the trunk of the palm when a cry from helen recalled him a large number of the sealions were coasting quietly down the surf toward the boat indeed a dozen of them had made their appearance around it hazel shouted to her not to fear and desiring that her alarm should not spread to the swarm he passed back quietly but rapidly when he reached the water three or four of the animals were already floundering between him and the boat he waded slowly toward one of them and stood beside it the man and the creature looked quietly at each other and then the seal rolled over with a snuffling selfsatisfied air winking its soft eyes with immense complacency helen in her alarm could not resist a smile at this conclusion of so terrible a demonstration for with all their gentle expression the tusks of the brute looked formidable but when she saw hazel pushing them aside and patting a very small cub on the back she recovered her courage completely then he took to his oars again and aided by the tide which was now on the ebb he rowed round the southwestern extremity of the island he found the water here as he anticipated very shallow it was midday when they were fairly on the southern coast and now sailing with the wind aft the cutter ran through the water at racing speed fearing that some reefs or rocky formations might exist in their course he reduced sail and kept away from the shore about a mile at this distance he was better able to see inland and mark down the accident of its formation the southern coast was uniform and helen said it resembled the cliffs of the kentish or sussex coast of england only the english white was here replaced by the pale volcanic gray by one oclock they came abreast the very spot where they had first made land and as they judged due south of their residence had they landed here a walk of three miles across the center of the island would have brought them home for about a similar distance the coast exhibited monotonous cliffs unbroken even by a rill it was plain that the watershed of the island was all northward they now approached the eastern end where rose the circular mountain of which mention has been already made this eminence had evidently at one time been detached from the rest of the land to which it was now joined by a neck of swamp about a mile and a half in breadth and two miles in length hazel proposed to reconnoiter this part of the shore nearly and ran the boat close in to land the reeds or canes with which this bog was densely clothed grew in a dark spongy soil here and there this waste was dotted with ragged trees which he recognized as the cypress from its gaunt branches hung a black funeral kind of weeper a kind of moss resembling irongray horsehair both in texture and uses though not so long in the staple this parasite hazel explained to helen was very common in such marshy ground and was the deathflag hung out by nature to warn man that malaria and fever were the invisible and inalienable inhabitants of that fatal neighborhood looking narrowly along the low shore for some good landing where under shelter of a tree they might repose for an hour and spread their midday repast they discovered an opening in the reeds a kind of lagoon or bayou extending into the morass between the highlands of the island and the circular mountain but close under the base of the latter this inlet he proposed to explore and accordingly the sail was taken down and the cutter was poled into the narrow creek the water here was so shallow that the keel slid over the quicksand into which the oar sank freely the creek soon became narrow the water deeper and of a blacker color and the banks more densely covered with canes these grew to the height of ten and twelve feet and as close as wheat in a thick crop the air felt dank and heavy and hummed with myriads of insects the black water became so deep and the bottom so sticky that hazel took to the oars again the creek narrowed as they proceeded until it proved scarcely wide enough to admit of his working the boat the height of the reeds hindered the view on either side suddenly however and after proceeding very slowly through the bends of the canal they decreased in height and density and they emerged into an open space of about five acres in extent a kind of oasis in this reedy desert created by a mossy mound which arose amid the morass and afforded firm footing of which a grove of trees and innumerable shrubs availed themselves helen uttered an exclamation of delight as this island of foliage in a sea of reeds met her eyes that had been famished with the arid monotony of the brake they soon landed helen insisted on the preparations for their meal being left to her and having selected a sheltered spot she was soon busy with their frugal food hazel surveyed the spot and selecting a red cedar was soon seated forty feet above her head making a topographical survey of the neighborhood he found that the bayou by which they had entered continued its course to the northern shore thus cutting off the mountain or easterly end and forming of it a separate island he saw that a quarter of a mile farther on the bayou or canal parted forming two streams of which that to the left seemed the main channel this he determined to follow turning to the west that is toward their home he saw at a distance of two miles a crest of hills broken into cliffs which defined the limit of the mainland the sea had at one time occupied the site where the morass now stood these cliffs formed a range extending from north to south their precipitous sides clothed here and there with trees marked where the descent was broken by platforms between him and this range the morass extended hazel took note of three places where the descent from these hills into the marsh could he believed most readily be made on the eastern side and close above him arose the peculiar mountain its form was that of a truncated cone and its sides densely covered with trees of some size the voice of helen called him from his perch and he descended quickly leaping into a mass of brushwood growing at the foot of his tree helen stood a few yards from him in admiration before a large shrub look mr hazel what a singular production said the girl as she stooped to examine the plant it bore a number of red flowers each growing out of a fruit like a prickly pear these flowers were in various stages some were just opening like tulips others more advanced had expanded like umbrellas and quite overlapped the fruit keeping it from sun and dew others had served their turn in that way and been withered by the suns rays but wherever this was the case the fruit had also burst open and displayed or discharged its contents and those contents looked like seeds but on narrower inspection proved to be little insects with pink transparent wings and bodies of incredibly vivid crimson hazel examined the fruit and flowers very carefully and stood rapt transfixed it must beand it is said he at last well im glad ive not died without seeing it what is it said she one of the most valuable productions of the earth it is cochineal this is the tunal tree oh indeed said helen indifferently cochineal is used for a dye but as it is not probable we shall require to dye anything the discovery seems to me more curious than useful you wanted some ink this pigment mixed with limejuice will form a beautiful red ink will you lend me your handkerchief and permit me to try if i have forgotten the method by which these little insects are obtained he asked her to hold her handkerchief under a bough of the tunal tree where the fruit was ripe he then shook the bough some insects fell at once into the cloth a great number rose and buzzed a little in the sun not a yard from where they were born but the sun dried their blood so promptly that they soon fell dead in the handkerchief those that the sun so killed went through three phases of color before their eyes they fell down black or nearly they whitened on the cloth and after that came gradually to their final color a flaming crimson the insect thus treated appeared the most vivid of all they soon secured about half a teacupful they were rolled up and put away then they sat down and made a very hearty meal for it was now past two oclock they reentered the boat and passing once more into the morass they found the channel of the bayou as it approached the northern shore less difficult of navigation the bottom became sandy and hard and the presence of trees in the swamp proved that spots of terra firma were more frequent but the water shallowed and as they opened the shore he saw with great vexation that the tide in receding had left the bar at the mouth of the canal visible in some parts he pushed on however until the boat grounded this was a sad affair there lay the sea not fifty yards ahead hazel leaped out and examined and forded the channel which at this place was about two hundred feet wide he found a narrow passage near the eastern side and to this he towed the boat then he begged miss rolleston to land and relieved the boat of the mast sail and oars thus lightened he dragged her into the passage but the time occupied in these preparations had been also occupied by naturethe tide had receded and the cutter stuck immovably in the waterway about six fathoms short of deeper water what is to be done now inquired helen when hazel returned to her side panting but cheerful we must await the rising of the tide i fear we are imprisoned here for three hours at least there was no help for it helen made light of the misfortune the spot where they had landed was inclosed between the two issues of the lagoon they walked along the shore to the more easterly and the narrower canal and on arriving hazel found to his great annoyance that there was ample water to have floated the cutter had he selected that the least promising road he suggested a return by the road they came and passing into the other canal by that to reach the sea they hurried back but found by this time the tide had left the cutter high and dry on the sand so they had no choice but to wait having three hours to spare hazel asked miss rollestons permission to ascend the mountain she assented to remain near the boat while he was engaged in this expedition the ascent was too rugged and steep for her powers and the seashore and adjacent groves would find her ample amusement during his absence she accompanied him to the bank of the smaller lagoon which he forded and waving an adieu to her he plunged into the dense wood with which the sides of the mountain were clothed she waited some time and then she heard his voice shouting to her from the heights above the mountaintop was about threequarters of a mile from where she stood but seemed much nearer she turned back toward the boat walking slowly but paused as a faint and distant cry again reached her ear it was not repeated and then she entered the grove the ground beneath her feet was soft with velvety moss and the dark foliage of the trees rendered the air cool and deliciously fragrant after wandering for some time she regained the edge of the grove near the boat and selecting a spot at the foot of an aged cypress she sat down with her back against its trunk then she took out arthurs letter and began to read those impassioned sentences as she read she sighed deeply as earnestly she found herself pitying arthurs condition more than she regretted her own she fell into reverie and from reverie into a drowsy languor how long she remained in this state she could not remember but a slight rustle overhead recalled her senses believing it to be a bird moving in the branches she was resigning herself again to rest when she became sensible of a strange emotiona conviction that something was watching her with a fixed gaze she cast her eyes around but saw nothing she looked upward from the tree immediately above her lap depended a snake its tail coiled around a dead branch the reptile hung straight its eyes fixed like two rubies upon helens as very slowly it let itself down by its uncoiling tail now its head was on a level with hers in another moment it must drop into her lap she was paralyzed chapter xxviii after toiling up a rugged and steep ascent encumbered with blocks of gray stone of which the island seemed to be formed forcing his way over fallen trees and through the tangled undergrowth of a species of wild vine which abounded on the mountainside hazel stopped to breathe and peer around as well as the dense foliage permitted he was up to his waist in scrub and the stiff leaves of the bayonet plant rendered caution necessary in walking at moments through the dense foliage he caught a glisten of the sea the sun was in the north behind him and by this alone he guided his road due southerly and upward once only he found a small cleared space about an acre in extent and here it was he uttered the cry helen heard he waited a few moments in the hope to hear her voice in reply but it did not reach him again he plunged upward and now the ascent became at times so arduous that more than once he almost resolved to relinquish or at least to defer his task but a moments rest recalled him to himself and he was one not easily baffled by difficulty or labor so he toiled on until he judged the summit ought to have been reached after pausing to take breath and counsel he fancied that he had borne too much to the left the ground to his right appeared to rise more than the path that he was pursuing which had become level and he concluded that instead of ascending he was circling the mountaintop he turned aside therefore and after ten minutes hard climbing he was pushing through a thick and high scrub when the earth seemed to give way beneath him and he fellinto an abyss he was ingulfed he fell from bush to bush down down scratch rip plump until he lodged in a prickly bush more winded than hurt out of this he crawled only to discover himself thus landed in a great and perfectly circular plain of about thirty acres in extent or about three hundred and fifty yards in diameter in the center was a lake also circular the broad belt of shore around this lake was covered with rich grass level as a bowling green and all this again was surrounded by a nearly perpendicular cliff down which indeed he had fallen this cliff was thickly clothed with shrubs and trees hazel recognized the crater of an extinct volcano on examining the lake he found the waters impregnated with volcanic products its bottom was formed of asphaltum having made a circuit of the shores he perceived on the westerly sidethat next the islanda break in the cliff and on a narrow examination he discovered an outlet it appeared to him that the lake at one time had emptied its waters through this ancient watercourse the descent here was not only gradual but the old riverbed was tolerably free from obstructions especially of the vegetable kind he made his way rapidly downward and in half an hour reached marshy ground the canebrake now lay before him on his left he saw the sea on the south about a third of a mile he knew that to the right must be the sea on the north about half a mile or so he bent his way thither the edge of the swamp was very clear and though somewhat spongy afforded good walking unimpeded as he approached the spot where he judged the boat to be the underwood thickened the trees again interlaced their arms and he had to struggle through the foliage at length he struck the smaller lagoon and as he was not certain whether it was fordable he followed its course to the shore where he had previously crossed in a few moments he reached the boat and was pleased to find her afloat the rising tide had even moved her a few feet back into the canal hazel shouted to apprise miss rolleston of his return and then proceeded to restore the mast to its place and replace the rigging and the oars this occupied some little time he felt surprised that she had not appeared he shouted again no reply chapter xxix hazel advanced hurriedly into the grove which he hunted thoroughly but without effect he satisfied himself that she could not have quitted the spot since the marsh inclosed it on one side the canals on the second and third the sea on the fourth he returned to the boat more surprised than anxious he waited awhile and again shouted her namestoppedlistenedno answer yet surely helen could not have been more than a hundred yards from where he stood his heart beat with a strange sense of apprehension he heard nothing but the rustling of the foliage and the sop of the waves on the shore as the tide crept up the shingle as his eyes roved in every direction he caught sight of something white near the foot of a withered cypresstree not fifty yards from where he stood he approached the bushes in which the tree was partially concealed on that side and quickly recognized a portion of helens dress he ran toward herburst through the underwood and gained the inclosure she was sitting there asleep as he conjectured her back leaning against the trunk he contemplated her thus for one moment and then he advanced about to awaken her but was struck speechless her face was ashy pale her eyes open and widely distended her bosom heaved slowly hazel approached rapidly and called to her her eyes never moved not a limb stirred she sat glaring forward on her lap was coiled a snakegray mottled with muddy green hazel looked round and selected a branch of the dead tree about three feet in length armed with this he advanced slowly to the reptile it was very quiet thanks to the warmth of her lap he pointed the stick at it the vermin lifted its head and its tail began to quiver then it darted at the stick throwing itself its entire length hazel retreated the snake coiled again and again darted by repeating this process four or five times he enticed the creature away and then availing himself of a moment before it could recoil he struck it a smart blow on the neck when hazel turned to miss rolleston he found her still fixed in the attitude into which terror had transfixed her the poor girl had remained motionless for an hour under the terrible fascination of the reptile comatized he spoke to her but a quick spasmodic action of her throat and a quivering of her hands alone responded the sight of her suffering agonized him beyond expression but he took her handshe pressed them for they were icy coldhe called piteously on her name but she seemed incapable of effort then stooping he raised her tenderly in his arms and carried her to the boat where he laid her still unresisting and incapable with trembling limbs and weak hands he launched the cutter and they were once more afloat and bound homeward he dipped the baler into the fresh water he had brought with him for their daily supply and dashed it on her forehead this he repeated until he perceived her breathing became less painful and more rapid then he raised her a little and her head rested upon his arm when they reached the entrance of the bay he was obliged to pass it for the wind being still southerly he could not enter by the north gate but came round and ran in by the western passage the same by which they had left the same morning hazel bent over helen and whispered tenderly that they were at home she answered by a sob in half an hour the keel grated on the sand near the boathouse then he asked her if she were strong enough to reach her hut she raised her head but she felt dizzy he helped her to land all power had forsaken her limbs her head sank on his shoulder and his arm wound round her lithe figure alone prevented her falling helplessly at his feet again he raised her in his arms and bore her to the hut here he laid her down on her bed and stood for a moment beside her unable to restrain his tears chapter xxx it was a wretched and anxious night for hazel he watched the hut without the courage to approach it that one moment of weakness which occurred to him on board the proserpine when he had allowed helen to perceive the nature of his feelings toward her had rendered all his actions open to suspicion he dared not exhibit toward her any sympathyhe might not extend to her the most ordinary civility if she fell ill if fever supervened how could he nurse her attend upon her his touch must have a significance he knew that for as he bore her insensible form he embraced rather than carried the precious burden could he look upon her in her suffering without betraying his forbidden love and then would not his attentions afflict more than console chewing the cud of such bitter thoughts he passed the night without noticing the change which was taking place over the island the sun rose and this awakened him from his reverie which had replaced sleep he looked around and then became sensible of the warnings in the air the seabirds flew about vaguely and absurdly and seemed sporting in currents of wind yet there was but little wind down below presently clouds came flying over the sky and blacker masses gathered on the horizon the sea changed color hazel knew the weather was breaking the wet season was at handthe moment when fever if such an invisible inhabitant there was on that island would visit them in a few hours the rain would be upon them and he reproached himself with want of care in the construction of the hut for some hours he hovered around it before he ventured to approach the door and call to helen he thought he heard her voice faintly and he entered she lay there as he had placed her he knelt beside her and was appalled at the change in her appearance the poor girls system had received a shock for which it was unprepared her severe sufferings at sea had strange to say reduced her in appearance less than could have been believed for her physical endurance proved greater than that of the strong men around her but the food which the island supplied was not suited to restore her strength and the nervous shock to which she had been subjected was followed by complete prostration hazel took her unresisting hand which he would have given a world to press he felt her pulse it was weak but slow her cheeks were hollow her eyes sunken her hand dropped helplessly when he released it leaving the hut quietly but hastily he descended the hill to the rivulet which he crossed about half a mile above the boathouse the stream forked one of its branches coming from the west the other from the east between this latter branch and terrapin wood was a stony hill to this spot hazel went and fell to gathering a handful of poppies when he had obtained a sufficient quantity he returned to the boathouse made a small fire of chips and filling his tin baler with water he set down the poppies to boil when the liquor was cool he measured out a portion and drank it in about twenty minutes his temples began to throb a sensation which was rapidly followed by nausea it was midday before he recovered from the effects of his experiment sufficiently to take food then he waited for two hours and felt much restored he stole to the hut and looked in helen lay there as he had left her he stooped over her her eyes were half closed and she turned them slowly upon him her lips moved a littlethat was all he felt her pulse again it was still weaker and slower he rose and went away and regaining the boathouse he measured out a portion of the poppy liquor onethird of the dose he had previously taken and drank it no headache or nausea succeeded he felt his pulse it became quick and violent while a sense of numbness overcame him and he slept it was but for a few minutes he awoke with a throbbing brow and some sickness but with a sense of delight at the heart for he had found an opiate and prescribed its quantity he drained the liquor away from the poppy leaves and carried it to the hut measuring with great care a small quantity he lifted the girls head and placed it to her lips she drank it mechanically then he watched beside her until her breathing and her pulse changed in character she slept he turned aside then and buried his face in his hands and prayed fervently for her lifeprayed as we pray for the daily bread of the heart he prayed and waited chapter xxxi the next morning when helen awoke she was very weak her head ached but she was herself hazel had made a broth for her from the fleshy part of a turtle this greatly revived her and by midday she was able to sit up having seen that her wants were within her reach he left her but in a few moments she heard him busily engaged on the roof of her hut on his return he explained to her his fears that the structure was scarcely as weatherproof as he desired and he anticipated hourly the commencement of the rainy season helen smiled and pointed to the sky which here was clear and bright but hazel shook his head doubtingly the wet season would commence probably with an atmospheric convulsion and then settle down to uninterrupted rain helen refused obstinately to believe in more rain than they had experienced on board the boata genial shower you will see replied hazel if you do not change your views within the next three days then call me a false prophet the following day passed and helen recovered more strength but still was too weak to walk but she employed herself at hazels request in making a rope of cocoanut fiber some forty yards long this he required to fish up the spar to a sufficient height on the great palmtree and bind it firmly in its place while she worked nimbly he employed himself in gathering a store of such things as they would require during the coming wintry season she watched him with a smile but he persevered so that day passed the next morning the rope was finished helen was not so well and was about to help herself to the poppy liquor when hazel happily stopped her hand in time he showed her the exact dose necessary and explained minutely the effects of a larger draught then he shouldered the rope and set out for palmtree point he was absent about six hours of which helen slept four and for two which seemed very long she ruminated what was she thinking of that made her smile and weep at the same moment and she looked so impatiently toward the door he entered at last very fatigued it was eleven miles to the point and back while eating his frugal supper he gave her a detail of his days adventures strange to say he had not seen a single seal on the sands he described how he had tied one end of her rope to the middle of the spar and with the other between his teeth he climbed the great palm for more than an hour he toiled he gained its top passed the rope over one of its branches and hauled up the spar to about eighty feet above the ground then descending with the other end he wound the rope spirally round and round the tree thus binding to its trunk the first twenty feet by which the spar hung from the branch she listened very carelessly he thought and betrayed little interest in this enterprise which had cost him so much labor and fatigue when he had concluded she was silent awhile and then looking up quickly said to his great surprise i think i may increase the dose of your medicine there you are mistaken in its power i am sure i can take four times what you gave me indeed you are mistaken he answered quickly i gave you the extreme measure you can take with safety how do you know that you can only guess at its effects at any rate i shall try it hazel hesitated and then confessed that he had made a little experiment on himself before risking its effects upon her helen looked up at him as he said this so simply and quietly her great eyes filled with an angelic light was it admiration was it thankfulness her bosom heaved and her lips quivered it was but a moment and she felt glad that hazel had turned away from her and saw nothing a long silence followed this little episode when she was aroused from her reverie patterpatpatpatter she looked up patpatterpatter their eyes met it was the rain hazel only smiled a little and then ran down to his boathouse to see that all was right there and then returned with a large bundle of chips with which he made a fire for the sky had darkened overhead gusts of wind ran along the water it had become suddenly chilly they had almost forgotten the feel of wet weather ere the fire had kindled the rain came down in torrents and the matted roof being resonant they heard it strike here and there above their heads helen sat down on her little stool and reflected in that hut were two persons one had foretold this and feared it and provided against it the other had said petulantly it was a bugbear and now the rain was pattering and the prophet was on his knees making her as comfortable as he could in spite of all and was not the man to remind her he had foretold it she pondered his character while she watched his movements he put down his embers then he took a cocoapod out from the wall cut it in slices with his knife and made a fine clear fire then he ran out again in spite of helens remonstrance and brought a dozen large scales of the palmtree it was all the more cheering for the dismal scene without and the pattering of the rain on the resounding roof but thanks to hazels precaution the hut proved weathertight of which fact having satisfied himself he bade her goodnight he was at the door when her voice recalled him mr hazel i cannot rest this night without asking your pardon for all the unkind things i may have done and said without thanking you humbly for your great forbearance and yourrespect for the unhap i mean the unfortunate girl thus cast upon your mercy she held out her hand he took it between his own and faintly expressed his gratitude for her kindness and so she sent him away brimful of happiness the rain was descending in torrents she heard it but he did not feel it for she had spread her angels wings over his existence and he regained his sheltered boathouse he knew not how chapter xxxii the next day was sunday hazel had kept a calendar of the week and every seventh day was laid aside with jealousy to be devoted to such simple religious exercises as he could invent the rain still continued with less violence indeed but without an hours intermission after breakfast he read to her the exodus of the israelites and their sufferings during that desert life he compared those hardships with their own troubles and pointed out to her how their condition presented many things to be thankful for the island was fruitful the climate healthy they might have been cast away on a sandy key or reef where they would have perished slowly and miserably of hunger and exposure then they were spared to each other had she been alone there she could not have provided for herself had he been cast away a solitary man the island would have been to him an intolerable prison in all these reflections hazel was very guarded that no expression should escape him to arouse her apprehension he was so careful of this that she observed his caution and watched his restraint and helen was thinking more of this than of the holy subject on which he was discoursing the disguise he threw over his heart was penetrable to the girls eye she saw his love in every careful word and employed herself in detecting it under his rigid manner secure in her own position she could examine his from the loopholes of her soul and take a pleasure in witnessing the suppressed happiness she could bestow with a word she did not wonder at her power the best of women have the natural vanity to take for granted the sway they assume over the existence which submits to them a week passed thus and hazel blessed the rain that drove them to this sociability he had prepared the bladder of a young seal which had drifted ashore dead this membrane dried in the sun formed a piece of excellent parchment and he desired to draw upon it a map of the island to accomplish this the first thing was to obtain a good red ink from the cochineal which is crimson he did according to his means he got one of the tin vessels and filed it till he had obtained a considerable quantity of the metal this he subjected for forty hours to the action of limejuice he then added the cochineal and mixed till he obtained a fine scarlet in using it he added a small quantity of a hard and pure gumhe had found gum abounded in the island his pen was made from an ospreys feather hundreds of which were strewn about the cliffs and some of these he had already secured and dried placing his tin baler before him on which he had scratched his notes he drew a map of the island what shall we call it said he helen paused and then replied call it godsend island so i will he said and wrote it down then they named the places they had seen the reef helen had discovered off the northwest coast they called white water island because of the breakers then came seal bay palmtree point mount lookout this was the hill due south of where they lived they called the canebrake wild duck swamp and the spot where they lunched cochineal clearing the mountain was named mount cavity but what shall we call the capital of the kingdomthis hut said miss rolleston as she leaned over him and pointed to the spot saint helens said hazel looking up and he wrote it down ere she could object then there was a little awkward pause while he was busily occupied in filling up some topographical details she turned it off gayly what are those caterpillars that you have drawn there sprawling over my kingdom she asked caterpillars you are complimentary miss rolleston those are mountains oh indeed and those lines you are now drawing are rivers i presume yes let us call this branch of our solitary estuary which runs westward the river lea and this to the east the river medway is such your majestys pleasure la reine le veut replied helen smiling but master geographer it seems to me that you are putting in mountains and rivers which you have never explored how do you know that these turns and twists in the stream exist as you represent them and those spurs which look so real have you not added them only to disguise the caterpillar character of your range of hills hazel laughed as he confessed to drawing on his fancy for some little details but pleaded that all geographers when they drew maps were licensed to fill in a few such touches where discovery had failed to supply particulars helen had always believed religiously in maps and was amused when she reflected on her former credulity chapter xxxiii helens strength was coming back to her but slowly she complained of great lassitude and want of appetite but the following day having cleared up the sun shone out with great power and brilliancy she gladly welcomed the return of the fine weather but hazel shook his head ten days rain was not their portionthe bad weather would return and complete the month or six weeks winter to which nature was entitled the next evening the appearance of the sky confirmed his opinion the sun set like a crimson shield gory and double its usual size it entered into a thick bank of dark violet cloud that lay on the horizon and seemed to split the vapor into rays but of a dusky kind immediately above this crimson the clouds were of a brilliant gold but higher they were the color of rubies and went gradually off to gray but as the orb dipped to the horizon a solid pile of unearthly clouds came up from the southeast their bodies were singularly and unnaturally black and mottled with coppercolor and hemmed with a fiery yellow and these infernal clouds towered up their heads pressing forward as if they all strove for precedency it was like miltons fiends attacking the sky the rate at which they climbed was wonderful the sun set and the moon rose full and showed those angry masses surging upward and jostling each other as they flew yet below it was dead calm having admired the sublimity of the scene and seen the full moon rise but speedily lose her light in a brassy halo they entered the hut which was now the headquarters and they supped together there while they were eating their little meal the tops of the trees were heard to sigh so still was everything else none the less did those strange clouds fly northward eighty miles an hour after supper helen sat busy over the fire where some gum collected by hazel resembling indiarubber was boiling she was preparing to cover a pair of poor welchs shoes inside and out with a coat of this material which hazel believed to be waterproof she sat in such a position that he could watch her it was a happy evening she seemed content she had got over her fear of him they were good comrades if they were nothing more it was happiness to him to be by her side even on those terms he thought of it all as he looked at her how distant she had seemed once to him what an unapproachable goddess yet there she was by his side in a hut he had made for her he could not help sipping the soft intoxicating draught her mere presence offered him but by and by he felt his heart was dissolving within him and he was trifling with danger he must not look on her too long seated by the fire like a wife the muchenduring man rose and turned his back upon the sight he loved so dearly he went out at the open door intending to close it and bid her goodnight but he did not do so just then for his attention as an observer of nature was arrested by the unusual conduct of certain animals gannets and other seabirds were running about the opposite wood and craning their necks in a strange way he had never seen one enter that wood before seals and sealions were surrounding the slope and crawling about and now and then plunging into the river which they crossed with infinite difficulty for it was running very high and strong the trees also sighed louder than ever hazel turned back to tell miss rolleston something extraordinary was going on she sat in sight from the river and as he came toward the hut he saw her sitting by the fire reading he stopped short her work lay at her feet she had taken out a letter and she was reading it by the fire as she read it her face was a puzzle but hazel saw the act alone and a dart of ice seemed to go through and through him this then was her true source of consolation he thought it was so before he had even reason to think so but never seeing any palpable proofs he had almost been happy he turned sick with jealous misery and stood there rooted and frozen then came a fierce impulse to shut the sight out that caused this pain he almost flung her portoullis to and made his hands bleed but a bleeding heart does not feel scratches goodnight said he hoarsely goodnight said she kindly and why should she not read his letter she was his affianced bride bound to him by honor as well as inclination this was the reflection to which after a sore battle with his loving heart the muchenduring man had to come at last and he had come to it and was getting back his peace of mind though not his late complacency and about to seek repose in sleep when suddenly a clap of wind came down like thunder and thrashed the island and everything in it everything animate and inanimate seemed to cry out as the blow passed another soon followed and anotherintermittent gusts at present but of such severity that not one came without making its mark birds were driven away like paper the sealions whimpered and crouched into corners and huddled together and held each other whining hazel saw but one thing the frail edifice he had built for the creature he adored he looked out of his boat and fixed his horrorstricken eyes on it he saw it waving to and fro yet still firm but he could not stay there if not in danger she must be terrified he must go and support her he left his shelter and ran toward her hut with a whoop and a scream another blast tore through the wood and caught him he fell dug his hands into the soil and clutched the earth while he was in that position he heard a sharp crack he looked up in dismay and saw that one of helens trees had broken like a carrot and the head was on the ground leaping about while a succession of horrible sounds of crashing and rending and tearing showed the frail hut was giving way on every side racked and riven and torn to pieces hazel though a stout man uttered cries of terror death would never have drawn from him and with a desperate headlong rush he got to the place where the bower had been but now it was a prostrate skeleton with the mat roof flapping like a loose sail above it and helen below as he reached the hut the wind got hold of the last of the four shrubs that did duty for a door and tore it from the cord that held it and whirled it into the air it went past hazels face like a bird flying though staggered himself by the same blow of wind he clutched the tree and got into the hut he found her directly she was kneeling beneath the mat that a few minutes ago had been her roof he extricated her in a moment uttering inarticulate cries of pity and fear dont be frightened said she i am not hurt but he felt her quiver from head to foot he wrapped her in all her rugs and thinking of nothing but her safety lifted her in his strong arms to take her to his own place which was safe from wind at least but this was no light work to go there erect was impossible holding tight by the tree he got her to the lee of the tent and waited for a lull he went rapidly down the hill but ere he reached the river a gust came careering over the sea a sturdy young tree was near him he placed her against it and wound his arms round her and its trunk the blast came the tree bent down almost to the ground then whirled round recovered shivered but he held firmly it passed again he lifted her and bore her to the boathouse as he went the wind almost choked her and her long hair lashed his face like a whip but he got her in and then sat panting and crouching but safe they were none too soon the tempest increased in violence and became more continuous no clouds but a ghastly glare all over the sky no rebellious waves but a sea hissing and foaming under its masters lash the river ran roaring and foaming by and made the boat heave even in its little creek the wind though it could no longer shake them went screaming terribly close over their headsno longer like air in motion but solid and keen it seemed the almightys scythe mowing down nature and soon it became like turbid water blackened with the leaves branches and fragments of all kinds it whirled along with it the trees fell crashing on all sides and the remains passed over their heads into the sea helen behaved admirably speech was impossible but she thanked him without iteloquently she nestled her little hand into hazels and to hazel that night with all its awful sights and sounds was a blissful one she had been in danger but now was safe by his side she had pressed his hand to thank him and now she was cowering a little toward him in a way that claimed him as her protector her glorious hair blew over him and seemed to net him and now and then as they heard some crash nearer and more awful than another she clutched him quickly though lightly for in danger her sex love to feel a friend it is not enough to see him near and once when a great dusky form of a sealion came crawling over the mound and whimpering peeped into the boathouse she even fled to his shoulder with both hands for a moment and was there light as a feather till the creature had passed on and his soul was full of peace and a great tranquillity overcame it he heard nothing of the wrack knew nothing of the danger oh mighty love the tempest might blow and fill the air and earth with ruin so that it spared her the wind was kind and gentle the night which brought that hair round his face and that head so near his shoulder and gave him the holy joy of protecting under his wing the soft creature he adored chapter xxxiv on the morning that followed this memorable night our personages seemed to change characters hazel sat down before the relics of the hutthree or four strings dangling and a piece of network wavingand eyed them with shame regret and humiliation he was so absorbed in his selfreproaches that he did not hear a light footstep and helen rolleston stood near him a moment or two and watched the play of his countenance with a very inquisitive and kindly light in her own eyes never mind said she soothingly hazel started at the music never mind your house being blown to atoms and mine has stood said he half reproachfully you took too much pains with mine i will take a great deal more with the next i hope not but i want you to come and look at the havoc it is terrible and yet so grand and thus she drew him away from the sight that caused his pain they entered the wood by a path hazel had cut from the seashore and viewed the devastation in terrapin wood prostrate trees lay across one another in astonishing numbers and in the strangest positions and their glorious plumes swept the earth come said she it is a bad thing for the poor trees but not for us see the place is strewed with treasures here is a tree full of fans all ready made and what is that a horses tail growing on a cocoatree and a long one too that will make ropes for you and thread for me ah and here is a cabbage poor mr welch well for one thing you need never saw nor climb any more see the advantages of a hurricane from the wood she took him to the shore and there they found many birds lying dead and hazel picked up several that he had read of as good to eat for certain signs had convinced him his fair and delicate companion was carnivorous and must be nourished accordingly seeing him so employed she asked him archly whether he was beginning to see the comforts of a hurricane not yet said he the account is far from even then come to where the rock was blown down she led the way gayly across the sands to a point where an overhanging crag had fallen with two trees and a quantity of earth and plants that grew above it but when they got nearer she became suddenly grave and stood still the mass had fallen upon a sheltered place where seals were hiding from the wind and had buried several for two or three limbs were sticking out of victims overwhelmed in the ruin and a magnificent sealion lay clear of the smaller rubbish but quite dead the cause was not far to seek a ton of hard rock had struck him and then ploughed up the sand in a deep furrow and now rested within a yard or two of the animal whose back it had broken hazel went up to the creature and looked at it then he came to helen she was standing aloof poor bugbear said he come away it is an ugly sight for you oh yes said helen then as they returned does not that reconcile you to the loss of a hut we are not blown away nor crushed that is true said hazel but suppose your health should suffer from the exposure to such fearful weather so unlucky so cruel just as you were beginning to get stronger i am all the better for it shall i tell you excitement is a good thing not too often of course but now and then and when we are in the humor for it it is meat and drink and medicine to us what to a delicate young lady ay to a delicate young lady last night has done me a world of good it has shaken me out of myself i am in better health and spirits of course i am very sorry the hut is blown downbecause you took so much trouble to build it but on my own account i really dont care a straw find me some corner to nestle in at night and all day i mean to be about and busy as a bee helping you and breakfast breakfast oh how hungry i am and this spirited girl led the way to the boat with a briskness and a vigor that charmed and astonished him souvent femme vane this gracious behavior did not blind hazel to the serious character of the situation and all breakfasttime he was thinking and thinking and often kept a morsel in his mouth and forgot to eat it for several seconds he was so anxious and puzzled at last he said i know a large hollow tree with apertures if i were to close them all but one and keep that for the door no trees have betrayed me ill never trust another tree with you stay i know i knowa cavern he uttered the verb rather loudly but the substantive with a sudden feebleness of intonation that was amusing his timidity was superfluous if he had said he knew a bank whereon the wild thyme grows the suggestion would have been well received that morning a cavern cried helen it has always been the dream of my life to live in a cavern hazel brightened up but the next moment he clouded again but i forgot it will not do there is a spring running right through it it comes down nearly perpendicular through a channel it has bored or enlarged and splashes on the floor how convenient said helen now i shall have a bath in my room instead of having to go miles for it by the by now you have invented the showerbath please discover soap not that one really wants any in this island for there is no dust and the very air seems purifying but who can shake off the prejudices of early education hazel said now ill laugh as much as you like when once this care is off my mind he ran off to the cavern and found it spacious and safe but the spring was falling in great force and the roof of the cave glistening with moisture it looked a hopeless case but if necessity is the mother of invention surely love is the father he mounted to the rock above and found the spot where the spring suddenly descended into the earth with the loudest gurgle he had ever heard a gurgle of defiance nothing was to be done there but he traced it upward a little way and found a place where it ran beside a deep decline aha my friend said he he got his spade and with some hours hard work dug it a fresh channel and carried it away entirely from its course he returned to the cavern water was dripping very fast but on looking up he could see the light of day twinkling at the top of the spiral water course he had robbed of its supply then he conceived a truly original idea why not turn his empty watercourse into a chimney and so give to one element what he had taken from another he had no time to execute this just then for the tide was coming in and he could not afford to lose any one of those dead animals so he left the funnel to drip that being a process he had no means of expediting and moored the sealion to the very rock that had killed him and was proceeding to dig out the seals when a voice he never could hear without a thrill summoned him to dinner it was a plentiful repast and included roast pintado and cabbagepalm helen rolleston informed him during dinner that he would no longer be allowed to monopolize the labor attendant upon their condition no said she you are always working for me and i shall work for you cooking and washing are a womans work not a mans and so are plaiting and netting this healthy resolution once formed was adhered to with a constancy that belonged to the girls character the roof of the ruined hut came ashore in the bay that evening and was fastened over the boat hazel lighted a bonfire in the cavern and had the satisfaction of seeing some of the smoke issue above but he would not let miss rolleston occupy it yet he shifted her things to the boat and slept in the cave himself however he lost no time in laying down a great hearth and built a fireplace and chimney in the cave the chimney went up to the hole in the arch of the cave then came the stone funnel stolen from nature and above on the upper surface of the cliff came the chimneypot thus the chimney acted like a german stove it stood in the center and soon made the cavern very dry and warm and a fine retreat during the rains when it was ready for occupation helen said she would sail to it she would not go by land that was too tame for her hazel had only to comply with her humor and at high water they got into the boat and went down the river into the sea with a rush that made helen wince he soon rowed her across the bay to a point distant not more than fifty yards from the cavern and installed her but he never returned to the river it was an inconvenient place to make excursions from and besides all his work was now either in or about the cavern and that convenient hurricane as helen called it not only made him a builder again it also made him a currier a soapboiler and a salter so they drew the boat just above highwater mark in a sheltered nook and he set up his arsenal ashore in this situation day glided by after day and week after week in vigorous occupations brightened by social intercourse and in some degree by the beauty and the friendship of the animals of all this industry we can only afford a brief summary hazel fixed two uprights at each side of the caverns mouth and connected each pair by a beam a netting laid on these and covered with gigantic leaves from the prostrate palms made a sufficient roof in this sheltered spot on this terrace they could sit even in the rain and view the sea helen cooked in the cave but served dinner up on this beautiful terrace so now she had a but and a ben as the scotch say he got a hogshead of oil from the sealion and so the cave was always lighted now and that was a great comfort and gave them more hours of indoor employment and conversation the poor bugbear really brightened their existence of the same oil boiled down and mixed with woodashes he made soap to helens great delight the hide of this animal was so thick he could do nothing with it but cut off pieces to make the soles of shoes if required but the seals were miscellaneous treasures he contrived with guano and aromatics to curry their skins of their bladders he made vile parchment and of their entrails gut catgut and twine beyond compare he salted two cubs and laid up the rest in store by inclosing large pieces in clay when these were to be used the clay was just put into hot embers for some hours then broken and the meat eaten with all its juices preserved helen cooked and washed and manufactured salt and collected quite a store of wild cotton though it grew very sparingly and it cost her hours to find a few pods but in hunting for it she found other thingshealth for one after sunset she was generally employed a couple of hours on matters which occupy the fair in every situation of life she made herself a sealskin jacket and porkpie hat she made mr hazel a mans cap of sealskin with a point but her great work was with the cotton which will be described hereafter however for two hours after sunset no more they rose at peep of day her physician allowed her to sit and work which she did and often smiled while he sat by and discoursed to her of all the things he had read and surprised himself by the strength and activity of his memory he attributed it partly to the air of the island nor were his fingers idle even at night he had tools to sharpen for the morrow glass to make and polish out of a laminated crystal he had found and then the hurricane had blown away among many properties his map so he had to make another with similar materials he completed the map in due course and gave it to helen it was open to the same strictures she had passed on the other hazel was no chartographer yet this time she had nothing but praise for it how was that to the reader it is now presented not as a specimen of chartographic art but as a little curiosity in its way being a facsimile of the map john hazel drew for helen rolleston with such outoftheway materials as that outoftheway island afforded above all it will enable the reader to follow our personages in their little excursions past and future and also to trace the course of a mysterious event we have to record relieved of other immediate cares hazels mind had time to dwell upon the problem helen had set him and one fine day a conviction struck him that he had taken a narrow and puerile view of it and that after all there must be in the nature of things some way to attract ships from a distance possessed with this thought he went up to telegraph point abstracted his mind from all external objects and fixed it on this ideabut came down as he went he descended by some steps he had cut zigzag for helens use and as he put his foot on the fifth stepwhoowhirrwhizcame nine ducks cooling his head they whizzed so close and made right for the lagoons hum thought hazel i never see you ducks fly in any other direction but that this speculation rankled in him all night and he told helen he should reconnoiter at daybreak but should not take her as there might be snakes he made the boat ready at daybreak and certain gannets pintadoes boobies and noddies and divers with eyes in their heads like fiery jewelsbirds whose greedy maws he had often gratifiedchose to fancy he must be going afishing and were on the alert and rather troublesome however he got adrift and ran out through north gate with a light westerly breeze followed by a whole fleet of birds these were joined in due course by another of his satellites a young seal he called tommy also fond of fishing the feathered convoy soon tailed off but tommy stuck to him for about eight miles he ran that distance to have a nearer look at a small island which lay due north of telegraph point he satisfied himself it was little more than a very long large reef the neighborhood of which ought to be avoided by ships of burden and resolving to set some beacon or other on it ere long he christened it white water island on account of the surf he came about and headed for the east bluff then tommy gave him up in disgust perhaps thought his conduct vacillating animals all despise that he soon landed almost under the volcano and moored his boat not far from a cliff peaked with guano exercising due caution this time he got up to the lagoons and found a great many ducks swimming about he approached little parties to examine their varieties they all swam out his way some of them even flew a few yards and then settled not one would let him come within forty yards this convinced hazel the ducks were not natives of the island but strangers who were not much afraid because they had never been molested on this particular island but still distrusted man while he pondered thus there was a great noise of wings and about a dozen ducks flew over his head on the rise and passed westward still rising till they got into the high currents and away upon the wings of the wind for distant lands the grand rush of their wings and the offhand way in which they spurned abandoned and disappeared from an island that held him tight made hazel feel very small his thoughts took the form of satire lords of the creation are we we sink in water in air we tumble on earth we stumble these pleasing reflections did not prevent his taking their exact line of flight and barking a tree to mark it he was about to leave the place when he heard a splashing not far from him and there was a duck jumping about on the water in a strange way hazel thought a snake had got hold of her and ran to her assistance he took her out of the water and soon found what was the matter her bill was open and a fishs tail was sticking out hazel inserted his finger and dragged out a small fish which had erected the spines on its back so opportunely as nearly to kill its destroyer the duck recovered enough to quack in a feeble and dubious manner hazel kept her for helen because she was a plain brown duck with some little reluctance he slightly shortened one wing and stowed away his captive in the hold of the boat he happened to have a great stock of pitch in the boat so he employed a few hours in writing upon the guano rocks on one he wrote in huge letters an english lady wrecked here haste to her rescue on another he wrote in small letters beware the reefs on the north side lie off for signals then he came home and beached the boat and brought helen his captive why it is an english duck she cried and was enraptured by this visit to the lagoons hazel gathered that this island was a halfway house for migrating birds especially ducks and he inferred that the line those vagrants had taken was the shortest way from this island to the nearest land this was worth knowing and set his brain working he begged helen to watch for the return of the turtledoves they had all left the island just before the rain and learn if possible from what point of the compass they arrived the next expedition was undertaken to please helen she wished to examine the beautiful creeks and caves on the north side which they had seen from a distance when they sailed round the island they started on foot one delightful day and walked briskly for the air though balmy was exhilarating they followed the course of the river till they came to the lake that fed it and was fed itself by hundreds of little natural gutters down which the hills discharged the rains this was new to helen though not to hazel she produced the map and told the lake slyly that it was incorrect a little too big she took some of the water in her hand sprinkled the lake with it and called it hazelmere they bore a little to the right and proceeded till they found a creek shaped like a wedge at whose broad end shone an arch of foliage studded with flowers and the sparkling blue water peeped behind this was tempting but the descent was rather hazardous at first great square blocks of rock one below another and these rude steps were coated with mosses of rich hue but wet and slippery hazel began to be alarmed for his companion however after one or two difficulties the fissure opened wider to the sun and they descended from the slimy rocks into a sloping hotbed of exotic flowers and those huge succulent leaves that are the glory of the tropics the ground was carpeted a yard deep with their luxuriance and others more aspiring climbed the warm sides of the diverging cliffs just as creepers go up a wall lining every crevice as they rose in this blessed spot warmed but not scorched by the tropical sun and fed with trickling waters was seen what marvels boon nature can do here our vegetable dwarfs were giants and our flowers were trees one lovely giantess of the jasmine tribe but with flowers shaped like a marigold and scented like a tuberose had a stem as thick as a poplar and carried its thousand buds and ambercolored flowers up eighty feet of broken rock and planted on every ledge suckers that flowered again and filled the air with perfume another tree about half as high was covered with a cascade of snowwhite tulips each as big as a small flowerpot and scented like honeysuckle an aloe ten feet high blossomed in a corner unheeded among loftier beauties and at the very mouth of the fissure a huge banana leaned across and flung out its vast leaves that seemed translucent gold against the sun under it shone a monstrous cactus in all her pink and crimson glory and through the maze of color streamed the deep blue of the peaceful ocean laughing and catching sunbeams helen leaned against the cliff and quivered with delight and that deep sense of flowers that belongs to your true woman hazel feared she was ill ill said she who could be ill here it is heaven upon earth oh you dears oh you loves and they all seemed growing on the sea and floating in the sun and it is only one of a dozen such said hazel if you would like to inspect them at your leisure ill just run to palmtree point for my signal is all askew i saw that as we came along helen assented readily and he ran off but left her the provisions she was not to wait dinner for him helen examined two or three of the flowery fissures and found fresh beauties in each and also some english leaves that gave her pleasure of another kind and after she had reveled in the flowers she examined the shore and soon discovered that the rocks which abounded here though there were also large patches of clear sand were nearly all pure coral in great variety red coral was abundant and even the pink coral to which fashion was just then giving a fictitious value was there by the ton this interested her and so did some beautiful shells that lay sparkling the time passed swiftly and she was still busy in her researches when suddenly it darkened a little and looking back she saw a white vapor stealing over the cliff and curling down upon this she thought it prudent to return to the place where hazel had left her the more so as it was near sunset the vapor descended and spread and covered sea and land then the sun set and it was darkness visible coming from the south the seafret caught hazel sooner and in a less favorable situation returning from the palmtree he had taken the shortest cut through a small jungle and been so impeded by the scrub that when he got clear the fog was upon him between that and the river he lost his way several times and did not hit the river till near midnight he followed the river to the lake and coasted the lake and then groped his way toward the creek but after a while every step he took was fraught with danger and the night was far advanced when he at last hit off the creek as he thought he halloed but there was no reply halloed again and to his joy her voice replied but at a distance he had come to the wrong creek she was farther westward he groped his way westward and came to another creek he haloed to her and she answered him but to attempt the descent would have been mere suicide she felt that herself and almost ordered him to stay where he was why we can talk all the same said she and it is not for long it was a curious position and one typical of the relation between them so near together yet the barrier so strong i am afraid you must be very cold said he oh no i have my sealskin jacket on and it is so sheltered here i wish you were as well off you are not afraid to be alone down there i am not alone when your voice is near me now dont you fidget yourself dear friend i like these little excitements i have told you so before listen how calm and silent it all is the place the night the mind seems to fill with great ideas and to feel its immortality she spoke with solemnity and he heard in silence indeed it was a reverend time and place the sea whose loud and penetrating tongue had in some former age created the gully where they both sat apart had of late years receded and kissed the sands gently that calm night so gently that its long low murmur seemed but the echo of tranquillity the voices of that pair sounded supernatural one speaking up and the other down the speakers quite invisible mr hazel said helen in a low earnest voice they say that night gives wisdom even to the wise think now and tell me your true thoughts has the foot of man ever trod upon this island before there was a silence due to a question so grave and put with solemnity at a solemn time in a solemn place at last hazels thoughtful voice came down the world is very very very old so old that the words ancient history are a falsehood and moses wrote but as yesterday and man is a very old animal upon this old old planet and has been everywhere i cannot doubt he has been here her voice went up but have you seen any signs his voice came down i have not looked for them the bones and the weapons of primeval man are all below earths surface at this time of day there was a dead silence then helens voice went up again but in modern times has no man landed here from faroff places since ships were built the voice came sadly down i do not know the voice went up but think the voice came down what calamity can be new in a world so old as this everything we can do and suffer others of our race have done and suffered the voice went up hush theres something moving on the sand chapter xxxv hazel waited and listened so did helen and her breath came fast for in the stilly night she heard light but mysterious sounds something was moving on the sand very slowly and softly but nearer and nearer her heart began to leap she put out her hand instinctively to clutch mr hazel but he was too far off she had the presence of mind and the selfdenial to disguise her fears for she knew he would come headlong to her assistance she said in a quavering whisper im not frightened only vvery ccurious and now she became conscious that not only one but several things were creeping about presently the creeping ceased and was followed by a louder and more mysterious noise in that silent night it sounded like raking and digging three or four mysterious visitants seemed to be making graves this was too much especially coming as it did after talk about the primeval dead her desire to scream was so strong and she was so afraid hazel would break his neck if she relieved her mind in that way that she actually took her handkerchief and bit it hard but this situation was cut short by a beneficent luminary the sun rose with a magnificent boundit was his way in that latitudeand everything unpleasant winced that moment the fog shivered in its turn and appeared to open in furrows as great javelins of golden light shot through it from the swiftly rising orb soon those golden darts increased to streams of portable fire that burst the fog and illumined the wet sands and helen burst out laughing like chanticleer for this first break of day revealed the sextons that had scared herthree ponderous turtles crawling slow and clumsy back to sea hazel joined her and they soon found what these evil spirits of the island had been at poor wretches they had each buried a dozen eggs in the sand one dozen of which were very soon set boiling at first indeed helen objected that they had no shells but hazel told her she might as well complain of a rose without a thorn he assured her turtles eggs were a known delicacy and very superior to birds eggs and so she found them they were eaten with the keenest relish and now said helen for my discoveries first here are my english leaves only bigger i found them on a large tree english leaves cried hazel with rapture why it is the caoutchouc oh dear said helen in a disappointed tone i took it for the indiarubber free it is the indiarubber tree and i have been hunting for it all over the island in vain and using wretchedly inferior gums for want of it im so glad said helen and now i have something else to show you something that curdled my blood but i dare say i was very foolish she then took him half across the sand and pointed out to him a number of stones dotted over the sand in a sort of oval these stones streaked with sea grass and incrusted with small shells were not at equal distances but yet allowing for gaps they formed a decided figure their outline resembled a great fish wanting the tail can this be chance asked helen oh if it should be what i fear and that issavages hazel considered it attentively a long time too far at sea for living savages said he and yet it cannot be chance what on earth is it it looks druidical but how can that be the island was smaller when these were placed here than it is now he went nearer and examined one of the stones then he scraped away the sand from its base and found it was not shaped like a stone but more like a whales rib he became excited went on his knees and tore the sand up with his hands then he rose up agitated and traced the outline again great heaven said he why it is a ship a ship ay said he standing in the middle of it here beneath our feet lies man with his work and his treasures this carcass has been here for many a long year not so very long either she is too big for the sixteenth century and yet she must have been sunk when the island was smaller i take it to be a spanish or portuguese ship probably one of those treasureships our commodores and chartered pirates and the american buccaneers used to chase about these seas here lie her bones and the bones of her crew your question was soon answered all that we can say has been said can do has been done can suffer has been suffered they were silent and the sunk ships bones moved them strangely in their deep isolation from the human race even the presence of the dead brought humanity somehow nearer to them they walked thoughtfully away and made across the sands for telegraph point before they got home helen suggested that perhaps if he were to dig in the ship he might find something useful he shook his head impossible the iron has all melted away like sugar long before this nothing can have survived but gold and silver and they are not worth picking up much less digging for my time is too precious no you have found two buried treasures todayturtles eggs and a ship freighted as i think with what men call the precious metals well the eggs are gold and the gold is a drugthere it will lie for me both discoveries bore fruits the ship hazel made a vow that never again should any poor ship lay her ribs on this island for want of warning he buoyed the reefs he ran out to white water island and wrote an earnest warning on the black reef and this time he wrote with white on black he wrote a similar warning with black on white at the western extremity of godsend island the eggs hazel watched for the turtles at daybreak turned one now and then and fed helen on the meat or its eggs morn noon and night for some time she had been advancing in health and strength but when the rains declined considerably and she was all day in the air she got the full benefit of the wonderful climate and her health appetite and muscular vigor became truly astonishing especially under what hazel called the turtle cure though indeed she was cured before she ate three good meals a day and needed them for she was up with the sun and her hands and feet never idle till he set four months on the island had done this but four months had not shown those straining eyes the white speck on the horizon the sail so looked and longed for hazel often walked the island by himself not to explore for he knew the place well by this time but he went his rounds to see that all his signals were in working order he went to mount lookout one day with this view it was about an hour before noon long before he got to the mountain he had scanned the horizon carefully as a matter of course but not a speck so when he got there he did not look seaward but just saw that his flagstaff was all right and was about to turn away and go home when he happened to glance at the water and there underneath him he sawa ship standing toward the island chapter xxxvi he started and rubbed his eyes and looked again it was no delusion things never did come as they are expected to come there was still no doubtful speck on the horizon but within eight miles of the islandand in this lovely air that looked nearly closewas a ship under canvas she bore s e from mount lookout and s s e from the east bluff of the island toward which her course was apparenty directed she had a fair wind but was not going fast being heavily laden and under no press of sail a keen thrill went through him and his mind was a whirl he ran home with the great news but even as he ran a cold sickly feeling crawled over him that ship parts her and me he resisted the feeling as a thing too monstrous and selfish and resisted it so fiercely that when he got to the slopes and saw helen busy at her work he waved his hat and hurrahed again and again and seemed almost mad with triumph helen stood transfixed she had never seen him in such a state good news he cried great news a ship in sight you are rescued her heart leaped into her mouth a ship she screamed where where he came up to her panting close under the island hid by the bluff but you will see her in half an hour god be praised get everything ready to go hurrah this is our last day on the island the words were brave and loud and boisterous but the face was pale and drawn and helen saw it and though she bustled and got ready to leave the tears were in her eyes but the event was too great to be resisted a wild excitement grew on them both they ran about like persons crazed and took things up and laid them down again scarcely knowing what they were doing but presently they were sobered a little for the ship did not appear they ran across the sands where they could see the bluff she ought to have passed that half an hour ago hazel thought she must have anchored helen looked at him steadily dear friend said she are you sure there is a ship at all are you not under a delusion this island fills the mind with fancies one day i thought i saw a ship sailing in the sky ah she uttered a faint scream for while she was speaking the bowsprit and jib of a vessel glided past the bluff so closely they seemed to scrape it and a ship emerged grandly and glided along the cliff are they mad cried hazel to hug the shore like that ah they have seen my warning and it appeared so for the ship just then came up in the wind several points and left the bluff dead astern she sailed a little way on that course and then paid off again and seemed inclined to range along the coast but presently she was up in the wind again and made a greater offing she was sailed in a strange vacillating way but hazel ascribed this to her peoples fear of the reefs he had indicated to all comers the better to watch her maneuvers and signal her if necessary they both went up to telegraph point they could not go out to her being low water seen from this height the working of this vessel was unaccountable she was to and off the wind as often as if she was drunk herself or commanded by a drunken skipper however she was kept well clear of the home reefs and made a good offing and so at last she opened the bay heading n w and distant four miles or thereabouts now was the time to drop her anchor so hazel worked the telegraph to draw her attention and waved his hat and hand to her but the ship sailed on she yawed immensely but she kept her course and when she had gone a mile or two more the sickening truth forced itself at last upon those eager watchers she had decided not to touch at the island in vain their joyful signals in vain the telegraph in vain that cry for help upon the eastern cliff it had saved her but not pleaded for them the monsters saw them on the heighttheir hope their joysaw and abandoned them they looked at one another with dilating eyes to read in a human face whether such a deed as this could really be done by man upon his fellow they uttered wild cries to the receding vessel vain vain all was in vain then they sat down stupefied but still glaring at the ship and each at the same moment held out a hand to the other and they sat hand in hand all the world to each other just then for there was the world in sight abandoning them in cold blood be calm dear friend said helen patiently oh my poor father and her other hand threw her apron over her head and then came a burst of anguish that no words could utter at this hazel started to his feet in fury now may the god that made sea and land judge between those miscreants there and you be patient said helen sobbing oh be patient no i will not be patient roared hazel judge thou her cause oh god each of these tears against a reptiles soul and so he stood glaring and his hair blowing wildly to the breeze while she sighed patiently at his knee presently he began to watch the vessel with a grim and bitter eye anon he burst out suddenly aha that is right well steered dont cry sweet one our cause is heard are they blind are they drunk are they sick i see nobody on deck perhaps i have been too god forgive me the ships ashore chapter xxxvii helen looked up and there was the ship fast and on her side she was on the white water reef not upon the black rocks themselves but on a part of them that was under water hazel ran down to the beach and there helen found him greatly agitated all his anger was gone he had but one thought nowto go out to her assistance but it still wanted an hour to high water and it was blowing smartly and there was nearly always a surf upon that reef what if the vessel should break up and lives be lost he paced the sands like a wild beast in its cage in an agony of pity remorse and burning impatience his feelings became intolerable he set his back to the boat and with herculean strength forced it down a little way to meet the tide he got logs and put them down for rollers he strove he strained he struggled till his face and hands were purple and at last he met the flowing tide and in a moment jumped into the boat and pushed off helen begged with sparkling eyes to be allowed to accompany him what to a ship smitten with scurvy or heaven knows what certainly not besides you would be wet through it is blowing rather fresh and i shall carry on pray for the poor souls i go to help and for me who have sinned in my anger he hoisted his sail and ran out helen stood on the bank and watched him with tender admiration how good and brave he was and he could go into a passion too when she was wronged or when he thought she was well she admired him none the less for that she watched him at first with admiration but soon with anxiety for he had no sooner passed north gate than the cutter having both sails set though reefed lay down very much and her hull kept disappearing helen felt anxious and would have been downright frightened but for her confidence in his prowess by and by only her staggering sails were visible and the sun set ere she reached the creek the wind declined with the sun and helen made two great fires and prepared food for the sufferers for she made sure hazel would bring them off in a few hours more she promised herself the happiness of relieving the distressed but to her infinite surprise she found herself almost regretting that the island was likely to be peopled with strangers no matter she should sit up for them all night and be very kind to them poor things though they had not been very kind to her about midnight the wind shifted to the northwest and blew hard helen ran down to the shore and looked seaward this was a fair wind for hazels return and she began to expect him every hour but no he delayed unaccountably and the worst of it was it began to blow a gale and this wind sent the sea rolling into the bay in a manner that alarmed her seriously the night wore on no signs of the boat and now there was a heavy gale outside and a great sea rolling in brown and foaming day broke and showed the sea for a mile or two the rest was hidden by driving rain helen kneeled on the shore and prayed for him dire misgivings oppressed her and soon these were heightened to terror for the sea began to disgorge things of a kind that had never come ashore before a great ships mast came tossing huge as it was the waves handled it like a toy then came a barrel then a broken spar these were but the forerunners of more fearful havoc the sea became strewed and literally blackened with fragments part wreck part cargo of a broken vessel but what was all this compared with the horror that followed a black object caught her eye driven in upon the crest of a wave she looked with her hair flying straight back and her eyes almost starting from her head it was a boat bottom up driven on and tossed like a cork it came nearer nearer nearer she dashed into the water with a wild scream but a wave beat her backward on the sand and as she rose an enormous roller lifted the boat upright into the air and breaking dashed it keel downwards on the beach at her sideempty chapter xxxviii helen uttered a shriek of agony and her knees smote together and she would have swooned on the spot but for the wind and the spray that beat against her to the fearful stun succeeded the wildest distress she ran to and fro like some wild animal bereaved she kept wringing her hands and uttering cries of pity and despair and went back to the boat a hundred times it held her by a spell it was long before she could think connectedly and even then it was not of herself nor of her lonely state but only why did not she die with him why did she not die instead of him he had been all the world to her and now she knew it oh what a friend what a champion what a lover these cruel waves had destroyed the morning broke and still she hovered and hovered about the fatal boat with great horrorstricken eyes and hair flying to the breeze and not a tear if she could only have smoothed his last moments have spoken one word into his dying ear but no her poor hero had died in going to save others died thinking her as cold as the waters that had destroyed him dead or alive he was all the world to her now she went wailing piteously and imploring the waves to give her at least his dead body to speak to and mourn over but the sea denied her even that dismal consolation the next tide brought in a few more fragments of the wreck but no corpse floated ashore then at last as the waves once more retired leaving this time only petty fragments of wreck on the beach she lifted up her voice and almost wept her heart out of her body such tears as these are seldom without effect on the mind and helen now began to rebel though faintly against despair she had been quite crushed at first under the material evidencethe boat driven empty by the very wind and waves that had done the cruel deed but the heart is averse to believe calamity and especially bereavement and very ingenious in arguing against that bitterest of all woes so she now sat down and brooded and her mind fastened with pathetic ingenuity on every circumstance that could bear a favorable construction the mast had not been broken how then had it been lost the body had not come ashore he had had time to get to the wreck before the gale from the north came on at all and why should a fair wind though powerful upset the boat on these slender things she began to build a superstructure of hope but soon her heart interrupted the reasoning what would he do in my place would he sit guessing while hope had a hair to hang by that thought struck her like a spur and in a moment she bounded into action erect her lips fixed and her eye on fire though her cheek was very pale she went swiftly to hazels store and searched it there she found the jibsail a boathook some rope and one little oar that hazel was making for her and had not quite completed the sight of this his last work overpowered her again and she sat down and took it on her knees and kissed it and cried over it and these tears weakened her for a time she felt it and had the resolution to leave the oar behind a single oar was of no use to row with she rigged the boathook as a mast and fastened the sail to it and with this poor equipment she actually resolved to put out to sea the wind still blew smartly and there was no blue sky visible and now she remembered she had eaten nothing that would not do her strength might fail her she made ready a meal and ate it almost fiercely and by a pure effort of resolution as she was doing all the rest by this time it was nearly high tide she watched the water creeping up will it float the boat it rises over the keel two inches three inches five inches water now she pushes with all her strength no the boat has water in it she had forgotten to bale out she strained every nerve but could not move it she stopped to take breath and husband her strength but when she renewed her efforts the five inches were four and she had the misery of seeing the water crawl away by degrees and leave the boat high and dry she sighed heartbroken awhile then went home and prayed when she had prayed a long time for strength and wisdom she lay down for an hour and tried to sleep but failed then she prepared for a more serious struggle with the many difficulties she had to encounter now she thanked god more than ever for the health and rare strength she had acquired in this island without them she could have done nothing now she got a clay platter and baled the vessel nearly dry she left a little water for ballast she fortified herself with food and put provisions and water on board the boat in imitation of hazel she went and got two round logs and as soon as the tide crawled up to four inches she lifted the bow a little and got a roller under then she went to the boats stern set her teeth and pushed with a rush of excitement that gave her almost a mans strength the stubborn boat seemed elastic and all but moved then instinct taught her where her true strength lay she got to the stern of the boat and setting the small of her back under the projecting gunwale she gathered herself together and gave a superb heave that moved the boat a foot she followed it up and heaved again with like effect then with a cry of joy she ran and put down another roller forward the boat was now on two rollers one more magnificent heave with all her zeal and strength and youth and the boat glided forward she turned and rushed at it as it went and the water deepening and a gust catching the sail it went out to sea and she had only just time to throw herself across the gunwale panting she was afloat the wind was sw and before she knew where she was the boat headed toward the home reefs and slipped through the water pretty fast considering how small a sail she carried she ran to the helm alas the rudder was broken off above the waterline the helm was a mockery and the boat running for the reefs she slacked the sheet and the boat lost her way and began to drift with the tide which luckily had not yet turned it carried her inshore helen cast her eyes around her for an expedient and she unshipped one of the transoms and by trailing it over the side and alternately slacking and hauling the sheet she contrived to make the boat crawl like a winged bird through the western passage after that it soon got becalmed under the cliff and drifted into two feet water instantly she tied a rope to the mast got out into the water and took the rope ashore she tied it round a heavy barrel she found there and set the barrel up and heaped stones round it and on it which unfortunately was a long job though she worked with feverish haste then she went round the point sometimes wet and sometimes dry for the little oar she had left behind because it broke her heart to look at away with such weakness now with that oar his last work she might steer if she could not row she got it she came back to the boat to recommence her voyage she found the boat all safe but in six inches of water and the tide going out so ended her voyage four hundred yards at most and then to wait another twelve hours for the tide it was too cruel and every hour so precious for even if hazel was alive he would die of cold and hunger ere she could get to him she cried like any woman she persisted like a man she made several trips and put away things in the boat that could possibly be of useabundant provision and a keg of water hazels wooden spade to paddle or steer with his basket of tools etc then she snatched some sleep but it was broken by sad and terrible dreams then she waited in an agony of impatience for high water we are not always the best judges of what is good for us probably these delays saved her own life she went out at last under far more favorable circumstancesa light westerly breeze and no reefs to pass through she was however severely incommoded with a groundswell at first she steered with the spade as well as she could but she found this was not sufficient the current ran westerly and she was drifting out of her course then she remembered hazels lessons and made shift to fasten the spade to the helm and then lashed the helm even this did not quite do so she took her little oar kissed it cried over it a little and then pulled manfully with it so as to keep the true course it was a muggy day neither wet nor dry white water island was not in sight from godsend island but as soon as she lost the latter the former became visiblean ugly grinning reef with an eternal surf on the south and western sides often she left off rowing and turned to look at it it was all black and blank except the white and fatal surf when she was about four miles from the nearest part of the reef there was a rush and bubble in the water and a great shark came after the boat helen screamed and turned very cold she dreaded the monster not for what he could do now but for what he might have done he seemed to know the boat he swam so vigilantly behind it was he there when the boat upset with hazel in it was it in his greedy maw the remains of her best friend must be sought her lips opened but no sound she shuddered and hid her face at this awful thought the shark followed steadily she got to the reef but did not hit it off as she intended she ran under its lee lowered the little sail and steered the boat into a nick where the shark could hardly follow her but he moved to and fro like a sentinel while she landed in trepidation and secured the boat to the branches of a white coral rock she found the place much larger than it looked from telegraph point it was an archipelago of coral reef incrusted here and there with shells she could not see all over it where she was so she made for what seemed the highest part a bleak seaweedy mound with some sandy hillocks about it she went up to this and looked eagerly all round not a soul she called as loud as her sinking heart would let her not a sound she felt very sick and sat down upon the mound when she had yielded awhile to the weakness of her sex she got up and was her fathers daughter again she set to work to examine every foot of the reef it was no easy task the rocks were rugged and sharp in places slippery in others often she had to go about and once she fell and hurt her pretty hands and made them bleed she never looked at them nor heeded but got up and sighed at the interruption then patiently persisted it took her two hours to examine thus in detail one half the island but at last she discovered something she saw at the eastern side of the reef a wooden figure of a woman and making her way to it found the figurehead and a piece of the bow of the ship with a sail on it and a yard on that this fragment was wedged into an angle of the reef and the seaward edge of it shattered in a way that struck terror to helen for it showed her how omnipotent the sea had been on the reef itself she found a cask with its head stove in also a little keg and two wooden chests or cases but what was all this to her she sat down again for her knees failed her presently there was a sort of moan near her and a seal splashed into the water and dived out of her sight she put her hands on her heart and bowed her head down utterly desolate she sat thus for a long time indeed until she was interrupted by a most unexpected visitor something came sniffing up to her and put a cold nose to her hand she started violently and both her hands were in the air in a moment it was a dog a pointer he whimpered and tried to gambol but could not manage it he was too weak however he contrived to let her see with the wagging of his tail and a certain contemporaneous twist of his emaciated body that she was welcome but having performed this ceremony he trotted feebly away leaving her very much startled and not knowing what to think indeed this incident set her trembling all over a dog saved from the wreck then why not a man and why not that life oh thought she would god save that creature and not pity my poor angel and me she got up animated with hope and recommenced her researches she now kept at the outward edge of the island and so went all round till she reached her boat again the shark was swimming to and fro waiting for her with horrible pertinacity she tried to eat a mouthful but though she was faint she could not eat she drank a mouthful of water and then went to search the very small portion that remained of the reef and to take the poor dog home with her because he she had lost was so good to animals only his example is left me she said and with that came another burst of sorrow but she got up and did the rest of her work crying as she went after some severe traveling she got near the northeast limit and in a sort of gully she saw the dog quietly seated high on his tail she called him but he never moved so then she went to him and when she got near him she saw why he would not come he was watching close by him lay the form of a man nearly covered with seaweed the feet were visible and so was the face the latter deadly pale it was he in a moment she was by him and leaning over him with both hands quivering was he dead no his eyes were closed he was fast asleep her hands flew to his face to feel him alive and then grasped both his hands and drew them up toward her panting bosom and the tears of joy streamed from her eyes as she sobbed and murmured over him she knew not what at that he awoke and stared at her he uttered a loud ejaculation of joy and wonder then taking it all in burst into tears himself and fell to kissing her hands and blessing her the poor soul had almost given himself up for lost and to be saved all in a moment and by her they could neither of them speak but only mingled tears of joy and gratitude hazel recovered himself first and rising somewhat stiffly lent her his arm her fathers spirit went out of her in the moment of victory and she was all womansweet loving clinging woman she got hold of his hand as well as his arm and clutched it so tight her little grasp seemed velvet and steel let me feel you said she but no words no words he supported his preserver tenderly to the boat then hoisting the sail he fetched the east side in two tacks shipped the sail and yard and also the cask keg and boxes he then put a great quantity of loose oysters on board each as large as a plate she looked at him with amazement what said she when he had quite loaded the boat only just out of the jaws of death and yet you can trouble your head about oysters and things wait till you see what i shall do with them said he these are pearl oysters i gathered them for you when i had little hope i should ever see you again to give them you this was an unlucky speech the act that seemed so small and natural a thing to him the womans heart measured more correctly something rose in her throat she tried to laugh instead of crying and so she did both and went into a violent fit of hysterics that showed how thoroughly her nature had been stirred to its depths she quite frightened hazel and indeed the strength of an excited womans weakness is sometimes alarming to manly natures he did all he could to soothe her without much success as soon as she was better he set sail thinking home was the best place for her she leaned back exhausted and after a while seemed to be asleep we dont believe she was but hazel did and sat cold and aching in body but warm at heart worshiping her with all his eyes at last they got ashore and he sat by her fire and told her all while she cooked his supper and warmed clothes at the fire for him the ship said he was a dutch vessel bound from batavia to callao that had probably gone on her beam ends for she was full of water her crew had abandoned her i think they underrated the buoyancy of the ship and cargo they left the poor dog on board her helm was lashed aweather a couple of turns but why that was done i cannot tell for the life of me i boarded her unshipped my mast and moored the boat to the ship fed the poor dog rummaged in the hold and contrived to hoist up a small cask of salted beef and a keg of rum and some cases of grain and seeds i managed to slide these on to the reef by means of the mast and oar lashed together but a roller ground the wreck farther on to the reef and the sudden snap broke the rope as i suppose and the boat went to sea i never knew the misfortune till i saw her adrift i could have got over that by making a raft but the gale from the north brought such a sea on us i saw she must break up so i got ashore how i could ah i little thought to see your face again still less that i should owe my life to you spare me said helen faintly what must not i thank you even for my life no the account is far from even yet you are no arithmetician to say so what astonishes me most is that you have never once scolded me for all the trouble and anxiety i am too happy to see you sitting there to scold you but still i do ask you to leave the sea alone after this the treacherous monster oh think what you and i have suffered on it she seemed quite worn out he saw that and retired for the night casting one more wistful glance on her but at that moment she was afraid to look at him her heart was welling over with tenderness for the dear friend whose life she had saved next morning hazel rose at daybreak as usual but found himself stiff in the joints and with a pain in his back the mat that hung at the opening of helens cave was not removed as usual she was on her bed with a violent headache hazel fed ponto and corrected him he was at present a civilized dog so he made a weak rush at the boobies and noddies directly he also smelled tommy inquisitively to learn was he an eatable tommy somehow divined the end of this sinister curiosity and showed his teeth then hazel got a rope and tied one end round his own waist and one round pontos neck and at every outbreak of civilization jerked him sharply on to his back the effect of this discipline was rapid ponto soon found that he must not make war on the inhabitants of the island he was a docile animal and in a very short time consented to make one of the happy family as hazel called the miscellaneous crew that beset him helen and hazel did not meet till past noon and when they did meet it was plain she had been thinking a great deal for her greeting was so shy and restrained as to appear cold and distant to hazel he thought to himself i was too happy yesterday and she too kind of course it could not last this change in her seemed to grow rather than diminish she carried it so far as to go and almost hide during the working hours she made off to the jungle and spent an unreasonable time there she professed to be collecting cotton and it must be admitted she brought a good deal home with her but hazel could not accept cotton as the only motive for this sudden separation he lost the light of her face till the evening then matters took another turn she was too polite ceremony and courtesy appeared to be gradually encroaching upon tender friendship and familiarity yet now and then her soft hazel eyes seemed to turn on him in silence and say forgive me all this then at those sweet looks love and forgiveness poured out of his eyes and then hers sought the ground and this was generally followed by a certain mixture of stiffness timidity and formality too subtle to describe the muchenduring man began to lose patience this is caprice said he cruel caprice our female readers will probably take a deeper view of it than that whatever it was another change was at hand since he was so exposed to the weather on the reef hazel had never been free from pain but he had done his best to work it off he had collected all the valuables from the wreck made a new mast set up a rude capstan to draw the boat ashore and cut a little dock for her at low water and clayed it in the full heat of the sun and having accomplished this drudgery he got at last to his labor of love he opened a quantity of pearl oysters fed tommy and the duck with them and began the great work of lining the cavern with them the said cavern was somewhat shellshaped and his idea was to make it out of a gloomy cavern into a vast shell lined entirely roof and sides with glorious sweet prismatic motherofpearl fresh from ocean well one morning while helen was in the jungle he made a cement of guano sand clay and water nipped some shells to a shape with the pincers and cemented them neatly like mosaic almost but in the middle of his work he was cut down by the disorder he had combated so stoutly he fairly gave in and sat down groaning with pain and in this state helen found him oh what is the matter said she he told her the truth and said he had violent pains in the back and head she did not say much but she turned pale she bustled and lighted a great fire and made him lie down by it she propped his head up she set water on to boil for him and would not let him move for anything and all the time her features were brimful of the loveliest concern he could not help thinking how much better it was to be ill and in pain and have her so kind than to be well and see her cold and distant toward evening he got better or rather he mistook an intermission for cure and retired to his boat but she made him take her rug with him and when he was gone she could not sleep for anxiety and it cut her to the heart to think how poorly he was lodged compared with her of all the changes fate could bring this she had never dreamed of that she should be so robust and he should be sick and in pain she passed an uneasy restless night and long before morning she awoke for the sixth or seventh time and she awoke with a misgiving in her mind and some sound ringing in her ears she listened and heard nothing but in a few moments it began again it was hazel talkingtalking in a manner so fast so strange so loud that it made her blood run cold it was the voice of hazel but not his mind she drew near and to her dismay found him feverstricken and pouring out words with little sequence she came close to him and tried to soothe him but he answered her quite at random and went on flinging out the strangest things in stranger order she trembled and waited for a lull hoping then to soothe him with soft words and tones of tender pity dens and caves he roared answering an imaginary detractor well never mind love shall make that hole in the rock a palace for a queen for a queen for the queen here he suddenly changed characters and fancied he was interpreting the discourse of another he means the queen of the fairies said he patronizingly then resuming his own character with loud defiance i say her chamber shall outshine the glories of the alhambra as far as the lilies outshone the artificial glories of king solomon oh mighty nature let others rely on the painter the goldbeater the carver of marble come you and help me adorn the temple of my beloved amen the poor soul thought by the sound of his own words it must be a prayer he uttered and now helen with streaming eyes tried to put in a word but he stopped her with a wild hush and went off into a series of mysterious whisperings make no noise please or we shall frighten her therethat is her windowno noise please ive watched and waited four hours just to see her sweet darling shadow on the blinds and shall i lose it for your small talk all paradoxes and platitudes excuse my plain speakinghush here it comesher shadowhushhow my heart beats it is gone so now speaking out goodnight base world do you hear you company of liars thieves and traitors called the world go and sleep if you can i shall sleep because my conscience is clear false accusations who can help them they are the act of others read of job and paul and joan of arc no no no no i didnt say read em out with those stentorian lungs i must be allowed a little sleep a man that wastes the midnight oil yet brushes the early dew goodnight he turned round and slept for several hours as he supposed but in reality he was silent for just three seconds well said he and is a gardener a man to be looked down upon by upstarts when adam delved and eve span where was then the gentleman why where the spade was yet i went through the heralds college and not one of our mushroom aristocracy bloated i object to they dont eat half as much as their footmen had a spade for a crest theres nothing ancient west of the caspian well all the better for theres no fool like an old fool a spades a spade for a that an a that an a thatan a thatan a that hallo stop that man hes gone off on his cork leg of a that an a thatand it is my wish to be quiet allow me respectfully to observe said he striking off suddenly into an air of vast politeness that man requires change ive done a jolly good days work with the spade for this old buffer and now the intellect claims its turn the mind retires above the noisy world to its acropolis and there discusses the great problem of the day the insular enigma to be or not to be that is the question i believe no it is not that is fully discussed elsewhere hum to diffuseintelligencefrom a fixed islandover one hundred leagues of water its a stinger but i cant complain i had read lempriere and smith and bryant and mythology in general yet i must go and fall in love with the sphinx men are so vain vanity whispered she will set you a light one why is a cobbler like a king for instance she is not in love with you ye fool if you are with her the harder the riddle the higher the compliment the sphinx pays you that is the way all sensible men look at it she is not the sphinx she is an angel and i call her my lady caprice hate her for being caprice you incorrigible muddlehead why i love caprice for being her shadow poor impotent love that cant solve a problem the only one she ever set me ive gone about it like a fool what is the use putting up little bits of telegraphs on the island ill make a kite a hundred feet high get five miles of rope ready against the next hurricane and then ill rub it with phosphorus and fly it but what can i fasten it to no tree would hold it dunce to the island itself of course and now go to stantle magg milton and copestake for one thousand yards of silkmoney money money well give them a mortgage on the island and a draft on the galleon now stop the pitchfountain and bore a hole near it fill fifty balloons with gas inscribe them with the latitude and longitude fly them and bring all the world about our ears the problem is solved it is solved and i am destroyed she leaves me she thinks no more of me her heart is in england then he muttered for a long time unintelligibly and helen ventured near and actually laid her hand on his brow to soothe him but suddenly his muttering ceased and he seemed to be puzzling hard over something the result came out in a clear articulate sentence that made helen recoil and holding by the mast cast an indescribable look of wonder and dismay on the speaker the words that so staggered her were these to the letter she says she hates reptiles yet she marries arthur wardlaw chapter xxxix the very name of arthur wardlaw startled helen and made her realize how completely her thoughts had been occupied with another but add to that the strange and bitter epigram or was it a mere fortuitous concourse of words she was startled amazed confounded puzzled and ere she could recover her composure hazel was back to his problem again but no longer with the same energy he said in a faint and sleepy voice he maketh the winds his messengers and flames of fire his ministers ah if i could do that well why not i can do anything she bids me graeculus esuriens coelum jusseris ibit and soon after this doughty declaration he dozed off and forgot all his trouble for a while the sun rose and still he slept and helen watched him with undisguised tenderness in her face undisguised now that he could not see it ere long she had companions in her care ponto came out of his den and sniffed about the boat and then began to scratch it and whimper for his friend tommy swam out of the sea came to the boat discovered heaven knows how that his friend was there and in the way of noises did everything but speak the seabirds followed and fluttered here and there in an erratic way with now and then a peck at each other all animated nature seemed to be uneasy at this eclipse of their hazel at last tommy raised himself quite perpendicular in a vain endeavor to look into the boat and invented a whine in the minor key which tells on dogs it set ponto off in a moment he sat upon his tail and delivered a long and most deplorable howl everything loves him thought helen with pontos music hazel awoke and found her watching him with tears in her eyes he said softly miss rolleston there is nothing the matter i hope why am i not up getting things for your breakfast dear friend said she why you are not doing things for me and forgetting yourself is because you have been very ill and i am your nurse now tell me what i shall get you is there nothing you could fancy no he had no appetite she was not to trouble about him and then he tried to get up but that gave him such a pain in his loins he was fain to lie down again so then he felt that he had got rheumatic fever he told her so but seeing her sweet anxious face begged her not to be alarmedhe knew what to take for it would she be kind enough to go to his arsenal and fetch some specimens of bark she would find there and also the keg of rum she flew at the word and soon made him an infusion of the barks in boiling water to which the rum was added his sweet nurse administered this from time to time the barks used were of the cassia tree and a wild citron tree cinchona did not exist in this island unfortunately perhaps there was no soil for it at a sufficient elevation above the sea nevertheless with these inferior barks they held the fever in check but the pain was obstinate and cost helen many a sigh for if she came softly she could often hear him moan and the moment he heard her foot he set to and whistled for a blind with what success may be imagined she would have bought those pains or a portion of them ay and paid a heavy price for them but pain like everything intermits and in those blessed intervals his mind was more active than ever and ran a great deal upon what he called the problem but she who had set it him gave him little encouragement now to puzzle over it the following may serve as a specimen of their conversation on that head the air of this island said he gives one a sort of vague sense of mental power it leads to no result in my case still it is an agreeable sensation to have it floating across my mind that some day i shall solve the great problem ah if i was only an inventor and so you are no no said hazel disclaiming as earnestly as some people claim i do things that look like acts of invention but they are acts of memory i could show you plates and engravings of all the things i have seemed to invent a man who studies books instead of skimming them can cut a dash in a desert island until the fatal word goes forthinvent and then you find him out i am sure i wish i had never said the fatal word you will never get well if you puzzle your brain over impossibilities impossibilities but is not that begging the question the measure of impossibilities is lost in the present age i propose a test let us go back a century and suppose that three problems were laid before the men of that day and they were asked to decide which is the most impossible st to diffuse intelligence from a fixed island over a hundred leagues of water d to make the sun take in thirty seconds likenesses more exact than any portraitpainter ever tooklikenesses that can be sold for a shilling at fifty per cent profit d for new york and london to exchange words by wire so much faster than the earth can turn that london shall tell new york at ten on monday morning what was the price of consols at two oclock monday afternoon that is a story said helen with a look of angelic reproach i accept that reply said hazel as for me i have got a smattering of so many subjects all full of incredible truths that my faith in the impossibility of anything is gone ah if james watt was only here instead of john hazeljames watt from the abbey with a head as big as a pumpkinhe would not have gone groping about the island writing on rocks and erecting signals no he would have had some grand and bold idea worthy of the proposition well so i think said helen archly that great man with the great head would have begun by making a kite a hundred yards high would he well he was quite capable of it yes and rubbed it with phosphorus and flown it the first tempest and made the string fast tothe island itself well that is an idea said hazel staring rather hyperbolical i fear but after all it is an idea or else continued helen he would weave a thousand yards of some light fabric and make balloons then he would stop the pitchfountain bore a hole in the rock near it and so get the gas fill the balloons inscribe them with our sad story and our latitude and longitude and send them flying all over the oceanthere hazel was amazed i resign my functions to you said he what imagination what invention oh dear no said helen slyly acts of memory sometimes pass for invention you know shall i tell you when first you fell ill you were rather lightheaded and uttered the strangest things they would have made me laugh heartily only i couldntfor crying and you said that about kites and balloons every word did i then i have most brains when i have least reason thats all ay said helen and other strange thingsvery strange and bitter things one i should like to ask you about what on earth you could mean by it but perhaps you meant nothing after all ill soon tell you said hazel but he took the precaution to add provided i know what it means myself she looked at him steadily and was on the point of seeking the explanation so boldly offered but her own courage failed her she colored and hesitated i shall wait said she till you are quite quite well that will be soon i hope only you must be good and obey my prescriptions cultivate patience it is a wholesome plant bow the pride of that intellect which you see a fever can lay low in an hour aspire no more beyond the powers of man here we shall stay unless providence sends us a ship i have ceased to repine and dont you begin dismiss that problem altogether see how hot it has made your poor brow be good now and dismiss it or else do as i dofold it up put it quietly away in a corner of your mind and when you least expect it will pop out solved oh comfortable doctrine but how about jamie watts headaches and why are the signs of hard thoughts so much stronger in his brow and face than in shakespeares mercy on us there is another problem hazel smiled well pleased and leaned back soothed silenced subdued by her soft voice and the exquisite touch of her velvet hand on his hot brow for womanlike she laid her hand like down on that burning brow to aid her words in soothing it nor did it occur to him just then that this admonition delivered with a kind maternal hand maternal voice came from the same young lady who had flown at him like a wildcat with this very problem in her mouth she mesmerized him problem and all he subsided into a complacent languor and at last went to sleep thinking only of her but the topic had entered his mind too deeply to be finally dismissed it returned next day though in a different form you must know that hazel as he lay on his back in the boat had often in a halfdrowsy way watched the effect of the sun upon the boats mast it now stood a bare pole and at certain hours acted like the needle of a dial by casting a shadow on the sands above all he could see pretty well by means of this pole and its shadow when the sun attained its greatest elevation he now asked miss rolleston to assist him in making this observation exactly she obeyed his instructions and the moment the shadow reached its highest angle and showed the minutest symptom of declension she said now and hazel called out in a loud voice noon and fortynine minutes past eight at sydney said helen holding out her chronometer for she had been sharp enough to get it ready of her own accord hazel looked at her and at the watch with amazement and incredulity what said he impossible you cant have kept sydney time all this while and pray why not said helen have you forgotten that once somebody praised me for keeping sydney time it helped you somehow or other to know where we were and so it will now cried hazel exultingly but no it is impossible we have gone through scenes that you cant have wound that watch up without missing a day indeed but i have said helen not wind my watch up why if i was dying i should wind my watch up see it requires no key a touch or two of the fingers and it is done oh i am remarkably constant in all my habits and this is an old friend i never neglect do you remember that terrible night in the boat when neither of us expected to see the morningoh how good and brave you werewell i remember winding it up that night i kissed it and bade it goodby but i never dreamed of not winding it up because i was going to be killed what am i not to be praised again as i was on board ship stingy cant afford to praise one twice for the same thing praised cried hazel excitedly worshiped you mean why we have got the longitude by means of your chronometer it is wonderful it is providential it is the finger of heaven pen and ink and let me work it out in his excitement he got up without assistance and was soon busy calculating the longitude of godsend isle chapter xl there said he now the latitude i must guess at by certain combinations in the first place the slight variation in the length of the days then i must try and make a rough calculation of the suns parallax and then my botany will help me a little spices furnish a clew there are one or two that will not grow outside the tropic it was the longitude that beat me and now we have conquered it hurrah now i know what to diffuse and in what direction east southeast the ducks have shown me that much so theres the first step toward the impossible problem very well said helen and i am sure one step is enough for one day i forbid you the topic for twelve hours at least i detest it because it always makes your poor head so hot what on earth does that matter said hazel impetuously and almost crossly come come come sir said helen authoritatively it matters to me but when she saw that he could think of nothing else and that opposition irritated him she had the tact and good sense not to strain her authority nor to irritate her subject hazel spliced a long finepointed stick to the masthead and set a plank painted white with guano at right angles to the base of the mast and so whenever the sun attained his meridian altitude went into a difficult and subtle calculation to arrive at the latitude or as near it as he could without proper instruments and he brooded and brooded over his discovery of the longitude but unfortunately he could not advance in some problems the first step once gained leads or at least points to the next but to know whereabouts they were and to let others know it were two difficulties heterogeneous and distinct having thought and thought till his head was dizzy at last he took helens advice and put it by for a while he set himself to fit and number a quantity of pearloyster shells so that he might be able to place them at once when he should be able to recommence his labor of love in the cavern one day helen had left him so employed and was busy cooking the dinner at her own place but mind you with one eye on the dinner and another on her patient when suddenly she heard him shouting very loud and ran out to see what was the matter he was roaring like mad and whirling his arms over his head like a demented windmill she ran to him eureka eureka he shouted in furious excitement oh dear cried helen never mind she was all against her patient exciting himself but he was exalted beyond even her control crown me with laurel he cried i have solved the problem and up went his arms oh is that all said she calmly get me two squares of my parchment cried he and some of the finest gut will not after dinner do no certainly not said hazel in a voice of command i wouldnt wait a moment for all the fleshpots of egypt then she went like the wind and fetched them oh thank you thank you now i wantlet me seeah theres an old rusty hoop that was washed ashore on one of that ships casks i put it carefully away how the unlikeliest things come in useful soon or late she went for the hoop but not so rapidly for here it was that the first faint doubt of his sanity came in however she brought it and he thanked her and now said he while i prepare the intelligence will you be so kind as to fetch me the rushes the what said helen in growing dismay the rushes ill tell you where to find some helen thought the best thing was to temporize perhaps he would be better after eating some wholesome food ill fetch them directly after dinner said she but it will be spoiled if i leave it for long and i do so want it to be nice for you today dinner cried hazel what do i care for dinner now i am solving my problem id rather go without dinner for years than interrupt a great idea pray let dinner take its chance and obey me for once for once said helen and turned her mild hazel eyes on him with such a look of gentle reproach forgive me but dont take me for a child asking you for a toy im a poor crippled inventor who sees daylight at last oh i am on fire and if you want me not to go into a fever why get me my rushes where shall i find them said helen catching fire at him go to where your old hut stood and follow the river about a furlong you will find a bed of high rushes cut me a good bundle cut them below the water choose the stoutest here is a pair of shears i found in the ship she took the shears and went swiftly across the sands and up the slope he watched her with an admiring eye and well he might for it was the very poetry of motion hazel in his hours of health had almost given up walking he ran from point to point without fatigue or shortness of breath helen equally pressed for time did not run but she went almost as fast by rising with the dawn by three meals a day of animal food by constant work and heavenly air she was in a condition women rarely attain to she was trained ten miles was no more to her than ten yards and when she was in a hurry she got over the ground by a grand but feminine motion not easy to describe it was a series of smooth undulations not vulgar strides but swift rushes in which the loins seemed to propel the whole body and the feet scarcely to touch the ground it was the vigor and freedom of a savage with the grace of a lady and so it was she swept across the sands and up the slope et vera incessu patuit dea while she was gone hazel cut two little squares of seals bladder one larger than the other on the smaller he wrote an english lady wrecked on an island w longitude deg min s latitude between the d and th parallels haste to her rescue then he folded this small and inclosed it in the larger slip which he made into a little bag and tied the neck extremely tight with fine gut leaving a long piece of the gut free and now helen came gliding back as she went and brought him a large bundle of rushes then he asked her to help him fasten these rushes round the iron hoop it must not be done too regularly said he but so as to look as much like a little bed of rushes as possible helen was puzzled still but interested so she set to work and between them they fastened rushes all round the hoop although it was a large one but when it was done hazel said they were too bare then we will fasten another row said helen goodhumoredly and without more ado she was off to the river again when she came back she found him up and he said the great excitement had cured himsuch power has the brain over the body this convinced her he had really hit upon some great idea and when she had made him eat his dinner by her fire she asked him to tell her all about it but by a natural reaction the glorious and glowing excitement of mind that had battled his very rheumatic pains was now followed by doubt and dejection dont ask me yet he sighed theory is one thing practice is another we count without our antagonists i forgot they will set their wits against mine and they are many i am but one and i have been so often defeated do you know i have observed that whenever i say beforehand now i am going to do something clever i am always defeated pride really goes before destruction and vanity before a fall the female mind rejecting all else went like a needles point at one thing in this explanation our antagonists said helen looking sadly puzzled why what antagonists have we the messengers said hazel with a groan the aerial messengers that did the business helen dropped the subject with almost ludicrous haste and after a few commonplace observations made a nice comfortable dose of grog and bark for him this she administered as an independent transaction and not at all by way of comment on his antagonists the aerial messengers it operated unkindly for her purpose it did him so much good that he lifted up his dejected head and his eyes sparkled again and he set to work and by sunset prepared two more bags of bladder with inscriptions inside and long tails of fine gut hanging he then set to work and with fingers far less adroit than hers fastened another set of rushes round the hoop he set them less evenly and some of them not quite perpendicular and while he was fumbling over this and examining the effect with paternal glances helens hazel eye dwelt on him with furtive pity for to her this girdle of rushes was now an instrument that bore an ugly likeness to the scepter of straw with which vanity run to seed sways imaginary kingdoms in bedlam or bicetre and yet he was better he walked about the cavern and conversed charmingly he was dictionary essayist raconteur anything she liked and as she prudently avoided and ignored the one fatal topic it was a delightful evening her fingers were as busy as his tongue and when he retired she presented him with the fruits of a fortnights work a glorious wrapper made of fleecy cotton inclosed in a plaited web of flexible and silky grasses he thanked her and blessed her and retired for the night about midnight she awoke and felt uneasy so she did what since his illness she had done a score of times without his knowledgeshe stole from her lair to watch him she found him wrapped in her present which gave her great pleasure and sleeping like an infant which gave her joy she eyed him eloquently for a long time and then very timidly put out her hand and in her quality of nurse laid it lighter than down upon his brow the brow was cool and a very slight moisture on it showed the fever was going or gone she folded her arms and stood looking at him and she thought of all they two had done and suffered together her eyes absorbed him devoured him the time flew by unheeded it was so sweet to be able to set her face from its restraint and let all its sunshine beam on him and even when she retired at last those light hazel eyes that could flash fire at times but were all dovelike now hung and lingered on him as if they could never look at him enough half an hour before daybreak she was awakened by the dog howling piteously she felt a little uneasy at that not much however she got up and issued from her cavern just as the sun showed his red eye above the horizon she went toward the boat as a matter of course she found ponto tied to the helm the boat was empty and hazel nowhere to be seen she uttered a scream of dismay the dog howled and whined louder than ever chapter xli wardlaw senior was not what you would call a tenderhearted man but he was thoroughly moved by general rollestons distress and by his fortitude the gallant old man landing in england one week and going back to the pacific the next like goes with like and wardlaw senior energetic and resolute himself though he felt for his son stricken down by grief gave his heart to the more valiant distress of his contemporary he manned and victualed the springbok for a long voyage ordered her to plymouth and took his friend down to her by train they went out to her in a boat she was a screw steamer that could sail nine knots an hour without burning a coal as she came down the channel the generals trouble got to be well known on board her and when he came out of the harbor the sailors by an honest hearty impulse that did them credit waited for no orders but manned the yards to receive him with the respect due to his services and his sacred calamity on getting on board he saluted the captain and the ships company with sad dignity and retired to his cabin with mr wardlaw there the old merchant forced on him by loan seven hundred pounds chiefly in gold and silver telling him there was nothing like money go where you will he then gave him a number of notices he had printed and a paper of advice and instructions it was written in his own large clear formal hand general rolleston tried to falter out his thanks john wardlaw interrupted him next to you i am her father am i not you have proved it well then however if you do find her as i pray to god you may i claim the second kiss mind that not for myself though for my poor arthur that lies on a sickbed for her general rolleston assented to that in a broken voice he could hardly speak and so they parted and that sad parent went out to the pacific to him it was indeed a sad and gloomy voyage and the hope with which he went on board oozed gradually away as the ship traversed the vast tracks of ocean one immensity of water to be passed before that other immensity could be reached on whose vast uniform surface the search was to be made to abridge this gloomy and monotonous part of our tale suffice it to say that he endured two months of water and infinity ere the vessel fast as she was reached valparaiso their progress however had been more than once interrupted to carry out wardlaws instructions the poor general himself had but one idea to go and search the pacific with his own eyes but wardlaw more experienced directed him to overhaul every whaler and coasting vessel he could and deliver printed notices telling the sad story and offering a reward for any positive information good or bad that should be brought in to his agent at valparaiso acting on these instructions they had overhauled two or three coasting vessels as they steamed up from the horn they now placarded the port of valparaiso and put the notices on board all vessels bound westward and the captain of the springbok spoke to the skippers in the port but they all shook their heads and could hardly be got to give their minds seriously to the inquiry when they heard in what water the cutter was last seen and on what course one old skipper said look on juan fernandez and then at the bottom of the pacific but the sooner you look there the less time you will lose from valparaiso they ran to juan fernandez which indeed seemed the likeliest place if she was alive when the larger island of that group the island dear alike to you who read and to us who write this tale came in sight the fathers heart began to beat higher the ship anchored and took in coal which was furnished at a wickedly high price by mr joshua fullalove who had virtually purchased the island from chili having got it on lease for longer than the earth itself is to last we hear and now rolleston found the value of wardlaws loan it enabled him to prosecute his search through the whole group of islands and he did hear at last of three persons who had been wrecked on masa fuero one of them a female he followed this up and at last discovered the parties he found them to be spaniards and the woman smoking a pipe after this bitter disappointment he went back to the ship and she was to weigh her anchor next morning but while general rolleston was at mesa fuero a small coasting vessel had come in and brought a strange report at secondhand that in some degree unsettled captain morelands mind and being hotly discussed on the forecastle set the ships company in a ferment chapter xlii hazel had risen an hour before dawn for reasons well known to himself he put on his worst clothes and a leathern belt his little bags round his neck and took his bundle of rushes in his hand he also provided himself with some pieces of raw fish and fresh oyster and thus equipped went up through terrapin wood and got to the neighborhood of the lagoon before daybreak there was a heavy steam on the water and nothing else to be seen he put the hoop over his head and walked into the water not without an internal shudder it looked so cold but instead of that it was very warm unaccountably warm he walked in up to his middle and tied his iron hoop to his belt so as to prevent it sinking too deep this done he waited motionless and seemed a little bed of rushes the sun rose and the steam gradually cleared away and hazel peering through a hole or two he had made expressly in his bed of rushes saw several ducks floating about and one in particular all purple without a speck but his amber eye he contrived to detach a piece of fish that soon floated to the surface near him but no duck moved toward it he tried another and another then a mallard he had not observed swam up from behind him and was soon busy pecking at it within a yard of him his heart beat he glided slowly and cautiously forward till the bird was close to the rushes hazel stretched out his hand with the utmost care caught hold of the birds feet and dragged him sharply under the water and brought him up within the circle of the rushes he quacked and struggled hazel soused him under directly and so quenched the sound then he glided slowly to the bank so slowly that the rushes merely seemed to drift ashore this he did not to create suspicion and so spoil the next attempt as he glided he gave his duck air every now and then and soon got on terra firma by this time he had taught the duck not to quack or he would get soused and held under he now took the long gutend and tied it tight round the birds leg and so fastened the bag to him even while he was effecting this a posse of ducks rose at the west end of the marsh and took their flight from the island as they passed hazel threw his captive up in the air and such was the force of example aided perhaps by the fright the captive had received that hazels bird instantly joined these travelers rose with them into the high currents and away bearing the news eastward upon the wings of the wind then hazel returned to the pool and twice more he was so fortunate as to secure a bird and launch him into space so hard is it to measure the wit of man and to define his resources the problem was solved the aerial messengers were on the wing diffusing over hundreds of leagues of water the intelligence that an english lady had been wrecked on an unknown island in longitude deg min and between the d and th parallels of south latitude and calling good men and ships to her rescue for the love of god chapter xliii and now for the strange report that landed at juan fernandez while general rolleston was searching masa fuero the coaster who brought it ashore had been in company at valparaiso with a whaler from nantucket who told him he had fallen in with a dutch whaler out at sea and distressed for water he had supplied the said dutchman who had thanked him and given him a runlet of hollands and had told him in conversation that he had seen land and a river reflected on the sky in waters where no land was marked in the chart namely somewhere between juan fernandez and norfolk island and that believing this to be the reflection of a part of some island near at hand and his water being low though not at that time run out he had gone considerably out of his course in hopes of finding this watered island but could see nothing of it nevertheless as his grandfather who had been sixty years at sea and logged many wonderful things had told him the sky had been known to reflect both ships and land at a great distance he fully believed there was an island somewhere in that longitude not down on any chart an island wooded and watered this tale soon boarded the springbok and was hotly discussed on the forecastle it came to captain morelands ears and he examined the skipper of the coastingsmack but this examination elicited nothing new inasmuch as the skipper had the tale only at third hand captain moreland however communicated it to general rolleston on his arrival and asked him whether he thought it worth while to deviate from their instructions upon information of such a character rolleston shook his head an island reflected in the sky no sir a portion of an island containing a river it is clearly a fable said rolleston with a sigh what is a fable general that the sky can reflect terrestrial objects oh there i cant go with you the phenomenon is rare but it is well established i never saw it myself but i have come across those that have suppose we catechise the forecastle hy foksel sir send a man aft the oldest seaman aboard ay ay sir there was some little delay and then a sailor of about sixty slouched aft made a sea scrape and removing his cap entirely awaited the captains commands my man said the captain i want you to answer a question do you believe land and ships have ever been seen in the sky reflected a many good seamen holds to that sir said the sailor cautiously is it the general opinion of seamen before the mast come tell us jacks as good as his master in these matters couldnt say for boys and lubbers sir but i never met a fullgrown seaman as denied that there sartainly few has seen it but all of em has seen them as has seen it ships and land too but mostly ships howsever i had a messmate once as was sailing past a rock they call ailsa craig and saw a regiment of soldiers amarching in the sky logged it did the mate and them soldiers was amarching between two towns in ireland at that very time there you see general said captain moreland but this is all secondhand said general rolleston with a sigh and i have learned how everything gets distorted in passing from one to another ah said the captain we cant help that the thing is rare i never saw it for one and i suppose you never saw a phenomenon of the kind isaac haint i said isaac grimly then with sudden and not very reasonable heat d my eyes and limbs if i haint seen the peak o teneriffe in the sky topsyturvy and as plain as i see that there cloud there pointing upward come said moreland now we are getting to it tell us all about that well sir said the seaman i dont care to larn them as laughs at everything they haint seen in maybe a dozen voyages at most but you know me and i knows you though you command the ship and i work before the mast now i axes you sir should you say isaac aiken was the man to take a sugarloaf or a cocked hat for the peak o teneriffe as likely as i am myself isaac no commander can say fairer nor that said isaac with dignity well then your honor ill tell ye the truth and no lie we was bound for teneriffe with a fair wind though not so much of it as we wanted by reason she was a good seaboat but broad in the bows the peak hove in sight in the sky and all the glasses was at her she lay a point or two on our weather quarter like full two hours and then she just melted away like a lump o sugar we kept on our course a day and a half and at last we sighted the real peak and anchored off the port whereby when we saw teneriffe peak in the sky to winnard she lay a hundred leagues to board shelp me god that is wonderful said general rolleston that will do isaac said the captain mr butt double his grog for a week for having seen more than i have the captain and general rolleston had a long discussion but the result was they determined to go to easter island first for general rolleston was a soldier and had learned to obey as well as command he saw no sufficient ground for deviating from wardlaws positive instructions this decision soon became known throughout the ship she was to weigh anchor at am next day by high water at eight next morning captain moreland and general rolleston being on deck one of the ships boys a regular pet with rosy cheeks and black eyes comes up to the gentlemen takes off his cap and panting audibly at his own audacity shoves a paper into general rollestons hand and scuds away for his life this wont do said the captain sternly the highbred soldier handed the paper to him unopened the captain opened it looked a little vexed but more amused and handed it back to the general it was a round robin round robins are not ingratiating as a rule but this one came from some rough but honest fellows who had already shown that kindliness and tact may reside in a coarse envelope the sailors of the springbok when they first boarded her in the thames looked on themselves as men bound on an empty cruise and nothing but the pay which was five shillings per month above the average reconciled them to it for a sailor does not like going to sea for nothing any more than a true sportsman likes to ride to hounds that are hunting a red herring trailed but the sight of the general had touched them afar off his gray hair and pale face seen as he rowed out of plymouth harbor had sent them to the yards by a gallant impulse and all through the voyage the game had been to put on an air of alacrity and hope whenever they passed the general or came under his eye if hypocrisy is always a crime this was a very criminal ship for the men and even the boys were hypocrites who feeling quite sure that the daughter was dead at sea months ago did nevertheless make up their faces to encourage the father into thinking she was alive and he was going to find her but people who pursue this game too long and keep up the hopes of another get infected at last themselves and the crew of the springbok arrived at valparaiso infected with a little hope then came the dutchmans tale and the discussion which ended adversely to their views and this elicited the circular we have now the honor to lay before our readers we who sign about this line hope none offence and mean none we think easter island is out of her course such of us as can be spared are ready and willing to take the old cutter that lies for sale to easter island if needs be but to waste the steamer it is a pity we are all agreed the dutch skipper saw land and water aloft sailing between juan fernandez and norfolk isle and what a dutchman can see on the sky we think an englishman can find it in the sea god willing whereby we pray our good captain to follow the dutchmans course with a good heart and a willing crew and so say we whose names here be general rolleston and captain moreland returned to the cabin and discussed this document they came on deck again and the men were piped aft general rolleston touched his cap and with the round robin in his hand addressed them thus my men i thank you for taking my trouble to heart as you do but it would be a bad return to send any of you to easter island in that cutter for she is not seaworthy so the captain tells me i will not consent to throw away your lives in trying to save a life that is dear to me but as to the dutchmans story about an unknown island our captain seems to think that is possible and you tell us you are of the same opinion well then i give up my own judgment and yield to yours yes we will go westward with a good heart he sighed and a willing crew the men cheered the boatswain piped the anchor was heaved and the springbok went out on a course that bade fair to carry her within a hundred miles of godsend island she ran fast on the second day some ducks passed over her head one of which was observed to have something attached to its leg she passed within sixty miles of mount lookout but never saw godsend island and so pursued her way to the society islands sent out her boats made every inquiry around about the islands but with no success and at last after losing a couple of months there brought the heartsick father back on much the same course but rather more northerly chapter xliv hazel returned homeward in a glow of triumph and for once felt disposed to brag to helen of his victorya victory by which she was to profit not he they met in the wood for she had tracked him by his footsteps she seemed pale and disturbed and speedily interrupted his exclamations of triumph by one of delight which was soon however followed by one of distress oh look at you she said you have been in the water it is wicked wicked but i have solved the problem i caught three ducks one after the other and tied the intelligence to their legs they are at this moment careering over the ocean with our story and our longitude and a guess at our latitude crown me with bays with foolscap more likely said helen only just getting well of rheumatic fever and to go and stand in water up to the middle why you dont listen to me cried hazel in amazement i tell you i have solved the problem it is you that dont listen to common sense retorted helen if you go and make yourself ill all the problems in the world will not compensate me and i must say i think it was not very kind of you to run off so without warning why give me hours of anxiety for want of a word but there it is useless to argue with a boy yes sir a boy the fact is i have been too easy with you of late one indulges sick children but then they must not slip away and stand in the water or there is an end of indulgence and one is driven to severity you must be ruled with a rod of iron go home this moment sir and change your clothes and dont you presume to come into the presence of the nurse you have offended till theres not a wet thread about you and so she ordered him off the inventor in his moment of victory slunk away crestfallen to change his clothes so far helen rolleston was a type of her sex in its treatment of inventors at breakfast she became a brilliant exception the moment she saw hazel seated by her fire in dry clothes she changed her key and made him relate the whole business and expressed the warmest admiration and sympathy but said she i do ask you not to repeat this exploit too often now dont do it again for a fortnight the island will not run away ducks come and go every day and your health is very very precious he colored with pleasure and made the promise at once but during this fortnight events occurred in the first place he improved his invention he remembered how a duck overweighted by a crab which was fast to her leg had come on board the boat memory dwelling on this and invention digesting it he resolved to weight his next batch of ducks for he argued thus probably our ducks go straight from this to the great american continent then it may be long ere one of them falls into the hands of a man and perhaps that man will not know english but if i could impede the flight of my ducks they might alight on ships and three ships out of four know english accordingly he now inserted stones of various sizes into the little bags it was a matter of nice calculation the problem was to weight the birds just so much that they might be able to fly three or four hundred miles or about half as far as their unencumbered companions but in the midst of all this a circumstance occurred that would have made a vain man or indeed most men fling the whole thing away helen and he came to a rupture it began by her fault and continued by his she did not choose to know her own mind and in spite of secret warnings from her better judgment she was driven by curiosity or by the unhappy restlessness to which her sex are peculiarly subject at odd times to sound hazel as to the meaning of a certain epigram that rankled in her and she did it in the most feminine way that is to say in the least direct whereas the safest way would have been to grasp the nettle if she could not let it alone said she one day quietly though with a deep blush do you know mr arthur wardlaw hazel gave a shiver and said i do do you know anything about him i do nothing to his discredit i am sure if you are sure why ask me do i ever mention his name perhaps you do sometimes without intending it you are mistaken he is in your thoughts no doubt but not in mine ought i to forget people entirely and what i owe them that is a question i decline to go into how harshly you speak to me is that fair you know my engagement and that honor and duty draw me to england yet i am happy here you who are so good and strong might pity me at least for i am torn this way and that and here the voice ceased and the tears began to flow i do pity you said hazel i must pity any one who is obliged to mention honor and duty in the same breath as arthur wardlaw at this time helen drew back offended bitterly that pity i reject and scorn said she no i plighted my faith with my eyes open and to a worthy object i never knew him blacken any person who was not there to speak for himself and that is a very worthy trait in my opinion the absent are like children they are helpless to defend themselves hazel racked with jealousy and irritated at this galling comparison lost his temper for once and said those who lay traps must not complain if others fall into them traps who lay them you did miss rolleston did i ever condescend to mention that mans name since we have been on the island it is you make me talk of him condescend that is the word nor will i ever deign to mention him again if my love had touched your heart i should have been obliged to mention him for then i should have been bound to tell you a story in which he is mixed my own miserable storymy blood boils against the human race when i think of it but no i see i am nothing to you and i will be silent it is very cruel of you to say that replied helen with tears in her eyes tell me your story and you will see whether you are nothing to me not one word of it said hazel slowly until you have forgotten that man exists oh thank you sir this is plain speaking i am to forget honor and plighted faith and then you will trust me with your secrets when i have shown myself unworthy to be trusted with anything keep your secrets and ill try and keep faith ay and i shall keep it too as long as theres life in my body cant you keep faith without torturing me who love you helens bosom began to heave at this but she fought bravely love me less and respect me more said she panting you affront me you frighten me i looked on you as a brother a dear brother but now i am afraid of you i am afraid he was so injudicious as to interrupt her instead of giving her time to contradict herself you have nothing to fear said he keep this side of the island and ill live on the other rather than hear the name of arthur wardlaw helens courage failed her at that spirited proposal and she made no reply at all but turned her back haughtily and went away from him only when she had got a little way her proud head drooped and she went crying a coolness sprang up between them and neither of them knew how to end it hazel saw no way to serve her now except by flying weighted ducks and he gave his mind so to this that one day he told her he had twentyseven ducks in the air all charged and twothirds of them weighted he thought that must please her now to his surprise and annoyance she received the intelligence coldly and asked him whether it was not cruel to the birds hazel colored with mortification at his great act of selfdenial being so received he said i dont think my worst enemy can say i am wantonly cruel to gods creatures helen threw in deftly and i am not your worst enemy but what other way is there to liberate you from this island where you have nobody to speak to but me well selfishness is the best course think only of others and you are sure not to please them if you want to please people you must begin by understanding them said the lady not illnaturedly but if they dont understand themselves then pity them you can for you are a man what hurts me said hazel is that you really seem to think i fly these ducks for my pleasure why if i had my wish you and i should never leave this island nor any other person set a foot on it i am frank you see rather too frank what does it matter since i do my duty all the same and fly the ducks but sometimes i do yearn for a word of praise for it and that word never comes it is a praiseworthy act said helen but so icily that it is a wonder he ever flew another duck after that no matter said he and his hand involuntarily sought his heart you read me a sharp but wholesome lesson that we should do our duty for our dutys sake and as i am quite sure it is my duty to liberate you and restore you to those you ill fly three ducks tomorrow morning instead of two it is not done by my advice said helen you will certainly make yourself ill oh that is all nonsense said hazel you are rude to me said helen and i am not aware that i deserve it rude am i then ill say no more said hazel half humbly half doggedly his parchment was exhausted and he was driven to another expedient he obtained alcohol by distillation from rum and having found dragons blood in its pure state little ruby drops made a deep red varnish that defied water he got slips of bark white inside cut his inscription deep on the inner side and filled the incised letters with this red varnish he had fortyeight ducks in the air and was rising before daybreak to catch another couple when he was seized with a pain in the right hip and knee and found he could hardly walk so he gave in that morning and kept about the premises but he got worse and he had hardly any use in his right side from the waist downward and was in great pain as the day wore on the pain and loss of power increased and resisted all his remedies there was no fever to speak of but nature was grimly revenging herself for many a gentler warning neglected when he realized his condition he was terribly cut up and sat on the sand with his head in his hands for nearly two hours but after that period of despondency he got up took his boathook and using it as a staff hobbled to his arsenal and set to work among his materials was a young tree he had pulled up the roots ran at right angles to the stem he just sawed off the ends of the roots and then proceeded to shorten the stem but meantime helen who had always a secret eye on him and his movements had seen there was something wrong and came timidly and asked what was the matter nothing said he doggedly then why did you sit so long on the sand i never saw you like that i was ruminating what upon not that i have any right to ask on the arrogance and folly of men they attempt more than they can do and despise the petty prudence and common sense of women and smart for it as i am smarting now for being wiser than you oh said helen why what is the matter and what is that you have made it looks likeoh dear it is a crutch said hazel with forced calmness and i am a cripple helen clasped her hands and stood trembling hazel lost his selfcontrol for a moment and cried out in a voice of agony a useless cripple i wish i was dead and out of the way then ashamed of having given way before her he seized his crutch placed the crook under his arm and turned sullenly away from her four steps he took with his crutch she caught him with two movements of her supple and vigorous frame she just laid her left hand gently on his shoulder and with her right she stole the crutch softly away and let it fall upon the sand she took his right hand and put it to her lips like a subject paying homage to her sovereign and then she put her strong arm under his shoulder still holding his right hand in hers and looked in his face no wooden crutches when i am by said she in a low voice full of devotion he stood surprised and his eyes began to fill come said she in a voice of music and thus aided he went with her to her cavern as they went she asked him tenderly where the pain was it was in my hip and knee he said but now it is nowhere for joy has come back to my heart and to mine too said helen except for this the quarrel dispersed like a cloud under this calamity there was no formal reconciliation no discussion and this was the wisest course for the unhappy situation remained unchanged and the friendliest discussion could only fan the embers of discord and misery gently instead of fiercely the pair so strangely thrown together commenced a new chapter of their existence it was not patient and nurse over again hazel though very lame had too much spirit left to accept that position but still the sexes became in a measure reversed helen the fisherman and forager hazel the cook and domestic he was as busy as ever but in a narrow circle he found pearl oysters near the sunk galleon and ere he had been lame many weeks he had entirely lined the sides of the cavern with motherofpearl set in cement and close as mosaic every day he passed an hour in paradise for his living crutch made him take a little walk with her her hand held his her arm supported his shoulder her sweet face was near his full of tender solicitude they seemed to be one and spoke in whispers to each other like thinking aloud the causes of happiness were ever present the causes of unhappiness were out of sight and showed no signs of approach and of the two helen was the happiest before a creature so pure as this marries and has children the great maternal instinct is still there but feeds on what it can getfirst a doll and then some helpless creature or other too often she wastes her hearts milk on something grown up but as selfish as a child helen was more fortunate her child was her hero now so lame that he must lean on her to walk the days passed by and the island was fast becoming the world to those two and as bright a world as ever shone on two mortal creatures it was a happy dream what a pity that dreams dissolve so soon this had lasted for nearly two months and hazel was getting better though still not well enough or not fool enough to dismiss his live crutch when one afternoon helen who had been up on the heights observed a dark cloud in the blue sky toward the west there was not another cloud visible and the air marvelously clear time about three quarters of an hour before sunset she told hazel about this solitary cloud and asked him with some anxiety if it portended another storm he told her to be under no alarmthere were no tempests in that latitude except at the coming and going out of the rainsbut he should like to go round the point and look at her cloud she lent him her arm and they went round the point and there they saw a cloud entirely different from anything they had ever seen since they were on the island it was like an enormous dark ribbon stretched along the sky at some little height above the horizon notwithstanding its prodigious length it got larger before their very eyes hazel started helen felt him start and asked him with some surprise what was the matter cloud said he that is no cloud that is smoke smoke echoed helen becoming agitated in her turn yes the breeze is northerly and carries the smoke nearer to us it is the smoke of a steamboat chapter xlv both were greatly moved and after one swift glance helen stole at him neither looked at the other they spoke in flurried whispers can they see the island i dont know it depends on how far the boat is to windward of her smoke how shall we know if she sees the island she will make for it that moment why do ships never pass an unknown island yes but that steamer will not pass us but why at this question hazel hung his head and his lip quivered he answered her at last because she is looking for you helen was struck dumb at this he gave his reasons steamers never visit these waters love has brought that steamer out love that will not go unrewarded arthur wardlaw is on board that ship have they seen us yet hazel forced on a kind of dogged fortitude he said when the smoke ceases to elongate you will know they have changed their course and they will change their course the moment the man at the masthead sees us oh but how do you know they have a man at the masthead i know by myself i should have a man at the masthead night and day and now the situation was beyond words they both watched and watched to see the line of smoke cease it continued to increase and spread eastward and that proved the steamer was continuing her course the sun drew close to the horizon they dont see us said helen faintly no said hazel not yet and the sun is just setting it is all over she put her handkerchief to her eyes a moment and then after a sob or two she said almost cheerfully well dear friend we were happy till that smoke came to disturb us let us try and be as happy now it is gone dont smile like that it makes me shudder did i smile it must have been at your simplicity in thinking we have seen the last of that steamer and so we have not so in three hours she will be at anchor in that bay why what will bring her i shall bring her you how by lighting my bonfire chapter xlvi helen had forgotten all about the bonfire she now asked whether he was sure those on board the steamer could see the bonfire then hazel told her that it was now of prodigious size and height some six months before he was crippled he had added and added to it that bonfire said he will throw a ruddy glare over the heavens that they cant help seeing on board the steamer then as they are not on a course but on a search they will certainly run a few miles southward to see what it is they will say it is either a beacon or a ship on fire and in either case they will turn the boats head this way well before they have run southward half a dozen miles their lookout will see the bonfire and the island in its light let us get to the boat my lucifers are there she lent him her arm to the boat and stood by while he made his preparations they were very simple he took a pine torch and smeared it all over with pitch then put his luciferbox in his bosom and took his crutch his face was drawn pitiably but his closed lips betrayed unshaken and unshakable resolution he shouldered his crutch and hobbled up as far as the cavern here helen interposed dont you go toiling up the hill said she give me the lucifers and the torch and let me light the beacon i shall be there in half the time you will thank you thank you said hazel eagerly not to say violently he wanted it done but it killed him to do it he then gave her his instructions it is as big as a haystack said he and as dry as a chip and there are eight bundles of straw placed expressly light bundles to windward first then the others it will soon be all in a blaze meanwhile said helen you prepare our supper i feel quite faintfor want of it hazel assented it is the last we shall he was going to say it was the last they would eat together but his voice failed him and he hobbled into the cavern and tried to smother his emotion in work he lighted the fire and blew it into a flame with a palmettoleaf and then he sat down awhile very sick at heart then he got up and did the cooking sighing all the time and just when he was beginning to wonder why helen was so long lighting eight bundles of straw she came in looking pale is it all right said he go and look said she no let us have our supper first neither had any appetite they sat and kept casting strange looks at one another to divert this anyhow hazel looked up at the roof and said faintly if i had known i would have made more haste and set pearl there as well what does that matter said helen looking down not much indeed replied he sadly i am a fool to utter such childish regrets and more than that i am a mean selfish cur to have a regret come come we cant eat let us go round the point and see the waves reddened by the beacon that gives you back to the world you were born to embellish helen said she would go directly and her languid reply contrasted strangely with his excitement she played with her supper and wasted time in a very unusual way until he told her plump she was not really eating and he could wait no longer he must go and see how the beacon was burning oh very well said she and they went down to the beach she took his crutch and gave it to him this little thing cut him to the heart it was the first time she had accompanied him so far as that without offering herself to be his crutch he sighed deeply as he put the crutch under his arm but he was too proud to complain only he laid it all on the approaching steamboat the subtle creature by his side heard the sigh and smiled sadly at being misunderstoodbut what man could understand her they hardly spoke till they reached the point the waves glittered in the moonlight there was no red light on the water why what is this said hazel you cant have lighted the bonfire in eight places as i told you she folded her arms and stood before him in an attitude of defiance all but her melting eye i have not lighted it at all said she hazel stood aghast what have i done he cried duty manhood everything demanded that i should light that beacon and i trusted it to you then helens attitude of defiance melted away she began to cower and hid her blushing face in her hands then she looked up imploringly then she uttered a wild and eloquent cry and fled from him like the wind chapter xlvii that cloud was really the smoke of the springbok which had mounted into air so thin that it could rise no higher the boat herself was many miles to the northward returning full of heavy hearts from a fruitless search she came back in a higher parallel of latitude intending afterward to steer nw to easter island the life was gone out of the ship the father was deeply dejected and the crew could no longer feign the hope they did not feel having pursued the above course to within four hundred miles of juan fernandez general rolleston begged the captain to make a bold deviation to the sw and then see if they could find nothing there before going to easter island captain moreland was very unwilling to go to the sw the more so as coal was getting short however he had not the heart to refuse general rolleston anything there was a northerly breeze he had the fires put out and covering the ship with canvas sailed three hundred miles sw but found nothing then he took in sail got up steam again and away for easter island the ship ran so fast that she had got into latitude thirtytwo by ten am next morning at h m the dreary monotony of this cruise was broken by the man at the masthead on deck there hullo the schooner on our weatherbow well what of her she has luffed well what o that she has altered her course how many points she was sailing se and now her head is ne that is curious general rolleston who had come and listened with a grain of hope now sighed and turned away the captain explained kindly that the man was quite right to draw his captains attention to the fact of a tradingvessel altering her course there is a seagrammar general said he and when one seaman sees another violate it he concludes there is some reason or other now jack what dye make of her i cant make much of her she dont seem to know her own mind that is all at ten oclock she was bound for valparaiso or the island but now she has come about and beating to windward bound for easter island i dunno keep your eye on her ay ay sir captain moreland told general rolleston that very few ships went to easter island which lies in a lovely climate but is a miserable place and he was telling the general that it is inhabited by savages of a low order who half worship the relics of masonry left by their more civilized predecessors when jack hailed the deck again well said the captain i think she is bound for the springbok the soldier received this conjecture with astonishment and incredulity not to be wondered at the steamboat headed nw right in the winds eye sixteen miles off at least a ship was sailing ne so that the two courses might be represented thus a b and there hung in the air like a black mark against the blue sky a fellow whose oracular voice came down and said b was endeavoring to intercept a nevertheless time confirmed the conjecture the schooner having made a short board to the ne came about and made a long board due west which was as near as he could lie to the wind on this captain moreland laid the steamboats head due north this brought the vessels rapidly together when they were about two miles distant the stranger slackened sail and hove to hoisting stars and stripes at her mizzen the union jack went up the shrouds of the springbok directly and she pursued her course but gradually slackened her steam general rolleston walked the deck in great agitation and now indulged in wild hopes which captain moreland thought it best to discourage at once ah sir he said dont you run into the other extreme and imagine he has come on our business it is at sea as it is ashore if a man goes out of his course to speak to you it is for his own sake not yours this yankee has got men sick with scurvy and is come for limejuice or his water is out orhallo savages aboard it was too true the schooner had a cargo of savages male and female the males were nearly naked but the females strange to say were dressed to the throat in ample robes with broad and flowing skirts and had little coronets on their heads as soon as the schooner hove to the fiddle had struck up and the savages were now dancing in parties of four the men doing a sort of monkey hornpipe in quick pace with their hands nearly touching the ground the women on the contrary erect and queenly swept about in slow rhythm with most graceful and coquettish movements of the arms and hands and bewitching smiles the steamboat came alongside but at a certain distance to avoid all chance of collision and the crew clustered at the side and cheered the savages dancing the poor general was forgotten at the merry sight presently a negro in white cotton with a face blacker than the savages stepped forward and hoisted a board on which was printed very large are you having allowed this a moment to sink into the mind he reversed the board and showed these words also printed large the springbok there was a thrilling murmur on board and after a pause of surprise the question was answered by a loud cheer and waving of hats the reply was perfectly understood almost immediately a boat was lowered by some novel machinery and pulled toward the steamer there were two men in it the skipper and the negro the skipper came up the side of the springbok he was loosely dressed in some light drabcolored stuff and a huge straw hat a man with a long puritanical head a nose inclined to be aquiline a face bronzed by weather and heat thin resolute lips and a square chin but for a certain breadth between his keen gray eyes which revealed more intellect than cromwells ironsides were encumbered with he might have passed for one of that hardpraying hardhitting fraternity he came on deck just touched his hat as if to brush away a fly and removing an enormous cigar from his mouth said wal and so this is the springbok spry little boat she is how many knots can ye get out of her now not that i am curious about twelve knots and when the steams off the bile how many can you sail not that it is my business eight or nine what is your business hum you have been over some water looking for that gal where do ye hail from last the society islands did you board me to hear me my catechism no i am not one of your prying sort where are ye bound for now i am bound for easter island have you heard anything of the gal no and when do ye expec to go back to england as wise as ye came never while the ship can swim cried moreland angrily to hide his despondency from this stranger and now it is my turn i think what schooner is this by whom commanded and whither bound the julia dodd joshua fullalove bound for juan fernandez with the raw material of civilizationlook at the varmint skippinand a printingpress an thats the instrument of civilization i rather think well sir and why in heavens name did you change your course wal i reckon i changed itto tell you a lie to tell us a lie ay the darnedest etarnal lie that ever came out of a mans mouth fust theres an unknown island somewheres about thats a kinder flourish beforehand on that island theres an english gal wrecked exclamations burst forth on every side at this and she is so tarnation cute she is flying ducks all over creation with a writing tied to their legs telling the tale and setting down the longitude there if that isnt a buster i hope i may never live to tell another god bless you sir cried the general where is the island what island the island where my child is wrecked what are you the gals father said joshua with a sudden touch of feeling i am sir pray withhold nothing from me you know why cunule said the yankee soothingly dont i tell you its a buster however the lie is none o mine its that old cuss skinflint set it afloat he is always pisoning these peaceful waters rolleston asked eagerly who skinflint was and where he could be found wal he is a sorter sea jackofalltrades etarnally cruising about to buy gratisthose he buys of call it stealing got a rotten old cutter manned by his wife and famly they get coal out of me for fur and sell the coal at double my price they kill seals and dress the skins aboard kill fish and salt em aboard ye know when that famly is at sea by the smell that pervades the briny deep an heralds their approach yesterday the air smelt awful so i said to vespasian here i think that seaskunk is out for theres something apisoning the cerulean waves an succumambient air we hadnt sailed not fifty miles more before we run agin him their clothes were drying all about the rigging hails me the varmint does vesp and i we work the printingpress together an so order him to looward not to taint our otaheitans that stink of ile at home but i had em biled before id buy em an now theyre vilets wal now skinflint says i i reckon youre come to bring me that harpoon o mine you stole last time you was at my island i never saw your harpoon says he i want to know have you come across the springbok mebbe i have says i why do you ask got news for her says he and cant find her nowheres so then we set to and fenced a bit and this old varmint to put me off the truth told me the buster a month ago or more he was boardedby a duck and this yar duck had a writing tied to his leg and this yar writing said an english gal was wrecked on an island and put down the very longitude show me that duck says i ironical dye take us for fools says he we ate the duck for supper that was like ye says i if an angel brought your pardon down from heights celestial youd roast him and sell his feathers for swansdown mebbe ye ate the writing i know y are a hungry lot the writing is in my cabin says he show it me says i an mebbe ill believe ye no the cuss would only show it to the springbok theres a reward says he whats the price of a soul aboard your cutter i asked him have you parted with yours as you want to buy one says he not one as would carry me right slick away to everlasting blazes says i so then we said goodmorning and he bore away for valparaiso presently i saw your smoke and that you would never overhaul old stinkamalee on that track so i came about now i tell you that old cuss knows where the gal is and mebbe got her tied hand and fut in his cabin an im kinder sot on english gals they put me in mind of butter and honey why my schooner is named after one so now cunule clap on steam for valparaiso and youll soon overhaul the old stinkpot you may know him by the brown patch in his jibsail the ontidy varmint pull out your purse and bind him to drop lying about ducks and geese and tell you the truth he knows where your gal is i swan wal ye neednt smother me for by this time he was the center of a throng all pushing and driving to catch his words captain moreland begged him to step down into his cabin and there the general thanked him with great warmth and agitation for his humanity we will follow your advice at once he said is there anything i can offer you without offense wal drawled the yankee i guess not business an sentiment wont mix nohow business took me to the island sentiment brought me here ill take a shakehand all round and if y have got live fowls to spare ill be obliged to you for a couple ye see im colonizing that darned island an sowing in with grain an otaheitans an niggers an irishmen an all the cream o creation an id be glad of a couple o dorkins to crow the lazy varmint up this very moderate request was heartily complied with and the acclamation and cheers of the crew followed this strange character to his schooner at which his eye glistened and twinkled with quiet satisfaction but he made it a point of honor not to move a muscle before he could get under way the springbok took a circuit and passing within a hundred yards of him fired a gun to leeward by way of compliment set a cloud of canvas and tore through the water at her highest speed outside the port of valparaiso she fell in with skinflint and found him not quite so black as he was painted the old fellow showed some parental feeling produced the bag at once to general rolleston and assured him a wearied duck had come on board and his wife had detached the writing they took in coal and then ran westward once more every heart beating high with confident hope chapter xlviii helens act was strange and demands a word of explanation if she had thought the steamboat was a strange vessel she would have lighted the bonfire if she had known her father was on board she would have lighted it with joy but hazel whose every word now was gospel had said it was arthur wardlaw in that boat searching for her still so strong is the impulse in all civilized beings to get back to civilization that she went up that hill as honestly intending to light the bonfire as hazel intended it to be lighted but as she went her courage cooled and her feet began to go slowly as her mind ran swiftly forward to consequence upon consequence to light that bonfire was to bring arthur wardlaw down upon herself and hazel living alone and on intimate terms arthur would come and claim her to his face could she disallow his claim gratitude would now be on his side as well as good faith what a shock to arthur what torture for hazel torture that he foresaw or why the face of anguish that dragged even now at her heartstrings and then it could end only in one way she and hazel would leave the island in arthurs ship what a voyage for all three she stood transfixed by shame her whole body blushed at what she saw coming then once more hazels face rose before her poor crippled hazel her hero and her patient she sat down and sighed and could no more light the fire than she could have put it out if another had lighted it she was a girl that could show you at times she had a father as well as a mother but that evening she was all woman they met no more that night in the morning his face was haggard and showed a mental struggle but hers placid and quietly beaming for the very reason that she had made a great sacrifice she was one of that sort and this difference between them was a foretaste his tender conscience pricked him sore to see her sit beaming there when if he had done his own duty with his own hands she would be on her way to england yet his remorse was dumb for if he gave it vent then he must seem ungrateful to her for her sacrifice she saw his deep and silent compunction approved it secretly said nothing but smiled and beamed and soothed he could not resist this and wild thrills of joy and hope passed through him visions of unbroken bliss far from the world but this sweet delirium was followed by misgivings of another kind and here she was at fault what could they be it was the voice of conscience telling him that he was really wining her love once inaccessible and if so was bound to tell her his whole story and let her judge between him and the world before she made any more sacrifices for him but it is hard to stop great happiness harder to stop it and ruin it every night as he lay alone he said tomorrow i will tell her all and make her the judge but in the morning her bright face crushed his purpose by the fear of clouding it his limbs got strong and his heart got weak and they used to take walks and her head came near his shoulder and the path of duty began to be set thicker than ever with thorns and the path of love with primroses one day she made him sit to her for his portrait and under cover of artistic enthusiasm told him his beard was godlike and nothing in the world could equal it for beauty she never saw but one at all like it poor mr seatons but even that was very inferior to his and then she dismissed the sitter poor thing said she you are pale and tired and she began to use ornaments took her bracelets out of her bag and picked pearls out of her walls and made a coronet under which her eyes flashed at night with superlative beautyconscious beauty brightened by the sense of being admired and looked at by the eye she desired to please she revered him he had improved her character and she knew it and often told him so call me hazelia she said make me liker you still one day he came suddenly through the jungle and found her reading her prayerbook he took it from her not meaning to be rude neither but inquisitive it was open at the marriageservice and her cheeks were dyed scarlet his heart panted he was a clergyman he could read that service over them both would it be a marriage not in england but in some countries it would why not in this this was not england he looked up her head was averted she was downright distressed he was sorry to have made her blush so he took her hand and kissed it tenderly so tenderly that his heart seemed to go into his lips she thrilled under it and her white brow sank upon his shoulder the sky was a vault of purple with a flaming topaz in the center the sea a heavenly blue the warm air breathed heavenly odors flaming macaws wheeled overhead hummingbirds more gorgeous than any flower buzzed round their heads and amazed the eye with delight then cooled it with the deep green of the jungle into which they dived it was a paradise with the sun smiling down on it and the ocean smiling up and the air impregnated with love here they were both content now to spend the rest of their days the world forgetting by the world forgot chapter xlix the springbok arrived in due course at longitude deg min but saw no island this was dispiriting but still captain moreland did not despair he asked general rolleston to examine the writing casefully and tell him was that miss rollestons handwriting the general shook his head sorrowfully no said he it is nothing like my childs hand why all the better said captain moreland the lady has got somebody about her who knows a thing or two the man that could catch wild ducks and turn em into postmen could hit on the longitude somehow and he doesnt pretend to be exact in the latitude upon this he ran northward four hundred miles which took him three days for they stopped at night no island he then ran south five hundred miles stopping at night no island then he took the vessel zigzag just before sunset one lovely day the man at the masthead sang out on deck there hullo something in sight on our weatherbow what is it looks like a mast no dont know what it is point the sailor pointed with his finger captain moreland ordered the ships course to be altered accordingly by this time general rolleston was on deck the ship ran two miles on the new course and all this time the topmans glass was leveled and the crew climbed about the rigging all eyes and ears at last the clear hail came down i can make it out now sir what is it it is a palmtree the captain jumped on a gun and waved his hat grandly and instantly the vessel rang with a lusty cheer and for once sailors gabbled like washerwomen they ran till they saw the island in the moonlight and the giant palm black and sculptured out of the violet sky then they set the lead going and it warned them not to come too close they anchored off the west coast a daybreak they moved slowly on still sounding as they went and rounding the west point general rolleston saw written on the guanoed rocks in large letters an english lady wrecked here haste to her rescue he and moreland shook hands and how their eyes glistened presently there was a stranger inscription still upon the rocksa rough outline of the island on an enormous scale showing the coastline the reefs the shallow water and the deep water ease her stop her the captain studied this original chart with his glass and crept slowly on for the west passage but warned by the soundings marked on the rock he did not attempt to go through the passage but came to an anchor and lowered his boat the sailors were all on the qui vive to land but the captain to their infinite surprise told them only three persons would land that morninghimself his son and general rolleston the fact is this honest captain had got a misgiving founded on a general view of human nature he expected to find the girl with two or three sailors one of them united to her by some nautical ceremony duly witnessed but such as a military officer of distinction could hardly be expected to approve he got into the boat in a curious state of delight dashed with uncomfortable suspense and they rowed gently for the west passage as for general rolleston now it was he needed all his fortitude suppose the lady was not helen after all the chances were against her being there suppose she was dead and buried in that island suppose that fatal disease with which she had sailed had been accelerated by hardships and providence permitted him only to receive her last sigh all these misgivings crowded on him the moment he drew so near the object which had looked all brightness so long as it was unattainable he sat pale and brave in the boat but his doubts and fears were greater than his hope they rounded telegraph point and in a moment paradise bay burst on them and hazels boat within a hundred yards of them it was halftide they beached the boat and general rolleston landed captain moreland grasped his hand and said call us if it is all right general rolleston returned the pressure of that honest hand and marched up the beach just as if he was going into action he came to the boat it had an awning over the stern and was clearly used as a sleepingplace a series of wooden pipes standing on uprights led from this up to the cliff the pipes were in fact mere sections of the sagotree with the soft pith driven out as this was manifestly a tube of communication general rolleston followed it until he came to a sort of veranda with a cave opening on it he entered the cave and was dazzled by its most unexpected beauty he seemed to be in a gigantic nautilus roof and sides and the very chimney were one blaze of motherofpearl but after the first start brighter to him was an old shawl he saw on a nail for that showed it was a womans abode he tore down the old shawl and carried it to the light he recognized it as helens her rugs were in a corner he rushed in and felt them all over with trembling hands they were still warm though she had left her bed some time he came out wild with joy and shouted to moreland she is alive she is alive she is alive then fell on his knees and thanked god a cry came down to him from above he looked up as he knelt and there was a female figure dressed in white stretching out its hands as if it would fly down to him its eyes gleamed he knew them all that way off he stretched out his hands as eloquently and then he got up to meet her but the stout soldiers limbs were stiffer than of old and he got up so slowly that ere he could take a step there came flying to him with little screams and inarticulate cries no living skeleton nor consumptive young lady but a grand creature tanned here and there rosy as the morn and full of lusty vigor a body all health strength and beauty a soul all love she flung herself all over him in a moment with cries of love unspeakable and then it was oh my darling my darling oh my own own ha ha ha ha oh oh oh oh is it you is it can it papa papa then little convulsive hands patting him and feeling his beard and shoulders then a sudden hail of violent kisses on his head his eyes his arms his hands his knees then a stout soldier broken down by this and sobbing for joy oh my child my flesh and blood oh oh oh then all manhood melted away except paternity and a father turned mother and clinging kissing and rocking to and fro with his child and both crying for joy as if their hearts would burst a sight for angels to look down at and rejoice but what mortal pen could paint it chapter l they gave a long time to pure joy before either of them cared to put questions or compare notes but at last he asked her who was on the island besides her oh said she only my guardian angel poor mr welch died the first week we were here he parted the hair on her brow and kissed it tenderly and who is your guardian angel why you are now my own papa and well you have proved it to think of your being the one to come at your age well never mind me who has taken such care of my childthis the sick girl they frightened me about indeed papa i was a dying girl my very hand was wasted look at it now brown as a berry but so plump you owe that to him and papa i can walk twenty miles without fatigue and so strong i could take you up in my arms and carry i know but i am content to eat you a shower of kisses i hope you will like him my own helen ah i am a happy old man this day what is his name mr hazel he is a clergyman oh papa i hope you will like him for he has saved my life more than once and then he has been so generous so delicate so patient for i used him very ill at first and you will find my character as much improved as my health and all owing to mr hazel he is a clergyman and oh so good so humble so clever so selfdenying ah how can i ever repay him well i shall be glad to see this paragon and shake him by the hand you may imagine what i feel to any one that is kind to my darling an old gentleman about my age oh no papa hum if he had been old i should not be here for he has had to fight for me against cruel men with knives and work like a horse he built me a hut and made me this cave and almost killed himself in my service poor mr hazel how old is he dearest papa i never asked him that but i think he is four or five years older than me and a hundred years better than i shall ever be i am afraid what is the matter darling nothing child nothing dont tell me cant i read your dear face come let me read yours look me in the face now full he took her by the shoulders firmly but not the least roughly and looked straight into her hazel eyes she blushed at this ordealblushed scarlet but her eyes pure as heaven faced his fairly though with a puzzled look he concluded this paternal inspection by kissing her on the brow i was an old fool he muttered what do you say dear papa nothing nothing kiss me again well love you had better find this guardian angel of yours that i may take him by the hand and give him a fathers blessing and make him some little return by carrying him home to england along with my darling ill call him papa where can he be gone i wonder she ran out to the terrace and called mr hazel mr hazel i dont see him but he cant be far off mr hazel then she came back and made her father sit down and she sat at his knee beaming with delight ah papa said he it was you who loved me best in england it was you that came to look for me no said he there are others there that love you as well in their way poor wardlaw on his sickbed for you cut down like a flower the moment he heard you were lost in the proserpine ah and i have broken faith that is a story said helen you couldnt for a moment i mean i promised the dear old manhe furnished the ship the men and the money to find you he says you are as much his daughter as mine well but what did you promise him said helen blushing and interrupting hastily for she could not bear the turn matters were taking oh only to give you the second kiss from arthur come better late than never she knelt before him and put out her forehead instead of her lips there said the general that kiss is from arthur wardlaw your intended why who the deuce is this a young man was standing wonderstruck at the entrance and had heard the generals last words they went through him like a knife general rolleston stared at him helen uttered an ejaculation of pleasure and said this is my dear father and he wants to thank you i dont understand this said the general i thought you told me there was nobody on the island but you and your guardian angel did you count this poor fellow for nobody why he did you a good turn once oh papa said helen reproachfully why this is my guardian angel this is mr hazel the general looked from one to another in amazement then he said to helen this your mr hazel yes papa why you dont mean to tell me you dont know this man know him papa why of course i know mr hazel know him and revere him beyond all the world except you the general lost patience are you out of your senses said he this man here is no hazel why this is james seatonour gardenera ticketofleave man chapter li at this fearful insult helen drew back from her father with a cry of dismay and then moved toward hazel with her hands extended as if to guard him from another blow and at the same time deprecate his resentment but then she saw his dejected attitude and she stood confounded looking from one to the other i knew him in a moment by his beard said the general coolly ah cried helen and stood transfixed she glared at hazel and his beard with dilating eyes and began to tremble then she crept back to her father and held him tight but still looked over her shoulder at hazel with dilating eyes and paling cheek as for hazel his deportment all this time went far toward convicting him he leaned against the side of the cave and hung his head in silence and his face was ashy pale when general rolleston saw his deep distress and the sudden terror and repugnance the revelation seemed to create in his daughters mind he felt sorry he had gone so far and said well well it is not for me to judge you harshly for you have laid me under a deep obligation and after all i can see good reasons why you should conceal your name from other people but you ought to have told my daughter the truth helen interrupted him or rather she seemed unconscious he was speaking she had never for an instant taken her eye off the culprit and now she spoke to him who and what are you sir my name is robert penfold penfold seaton cried helen alias upon alias and she turned to her father in despair then to hazel again are you what papa says i am oh papa papa cried helen then there is no truth nor honesty in all the world and she turned her back on robert penfold and cried and sobbed upon her fathers breast oh the amazement and anguish of that hour the pure affection and reverence that would have blessed a worthy man wasted on a convict her hearts best treasures flung on a dunghill this is a womans greatest loss on earth and helen sank and sobbed under it general rolleston whose own heart was fortified took a shallow view of the situation and moreover helens face was hidden on his bosom and what he saw was hazels manly and intelligent countenance pale and dragged with agony and shame come come he said gently dont cry about it it is not your fault and dont be too hard on the man you told me he had saved your life would he had not said the sobbing girl there seaton said the general now you see the consequences of deceit it wipes out the deepest obligations he resumed in a different tone but not with me this is a woman but i am a man and know how a bad man could have abused the situation in which i found you two not worse than he has done cried helen what do you tell me girl said general rolleston beginning to tremble in his turn what could he do worse than steal my esteem and veneration and drag my hearts feelings in the dirt oh wherewherecan i ever look for a guide instructor and faithful friend after this he seemed all truth and he is all a lie the world is all a lie would i could leave it this moment this is all romantic nonsense said general rolleston beginning to be angry you are a little fool and in your ignorance and innocence have no idea how well this young fellow has behaved on the whole i tell you that in spite of this one fault i should like to shake him by the hand i will too and then admonish him afterward you shall not you shall not cried helen seizing him almost violently by the arm you take him by the hand a monster how dare you steal into my esteem how dare you be a miracle of goodness selfdenial learning and every virtue that a lady might worship and thank god for when all the time you are a vile convicted ill thank you not to say that word said hazel firmly ill call you what you are if i choose said helen defiantly but for all that she did not do it she said piteously what offense had i ever given you what crime had i ever committed that you must make me the victim of this diabolical deceit oh sir what powers of mind you have wasted to achieve this victory over a poor unoffending girl what was your motive what good could come of it to you he wont speak to me he is not even penitent sullen and obstinate he shall be taken to england and well punished for it papa it is your duty helen said the general you ladies are rather too fond of hitting a man when he is down and you speak daggers as the saying is and then wish you had bitten your tongue off sooner you are my child but you are also a british subject and if you charge me on my duty to take this man to england and have him imprisoned i must but before you go that length you had better hear the whole story sir said robert penfold quietly i will go back to prison this minute if she wishes it how dare you interrupt papa said helen haughtily but with a great sob come come said the general be quiet both of you and let me say my say to robert you had better turn your head away for i am a straightforward man and im going to show her you are not a villain but a madman this robert penfold wrote me a letter imploring me to find him some honest employment however menial that looked well and i made him my gardener he was a capital gardener but one fine day he caught sight of you you are a very lovely girl though you dont seem to know it and he is a madman and he fell in love with you helen uttered an ejaculation of great surprise the general resumed he can only have seen you at a distance or you would recognize him but really it is laughable he saw you somehow though you did not see him and well his insanity hurt himself and did not hurt you you remember how he suspected burglars and watched night after night under your window that was out of love for you his insanity took the form of fidelity and humble devotion he got a wound for his pains poor fellow and you made arthur wardlaw get him a clerks place arthur wardlaw cried seaton was it to him i owed it and he groaned aloud said helen he hates poor arthur his benefactor then to penfold if you are that james seaton you received a letter from me i did said penfold and putting his hand in his bosom he drew out a letter and showed it her let me see it said helen oh no dont take this from me too said he piteously general rolleston continued the day you sailed he disappeared and i am afraid not without some wild idea of being in the same ship with you this was very reprehensible do you hear young man but what is the consequence you get shipwrecked together and the young madman takes such care of you that i find you well and hearty and calling him your guardian angel andanother thing to his credithe has set his wits to work to restore you to the world these ducks one of which brings me here of course it was he who contrived that not you young man you must learn to look things in the face this young lady is not of your sphere to begin and in the next place she is engaged to mr arthur wardlaw and i am come out in his steamboat to take her to him and as for you helen take my advice think what most convicts are compared to this one shut your eyes entirely to his folly as i shall and let you and i think only of his good deeds and so make him all the return we can you and i will go on board the steamboat directly and when we are there we can tell moreland there is somebody else on the island he then turned to penfold and said my daughter and i will keep in the afterpart of the vessel and anybody that likes can leave the ship at valparaiso helen i know it is wrong but what can i doi am so happy you are alive and well how can i punish or afflict a human creature today and above all how can i crush this unhappy young man without whom i should never have seen you again in this world my daughter my dear lost child and he held her at arms length and gazed at her and then drew her to his bosom and for him robert penfold ceased to exist except as a man that had saved his daughter papa said helen after a long pause just make him tell why he could not trust to me why he passed himself off to me for a clergyman i am a clergyman said robert penfold oh said helen shocked to find him so hardened as she thought she lifted her hands to heaven and the tears streamed from her eyes well sir said she faintly i see i cannot reach your conscience one question more and then i have done with you forever why in all these months that we have been alone and that you have shown me the nature i dont say of an honest man but of an angelyes papa of an angelwhy could you not show me one humble virtue sincerity it belongs to a man why could you not say i have committed one crime in my life but repented forever judge by this confession and by what you have seen of me whether i shall ever commit another take me as i am and esteem me as a penitent and more worthy man but i will not deceive you and pass for a paragon why could you not say as much as this to me if you loved me why deceive me so cruelly these words uttered no longer harshly but in a mournful faint despairing voice produced an effect the speaker little expected robert penfold made two attempts to speak but though he opened his mouth and his lips quivered he could get no word out he began to choke with emotion and though he shed no tears the convulsion that goes with weeping in weaker natures overpowered him in a way that was almost terrible confound it said general rolleston this is monstrous of you helen it is barbarous you are not like your poor mother she was pale and trembling and the tears flowing but she showed her native obstinacy she said hoarsely papa you are blind he must answer me he knows he must i must said robert penfold gasping still then he manned himself by a mighty effort and repeated with dignity i will there was a pause while the young man still struggled for composure and selfcommand was i not often on the point of telling you my sad story then is it fair to say that i should never have told it you but oh miss rolleston you dont know what agony it may be to an unfortunate man to tell the truth there are accusations so terrible so defiling that when a man has proved them false they still stick to him and soil him such an accusation i labor under and a judge and a jury have branded me if they had called me a murderer i would have told you but that is such a dirty crime i feared the prejudices of the world i dreaded to see your face alter to me yes i trembled and hesitated and asked myself whether a man is bound to repeat a foul slander against himself even when thirteen shallow men have said it and made the lie law there said general rolleston i thought how it would be helen you have tormented him into defending himself tooth and nail so now we shall have the old story he is innocent i never knew a convict that wasnt if he found a fool to listen to him i decline to hear another word you neednt excuse yourself for changing your name i excuse it and that is enough but the boat is waiting and we cant stay to hear you justify a felony i am not a felon i am a martyr chapter lii robert penfold drew himself up to his full height and uttered these strange words with a sad majesty that was very imposing but general rolleston steeled by experience of convicts their plausibility and their histrionic powers was staggered only for a moment he deigned no reply but told helen that captain moreland was waiting for her and she had better go on board at once she stood like a statue no papa ill not turn my back on him till i know whether he is a felon or a martyr my poor child has he caught you at once with a clever phrase a judge and a jury have settled that they settled it as you would settle it by refusing to hear me have i refused to hear you said helen what do i care for steamboats and captains if i stay here to all eternity ill know from your own lips and your own face whether you are a felon or a martyr it is no phrase papa he is a felon or a martyr and i am a most unfortunate girl or else a base disloyal one fiddledee said general rolleston angrily then looking at his watch i give you five minutes to humbug us inif you can robert penfold sighed patiently but from that moment he ignored general rolleston and looked to helen only and she fixed her eyes upon his face with a tenacity and an intensity of observation that surpassed anything he had ever seen in his life it dazzled him but it did not dismay him miss rolleston said he my history can be told in the time my prejudiced judge allows me i am a clergyman and a private tutor at oxford one of my pupils wasarthur wardlaw i took an interest in him because my father michael penfold was in wardlaws employ this arthur wardlaw had a talent for mimicry he mimicked one of the college officers publicly and offensively and was about to be expelled and that would have ruined his immediate prospects for his father is just but stern i fought hard for him and being myself popular with the authorities i got him off he was grateful or seemed to be and we became greater friends than ever we confided in each other he told me he was in debt in oxford and much alarmed lest it should reach his fathers ears and lose him the promised partnership i told him i was desirous to buy a small living near oxford which was then vacant but i had only saved pounds and the price was pounds i had no means of raising the balance then he said borrow pounds of my father give me fourteen hundred of it and take your own time to repay the pounds i shall be my fathers partner in a month or two said he you can pay us back by instalments i thought this very kind of him i did not want the living for myself but to give my dear father certain comforts and country air every week he needed it he was born in the country well i came to london about this business and a stranger called on me and said he came from mr arthur wardlaw who was not well enough to come himself he produced a note of hand for pounds signed john wardlaw and made me indorse it and told me where to get it cashed he would come next day for arthur wardlaws share of the money well i suspected no ill would you i went and got the note discounted and locked the money up it was not my money the greater part was arthur wardlaws that same evening a policeman called and asked several questions which of course i answered he then got me out of the house on some pretense and arrested me as a forger oh cried helen i forgot the clergyman i was a gentleman and a man insulted and i knocked the officer down directly but his myrmidons overpowered me i was tried at the central criminal court on two charges first the crown as they call the attorney that draws the indictment charged me with forging the note of hand and then with not forging it but passing it well knowing that somebody else had forged it well undercliff the expert swore positively that the forged note was not written by me and the crown as they call it was defeated on that charge but being proved a liar in a court of justice did not abash my accuser the second charge was pressed with equal confidence the note you are to understand was forgedthat admits of no doubt and i passed it the question was whether i passed it knowing it to be forged how was that to be determined and here it was that my own familiar friend in whom i trusted destroyed me of course as soon as i was put in prison i wrote and sent to arthur wardlaw would you believe it he would not come to me he would not even write then as the time drew near i feared he was a traitor i treated him like one i told my solicitor to drag him into court as my witness and make him tell the truth the clerk went down accordingly and found he kept his door always locked but the clerk outwitted him and served him with the subpoena in his bedroom before he could crawl under the bed but he baffled us at last he never appeared in the witnessbox and when my counsel asked the court to imprison him his father swore he could not come he was dying and all out of sympathy with me fine sympathy that closed the lips and concealed the truth one syllable of which would have saved his friend and benefactor from a calamity worse than death is the truth poison that to tell it makes a sick man die is the truth hell that a dying man refuses to speak it how can a man die better than speaking the truth how can he die worse than withholding it i believe his sickness and his death were lies like himself for want of one word from arthur wardlaw to explain that i had every reason to expect a note of hand from him the jury condemned me they were twelve honest but shallow meninvited to go inside another mans bosom and guess what was there they guessed that i knew and understood a thing which to this hour i neither know nor understand by god he paused a moment then resumed i believe they founded their conjecture on my knocking down the officer there was a reason for you why forgers and their confederates are reptiles and have no fight in them experience proves this but these twelve men did not go by experience they guessed like babies and after much hesitation condemned me but recommended me to mercy mercy what mercy did i deserve either i was innocent or hanging was too good for me no in their hearts they doubted my guilt and their doubt took that timid form instead of acquitting me i was amazed at the verdict and asked leave to tell the judge why arthur wardlaw had defied the court and absented himself as my witness had the judge listened for one minute he would have seen i was innocent but no i was in england where the mouth of the accused is stopped if he is fool enough to employ counsel the judge stopped my mouth as your father just now tried to stop it and they branded me as a felon up to that moment my life was honorable and worthy since that moment i have never wronged a human creature men pass from virtue to vice from vice to crime this is the ladder a soul goes down but you are invited to believe that i jumped from innocence into a filthy felony and then jumped back again none the worse and was a gardener that fought for his employer and a lover that controlled his passion it is a liea lie that ought not to take in a child but prejudice degrades a man below the level of a child ill say no more my patience is exhausted by wrongs and insults i am as honest a man as ever breathed and the place where we stand is mine for i made it leave it and me this moment go to england and leave me where the animals more reasonable than you have the sense to see my real character ill not sail in the same ship with any man nor any woman either who can look me in the face and take me for a felon he swelled and towered with the just wrath of an honest man driven to bay and his eye shot black lightning he was sublime helen cowered but her spirited old father turned red and said haughtily we take you at your word and leave you you insolent vagabond follow me this instant helen and he marched out of the cavern in a fury but instead of following him helen stood stockstill and cowered and cowered till she seemed sinking forward to the ground and she got hold of robert penfolds hand and kissed it and moaned over it martyr martyr she whispered and still kissed his hand like a slave offering her master pity and asking pardon martyr martyr every word is truetrue as my love in this attitude and with these words on her lips they were surprised by general rolleston who came back astonished at his daughter not following him judge of his amazement now what does this mean he cried turning pale with anger it means that he has spoken the truth and that i shall imitate him he is my martyr and my love when others cast shame on you then it is time for me to show my heart james seaton i love you for your madness and your devotion to her whom you had only seen at a distance ah that was love john hazel i love you for all that has passed between us what can any other man be to meor woman to you but most of all i love you robert penfoldmy hero and my martyr when i am told to your face that you are a felon then to your face i say you are my idol my hero and my martyr love the word is too tame too common i worship you i adore you how beautiful you are when you are angry how noble you are now you forgive me for you do forgive me robert you must you shall no you will not send your helen away from you for her one fault so soon repented show me you forgive me show me you love me still almost as much as i love you he is crying oh my darling my darling my darling and she was round his neck in a moment with tears and tender kisses the first she had ever given him ask yourself whether they were returned a groan or rather we might say a snort of fury interrupted the most blissful moment either of these young creatures had ever known it came from general rolleston now white with wrath and horror you villain he cried helen threw herself upon him and put her hand before his mouth not a word more or i shall forget i am your daughter no one is to blame but i i love him i made him love me he has been trying hard not to love me so much but i am a woman and could not deny myself the glory and the joy of being loved better than woman was ever loved before and so i am i am kill me if you like insult me if you will but not a word against him or i give him my hand and we live and die together on this island oh papa he has often saved that life you value so and i have saved his he is all the world to me have pity on your child have pity on him who carries my heart in his bosom she flung herself on her knees and strained him tight and implored him with head thrown back and little clutching hands and eloquent eyes ah it is hard to resist the voice and look and clinging of a mans own flesh and blood children are so strongupon their knees their dear faces bright copies of our own are just the height of our hearts then the old man was staggered was almost melted give me a moment to think said he in a broken voice this blow takes my breath away helen rose and laid her head upon her fathers shoulder and still pleaded for her love by her soft touch and her tears that now flowed freely he turned to penfold with all the dignity of age and station mr penfold said he with grave politeness after what my daughter has said i must treat you as a man of honor or i must insult her well then i expect you to show me you are what she thinks you and are not what a court of justice has proclaimed you sir this young lady is engaged with her own free will to a gentleman who is universally esteemed and has never been accused to his face of any unworthy act relying on her plighted word the wardlaws have fitted out a steamer and searched the pacific and found her can you as a man of honor advise her to stay here and compromise her own honor in every way ought she to break faith with her betrothed on account of vague accusations made behind his back it was only in selfdefense i accused mr arthur wardlaw said robert penfold general rolleston resumed you said just now there are accusations which soil a man if you were in my place would you let your daughter marry a man of honor who had unfortunately been found guilty of a felony robert groaned and hesitated but he said no then what is to be done she must either keep her plighted word or else break it for whom for a gentleman she esteems and loves but cannot marry a leper may be a saint but i would rather bury my child than marry her to a leper a convict may be a saint but ill kill her with my own hand sooner than she shall marry a convict and in your heart and conscience you cannot blame me were you a father you would do the same what then remains for her and me but to keep faith and what can you do better than leave her and carry away her everlasting esteem and her fathers gratitude it is no use being good by halves or bad by halves you must either be a selfish villain and urge her to abandon all shame and live here on this island with you forever or you must be a brave and honest man and bow to a parting that is inevitable consider sir your eloquence and her pity have betrayed this young lady into a confession that separates you her enforced residence here with you has been innocent it would be innocent no longer now she has been so mad as to own she loves you and i tell you frankly if after that confession you insist on going on board the steamer with her i must take you humanity requires it but if i do i shall hand you over to the law as a convict escaped before his time perhaps i ought to do so as it is but that is not certain i dont know to what country this island belongs i may have no right to capture you in strange dominions but an english ship is englandand if you set foot on the springbok you are lost now then you are a man of honor you love my child truly and not selfishlyyou have behaved nobly until today go one step farther on the right road call worldly honor and the god whose vows you have taken sir to your aid and do your duty oh man man cried robert penfold you ask more of me than flesh and blood can bear what shall i say what shall i do helen replied calmly take my hand and let us die together since we cannot live together with honor general rolleston groaned for this then i have traversed one ocean and searched another and found my child i am nothing to hernothing oh who would be a father he sat down oppressed with shame and grief and bowed his stately head in manly but pathetic silence oh papa papa cried helen forgive your ungrateful child and she kneeled and sobbed with her forehead on his knees then robert penfold in the midst of his own agony found room in that great suffering heart of his for pity he knelt down himself and prayed for help in this bitter trial he rose haggard with the struggle but languid and resigned like one whose deathwarrant has been read sir said he there is but one way you must take her home and i shall stay here leave you all alone on this island said helen never if you stay here i shall stay to comfort you i decline that offer i am beyond the reach of comfort think what you do robert said helen with unnatural calmness if you have no pity on yourself have pity on us would you rob me of the very life you have taken such pains to save my poor father will carry nothing to england but my dead body long before we reach that country i loved so well and now hate it for its stupidity and cruelty to you my soul will have flown back to this island to watch over you robert you bid me to abandon you to solitude and despair neither of you two love me half as much as i love you both general rolleston sighed deeply if i thought that said he then in a faint voice my own courage fails me now i look into my heart and i see that my childs life is dearer to me than all the world she was dying they say suppose i send moreland to the continent for a clergyman and marry you then you can live on this island forever only you must let me live here too for i could never show my face again in england after acting so dishonorably it will be a miserable end of a life passed in honor but i suppose it will not be for long shame can kill as quickly as disappointed love robert robert cried helen in agony the martyr saw that he was master of the situation and must be either base or very noblethere was no middle way he leaned his head on his hands and thought with all his might hush said helen he is wiser than we are let him speak if i thought you would pine and die upon the voyage no power should part us but you are not such a coward if my life depended on yours would you not live you know i would when i was wrecked on white water island you played the man not one woman in a thousand could have launched a boat and sailed it with a boathook for a mast and helen interrupted him it was nothing i loved you i love you better now i believe it and therefore i ask you to rise above your sex once more and play the man for me this time it is not my life you are to rescue but that which is more precious stillmy good name ah that would be worth living for cried helen you will find it very hard to do but not harder for a woman than to launch a boat and sail her without a mast see my father michael penfold see undercliff the expert see the solicitor the counsel sift the whole story and above all find out why arthur wardlaw dared not enter the witnessbox be obstinate as a man be supple as a woman and dont talk of dying when there is a friend to be rescued from dishonor by living and working die while i can rescue you from death or dishonor i will not be so base ah robert robert how well you know me yes i do know you helen i believe that great soul of yours will keep your body strong to do this brave work for him you love and who loves you and as for me i am man enough to live for years upon this island if you will only promise me two things i promise then never to die and never to marry arthur wardlaw until you have reversed that lying sentence which has blasted me lay your hand on your fathers head and promise me that helen laid her hand upon her fathers head and said i pledge my honor not to die if life is possible and never to marry any man until i have reversed that lying sentence which has blasted the angel i love and i pledge myself to help her said general rolleston warmly for now i know you are a man of honor i have too often been deceived by eloquence to listen much to that but now you have proved by your actions what you are you pass a forged check knowing it to be forged id stake my salvation its a lie theres my hand god comfort you god reward you my noble fellow i hope he will sir sobbed robert penfold you are her father and you take my hand perhaps that will be sweet to think of by and by but no joy can enter my heart now it is broken take her away at once sir flesh is weak my powers of endurance are exhausted general rolleston acted promptly on this advice he rolled up her rugs and the things she had made and robert had the courage to take them down to the boat then he came back and the general took her bag to the boat all this time the girl herself sat wringing her hands in anguish and not a tear it was beyond that now as he passed robert the general said take leave of her alone i will come for her in five minutes you see how sure i feel you are a man of honor when robert went in she rose and tottered to him and fell on his neck she saw it was the deathbed of their love and she kissed his eyes and clung to him they moaned over each other and clung to each other in mute despair the general came back and he and robert took helen shivering and fainting to the boat as the boat put off she awoke from her stupor and put out her hands to robert with one piercing cry they were parted chapter liii in that curious compound the human heart a respectable motive is sometimes connected with a criminal act and it was so with joseph wylie he had formed an attachment to nancy rouse and her price was two thousand pounds this nancy rouse was a character she was general rollestons servant for many years her place was the kitchen but she was a woman of such restless activity and so wanting in the proper pride of a servant that she would help a housemaid or a ladys maid or do anything almost except be idle to use her own words she was one as couldnt abide to sit mumchance that fatal foe to domestic industry the london journal fluttered in vain down her area for she could not read she supported a sick mother out of her wages aided by a few presents of money and clothes from helen rolleston who had a great regard for nancy and knew what a hard fight she had to keep a sick woman out of her twenty pounds a year in love nancy was unfortunate her buxom looks and sterling virtues were balanced by a provoking sagacity and an irritating habit of speaking her mind she humbled her lovers vanity one after another and they fled her heart smarted more than once nancy was ambitious and her first rise in life took place as follows when the rollestons went to australia she had a good cry at parting with helen but there was no help for it she could not leave her mother however she told helen she could not stomach any other service and since she must be parted was resolved to better herself this phrase is sometimes drolly applied by servants because they throw independence into the scale in nancys case it meant setting up as a washerwoman helen opened her hazel eyes with astonishment at this the first round in the ladder of nancys ambition however she gave her ten pounds and thirty introductions twentyfive of which missed fire and with the odd five nancy set up her tub in the suburbs and by her industry geniality and frugality got on tolerably well in due course she rented a small house backed by a small green and advertised for a gentleman lodger she soon got one and soon got rid of him however she was never long without one nancy met joseph wylie in company and as sailors are brisk wooers he soon became her acknowledged suitor and made some inroad into her heart though she kept on the defensive warned by past experience wylies lovemaking had a droll feature about it it was most of it carried on in the presence of three washerwomen because nancy had no time to spare from her work and wylie had no time to lose in his wooing being on shore for a limited period and this absence of superfluous delicacy on his part gave him an unfair advantage over the tallowchandlers foreman his only rival at present many a sly thrust and many a hearty laugh from his female auditors greeted his amorous eloquence but for all that they sided with him and nancy felt her importance and brightened along with her mates at the sailors approach which was generally announced by a cheerful hail he was good company to use nancys own phrase and she accepted him as a sweetheart on probation but when mr wylie urged her to marry him she demurred and gave a string of reasons all of which the sailor and his allies the subordinate washerwomen combated in full conclave then she spoke out my lad the washtub is a saddle as wont carry double ive seen poverty enough in my mothers house it shant come in at my door to drive love out o window two comes together with just enough for two next year instead of two they are three and one of the three cant work and wants a servant extra and by and by there is half a dozen and the money coming in at the spigot and going out at the bunghole one day in the middle of his wooing she laid down her iron and said you come along with me and i wonder how much work will be done while my back is turned for you three gabbling and wondering what ever im a going to do with this here sailor she took wylie a few yards down the street and showed him a large house with most of the windows broken there said she theres a sight for a seafaring man thats in chancery well its better to be there than in h said wylie meaning to be sharper wait till youve tried em both said nancy then she took him to the back of the house and showed him a large garden attached to it now joseph said she ive showed you a lodginghouse and a dryingground and im a cook and a clearstarcher and im wild to keep lodgers and do for em washing and all then if their foul linen goes out they follows it the same if they has their meat from the cookshop four hundred pounds a year lies there a waiting for me ive been at them often to let me them premises but they says no we have got no horder from the court to let which the court would rather see em go to rack an ruin for nothing than let em to an honest woman as would pay the rent punctual and make her penny out of em and nobody none the worse and to sell them the price is two thousand pounds and if i had it id give it this minit but where are the likes of you and me to get two thousand pounds but the lawyer he says miss rouse from you one thousand down and the rest on mortgige at fortyfive pounds the year which it is dirt cheap i say so now my man when that house is mine im yours im putting by for it o my side if you means all you say why not save a bit o yours once i get that house and garden you neednt go to sea no more nor you shant if i am to be bothered with a man let me know where to put my finger on him at all hours and not lie shivering and shaking at every window as creaks and him out at sea and if you are too proud to drive the linen in a light cart why i could pay a man in short she told him plainly she would not marry till she was above the world and the road to above the world was through that great battered house and seedy garden in chancery now it may appear a strange coincidence that nancys price to wylie was two thousand pounds and wylies to wardlaw was two thousand pounds but the fact is it was a forced coincidence wylie bargaining with wardlaw stood out for two thousand pounds because that was the price of the house and garden and nancy now when wylie returned to england safe after his crime and his perils he comforted himself with the reflection that nancy would have her house and garden and he should have nancy but young wardlaw lay on his sick bed his father was about to return to the office and the gold disguised as copper was ordered up to the cellars in fenchurch street there in all probability the contents would be examined ere long the fraud exposed and other unpleasant consequences might follow over and above the loss of the promised pounds wylie felt very disconsolate and went down to nancy rouse depressed in spirits to his surprise she received him with more affection than ever and reading his face in a moment told him not to fret it will be so in your way of life said this homely comforter your sort comes home emptyhanded one day and money in both pockets the next im glad to see you home at all for ive been in care about you youre very welcome joe if you are come home honest and sober why that is the next best thing to coming home rich wylie hung his head and pondered these words and well he might for he had not come home either so sober or so honest as he went out but quite as poor however his elastic spirits soon revived in nancys sunshine and he became more in love with her than ever but when presuming upon her affection he urged her to marry him and trust to providence she laughed in his face trust to himprovidence you mean said she no no joseph if you are unlucky i must be lucky before you and me can come together then wylie resolved to have his pounds at all risks he had one great advantage over a landsman who has committed a crime he could always go to sea and find employment first in one ship and then in another terra firma was not one of the necessaries of life to him he came to wardlaws office to feel his way and talked guardedly to michael penfold about the loss of the proserpine his apparent object was to give information his real object was to gather it he learned that old wardlaw was very much occupied with fitting out a steamer that the forty chests of copper had actually come up from the shannon and were under their feet at that moment and that young wardlaw was desperately ill and never came to the office michael had not at that time learned the true cause of young wardlaws illness yet wylie detected that young wardlaws continued absence from the office gave michael singular uneasiness the old man fidgeted and washed the air with his hands and with simple cunning urged wylie to go and see him about the proserpine and get him to the office if it was only for an hour or two tell him we are all at sixes and sevens mr wylie all at sixes and sevens well said wylie affecting a desire to oblige give me a line to him for ive been twice and could never get in michael wrote an earnest line to say that wardlaw senior had been hitherto much occupied in fitting out the springbok but that he was going into the books next week what was to be done the note was received but arthur declined to see the bearer then wylie told the servant it was joseph wylie on a matter of life and death tell him i must stand on the staircase and hallo it out if he wont hear it any other way this threat obtained his admission to arthur wardlaw the sailor found him on a sofa in a darkened room pale and worn to a shadow mr wardlaw said wylie firmly you mustnt think i dont feel for you but sir we are gone too far to stop you and me there is two sides to this business it is pounds for you and pounds for me or it is what do i care for money now groaned wardlaw let it all go to the devil who tempted me to destroy her i loved better than money better than all the world well but hear me out said wylie i say it is pounds to you and pounds to me or else it is twenty years penal servitude to both on us penal servitude and the words roused the merchant from his lethargy like a showerbath you know that well enough said wylie why twas a hanging matter a few years ago come come there are no two ways you must be a man or we are undone fear prevailed in that timorous breast which even love of money had failed to rouse wardlaw sat up staring wildly and asked wylie what he was to do first let me ring for a bottle of that old brandy of yours the brandy was got wylie induced him to drink a wineglassful neat and then to sit at the table and examine the sailors declaration and the logs im no great scholard said he i warnt a going to lay these before the underwriters till you had overhauled them there take another drop nowtwill do you goodwhile i draw up this thundering blind thus encouraged and urged the brokenhearted schemer languidly compared the seamens declaration with the logs and even in his feeble state of mind and body made an awkward discovery at once why they dont correspond said he what dont correspond your mens statement and the ships log the men speak of one heavy gale after another in january and the pumps going but the log says a puff of wind from the ne and here again the entry exposes your exaggeration one branch of our evidence contradicts the other this comes of trying to prove too much you must say the log was lost went down with the ship how can i cried wylie i have told too many i had got it safe at home why did you say that what madness why were you away from your office at such a time how can i know everything and do everything i counted on you for the headwork ashore cant ye think of any way to square the log to that part of our tale might paste in a leaf or two eh that would be discovered at once you have committed an irremediable error what broad strokes this hudson makes he must have written with the stump of a quill wylie received this last observation with a look of contempt for the mind that could put so trivial a question in so great an emergency are you quite sure poor hudson is dead asked wardlaw in a low voice dead dont i tell you i saw him die said wylie trembling all of a sudden he took a glass of brandy and sent it flying down his throat leave the paper with me said arthur languidly and tell penfold ill crawl to the office tomorrow you can meet me there i shall see nobody else wylie called next day at the office and was received by penfold who had now learned the cause of arthurs grief and ushered the visitor in to him with looks of benevolent concern arthur was seated like a lunatic pale and motionless on the table before him was a roast fowl and a salad which he had forgotten to eat his mind appeared to alternate between love and fraud for as soon as he saw wylie he gave himself a sort of shake and handed wylie the log and the papers examine them they agree better with each other now wylie examined the log and started with surprise and superstitious terror why hirams ghost has been here at work said he it is his very handwriting hush said wardlaw not so loud will it do the writing will do firstrate but any one can see this log has never been to sea inspired by the others ingenuity he then after a moments reflection emptied the saltcellar into a plate and poured a little water over it he wetted the leaves of the log with this salt water and dogseared the whole book wardlaw sighed see what expedients we are driven to said he he then took a little soot from the chimney and mixed it with salad oil he applied some of this mixture to the parchment cover rubbed it off and by such manipulation gave it a certain mellow look as if it had been used by working hands wylie was armed with these materials and furnished with money to keep his sailors to their tale in case of their being examined arthur begged in his present affliction to be excused from going personally into the matter of the proserpine and said that penfold had the ships log and the declaration of the survivors which the insurers could inspect previously to their being deposited at lloyds the whole thing wore an excellent face and nobody found a peg to hang suspicion on so far after this preliminary and the deposit of the papers nothing was hurried the merchant absorbed in his grief seemed to be forgetting to ask for his money wylie remonstrated but arthur convinced him they were still on too ticklish ground to show any hurry without exciting suspicion and so passed two weary months during which wylie fell out of nancy rouses good graces for idling about doing nothing be you a waiting for the plum to fall into your mouth young man said she the demand was made on the underwriters and arthur contrived that it should come from his father the firm was of excellent repute and had paid hundreds of insurances without a loss to the underwriters the proserpine had foundered at sea several lives had been lost and of the survivors one had since died owing to the hardships he had endured all this betokened a genuine calamity nevertheless one ray of suspicion rested on the case at first the captain of the proserpine had lost a great many ships and on the first announcement one or two were resolved to sift the matter on that ground alone but when five eyewitnesses suppressing all mention of the word drink declared that captain hudson had refused to leave the vessel and described his going down with the ship from an obstinate and too exalted sense of duty every chink was closed and to cut the matter short the insurance money was paid to the last shilling and benson one of the small underwriters ruined nancy rouse who worked for mrs benson lost eighteen shillings and sixpence and was dreadfully put out about it wylie heard her lamentations and grinned for now his pounds was as good as in his pocket he thought great was his consternation when arthur told him that every shilling of the money was forestalled and that the entire profit of the transaction was yet to come viz by the sale of the gold dust then sell it said wylie i dare not the affair must cool down before i can appear as a seller of gold and even then i must dribble it out with great caution thank heaven it is no longer in those cellars where is it then that is my secret you will get your two thousand all in good time and if it makes you onetenth part as wretched as it has made me you will thank me for all these delays at last wylie lost all patience and began to show his teeth and then arthur wardlaw paid him his two thousand pounds in forty crisp notes he crammed them into a side pocket and went down triumphant to nancy rouse through her parlor window he saw the benign countenance of michael penfold he then remembered that penfold had told him some time before that he was going to lodge with her as soon as the present lodger should go this however rather interrupted wylies design of walking in and chucking the two thousand pounds into nancys lap on the contrary he shoved them deeper down in his pocket and resolved to see the old gentleman to bed and then produce his pelf and fix the weddingday with nancy he came in and found her crying and penfold making weak efforts to console her the teathings were on the table and nancy s cup half emptied wylie came in and said why what is the matter now he said this mighty cheerfully as one who carried the panacea for all ills in his pocket and a medicine peculiarly suited to nancy rouses constitution but he had not quite fathomed her yet as soon as ever she saw him she wiped her eyes and asked him grimly what he wanted there wylie stared at the reception but replied stoutly that it was pretty well known by this time what he wanted in that quarter well then said nancy want will be your master why did you never tell me miss helen was in that ship my sweet dear mistress as was that i feel for like a mother you left her to drown and saved your own great useless carcass and drowned she is poor dear get out o my sight do it wasnt my fault nancy said wylie earnestly i didnt know who she was and i advised her to come with us but she would go with that parson chap what parson chap what a liar you be she is wardlaws sweetheart and dont care for no parsons if you didnt know you was to blame why didnt you tell me a word of your own accord you kep dark do you call yourself a man to leave my poor young lady to shift for herself she had as good a chance to live as i had said wylie sullenly no she hadnt you took care o yourself well since you are so fond of yourself keep yourself to yourself and dont come here no more after this i hate the sight on ye you are like the black dog in my eyes and always will be poor dear miss helen ah i cried when she leftmy mind misgave me but little i thought she would perish in the salt seas and all for want of a man in the ship if you had gone out again after in the steamboatmr penfold have told me all about itid believe you werent so much to blame but no lolloping and looking about all day for months theres my door joe wylie i cant cry comfortable before you as had a hand in drowning of her you and me is parted forever ill die as i am or ill marry a man which you aint one nor nothing like one is he waiting for you to hold the door open mr penfold or dont i speak plain enough them as i gave the sack to afore you didnt want so much telling well im going said wylie sullenly then with considerable feeling this is hard lines but nancy was inexorable and turned him out with the pounds in his pocket he took the notes out of his pocket and flung them furiously down in the dirt then he did what everybody does under similar circumstances he picked them up again and pocketed them along with the other dirt they had gathered next day he went down to the docks and looked out for a ship he soon got one and signed as second mate she was to sail in a fortnight but before a week was out the banknotes had told so upon him that he was no longer game to go to sea but the captain he had signed with was a tartar and not to be trifled with he consulted a knowing friend and that friend advised him to disguise himself till the ship had sailed accordingly he rigged himself out with a long coat and a beard and spectacles and hid his seaslouch as well as he could and changed his lodgings finding he succeeded so well he thought he might as well have the pleasure of looking at nancy rouse if he could not talk to her so he actually had the hardihood to take the parlor next door and by this means he heard her move about in her room and caught a sight of her at work on her little green and he was shrewd enough to observe she did not sing and whistle as she used to do the dog chuckled at that his banknotes worried him night and day he was afraid to put them in a bank afraid to take them about with him into his haunts afraid to leave them at home and out of this his perplexity arose some incidents worth relating in their proper order arthur wardlaw returned to business but he was a changed man all zest in the thing was gone his fraud set him above the world and that was now enough for him in whom ambition was dead and indeed nothing left alive in him but deep regrets he drew in the horns of speculation and went on in the old safe routine and to the restless activity that had jeopardized the firm succeeded a strange torpidity he wore black for helen and sorrowed without hope he felt he had offended heaven and had met his punishment in helens death wardlaw senior retired to elmtrees and seldom saw his son when they did meet the old man sometimes whispered hope but the whisper was faint and unheeded one day wardlaw senior came up express to communicate to arthur a letter from general rolleston written at valparaiso in this letter general rolleston deplored his unsuccessful search but said he was going westward upon the report of a dutch whaler who had seen an island reflected in the sky while sailing between juan fernandez and norfolk isle arthur only shook his head with a ghastly smile she is in heaven said he and i shall never see her again not here or hereafter wardlaw senior was shocked at this speech but he made no reply he pitied his son too much to criticise the expressions into which his bitter grief betrayed him he was old and had seen the triumphs of time over all things human sorrow included these however as yet had done nothing for arthur wardlaw at the end of six months his grief was as somber and as deadly as the first week but one day as this pale figure in deep mourning sat at his table going listlessly and mechanically through the business of scraping money together for others to enjoy whose hearts unlike his might not be in the grave his father burst in upon him with a telegram in his hand and waved it over his head in triumph she is found she is found he roared read that and thrust the telegram into his hands those hands trembled and the languid voice rose into shrieks of astonishment and delight as arthur read the words we have got her alive and well shall be at charing cross hotel p m chapter liv while the boat was going to the springbok general rolleston whispered to captain moreland and what he said may be almost guessed from what occurred on board the steamer soon afterward helen was carried trembling into the cabin and the order was given to heave the anchor and get under way a groan of disappointment ran through the ship captain moreland expressed the generals regret to the men and divided two hundred pounds upon the capstan and the groan ended in a cheer as for helens condition that was at first mistaken for ill health she buried herself for two whole days in her cabin and from that place faint moans were heard now and then the sailors called her the sick lady heaven knows what she went through in that fortyeight hours she came upon deck at last in a strange state of mind and body restless strung up absorbed the rare vigor she had acquired on the island came out now with a vengeance she walked the deck with briskness and a pertinacity that awakened admiration in the crew at first but by and by superstitious awe for while the untiring feet went briskly to and fro over leagues and leagues of plank every day the great hazel eyes were turned inward and the mind absorbed with one idea skimmed the men and things about her listlessly she had a mission to fulfill and her whole nature was stringing itself up to do the work she walked so many miles a day partly from excitement partly with a deliberate resolve to cherish her health and strength i may want them both said she to clear robert penfold thought and high purpose shone through her so that after a while nobody dared trouble her much with commonplaces to her father she was always sweet and filial but sadly cold compared with what she had always been hitherto he was taking her body to england but her heart stayed behind upon that island he saw this and said it forgive me said she coldly and that was all her reply sometimes she had violent passions of weeping and then he would endeavor to console her but in vain they ran their course and were succeeded by the bodily activity and concentration of purpose they had interrupted for a little while at last after a rapid voyage they drew near the english coast and then general rolleston who had hitherto spared her feelings and been most indulgent and considerate felt it was high time to come to an understanding with her as to the course they should both pursue now helen said he about the wardlaws helen gave a slight shudder but she said after a slight hesitation let me know your wishes oh mine are not to be too ungrateful to the father and not to deceive the son i will not be ungrateful to the father nor deceive the son said helen firmly the general kissed her on the brow and called her his brave girl but said he on the other hand it must not be published that you have been for eight months on an island alone with a convict anything sooner than that you know the malice of your own sex if one woman gets hold of that you will be an outcast from society helen blushed and trembled nobody need be told that but arthur and i am sure he loves me well enough not to injure me with the world but he would be justified in declining your hand after such a revelation quite and i hope he will decline it when he knows i love another however hopelessly you are going to tell arthur wardlaw all that i am then all i can say is you are not like other women i have been brought up by a man if i was arthur wardlaw it would be the last word you should ever speak to me if you were arthur wardlaw i should be on that dear island now well suppose his love should be greater than his spirit and if he does not go back when he hears of my hopeless love i dont see how i can i shall marry him and try with all my soul to love him ill open every door in london to robert penfold except one my husbands and that door while i live he shall never enter oh my heart my heart she burst out sobbing desperately and her father laid her head upon his bosom and sighed deeply and asked himself how all this would end before they landed her fortitude seemed to return and of her own accord she begged her father to telegraph to the wardlaws would you not like a day to compose yourself and prepare for this trying interview said he i should but it is mere weakness and i must cure myself of my weakness or i shall never clear robert penfold and then papa i think of you if old mr wardlaw heard you had been a day in town you might suffer in his good opinion we shall be in london at seven ask them at eight that will be one hours respite god help me and strengthen poor arthur to bear the blow i bring him long before eight oclock that day arthur wardlaw had passed from a state of somber misery and remorse to one of joy exultation and unmixed happiness he no longer regretted his crime nor the loss of the proserpine helen was alive and well and attributed not her danger but only her preservation to the wardlaws wardlaw senior kept his carriage in town and precisely at eight oclock they drove up to the door of the hotel they followed the servant with bounding hearts and rushed into the room where the general and helen stood ready to receive them old wardlaw went to the general with both hands out and so the general met him and between these two it was almost an embrace arthur ran to helen with cries of joy and admiration and kissed her hands again and again and shed such genuine tears of joy over them that she trembled all over and was obliged to sit down he kneeled at her feet and still imprisoned one hand and mumbled it while she turned her head away and held her other hand before her face to hide its real expression which was a mixture of pity and repugnance but as her face was hidden and her eloquent body quivered and her hand was not withdrawn it seemed a sweet picture of feminine affection to those who had not the key at last she was relieved from a most embarrassing situation by old wardlaw he cried out on this monopoly and helen instantly darted out of her chair and went to him and put up her cheek to him which he kissed and then she thanked him warmly for his courage in not despairing of her life and his goodness in sending out a ship for her now the fact is she could not feel grateful but she knew she ought to be grateful and she was ashamed to show no feeling at all in return for so much so she was eloquent and the old gentleman was naturally very much pleased at first but he caught an expression of pain on arthurs face and then he stopped her my dear said he you ought to thank arthur not me it is his love for you which was the cause of my zeal if you owe me anything pay it to him for he deserves it best he nearly died for you my sweet girl no no you mustnt hang your head for that neither what a fool i am to revive old sorrows here we are the happiest four in england then he whispered to her be kind to poor arthur that is all i ask his very life depends on you helen obeyed this order and went slowly back to arthur she sat cold as ice on the sofa beside him and he made love to her she scarcely heard what he said she was asking herself how she could end this intolerable interview and escape her fathers looks who knew the real state of her heart at last she rose and went and whispered to him my courage has failed me have pity on me and get me away it is the old man he kills me general rolleston took the hint and acted with more tact than one would have given him credit for he got up and rang the bell for tea then he said to helen you dont drink tea now and i see you are excited more than is good for you you had better go to bed yes papa said helen she took her candle and as she passed young wardlaw she told him in a low voice she would be glad to speak to him alone tomorrow at what hour said he eagerly when you like at one and so she retired leaving him in ecstasies this was the first downright assignation she had ever made with him they met at one oclock he radiant as the sun and a rose in his buttonhole she sad and somber and with her very skin twitching at the thought of the explanation she had to go through he began with amorous commonplaces she stopped him gravely arthur said she you and i are alone now and i have a confession to make unfortunately i must cause you painterrible pain oh my heart flinches at the wound i am going to give you but it is my fate either to wound you or to deceive you during this preamble arthur sat amazed rather than alarmed he did not interrupt her though she paused and would gladly have been interrupted since an interruption is an assistance in perplexities arthur we suffered great hardships on the boat and you would have lost me but for one person he saved my life again and again i saved his upon the island my constancy was subject to trialsoh such trials so great an example of every manly virtue forever before my eyes my gratitude and my pity eternally pleading england and you seemed gone forever make excuses for me if you can arthurii have formed an attachment in making this strange avowal she hung her head and blushed and the tears ran down her cheeks but we suspect they ran for him and not for arthur arthur turned deadly sick at this tremendous blow dealt with so soft a hand at last he gasped out if you marry him you will bury me no arthur said helen gently i could not marry him even if you were to permit me when you know more you will see that of us three unhappy ones you are the least unhappy but since this is so am i wrong to tell you the truth and leave you to decide whether our engagement ought to continue of course what i have owned to you releases you releases me but it does not unbind my heart from yours cried arthur in despair then his hysterical nature came out and he was so near fainting away that helen sprinkled water on his temples and applied eaudecologne to his nostrils and murmured poor poor arthur oh was i born only to afflict those i esteem he saw her with the tears of pity in her eyes and he caught her hand and said you were always the soul of honor keep faith with me and i will cure you of that unhappy attachment what do you hold me to my engagement after what i have told you cruel helen you know i have not the power to hold you i am not cruel and you have the power but oh think for your own sake not mine i have thought and this attachment to a man you cannot marry is a mere misfortuneyours as well as mine give me your esteem until your love comes back and let our engagement continue it was for you to decide said helen coldly and you have decided there is one condition i must ask you to submit to i submit to it what before you hear it helen you dont know what a year of misery i have endured ever since the report came of your death my happiness is cruelly dashed now but still it is great happiness by comparison make your conditions you are my queen as well as my love and my life helen hesitated it shocked her delicacy to lower the man she had consented to marry oh helen said arthur anything but secrets between you and me go on as you have begun and let me know the worst at once can you be very generous arthurgenerous to him who has caused you so much pain ill try said arthur with a groan i would not marry him unless you gave me up for i am your betrothed and you are true to me i could not marry him even if i were not pledged to you but it so happens i can do him one great service without injustice to you and this service i have vowed to do before i marry i shall keep that vow as i keep faith with you he has been driven from society by a foul slander that slander i am to sift and confute it will be long and difficult but i shall do it and you could help me if you chose but that i will not be so cruel as to ask arthur bit his lip with jealous rage but he was naturally cunning and his cunning showed him there was at present but one road to helens heart he quelled his torture as well as he could and resolved to take that road he reflected a moment and then he said if you succeed in that will you marry me next day i will upon my honor then i will help you arthur think what you say women have loved as unselfishly as this but no man that ever i heard of no man ever did love a woman as i love you yes i would rather help you though with a sore heart than hold aloof from you what have we to do together did i not tell youto clear his character of a foul stigma and restore him to england and to the world which he is so fitted to adorn yes yes said arthur but who is it why do i ask though he must be a stranger to me no stranger at all said helen but one who is almost as unjust to you as the world has been to him then fixing her eyes full on him she said arthur it is your old friend and tutor robert penfold chapter lv arthur wardlaw was thunderstruck and for some time sat stupidly staring at her and to this blank gaze succeeded a look of abject terror which seemed to her strange and beyond the occasion but this was not all for after glaring at her with scared eyes and ashy cheeks a moment or two he got up and literally staggered out of the room without a word he had been taken by surprise and for once all his arts had failed him helen whose eyes had never left his face and had followed his retiring figure was frightened at the weight of the blow she had struck and strange thoughts and conjectures filled her mind hitherto she had felt sure robert penfold was under a delusion as to arthur wardlaw and that his suspicions were as unjust as they certainly were vague yet now at the name of robert penfold arthur turned pale and fled like a guilty thing this was a coincidence that confirmed her good opinion of robert penfold and gave her ugly thoughts of arthur still she was one very slow to condemn a friend and too generous and candid to condemn on suspicion so she resolved as far as possible to suspend her unfavorable judgment of arthur until she should have asked him why this great emotion and heard his reply moreover she was no female detective but a pure creature bent on clearing innocence the object of her life was not to discover the faults of arthur wardlaw or any other person but to clear robert penfold of a crime yet arthurs strange behavior was a great shock to her for here at the very outset he had somehow made her feel she must hope for no assistance from him she sighed at this check and asked herself to whom she should apply first for aid robert had told her to see his counsel his solicitor his father and mr undercliff an expert and to sift the whole matter not knowing exactly where to begin she thought she would after all wait a day or two to give arthur time to recover himself and decide calmly whether he would cooperate with her or not in this trying interval she set up a diaryfor the first time in her life for she was no egotist and she noted down what we have just related only in a very condensed form and wrote at the margin mysterious arthur never came near her for two whole days this looked grave on the third day she said to general rolleston papa you will help me in the good causewill you not he replied that he would do what he could but feared that would be little will you take me down to elmtrees this morning with all my heart he took her down to elmtrees on the way she said papa you must let me get a word with mr wardlaw alone oh certainly but of course you will not say a word to hurt his feelings oh papa excuse me but when a person of your age is absorbed with one idea she sometimes forgets that other people have any feelings at all helen kissed him meekly and said that was too true and she would be upon her guard to general rollestons surprise his daughter no sooner saw old wardlaw than she wentor seemed to gointo high spirits and was infinitely agreeable but at last she got him all to herself and then she turned suddenly grave and said mr wardlaw i want to ask you a question it is something about robert penfold wardlaw shook his head that is a painful subject my dear but what do you wish to know about that unhappy young man can you tell me the name of the counsel who defended him at the trial no indeed i cannot but perhaps you can tell me where i could learn that his father is in our office still no doubt he could tell you now for obvious reasons helen did not like to go to the office so she asked faintly if there was nobody else who could tell her i suppose the solicitor could but i dont know who was the solicitor said helen with a sigh hum said the merchant try the billbroker ill give you his address and he wrote it down for her helen did not like to be too importunate and she could not bear to let wardlaw senior know she loved anybody better than his son and yet some explanation was necessary so she told him as calmly as she could that her father and herself were both well acquainted with robert penfold and knew many things to his credit i am glad to hear that said wardlaw and i can believe it he bore an excellent character here till in an evil hour a strong temptation came and he fell what you think he was guilty i do arthur i believe has his doubts still but he is naturally prejudiced in his friends favor and besides he was not at the trial i was thank you mr wardlaw said helen coldly and within five minutes she was on her way home arthur prejudiced in robert penfolds favor that puzzled her extremely she put down the whole conversation while her memory was fresh she added this comment what darkness i am groping in next day she went to the billbroker and told him mr wardlaw senior had referred her to him for certain information wardlaws name was evidently a passport mr adams said obsequiously anything in the world i can do madam it is about mr robert penfold i wish to know the name of the counsel he had at his trial robert penfold what the forger he was accused of that crime said helen turning red accused madam he was convicted i ought to know for it was my partner he tried the game on but i was too sharp for him i had him arrested before he had time to melt the notes indicted him and sent him across the herring pond in spite of his parsons coat the rascal helen drew back as if a serpent had stung her it was you who had him transported cried she turning her eyes on him with horror of course it was me said mr adams firing up and i did the country good service i look upon a forger as worse than a murderer what is the matter you are ill the poor girl was half fainting at the sight of the man who had destroyed her robert and owned it no no she cried hastily let me get awaylet me get away from hereyou cruel cruel man she tottered to the door and got to her carriage she scarcely knew how without the information she went for the billbroker was no fool he saw now how the land lay he followed her down the stairs and tried to stammer excuses charing cross hotel said she faintly and laid her face against the cushion to avoid the sight of him when she got home she cried bitterly at her feminine weakness and her incapacity and she entered this pitiable failure in her journal with a severity our male readers will hardly we think be disposed to imitate and she added by way of comment is this how i carry out my poor roberts precept be obstinate as a man be supple as a woman that night she consulted her father on this difficulty so slight to any but an inexperienced girl he told her there must be a report of the trial in the newspapers and the report would probably mention the counsel she had better consult a file then the thing was where to find a file after one or two failures the british museum was suggested she went thither and could not get in to read without certain formalities while these were being complied with she was at a standstill that same evening came a line from arthur wardlaw dearest heleni hear from mr adams that you desire to know the name of the counsel who defended robert penfold it was mr tollemache he has chambers in lincolns inn ever devotedly yours arthur wardlaw helen was touched with this letter and put it away indorsed with a few words of gratitude and esteem and copied it into her diary and remarked this is one more warning not to judge hastily arthurs agitation was probably only great emotion at the sudden mention of one whose innocence he believes and whose sad fate distresses him she wrote back and thanked him sweetly and in terms that encouraged a visit next day she went to mr tollemache a seedy man followed her at a distance mr tollemache was not at his chambers nor expected till four oclock he was in court she left her card and wrote on it in pencil that she would call at four she went at ten minutes after four mr tollemache declined through his clerk to see her if she was a client he could only be approached by her solicitor she felt inclined to go away and cry but this time she remembered she was to be obstinate as a man and supple as a woman she wrote on a card i am not a client of mr tollemache but a lady deeply interested in obtaining some information which mr tollemache can with perfect propriety give me i trust to his courtesy as a gentleman not to refuse me a short interview admit the lady said a sharp little voice she was ushered in and found mr tollemache standing before the fire now madam what can i do for you some years ago you defended mr robert penfold he was accused of forgery oh was he i think i remember something about it a bankers clerkwasnt he oh no sir a clergyman a clergyman i remember it perfectly he was convicted do you think he was guilty sir there was a strong case against him i wish to sift that case indeed and you want to go through the papers what papers sir the brief for the defense yes said helen boldly would you trust me with that sir oh if you knew how deeply i am interested the tears were in her lovely eyes the brief has gone back to the solicitor of course i dare say he will let you read it upon a proper representation thank you sir will you tell me who is the solicitor and where he lives oh i cant remember who was the solicitor that is the very first thing you ought to have ascertained it was no use coming to me forgive me for troubling you sir said helen with a deep sigh not at all madam i am only sorry i cannot be of more service but do let me advise you to employ your solicitor to make these preliminary inquiries happy to consult with him and reopen the matter should he discover any fresh evidence he bowed her out and sat down to a brief while she was yet in sight she turned away heartsick the advice she had received was good but she shrank from baring her heart to her fathers solicitor she sat disconsolate awhile then ordered another cab and drove to wardlaws office it was late and arthur was gone home so indeed was everybody except one young subordinate who was putting up the shutters sir said she can you tell me where old mr penfold lives somewhere in the subbubs miss yes sir but where i think it is out pimlico way could you not give me the street i would beg you to accept a present if you could this sharpened the young gentlemans wits he went in and groped here and there till he found the address and gave it her no fairfield cottages primrose lane pimlico she gave him a sovereign to his infinite surprise and delight and told the cabman to drive to the hotel the next moment the man who had followed her was chatting familiarly with the subordinate and helping him to put up the shutters i say dick said the youngster penfolds is up in the market a duchess was here just now and gave me a soy to tell her where he lived wait a moment till i spit on it for luck the agent however did not wait to witness that interesting ceremony he went back to his hansom round the corner and drove at once to arthur wardlaws house with the information helen noted down michael penfolds address in her diary and would have gone to him that evening but she was to dine teteatete with her father next day she went down to fairfield cottages at half past four on the way her heart palpitated for this was a very important interview here at least she might hope to find some clew by following out which she would sooner or later establish roberts innocence but then came a fearful thought why had not his father done this already if it was possible to do it his father must love him his father must have heard his own story and tested it in every way yet his father remained the servant of a firm the senior partner of which had told her to her face robert was guilty it was a strange and terrible enigma yet she clung to the belief that some new light would come to her from michael penfold then came bashful fears how should she account to mr penfold for the interest she took in his own son she who was affianced to mr penfolds employer she arrived at fairfield cottages with her cheeks burning and repeating to herself now is the time to be supple as a woman but obstinate as a man she sent the cabman in to inquire for mr penfold a sharp girl of about thirteen came out to her and told her mr penfold was not at home can you tell me when he will be at home no miss he have gone to scotland a telegraphum came from wardlaws last night as he was to go to scotland first thing this morning and he went at six oclock oh dear how unfortunate who shall i say called miss thank you i will write what time did the telegram come between five and six last evening miss she returned to the hotel fate seemed to be against her baffled at the very threshold at the hotel she found arthur wardlaws card and a beautiful bouquet she sat down directly and wrote to him affectionately and asked him in the postscript if he could send her a report of the trial she received a reply directly that he had inquired in the office for one of the clerks had reports of it but this clerk was unfortunately out and had locked up his desk helen sighed her feet seemed to be clogged at every step in this inquiry next morning however a large envelope came for her and a mr hand wrote to her thus madamhaving been requested by mr arthur wardlaw to send you my extracts of a trial the queen v penfold i herewith forward the same and would feel obliged by your returning them at your convenience your obedient servant james hand helen took the inclosed extracts to her bedroom and there read them both over many times in both these reports the case for the crown was neat clear cogent straightforward and supported by evidence the defense was chiefly argument of counsel to prove the improbability of a clergyman and a man of good character passing a forged note one of the reports stated that mr arthur wardlaw a son of the principal witness had taken the accusation so much to heart that he was now dangerously ill at oxford the other report did not contain this but on the other hand it stated that the prisoner after conviction had endeavored to lay the blame on mr arthur wardlaw but that the judge had stopped him and said he could only aggravate his offense by endeavoring to cast a slur upon the wardlaws who had both shown a manifest desire to shield him but were powerless for want of evidence in both reports the summing up of the judge was moderate in expression but leaned against the prisoner on every point and corrected the sophistical reasoning of his counsel very sensibly both reports said an expert was called for the prisoner whose ingenuity made the court smile but did not counterbalance the evidence helen sat cold as ice with the extracts in her hand not that her sublime faith was shaken but that poor robert appeared to have been so calmly and fairly dealt with by everybody even mr hennessy the counsel for the crown had opened the case with humane regret and confined himself to facts and said nobody would be more pleased than he would if this evidence could be contradicted or explained in a manner consistent with the prisoners innocence what a stone she had undertaken to rollup what a hill what was to be her next step go to the museum which was now open to her and read more reports she shrank from that the newspapers are all against him said she and i dont want to be told he is guilty when i know he is innocent she now reexamined the extracts with a view to names and found the only names mentioned were those of the counsel the experts name was not given in either however she knew that from robert she resolved to speak to mr hennessy first and try and get at the defendants solicitor through him she found him out by the law directory and called at a few minutes past four hennessy was almost the opposite to tollemache he was about the size of a gentlemans wardrobe and like most enormous men goodnatured he received her saw with his practiced eye that she was no common person and after a slight hesitation on professional grounds heard her request he sent for his notebook found the case in one moment remastered it in another and told her the solicitor for the crown in that case was freshfleld now said he you want to know who was the defendants solicitor jenkins a stamped envelope write your name and address on that while she was doing it he scratched a line to mr freshfield asking him to send the required information to the inclosed address she thanked mr hennessy with the tears in her eyes i dare not ask you whether you think him guilty she said hennessy shook his head with an air of goodnatured rebuke you must not crossexamine counsel said he but if it will be any comfort to you ill say this much there was just a shadow of doubt and tollemache certainly let a chance slip if i had defended your friend i would have insisted on a postponement of the trial until this arthur wardlaw looking at his notebook could be examined either in court or otherwise if he was really dying is he dead do you know no i thought not sick witnesses are often at deaths door but i never knew one pass the threshold ha ha the trial ought to have been postponed till he got well if a judge refused me a postponement in such a case i would make him so odious to the jury that the prisoner would get a verdict in spite of his teeth then you think he was badly defended no that is saying a great deal more than i could justify but there are counsel who trust too much to their powers of reasoning and underrate a chink in the evidence pro or con practice and a few backfalls cure them of that mr hennessy uttered this general observation with a certain change of tone which showed he thought he had said as much or more than his visitor had any right to expect from him and she therefore left him repeating her thanks she went home pondering on every word he had said and entered it all in her journal with the remark how strange the first doubt of roberts guilt comes to me from the lawyer who caused him to be found guilty he calls it the shadow of a doubt that very evening mr freshfield had the courtesy to send her by messenger the name and address of the solicitor who had defended robert penfold lovejoy james lincolns inn fields she called on them and sent in her card she was kept waiting a long time in the outer office and felt ashamed and sick at heart seated among young clerks at last she was admitted and told mr lovejoy she and her father general rolleston were much interested in a late client of his mr robert penfold and would he be kind enough to let her see the brief for the defense are you a relation of the penfolds madam no sir said helen blushing humph said lovejoy he touched a handbell a clerk appeared ask mr upton to come to me mr upton the managing clerk came in due course and mr lovejoy asked him who instructed us in the queen v penfold it was mr michael penfold sir mr lovejoy then told helen that she must just get a line from mr michael penfold and then the papers should be submitted to her yes but sir said helen mr penfold is in scotland well but you can write to him no i dont know in what part of scotland he is then you are not very intimate with him no sir my acquaintance is with mr robert penfold have you a line from him i have no written authority from him but will you not take my word that i act by his desire my dear madam said the lawyer we go by rule there are certain forms to be observed in these things i am sure your own good sense will tell you it would be cruel and improper of me to submit those papers without an order from robert or michael penfold pray consider this as a delay not a refusal yes sir said helen but i meet with nothing but delays and my heart is breaking under them the solicitor looked sorry but would not act irregularly she went home sighing and condemned to wait the return of michael penfold the cab door was opened for her by a seedy man she fancied she had seen before baffled thus and crippled in every movement she made however slight in favor of robert penfold she was seduced on the other hand into all the innocent pleasures of the town her adventure had transpired somehow or other and all general rollestons acquaintances hunted him up and both father and daughter were courted by people of ton as lions a shipwrecked beauty is not offered to society every day even her own sex raved about her and about the chain of beautiful pearls she had picked up somehow on her desolate island she always wore them they linked her to that sacred purpose she seemed to be forgetting her father drew her with him into the vortex hiding from her that he embarked in it principally for her sake and she went down the current with him out of filial duty thus unfathomable difficulties thrust her back from her uphill task and the world with soft but powerful hand drew her away to it arthur brought her a choice bouquet or sent her a choice bouquet every evening but otherwise did not intrude much upon her and though she was sure he would assist her if she asked him gratitude and delicacy forbade her to call him again to her assistance she preferred to await the return of michael penfold she had written to him at the office to tell him she had news of his son and begged him to give her instant notice of his return from scotland day after day passed and he did not write to her she began to chafe and then to pine her father saw and came to a conclusion that her marriage with arthur ought to be hastened he resolved to act quietly but firmly toward that end chapter lvi up to this time helens sex and its attributes had been a great disadvantage to her she had been stopped on the very threshold of her inquiry by petty difficulties which a man would have soon surmounted but one fine day the scale gave a little turn and she made a little discovery thanks to her sex women whether it is that they are born to be followed or are accustomed to be followed seem to have eyes in the backs of their heads and instinct to divine when somebody is after them this inexperienced girl who had missed seeing many things our readers have seen observed in merely passing her window a seedy man in the courtyard of the hotel would you believe it she instantly recognized the man who had opened her cab door for her in lincolns inn fields quick as lightning it passed through her mind why do i see the same figure at lincolns inn fields and at charing cross at various intervals she passed the window and twice she saw the man again she pondered and determined to try a little experiment robert penfold it may be remembered had mentioned an expert as one of the persons she was to see she had looked for his name in the directory but experts were not down in the book another fatality but at last she had found undercliff a lithographer and she fancied that must be the same person she did not hope to learn much from him the newspapers said his evidence had caused a smile she had a distinct object in visiting him the nature of which will appear she ordered a cab and dressed herself she came down and entered the cab but instead of telling the man to drive she gave him a slip of paper containing the address of the lithographer drive there said she a little mysteriously the cabman winked suspecting an intrigue and went off to the place there she learned mr undercliff had moved to frith street soho number not known she told the cabman to drive slowly up and down the street but could not find the name at last she observed some lithographs in a window she let the cabman go all down the street then stopped him and paid him off she had no sooner done this than she walked very briskly back and entered the little shop and inquired for mr undercliff he was out and not expected back for an hour i will wait said helen and she sat down with her head upon her white hand a seedy man passed the window rapidly with a busy air and if his eye shot a glance into the shop it was so slight and careless nobody could suspect he was a spy and had done his work effectually as he flashed by in that moment the young lady through the chink of her fingers which she had opened for that purpose not only recognized the man but noticed his face his hat his waistcoat his dirty linen and the pin in his necktie ah said she and flushed to the brow she lifted up her head and became conscious of a formidable old woman who was standing behind the counter at a side door eying her with the severest scrutiny this old woman was tall and thin and had a fine face the lower part of which was feminine enough but the forehead and brows were alarming though her hair was silvery the brows were black and shaggy and the forehead was divided by a vertical furrow into two temples under those shaggy eyebrows shone dark gray eyes that passed for black with most people and those eyes were fixed on helen reading her helens light hazel eyes returned their gaze she blushed and still looking said pray madam can i see mr undercliff my son is out for the day miss said the old lady civilly oh dear how unfortunate i am said helen with a sigh he comes back tonight you can see him tomorrow at ten oclock a question of handwriting not exactly said helen but he was witness in favor of a person i know was innocent but he was found guilty said the other with cool frankness yes madam and he has no friend to clear him but me a poor weak girl baffled and defeated whichever way i turn she began to cry the old woman looked at her crying with that steady composure which marks her sex on these occasions and when she was better said quietly you are not so weak as you think she added after a while if you wish to retain my son you had better leave a fee with pleasure madam what is the fee one guinea of course there is a separate charge for any work he may do for you that is but reasonable madam and with this she paid the fee and rose to go shall i send any one home with you no thank you said helen why because you are followed and because you are not used to be followed why how did you find that out by your face when a man passed the windowa shabbygenteel fellow he was employed by some gentleman no doubt such faces as yours will be followed in london if you feel uneasy miss i will put on my bonnet and see you home helen was surprised at this act of substantial civility from the gorgon oh thank you mrs undercliff said she no i am not the least afraid let them follow me i am doing nothing that i am ashamed of indeed i am glad i am thought worth the trouble of following it shows me i am not so thoroughly contemptible goodby and many thanks ten oclock tomorrow and she walked home without looking once behind her till the hotel was in sight then she stopped at a shop window and in a moment her swift eye embraced the whole landscape but the shabbygenteel man was nowhere in sight chapter lvii when joseph wylie disappeared from the scene nancy rouse made a discovery which very often follows the dismissal of a suitorthat she was considerably more attached to him than she had thought the house became dull the subordinate washerwomen languid their taciturnity irritated and depressed nancy by turns in the midst of this michael penfold discovered that helen had come back safe he came into her parlor beaming with satisfaction and told her of the good news it gave her immense delight at first but when she had got used to her joy on that score she began to think she had used joe wylie very ill now that helen was saved she could no longer realize that wylie was so very much to blame she even persuaded herself that his disappearance was the act of a justly offended man and as he belonged to a class of whose good sense she had a poor opinion she was tormented with fears that he would do some desperate actdrown himself or go to sea or worst of all marry some trollop she became very anxious and unhappy before this misfortune she used to go about singing the first verse of a song and whistling the next like any plowboy an eccentric performance but it made the house gay now both song and whistle were suspended and instead it was all hard work and hard crying turn about she attached herself to michael penfold because he had known trouble and was sympathetic and these two opened their hearts to one another and formed a friendship that was very honest and touching the scene of their conversation and mutual consolation was nancys parlor a little mite of a room she had partitioned off from her business for said she a lady ill beafter my work is doneif it is only in a cupboard the room had a remarkably large fireplace which had originally warmed the whole floor but now was used as a ventilator only the gas would have been stifling without it as for lighting a fire in it that was out of the question on a certain evening soon after mr penfolds return from scotland the pair sat over their tea and the conversation fell on the missing sweetheart michael had been thinking it over and was full of encouragement he said miss rouse something tells me that if poor mr wylie could only know your heart he would turn up again directly what we ought to do is to send somebody to look for him in all the sailors hauntssome sharp fellow dear me what a knocking they keep up next door oh that is always the way when one wants a quiet chat drat the woman ill have her indicted no you wont miss rouse she is a poor soul and has got no business except letting lodgings she is not like you but i do hope she will be so kind as not to come quite through the wall dear heart said nancy go on and never mind her noise which it is worse than a horgangrinder well then if you cant find him that way i sayadvertise me cried nancy turning very red do i look like a woman as would advertise for a man no maam quite the reverse but what i mean is you might put in something not too plain for instance if j w will return to n r all will be forgotten and forgiven hed have the upper hand of me for life said nancy no no i wont advertise for the fool what right had he to run off at the first word he ought to know my bark is worse than my bite by this time you can though me bite maam said the old gentleman bite no advertise since youre so fond of it come you sit down and write one and ill pay for it for that matter michael sat down and drew up the following if mr joseph wylie will call on michael penfold at no e c he will hear of something to his advantage to his advantage said nancy doubtfully why not tell him the truth why that is the truth maam isnt it to his advantage to be reconciled to an honest virtuous painstaking lady that honors him with her affectionand me with her friendship besides it is the common form and there is nothing like sticking to form mr penfold said nancy any one can see you was born a gentleman and i am a deal prouder to have you and your washing than i should him as pays you your wages pale eyespale hairpale eyebrowsi wouldnt trust him to mangle a duster oh miss rouse pray dont disparage my good master to me i cant help it sir thought is free especially in this here compartment better speak ones mind than die o the sulks so shut your ear when my music jars but one every other day is enough if he wont come back for that why he must go and i must look out for another theres as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it still ill not deny i have a great respect for poor joe oh mr penfold what shall i do oh oh oh there there said michael ill put this into the times every day you are a good soul mr penfold ohoh oh when he had finished the advertisement in a clerkly hand and she had finished her cry she felt comparatively comfortable and favored mr penfold with some reflections dear heart mr penfold how you and i do take to one another to be sure but so we ought for we are honest folk the pair and has had a hard time dont it never strike you rather curious that two thousand pounds was at the bottom of both our troubles yourn and mine i might have married joe and been a happy woman with him but the devil puts in my head there you go again hammering life aint worth having next door to that lodginghouse drat the woman if she must peck why dont she go in the churchyard and peck her own grave which we shall never be quiet till she is there and these here gimcrack houses they wont stand no more pecking at than a soapsud ay thats what hurts me mr penfold the lord had given him and me health and strength and honesty our betters had wed for love and wrought for money as the saying is but i must go again nature that cried come couple and must bargain for two thousand pounds so now ive lost the man and not got the money nor never shall and if i had id burn ahahahahah this tirade ended in stifled screams of terror caused by the sudden appearance of a human hand in a place and in a manner well adapted to shake the stoutest laundresss nerves this hand came through the brickwork of the chimneyplace and there remained a moment or two then slowly retired and as it retired something was heard to fall upon the shavings and tinsel of the fireplace nancy by a feminine impulse put her hands before her face to hide this supernatural hand and when she found courage to withdraw them and glare at the place there was no aperture whatever in the brickwork and consequently the hand appeared to have traversed the solid material both coming and going oh mr penfold cried nancy im a sinful woman this comes of talking of the devil arter sunset and she sat trembling so that the very floor shook mr penfolds nerves were not strong he and nancy both huddled together for mutual protection and their faces had not a vestige of color left in them however after a period of general paralysis penfold whispered i heard it drop something on the shavings then we shall be all in a blaze o brimstone shrieked nancy wringing her hands and they waited to see then as no conflagration took place mr penfold got up and said he must go and see what it was the hand had dropped nancy in whom curiosity was beginning to battle with terror let him go to the fireplace without a word of objection and then cried out dont go anigh it sir it will do you a mischief dont touch it whatever take the tongs he took the tongs and presently flung into the middle of the room a small oilskin packet this as it lay on the ground they both eyed like two deer glowering at a piece of red cloth and ready to leap back over the moon if it should show signs of biting but oilskin is not preternatural nor has tradition connected it however remotely with the enemy of man consequently a great revulsion took place in nancy and she passed from fear to indignation at having been frightened so she ran to the fireplace and putting her head up the chimney screamed heave your dirt where you heave your love ye brazen while she was objurgating her neighbor whom with feminine justice she held responsible for every act done in her house penfold undid the packet and nancy returned to her seat with her mind more at ease to examine the contents banknotes cried penfold ay said nancy incredulously they do look like banknotes and feel like em but they aint wrote like them banknotes aint wrote black like that in the lefthand corner penfold explained tenpound notes are not nor fives but large notes are these are all fifties fifty whats fifty pounds what each of them bits of paper worth fifty pounds yes let us count them oh lord why that is two thousand poundsjust two thousand pounds it is the very sum that ruined me it did not belong to me and its being in the house ruined my poor robert and this does not belong to you lock all the doors bar all the windows and burn them before the police come wait a bit said nancywait a bit they sat on each side of the notes penfold agitated and terrified nancy confounded and perplexed chapter lviii punctually at ten oclock helen returned to frith street and found mr undercliff behind a sort of counter employed in tracing a workman was seated at some little distance from him both bent on their work mr undercliff said helen he rose and turned toward her politelya pale fair man with a keen gray eye and a pleasant voice and manner i am edward undercliff you come by appointment yes sir a question of handwriting not entirely sir do you remember giving witness in favor of a young clergyman mr robert penfold who was accused of forgery i remember the circumstance but not the details oh dear that is unfortunate said helen with a deep sigh she often had to sigh now why you see said the expert i am called on such a multitude of trials however i take notes of the principal ones what year was it in in mr undercliff went to a set of drawers arranged chronologically and found his notes directly it was a forged bill madam indorsed and presented by penfold i was called to prove that the bill was not in the handwriting of penfold here is my facsimile of the robert penfold indorsed upon the bill by the prisoner he handed it her and she examined it with interest and here are facsimiles of genuine writing by john wardlaw and here is a copy of the forged note he laid it on the table before her she started and eyed it with horror it was a long time before she could speak at length she said and that wicked piece of paper destroyed robert penfold not that piece of paper but the original this is a facsimile so far as the writing is concerned it was not necessary in this case to imitate paper and color stay here is a sheet on which i have lithographed the three styles that will enable you to follow my comparison but perhaps that would not interest you helen had the tact to say it would thus encouraged the expert showed her that robert penfolds writing had nothing in common with the forged note he added i also detected in the forged note habits which were entirely absent from the true writing of john wardlaw you will understand there were plenty of undoubted specimens in court to go by then oh sir said helen robert penfold was not guilty certainly not of writing the forged note i swore that and ill swear it again but when it came to questions whether he had passed the note and whether he knew it was forged that was quite out of my province i can understand that said helen but you heard the trial you are very intelligent sir you must have formed some opinion as to whether he was guilty or not the expert shook his head madam said he mine is a profound and difficult art which aims at certainties very early in my career i found that to master that art i must be singleminded and not allow my ear to influence my eye by purposely avoiding all reasoning from external circumstances i have distanced my competitors in expertise but i sometimes think i have rather weakened my powers of conjecture through disuse now if my mother had been at the trial she would give you an opinion of some value on the outside facts but that is not my line if you feel sure he was innocent and want me to aid you you must get hold of the handwriting of every person who was likely to know old wardlaws handwriting and so might have imitated it all the clerks in his office to begin with nail the forger that is your only chance what sir said helen with surprise if you saw the true handwriting of the person who wrote that forged note should you recognize it why not it is difficult but i have done it hundreds of times oh is forgery so common no but i am in all the cases and besides i do a great deal in a business that requires the same kind of expertiseanonymous letters i detect assassins of that kind by the score a gentleman or lady down in the country gets a poisoned arrow by the post or perhaps a shower of them they are always in disguised handwriting those who receive them send them up to me with writings of all the people they suspect the disguise is generally more or less superficial five or six unconscious habits remain below it and often these undisguised habits are the true characteristics of the writer and ill tell you something curious madam it is quite common for all the suspected people to be innocent and then i write back send me the handwriting of the people you suspect the least and among them i often find the assassin oh mr undercliff said helen you make my heart sick oh it is a vile world for that matter said the expert and the country no better than the town for all it looks so sweet with its green fields and purling rills there they sow anonymous letters like barley the very girls write anonymous letters that make my hair stand on end yes it is a vile world dont you believe him miss said mrs undercliff appearing suddenly then turning to her son how can you measure the world you live in a little one of your owna world of forgers and anonymous writers you see so many of these you fancy they are common as dirt but they are only common to you because they all come your way oh that is it is it said the expert doubtfully yes that is it ned said the old lady quietly then after a pause she said i want you to do your very best for this young lady i always do said the artist but how can i judge without materials and she brings me none mrs undercliff turned to helen and said have you brought him nothing at all no handwritingsin your bag then helen sighed again i have no handwriting except mr penfolds but i have two printed reports of the trial printed reports said the expert they are no use to me ah here is an outline i took of the prisoner during the trial you can read faces tell the lady whether he was guilty or not and he handed the profile to his mother with an ironical look not that he doubted her proficiency in the rival art of reading faces but that he doubted the existence of the art mrs undercliff took the profile and coloring slightly said to miss rolleston it is living faces i profess to read there i can see the movement of the eyes and other things that my son here has not studied then she scrutinized the profile it is a very handsome face said she the expert chuckled theres a womans judgment said he handsome the fellow i got transported for life down at exeter was an adonis and forged wills bonds and powers of attorney by the dozen theres something noble about this face said mrs undercliff ignoring the interruption and yet something simple i think him more likely to be a catspaw than a felon having delivered this with a certain modest dignity she laid the profile on the counter before helen the expert had a wonderful eye and hand it was a good thing for society he had elected to be gamekeeper instead of poacher detector of forgery instead of forger no photograph was ever truer than this outline helen started and bowed her head over the sketch to conceal the strong and various emotions that swelled at sight of the portrait of her martyr in vain if the eyes were hidden the tender bosom heaved the graceful body quivered and the tears fell fast upon the counter mrs undercliff was womanly enough though she looked like the late lord thurlow in petticoats and she instantly aided the girl to hide her beating heart from the man though that man was her son she distracted his attention give me all your notes ned said she and let me see whether i can make something of them but first perhaps miss rolleston will empty her bag on the counter go back to your work a moment for i know you have enough to do the expert was secretly glad to be released from a case in which there were no materials and so helen escaped unobserved except by one of her own sex she saw directly what mrs undercliff had done for her and lifted her sweet eyes thick with tears to thank her mrs undercliff smiled maternally and next these two ladies did a stroke of business in the twinkling of an eye and without a word spoken whereof anon helen being once more composed mrs undercliff took up the prayerbook and asked her with some curiosity what could be in that oh said helen only some writing of mr penfold mr undercliff does not want to see that he is already sure robert penfold never wrote that wicked thing yes but i should like to see some more of his handwriting for all that said the expert looking suddenly up but it is only in pencil never mind you need not fear i shall alter my opinion helen colored high you are right and i should disgrace my good cause by withholding anything from your inspection there sir and she opened the prayerbook and laid coopers dying words before the expert he glanced over them with an eye like a bird and compared them with his notes yes said he that is robert penfolds writing and i say again that hand never wrote the forged note let me see that said mrs undercliff oh yes said helen rather irresolutely but you look into the things as well as the writing and i promised papa cant you trust me said mrs undercliff turning suddenly cold and a little suspicious oh yes madam and indeed i have nothing to reproach myself with but my papa is anxious however i am sure you are my friend and all i ask is that you will never mention to a soul what you read there i promise that said the elder lady and instantly bent her black brows upon the writing and as she did so helen observed her countenance rise as a face is very apt to do when its owner enters on congenial work you would have made a great mistake to keep this from me said she gravely then she pondered profoundly then she turned to her son and said why edward this is the very young lady who was wrecked in the pacific ocean and cast on a desolate island we have all read about you in the papers miss and i felt for you for one but of course not as i do now i have seen you you must let me go into this with you ah if you would said helen oh madam i have gone through tortures already for want of somebody of my own sex to keep me in countenance oh if you could have seen how i have been received with what cold looks and sometimes with impertinent stares before i could even penetrate into the region of those cold looks and petty formalities any miserable straw was excuse enough to stop me on my errand of justice and mercy and gratitude gratitude oh yes madam the papers have only told you that i was shipwrecked and cast away they dont tell you that robert penfold warned me the ship was to be destroyed and i disbelieved and affronted him in return and he never reproached me not even by a look and we were in a boat with the sailors all starvednot hungry starvedand mad with thirst and yet in his own agony he hid something for me to eat all his thought all his fear was for me such things are not done in those great extremities of the poor vulgar suffering body except by angels in whom the soul rises above the flesh and he is such an angel i have had a knife lifted over me to kill me madamyes and again it was he who saved me i owe my life to him on the island over and over again and in return i have promised to give him back his honor that he values far more than life as all such noble spirits do ah my poor martyr how feebly i plead your cause oh help me pray pray help me all is so dark and i so weak so weak again the loving eyes streamed and this time not an eye was dry in the little shop the expert flung down his tracing with something between a groan and a curse who can do that drudgery he cried while the poor young lady mother you take it in hand find me some material though it is no bigger than a flys foot give me but a clew no thicker than a spiders web and ill follow it through the whole labyrinth but you see im impotent theres no basis for me it is a case for you it wants a shrewd sagacious body that can read facts and faces and i wont jest any more miss rolleston for you are deeply in earnest well then she really is a woman with a wonderful insight into facts and faces she has got a way of reading them as i read handwriting and she must have taken a great fancy to you for as a rule she never does us the honor to meddle have you taken a fancy to me madam said helen modestly and tenderly yet half archly that i have said the other those eyes of yours went straight into my heart last night or i should not be here this morning that is partly owing to my own eyes being so dark and yours the loveliest hazel it is twenty years since eyes like yours have gazed into mine diamonds are not half so rare nor a tenth part so lovely to my fancy she turned her head away melted probably by some tender reminiscence it was only for a moment she turned round again and said quietly yes ned i should like to try what i can do i think you said these are reports of his trial ill begin by reading them she read them both very slowly and carefully and her face grew like a judges and helen watched each shade of expression with deep anxiety that powerful countenance showed alacrity and hope at first then doubt and difficulty and at last dejection helens heart turned cold and for the first time she began to despair for now a shrewd person with a plain prejudice in her favor and roberts was staggered by the simple facts of the trial chapter lix mrs undercliff having read the reports avoided helens eye another bad sign she turned to mr undercliff and probably because the perusal of the reports had disappointed her said almost angrily edward what did you say to make them laugh at that trial both these papers say that an expert was called whose ingenuity made the court smile but did not counterbalance the evidence why that is a falsehood on the face of it said the expert turning red i was called simply and solely to prove penfold did not write the forged note i proved it to the judges satisfaction and he directed the prisoner to be acquitted on that count miss rolleston the lawyers often do sneer at experts but then four experts out of five are rank impostors a set of theorists who go by arbitrary rules framed in the closet and not by large and laborious comparison with indisputable documents these charlatans are not aware that five thousand cramped and tremulous but genuine signatures are written every day by honest men and so they denounce every cramped or tremulous writing as a forgery the varieties in a mans writing caused by his writing with his glove on or off with a quill or a bad steel pen drunk or sober calm or agitated in full daylight or dusk etc etc all this is a dead letter to them and they have a bias toward suspicion of forgery and a bankers clerk with his mere general impression is better evidence than they are but i am an artist of a very different stamp i never reason a priori i compare and i have no bias i never will have the judges know this and the pains and labor i take to be right and they treat me with courtesy at penfolds trial the matter was easy i showed the court he had not written the note and my evidence crushed the indictment so far how could they have laughed at my testimony why they acted upon it those reports are not worth a straw what journals were they cut out of i dont know said helen is there nothing on the upper margin to show no what not on either of them no show them me please this is a respectable paper too the daily news oh mr undercliff how can you know that i dont know it but i think so because the type and paper are like that journal the conductors are fond of clean type so am i why here is another misstatement the judge never said he aggravated his offense by trying to cast a slur upon the wardlaws ill swear the judge never said a syllable of the kind what he said was you can speak in arrest of judgment on grounds of law but you must not impugn the verdict with facts that was the only time he spoke to the prisoner at all these reports are not worth a button helen lifted up her hands and eyes in despair where shall i find the truth said she the world is a quicksand my dear young lady said mrs undercliff dont you be discouraged there must be a correct report in some paper or other i am not so sure of that said undercliff i believe the reporters trundle off to the nearest publichouse together and light their pipes with their notes and settle something or other by memory indeed they have reached a pitch of inaccuracy that could not be attained without cooperation independent liars contradict each other but these chaps follow one another in falsehood like geese toddling after one another across a common come come said mrs undercliff if you cant help us dont hurt us we dont want a man to talk yellow jaundice to us miss rolleston must employ somebody to read all the other papers and compare the reports with these ill employ nobody but myself said helen ill go to the british museum directly the museum cried mr undercliff looking with surprise why they will be half an hour groping for a copy of the times no no go to peeles coffeehouse he directed her where to find that place and she was so eager to do something for robert however small that she took up her bag directly and put up the prayerbook and was going to ask for her extracts when she observed mr undercliff was scrutinizing them with great interest so she thought she would leave them with him but on looking more closely she found that he was examining not the reports but the advertisements and miscellanea on the reverse side she waited out of politeness but she colored and bit her lip she could not help feeling hurt and indignant any trash is more interesting to people than poor roberts case she thought and at last she said bitterly those advertisements seem to interest you sir shall i leave them with you if you please said the expert over whose head bent in dogged scrutiny this small thunderbolt of feminine wrath passed unconscious helen drove away to peeles coffee house mrs undercliff pondered over the facts that had been elicited in this conversation the expert remained absorbed in the advertisements at the back of helens reports when he had examined every one of them minutely he held the entire extracts up to the light and looked through them then he stuck a double magnifier in his eye and looked through them with that then he took two pieces of card wrote on them re penfold and looked about for his other materials to put them all neatly together lo the profile of robert penfold was gone now that is too bad said he so much for her dovelike eyes that you admired so miss innocence has stolen that profile stolen she bought itof me why she never said a word no but she looked a look she asked me with those sweet imploring eyes might she have it and i looked yes then she glanced toward you and put down a note here it is why you beat the telegraph you two ten pounds for that thing i must make it up to her somehow i wish you could poor girl she is a lady every inch but she is in love with that penfold im afraid it is a hopeless case i have seen a plainer but hopeless it is not however you work your way and ill work mine but you cant you have no materials no but i have found a door that may lead to materials having delivered himself thus myteriously he shut himself up in obstinate silence until helen rolleston called again two days afterward she brought a bag full of manuscript this timeto wit copies in her own handwriting of eight reports the queen v penfold she was in good spirits and told mrs undercliff that all the reports were somewhat more favorable than the two she had left and she was beginning to tell mr undercliff he was quite right in his recollection when he interrupted her and said all that is secondary now have you any objection to answer me a question she colored but said oh no ask me anything you like then she blushed deeper how did you become possessed of those two reports you left with me the other day at this question so different from what she feared helen cleared up and smiled and said from a mr hand a clerk in mr wardlaws office they were sent me at my request the expert seemed pleased at this reply his brow cleared and he said then i dont mind telling you that those two reports will bring penfolds case within my province to speak plainly miss rolleston your newspaper extractsare forgeries chapter lx forgeries cried helen with innocent horror rank forgeries repeated the expert coolly forgeries cried helen why how can printed things be that that is what i should like to know said the old lady why what else can you call them said the expert they are got up to look like extracts from newspapers but they were printed as they are and were never in any journal shall i tell you how i found that out if you please sir said helen well then i looked at the reverse side and i found seven misprints in one slip and five in the other that was a great number to creep into printed slips of that length the trial part did not show a single erratum hullo said i to myself why one side is printed more carefully than the other and that was not natural the printing of advertisements is looked after quite as sharply as any other part in a journal why the advertisers themselves cry out if they are misprinted oh how shrewd cried helen childs play said the expert well from that blot i went on i looked at the edges and they were cut too clean a gentleman with a pair of scissors cant cut slips out of a paper like this they were cut in the printers office lastly on holding them to the light i found they had not been machined upon the plan now adopted by all newspapers but worked by hand in one wordforgeries oh said helen to think i should have handled forgeries and shown them to you for real ah im so glad for now i have committed the same crime as robert penfold i have uttered a forged document take me up and have me put in prison for i am as guilty as ever he was her face shone with rapture at sharing roberts guilt the expert was a little puzzled by sentiments so highflown and unpractical i think said he you are hardly aware what a valuable discovery this may prove to you however the next step is to get me a specimen of the persons handwriting who furnished you with these the chances are he is the writer of the forged note helen uttered an exclamation that was almost a scream the inference took her quite by surprise she looked at mrs undercliff he is right i think said the old lady right or wrong said the expert the next step in the inquiry is to do what i said but that demands great caution you must write a short civil note to mr hand and just ask him some question let me see ask him what newspapers his extracts are from and whether he has got any more he will not tell you the truth but no matter we shall get hold of his handwriting but sir said helen there is no need for that mr hand sent me a note along with the extracts the deuce he did all the better any words in it that are in the forged note is penfold in it or wardlaw helen reflected a moment and then said she thought both those names were in it fetch me that note said undercliff and his eyes sparkled he was on a hot scent now and let me study the genuine reports and compare what they say with the forged ones said mrs undercliff oh what friends i have found at last cried helen she thanked them both warmly and hurried home for it was getting late next day she brought hands letter to mr undercliff and devoured his countenance while he inspected it keenly and compared it with the forged note the comparison was long and careful but unsatisfactory mr undercliff could not conscientiously say whether hand had written the forged note or not there were pros and cons we are in deeper water than i thought said he the comparison must be enlarged you must write as i suggested and get another note out of mr hand and leave the prayerbook with me said mrs undercliff helen complied with these instructions and in due course received a civil line from mr hand to say that the extracts had been sent him from the country by one of his fellowclerks and he had locked them up lest mr michael penfold who was much respected in the office should see them he could not say where they came from perhaps from some provincial paper if of any value to miss rolleston she was quite at liberty to keep them he added there was a coffeehouse in the city where she could read all the london papers of that date this letter which contained a great many more words than the other was submitted to undercliff it puzzled him so that he set to work and dissected every curve the writers pen had made but he could come to no positive conclusion and he refused to utter his conjectures we are in a deep water said he finally he told his mother he was at a standstill for the present but i am not said mrs undercliff she added after a while i think theres felony at the bottom of this smells like it to me said the expert then i want you to do something very clever for me what is that i want you to forge something come i say quite innocent i assure you well but it is a bad habit to commence all depends on the object this is to take in a forger that is all the experts eyes sparkled he had always been sadly discontented with the efforts of forgers and thought he could do better ill do it said he gayly chapter lxi general rolleston and his daughter sat at breakfast in the hotel general rolleston was reading the times and his eye lighted on something that made him start he looked toward helen and his first impulse was to communicate it to her but on second thoughts he preferred to put a question to her first you have never told the wardlaws what those sailors said no papa i still think they ought to have been told but you know you positively forbade me of course i did why afflict the old gentleman with such a tale a couple of common sailors who chose to fancy the ship was destroyed who are better judges of such a thing than sailors well my child if you think so i cant help it all i say is spare the old gentleman such a report as for arthur to tell you the truth i have mentioned the matter to him ah papa then why forbid me to tell him what did he say he was very much distressed destroy the ship my helen was in said he if i thought wylie had done that id kill him with my own hand though i was hanged for it next minute i never saw the young fellow fire up so before but when he came to think calmly over it a little while he said i hope this slander will never reach my fathers ears it would grieve him deeply i only laugh at it laugh at it and yet talk of killing oh people say they laugh at a thing when they are very angry all the time however as you are a good girl and mind what you are told ill read you an advertisement that will make you stare here is joseph wylie who you say wrecked the proserpine actually invited by michael penfold to call on him and hear of something to his advantage dear me said helen how strange surely mr penfold cannot know the character of that man stop a minute advertise for him then nobody knows where he lives there papa you see he is afraid to go near arthur wardlaw he knows he destroyed the ship what a mystery it all is and so mr penfold is at home after all and not to send me a single line i never met with so much unkindness and discourtesy in all my life ah my dear said the general you never defied the world before as you are doing now helen sighed but presently recovering her spirit said she had done without the world on her dear island and she would not be its slave now as she was always as good as her word she declined an invitation to play the lion and dressing herself in plain merino went down that very evening to michael penfolds cottage we run thither a little before her to relate briefly what had taken place there nancy rouse as may well be imagined was not the woman to burn two thousand pounds she locked the notes up and after that night became very reserved on that head so much so that at last mr penfold saw it was an interdicted topic and dropped it in much wonder when nancy came to think of it in daylight she could not help suspecting wylie had some hand in it and it occurred to her that the old gentleman who lodged next door might be an agent of wylies and a spy on her wylie must have told him to push the pounds into her room but what a strange thing to do to be sure he was a sailor and sailors had been known to make sandwiches of banknotes and eat them still her good sense revolted against this theory and she was sore puzzled for after all there was the money and she had seen it come through the wall one thing appeared certain joe had not forgotten her he was thinking of her as much as ever or more than ever so her spirits rose she began singing and whistling again and waited cunningly till joe should reappear and explain his conduct hostage for his reappearance she held the pounds she felt so strong and saucy she was half sorry she had allowed mr penfold to advertise but after all it did not much matter she could always declare to joe she had never missed him for her part and the advertising was a folly of poor mr penfolds matters were in this condition when the little servant came up one evening to mr penfold and said there was a young lady to see him a young lady for me said he which she wont eat you while i am by said the sharp little girl it is a lady and the same what come before perhaps she will oblige me with her name said michael timidly i wont show her up till she do said this mite of a servant who had been scolded by nancy for not extracting that information on helens last visit of course i must receive her said michael half consulting the mite it belonged to a sex which promptly assumes the control of such gentle creatures as he was is miss rouse in the way said he the mite laughed and said she is only gone down the street ill send her in to take care on you with this she went off and in due course led helen up the stairs she ran in and whispered in michaels ear it is miss helen rolleston thus they announced a lady at no michael stared with wonder at so great a personage visiting him and the next moment helen glided into the room blushing a little and even panting inaudibly but all on her guard she saw before her a rather stately figure and a face truly venerable benignant and beautiful though deficient in strength she cast a devouring glance on him as she courtesied to him and it instantly flashed across her but for you there would be no robert penfold there was an unconscious tenderness in her voice as she spoke to him for she had to open the interview mr penfold i fear my visit may surprise you as you did not write to me but when you hear what i am come about i think you will not be displeased with me for coming displeased madam i am highly honored by your visita lady who i understand is to be married to my worthy employer mr arthur pray be seated madam thank you sir helen began in a low thrilling voice to which however she gave firmness by a resolute effort of her will i am come to speak to you of one who is very dear to you and to all who really know him dear to me it is my son the rest are gone it is robert and he began to tremble yes it is robert said she very softly then turning her eyes away from him lest his emotion should overcome her she said he has laid me and my father under deep obligations she dragged her father in for it was essential not to show mr penfold she was in love with robert obligations to my robert ah madam it is very kind of you to say that and cheer a desolate fathers heart with praise of his lost son but how could a poor unfortunate man in his position serve a lady like you he defended me against robbers singlehanded ah said the old man glowing with pride and looking more beautiful than ever he was always as brave as a lion that is nothing he saved my life again and again and again god bless him for it and god bless you for coming and telling me of it oh madam he was always brave and gentle and just and good so noble so unfortunate and the old man began to cry helens bosom heaved and it cost her a bitter struggle not to throw her arms around the dear old mans neck and cry with him but she came prepared for a sore trial of her feelings and she clinched her hands and teeth and would not give way an inch tell me how he saved your life madam he was in the ship and in the boat with me ah madam said michael that must have been some other robert penfold not my son he could not come home his time was not up you know it was robert penfold son of michael penfold excuse me a moment said michael and he went to a drawer and brought her a photograph of robert was it this robert penfold the girl took the photograph and eyed it and lowered her head over it yes she murmured and he was coming home in the ship with you is he mad more trouble more trouble do not alarm yourself said helen he will not land in england for yearshere she stifled a soband long ere that we shall have restored him to society michael stared at that and shook his head never said he that is impossible why impossible they all say he is a felon they all shall say that he is a martyr and so he is but how can that ever be proved i dont know but i am sure the truth can always be proved if people have patience and perseverance my sweet young lady said michael sadly you dont know the world i am learning it fast though it may take me a few years perhaps to make powerful friends to grope my way among forgers and spies and wicked dishonest people of all sorts but so surely as you sit there ill clear robert penfold before i die the good feeble old man gazed on her with admiration and astonishment she subdued her flashing eye and said with a smile and you shall help me mr penfold let me ask you a question i called here before but you were gone to edinburgh then i wrote to you at the office begging you to let me know the moment you returned now do not think i am angry but pray tell me why you would not answer my letter michael penfold was not burdened with amour propre but who has not got a little of it in some corner of his heart miss rolleston said he i was born a gentleman and was a man of fortune once till false friends ruined me i am in business now but still a gentleman and neither as a gentleman nor as a man of business could i leave a ladys letter unanswered i never did such a thing in all my life i never got your letter he said quite put out and his wrath was so like a doves that helen smiled and said but i posted it myself and my address was in it yet it was not returned well madam it was not delivered i assure you it was intercepted then he looked at her she blushed and said yes i am getting suspicious ever since i found i was followed and watched excuse me a moment she went to the window and peered through the curtains she saw a man walking slowly by he quickened his pace the moment she opened the curtain yes said she it was intercepted and i am watched wherever i go before she could say any more a bustle was heard on the stairs and in bounced nancy rouse talking as she came excuse me mr penfolds but i cant wait no longer with my heart a bursting it is it is oh my dear sweet young lady the lord be praised you really are here alive and well kiss you i must and shall come back from the dead theretherethere nancy my good kind nancy cried helen and returned her embrace warmly then followed a burst of broken explanations and at last helen made out that nancy was the landlady and had left lambeth long ago but dear heart said she mr penfolds im properly jealous of you to think of her coming here to see you and not me but i didnt know you were here nancy then followed a stream of inquiries and such warmhearted sympathy with all her dangers and troubles that helen was led into revealing the cause of it all nancy said she solemnly the ship was willfully cast away there was a villain on board that made holes in her on purpose and sunk her nancy lifted up her hands in astonishment but mr penfold was far more surprised and agitated for heavens sake dont say that he cried why not sir said helen it is the truth and i have got the testimony of dying men to prove it i am sorry for it pray dont let anybody know why wardlaws would lose the insurance of pounds arthur wardlaw knows it my father told him and he never told me said penfold with growing surprise goodness me what a world it is cried nancy why that was murder and no less it is a wonder she wasnt drownded and another friend into the bargain that i had in that very ship oh i wish i had the villain here that done it id tear his eyes out here the mite of a servant bounded in radiant and giggling gave nancy a triumphant glance and popped out again holding the door open through which in slouched a seafaring man drawn by penfolds advertisement and decoyed into nancys presence by the imp of a girl who thought to please her mistress nancy who for some days had secretly expected this visit merely gave a little squeak but helen uttered a violent scream and upon that wylie recognized her and literally staggered back a step or two and these words fell out of his mouth the sick girl helen caught them ay cried she but she is alive in spite of you alive to denounce you and to punish you she darted forward and her eyes flashed lightning look at this man all of you she cried look at him well this is the wretch that scuttled the proserpine chapter lxii oh miss helen how can you say that cried nancy in utter dismay ill lay my life poor joe never did such wickedness but helen waved her off without looking at her and pointed at wylie are you blind why does he cringe and cower at sight of me i tell you he scuttled the proserpine and the great auger he did it with i have seen and handled yes sir you destroyed a ship and the lives of many innocent persons whose blood now cries to heaven against you and if i am alive to tell the cruel tale it is no thanks to you for you did your best to kill me and what is worse to kill robert penfold this gentlemans son for he was on board the ship you are no better than an assassin i am a man thats down said wylie in a low and broken voice hanging his head dont hit me any more i didnt mean to take anybodys life i took my chance with the rest lady as im a man i have lain in my bed manys the night crying like a child with thinking you were dead and now i am glad you are alive to be revenged on me well you see it is your turn now you have lost me my sweetheart there shell never speak to me again after this ah the poor man gets all the blame you dont ask who tempted me and if i was to tell you youd hate me worse than ever so ill belay if im a sinner im a sufferer englands too hot to hold me ive only to go to sea and get drowned the quickest way and with this he vented a deep sigh and slouched out of the room nancy sank into a seat and threw her apron over her head and rocked and sobbed as if her heart would break as for helen rolleston she still stood in the middle of the room burning with excitement then poor old michael came to her and said almost in a whisper it is a bad business he is her sweetheart and she had the highest opinion of him this softened helen in a great measure she turned and looked at nancy and said oh dear what a miserable thing but i couldnt know that after a while she drew a chair and sat down by nancy and said i wont punish him nancy nancy burst out sobbing afresh you have punished him said she bruskly and me too as never did you no harm you have driven him out of the country you have at this piece of feminine justice helens anger revived so then said she ships are to be destroyed and ladies and gentlemen murdered and nobody is to complain or say an angry word if the wretch happens to be paying his addresses to you that makes up for all the crimes in the world what can an honest woman like you lose all sense of right and wrong for a man and such a man why he is as wellmade a fellow as ever i saw sobbed nancy oh is he said helen ironicallyher views of manly beauty were different and black eyes a sine qua non with herthen it is a pity his soul is not made to correspond i hope by my next visit you will have learned to despise him as you ought why if i loved a man ever so id tear him out of my heart if he committed a crime ay though i tore my soul out of my body to do it no you wouldnt said nancy recovering some of her natural pugnacity for we are all tarred with the same stick gentle or simple but i assure you i would cried helen and so ought you well miss you begin cried nancy suddenly firing up through her tears if the proserpine was scuttled which ive your word for it miss helen and i never knew you tell a lie why your sweetheart is more to blame for it than mine helen rose with dignity you are in grief said she i leave you to consider whether you have done well to affront me in your own house and she was moving to the door with great dignity when nancy ran and stopped her oh dont leave me so miss helen she cried dont you go to quarrel with me for speaking the truth too plain and rude as is a plainspoken body at the best and in such grief myself i scarce know what to say but indeed and in truth you mustnt go and put it abroad that the ship was scuttled if you do you wont hurt joe wylie hell get a ship and fly the country who youll hurt will be your own husband as is to bewardlaws shall i mr penfold asked helen disdainfully well madam certainly it might create some unworthy suspicion suspicion cried nancy dont you think to throw dust in my eyes what had poor joe to gain by destroying that there ship you know very well he was bribed to do it and risk his own life and who bribed him who should bribe him but the man as owned the ship miss rouse said mr penfold i sympathize with your grief and make great allowance but i will not sit here and hear my worthy employer blackened with such terrible insinuations the great house of wardlaw bribe a sailor to scuttle their own ship with miss rolleston and one hundred and sixty thousand pounds worth of gold on board monstrous monstrous then what did joe wylie mean replied nancy says he the poor man gets all the blame if i was to tell you who tempted me says he youd hate me worse then i say why should she hate him worse because its her sweetheart tempted mine i stands to that this inference thus worded struck helen as so droll that she turned her head aside to giggle a little but old penfold replied loftily who cares what a wylie says against a great old mercantile house of london city very well mr penfolds said nancy with one great final sob and dried her eyes with her apron and she did it with such an air they both saw she was not going to shed another tear about the matter very well you are both against me then ill say no more but i know what i know and what do you know inquired helen time will show said nancy turning suddenly very doggedtime will show nothing more was to be got out of her after that and helen soon after made her a civil though stiff little speech regretted the pain she had inadvertently caused her and went away leaving mr penfold her address on her return home she entered the whole adventure in her diary she made a separate entry to this effect mysteriousmy letter to mr penfold at the office intercepted wylie hints that he was bribed by messrs wardlaw nancy rouse suspects that it was arthur and says time will show as for me i can neither see why wylie should scuttle the ship unless he was bribed by somebody nor what arthur or his father could gain by destroying that ship this is all as dark as is that more cruel mystery which alone i care to solve chapter lxiii next morning after a sleepless night nancy rouse said to mr penfold havent i heard you say as banknotes could be traced to folk certainly madam said michael but it is necessary to take the numbers of them oh and how do you do that why every note has its own number la ye dont say so then them fifties are all numbered belike certainly and if you wish me to take down the numbers i will do so well sir some other day you shall i could not bear the sight of them just yet for it is them as has been the ruin of poor joe wylie i do think michael could not follow this but the question having been raised he advised her on grounds of common prudence not to keep them in the house without taking down their numbers we will talk about that in the evening said nancy accordingly at night nancy produced the notes and michael took down the numbers and descriptions in his pocketbook they ran from to and he promised her to try and ascertain through what hands they had passed he said he had a friend in the bank of england who might perhaps be able to discover to what private bank they had been issued in the first instance and then those bankers on a strong representation might perhaps examine their books and say to whom they had paid them he told her the notes were quite new and evidently had not been separated since their first issue nancy caught a glimpse of his meaning and set herself doggedly to watch until the person who had passed the notes through the chimney should come for them he will miss them said she you mark my words thus helen though reduced to a standstill herself had set an inquiry on foot which was alive and ramifying in the course of a few days she received a visit from mrs undercliff that lady came in and laid a prayerbook on the table saying i have brought it you back miss and i want you to do something for my satisfaction oh certainly said helen what is it well miss first examine the book and the writing is it all right helen examined it and said it was indeed said she the binding looks fresher if anything you have a good eye said mrs undercliff well what i want you to do is of course mr wardlaw is a good deal about you yes does he go to church with you ever no but he would if you were to ask him i have no doubt he would but why manage matters so that he shall go to church with you and then put the book down for him to see the writing all in a moment watch his face and tell me helen colored up and said no i cant do that why it would be turning gods temple into a trap besides the real reason first if you please said this horribly shrewd old woman well mr arthur wardlaw is the gentleman i am going to marry good heavens cried mrs undercliff taken utterly aback by this most unexpected turn why you never told me that no said helen blushing i did not think it necessary to go into that well of course it is not in human nature that mr wardlaw should be zealous in my good work or put himself forward but he has never refused to lend me any help that was in his power and it is repugnant to my nature to suspect him of a harm and to my feelings to lay a trap for him quite right said mrs undercliff of course i had no idea you were going to marry mr wardlaw i made sure mr penfold was the man helen blushed higher still but made no reply mrs undercliff turned the conversation directly my son has given many hours to mr hands two letters and he told me to tell you he is beginning to doubt whether mr hand is a real person with a real handwriting at all oh mrs undercliff why he wrote me two letters however i will ask mr penfold whether mr hand exists or not when shall i have the pleasure of seeing you again whenever you like my dear young lady but not upon this business of penfold and wardlaw i have done with it forever and my advice to you miss is not to stir the mud any more and with these mysterious words the old lady retired leaving helen deeply discouraged at her desertion however she noted down the conversation in her diary and made this comment people find no pleasure in proving an accused person innocent the charm is to detect guilt this day a good kind friend abandons me because i will not turn aside from my charitable mission to suspect another person as wrongfully as he i love has been suspected mem to see or make inquiries about mr hand general rolleston had taken a furnished house in hanover square he now moved into it and helen was compelled to busy herself in household arrangements she made the house charming but unfortunately stood in a draught while heated and caught a chill which a year ago would very likely have gone to her lungs and killed her but now settled on her limbs in violent neuralgic pains and confined her to her bed for a fortnight she suffered severely but had the consolation of finding she was tenderly beloved arthur sent flowers every day and affectionate notes twice a day and her father was constantly by her bedside at last she came down to the drawingroom but lay on the sofa well wrapped up and received only her most intimate friends the neuralgia had now settled on her right arm and hand so that she could not write a letter and she said to herself with a sigh oh how unfit a girl is to do anything great we always fall ill just when health and strength are most needed nevertheless during this period of illness and inaction circumstances occurred that gave her joy old wardlaw had long been exerting himself in influential channels to obtain what he called justice for his friend rolleston and had received some very encouraging promises for the generals services were indisputable and while he was stirring the matter helen was unconsciously cooperating by her beauty and the noise her adventure made in society at last a gentleman whose wife was about the queen promised old wardlaw one day that if a fair opportunity should occur that lady should tell helens adventure and how the gallant old general when everybody else despaired had gone out to the pacific and found his daughter and brought her home this lady was a courtier of ten years standing and waited her opportunity but when it did come she took it and she soon found that no great tact or skill was necessary on such an occasion as this she was listened to with ready sympathy and the very next day some inquiries were made the result of which was that the horse guards offered lieutenantgeneral rolleston the command of a crack regiment and a full generalship at the same time it was intimated to him from another official quarter that a baronetcy was at his service if he felt disposed to accept it the tears came into the stout old warriors eyes at this sudden sunshine of royal favor and helen kissed old wardlaw of her own accord and the star of the wardlaws rose into the ascendant and for a time robert penfold seemed to be quite forgotten the very day general rolleston became sir edward a man and a woman called at the charing cross hotel and asked for miss helen rolleston the answer was she had left the hotel about ten days where is she gone if you please we dont know why hasnt she left her new address no the footman came for letters several times no information was to be got here and mr penfold and nancy rouse went home greatly disappointed and puzzled what to do at first sight it might appear easy for mr penfold to learn the new address of miss rolleston he had only to ask arthur wardlaw but to tell the truth during the last fortnight nancy rouse had impressed her views steadily and persistently on his mind and he had also made a discovery that cooperated with her influence and arguments to undermine his confidence in his employer what that discovery was we must leave him to relate looking then at matters with a less unsuspicious eye than heretofore he could not help observing that arthur wardlaw never put into the office letterbox a single letter for his sweetheart he must write to her thought michael but i am not to know her address suppose after all he did intercept that letter and now like other simple credulous men whose confidence has been shaken he was literally brimful of suspicions some of them reasonable some of them rather absurd he had too little art to conceal his change of mind and so very soon after his vain attempt to see helen rolleston at the inn he was bundled off to scotland on business of the office nancy missed him sorely she felt quite alone in the world she managed to get through the daywork helped her but at night she sat disconsolate and bewildered and she was now beginning to doubt her own theory for certainly if all that money had been joe wylies he would hardly have left the country without it now the second evening after michaels departure she was seated in his room brooding when suddenly she heard a peculiar knocking next door she listened a little while and then stole softly downstairs to her own little room her suspicions were correct it was the same sort of knocking that had preceded the phenomenon of the hand and banknotes she peeped into the kitchen and whispered jennypollycome here a stout washerwoman and the mite of a servant came wondering now you stand there said nancy and do as i bid you hold your tongues now i know all about it the myrmidons stood silent but with panting bosoms for the mysterious knocking now concluded and a brick in the chimney began to move it came out and immediately a hand with a ring on it came through the aperture and felt about the mite stood firm but the big washerwoman gave signs of agitation that promised to end in a scream nancy put her hand roughly before the womans mouth hold your tongue ye great soft and without finishing her sentence she darted to the chimney and seized the hand with both her own and pulled it with such violence that the wrist followed it through the masonry and a roar was heard hold on to my waist polly she cried jenny take the poker and that string and tie his hand to it while we hold on quick quick are ye asleep thus adjured the mite got the poker against the wall and tried to tie the wrist to it this however was not easy the hand struggled so desperately however pulling is a matter of weight rather than muscle and the weight of the two women pulling downward overpowered the violent struggles of the man and the mite contrived to tie the poker to the wrist and repeat the ligatures a dozen times in a figure of eight then the owner of the hand who had hitherto shown violent strength taken at a disadvantage now showed intelligence convinced that skill as well as force were against him he ceased to struggle and became quite quiet the women contemplated their feat with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes when they had feasted a reasonable time on the imprisoned hand and two of them true to their sex had scrutinized a green stone upon one of the fingers to see whether it was real or false nancy took them by the shoulders and bundled them goodhumoredly out of the room she then lowered the gas and came out and locked the room up and put the key in her pocket ill have my supper with you said she come jenny im cook and you make the kitchen as a body could eat off it for i expect vicitors la maam said the mite he cant get out of the chimbly to visit hus through the street door no girl said nancy but he can send a hambassador so show her heyes and plague her art as the play says for of all the dirty kitchens give me hers i never was there but once and my slipper come off for the muck a sticking to a body like birdlime there was a knock at nancys street door the little servant full of curiosity was for running to it on the instant but nancy checked her take your time said she it is only a lodginghouse keeper chapter lxiv sir edward rolleston could not but feel his obligations to the wardlaws and when his daughter got better he spoke warmly on the subject and asked her to consider seriously whether she had not tried arthurs affection sufficiently he does not complain to you i know said he but he feels it very hard that you should punish him for an act of injustice that has already so deeply afflicted him he says he believes some fool or villain heard him say that two thousand pounds was to be borrowed between them and went and imposed on robert penfolds credulity meaning perhaps to call again after the note had been cashed and get arthurs share of the money but why did he not come forward he declares he did not know when the trial was till a month after and his father bears him out says he was actually delirious and his life in danger i myself can testify that he was cut down just in this way when he heard the proserpine was lost and you on board her why not give him credit for the same genuine distress at young penfolds misfortune come helen is it fair to afflict and punish this gentleman for the misfortune of another whom he never speaks of but with affection and pity he says that if you would marry him at once he thinks he should feel strong enough to throw himself into the case with you and would spare neither money nor labor to clear robert penfold but as it is he says he feels so wretched and so tortured with jealousy that he cant cooperate warmly with you though his conscience reproaches him every day poor young man his is really a very hard case for you promised him your hand before you ever saw robert penfold i did said helen but i did not say when let me have one year to my good work before i devote my whole life to arthur well it will be a year wasted why postpone your marriage for that i promised yes but he chose to fancy young wardlaw is his enemy you might relax that now he tells you he will cooperate with you as your husband now helen tell the truthis it a womans work have you found it so will not arthur do it better than you helen weakened already by days of suffering began to cry and say what shall i do what shall i do if you have any doubt my dear said sir edward then think of what i owe to these wardlaws and with that he kissed her and left her in tears and soon after sent arthur himself up to plead his own cause it was a fine summer afternoon the long french casements looking on the garden of the square were open and the balmy air came in and wooed the beautiful girls cheek and just stirred her hair at times arthur wardlaw came softly in and gazed at her as she lay her loveliness filled his heart and soul he came and knelt by her sofa and took her hand and kissed it and his own eyes glistened with tenderness he had one thing in his favor he loved her her knowledge of this had more than once befriended him and made her refuse to suspect him of any great ill it befriended him now she turned a look of angelic pity on him poor arthur she said you and i are both unhappy but we shall be happy ere long i hope said arthur helen shook her head then he patted her and coaxed her and said he would be her servant as well as a husband and no wish of her heart should go ungratified none said she fixing her eyes on him not one said he upon my honor then he was so soft and persuasive and alluded so delicately to her plighted faith that she felt like a poor bird caught in a silken net sir edward is very good said he he feels for me at that moment a note was sent up mr wardlaw is here and has asked me when the marriage is to be i cant tell him i look like a fool helen sighed deeply and had begun to gather those tears that weaken a woman she glanced despairingly to and fro and saw no escape then heaven knows why or whereforeprobably with no clear design at all but a womans weak desire to cause a momentary diversion to put off the inevitable for five minutesshe said to arthur please give me that prayerbook thank you it is right you should know this and she put coopers deposition and welchs into his hands he devoured them and started up in great indignation it is an abominable slander said he we have lost ten thousand pounds by the wreck of that ship and wylies life was saved by a miracle as well as your own it is a foul slander i hurl it from me and he made his words good by whirling the prayerbook out of window helen uttered a scream my mothers prayerbook she cried oh i beg pardon said he as well you may said she run and send george after it no ill go myself said he pray forgive me you dont know what a terrible slander they have desecrated your prayerbook with he ran out and was a long time gone he came back at last looking terrified i cant find it said he somebody has carried it off oh how unfortunate i am not find it said helen but it must be found of course it must be found said arthur a pretty scandal to go into the hands of heaven knows who i shall offer twenty guineas reward for it at once ill go down to the times this moment was ever anything so unlucky yes go at once said helen and ill send the servants into the square i dont want to say anything unkind arthur but you ought not to have thrown my prayerbook into the public street i know i ought not i am ashamed of it myself well let me see the advertisement you shall i have no doubt we shall recover it next morning the times contained an advertisement offering twenty guineas for a prayerbook lost in hanover square and valuable not in itself but as a relic of a deceased parent in the afternoon arthur called to know if anybody had brought the prayerbook back helen shook her head sadly and said no he seemed very sorry and so penitent that helen said do not despair and if it is gone why i must remember you have forgiven me something and i must forgive you the footman came in if you please miss here is a woman wishes to speak to you says she has brought a prayerbook oh show her up at once cried helen arthur turned away his head to hide a cynical smile he had good reasons for thinking it was not the one he had flung out of the window yesterday a tall woman came in wearing a thick veil that concealed her features she entered on her business at once you lost a prayerbook in this square yesterday madam yes you offer twenty guineas reward for it yes please to look at this one helen examined it and said with joy it was hers arthur was thunderstruck he could not believe his senses let me look at it said he his eyes went at once to the writing he turned as pale as death and stood petrified the woman took the prayerbook out of his unresisting hand and said youll excuse me sir but it is a large reward and gentlefolks sometimes go from their word when the article is found helen who was delighted at getting back her book and rather tickled at arthur having to pay twenty guineas for losing it burst out laughing and said give her the reward arthur i am not going to pay for your misdeeds with all my heart said arthur struggling for composure he sat down to draw a check what name shall i put hum edith hesket two ts no only one there thank you sir she put the check into her purse and brought the prayerbook to helen lock it up at once said she in a voice so low that arthur heard her murmur but not the words and she retired leaving helen staring with amazement and arthur in a cold perspiration chapter lxv when the springbok weighed anchor and left the island a solitary form was seen on telegraph hill when she passed eastward out of sight of that point a solitary figure was seen on the cliffs when her course brought the island dead astern of her a solitary figure stood on the east bluff of the island and was the last object seen from the boat as she left those waters forever what words can tell the sickening sorrow and utter desolation that possessed that yearning bosom when the boat that had carried helen away was out of sight he came back with uneven steps to the cave and looked at all the familiar objects with stony eyes and scarce recognized them for the sunshine of her presence was there no more he wandered to and fro in a heavy stupor broken every now and then by sharp pangs of agony that almost made him scream and so the poor bereaved creature wandered about all day he could not eat he could not sleep his misery was more than he could bear one day of desolation succeeded another and what men say so hastily was true for once his life was a burden he dragged it about with him he scarce knew how he began to hate all the things he had loved while she was there the beautiful cave all glorious with pearl that he had made for her he could not enter it the sight killed him and she not there he left paradise bay altogether at last and anchored his boat in a nook of seal bay and there he slept in general but sometimes he would lie down wherever he happened to be and sleep as long as he could to him to wake was a calamity and when he did wake it was always with a dire sense of reviving misery and a deep sigh at the dark day he knew awaited him his flesh wasted on his bones and his clothes hung loosely about him the sorrow of the mind reduced him almost to that miserable condition in which he had landed on the island the dog and the seal were faithful to him used to lie beside him and often whimpered their minds accustomed to communicate without the aid of speech found out heaven knows how that he was in grief or in sickness these two creatures perhaps saved his life or his reason they came between his bereaved heart and utter solitude thus passed a month of wretchedness unspeakable then his grief took a less sullen form he came back to paradise bay and at sight of it burst into a passion of weeping these were his first tears and inaugurated a grief more tender than ever but less akin to madness and despair now he used to go about and cry her name aloud passionately by night and day oh helen helen and next his mind changed in one respect and he clung to every reminiscence of her every morning he went round her haunts and kissed every place where he had seen her put her hand only the cave he could not yet face he tried too he went to the mouth of it again and again and looked in but go into it and face it empty of herhe could not he prayed often one night he saw her in a dream she bent a look of angelic pity on him and said but these words live in my cave then vanished alone on an island in the vast pacific who can escape superstition it fills the air he took this communication as a command and the next night he slept in the cave but he entered it in the dark and left it before dawn by degrees however he plucked up courage and faced it in daylight but it was a sad trial he came out crying bitterly after a few minutes still he persevered because her image had bade him and at last one evening he even lighted the lamp and sat there looking at the glorious walls and roof his hapless love had made getting stronger by degrees he searched about and found little relics of hera glove a needle a great hat she had made out of some large leaves all these he wept over and cherished but one day he found at the very back of the cave a relic that made him start as if a viper had stung his loving heart it was a letter he knew it in a moment it had already caused him many a pang but now it almost drove him mad arthur wardlaws letter he recoiled from it and let it lie he went out of the cave and cursed his hard fate but he came back it was one of those horrible things a man abhors yet cannot keep away from he took it up and dashed it down with rage many times but it all ended in his lighting the lamp at night and torturing himself with every word of that loving letter and she was going home to the writer of that letter and he was left prisoner on the island he cursed his generous folly and writhed in agony at the thought he raged with jealousy so that his very grief was blunted for a time he felt as if he must go mad then he prayedprayed fervently and at last worn out with such fierce and contending emotions he fell into a deep sleep and did not wake till the sun was high in heaven he woke and the first thing he saw was the fatal letter lying at his feet in a narrow stream of sunshine that came peering in he eyed it with horror this then was then to haunt him by night and day he eyed it and eyed it then turned his face from it but could not help eying it again and at last certain words in this letter seemed to him to bear an affinity to another piece of writing that had also caused him a great woe memory by its subtle links connected these two enemies of his together he eyed it still more keenly and that impression became strengthened he took the letter and looked at it close and held it at arms length and devoured it and the effect of this keen examination was very remarkable it seemed to restore the man to energy and to something like hope his eyes sparkled and a triumphant ah burst from his bosom he became once more a man of action he rose and bathed and walked rapidly to and fro upon the sands working himself up to a daring enterprise he took his saw into the jungle and cut down a tree of a kind common enough there it was wonderfully soft and almost as light as cork the wood of this was literally useless for any other purpose than that to which penfold destined it he cut a great many blocks of this wood and drilled holes in them and having hundreds of yard of good line attached these quasi corks to the gunwale so as to make a lifeboat this work took him several days during which time an event occurred that encouraged him one morning he saw about a million birds very busy in the bay and it proved to be a spermaceti whale come ashore he went out to her directly with all his tools for he wanted oil for his enterprise and the seal oil was exhausted when he got near the whale in his boat he observed a harpoon sticking in the animals back he cut steps with his ax in the slippery carcass and got up to it as well as he could extracted it by cutting and pulling and threw it down into his boat but not till he had taken the precaution to stick a great piece of blubber on the barbed point he then sawed and hacked under difficulties being buffeted and bothered with thousands of birds so eager for slices that it was as much as he could do to avoid the making of minced fowl but true to his gentle creed he contrived to get three hundredweight of blubber without downright killing any of these greedy competitors though he buffeted some of them and nearly knocked out what little sense they had he came ashore with his blubber and harpoon and when he came to examine the latter he found that the name of the owner was cut deeply in the steel josh fullalove j fernandez this inscription had a great effect on robert penfolds mind it seemed to bring the island of juan fernandez and humanity in general nearer to him he boiled down the blubber and put a barrel of oil on board his lifeboat he had a ships lantern to burn it in he also pitched her bottom as far as he could get at it and provisioned her for a long voyage taking care to lash the watercask and beefcask to the forethwart and foremast in case of rough weather when he had done all this it occurred to him suddenly that should he ever escape the winds and waves and get to england he would then have to encounter difficulties and dangers of another class and lose the battle by his poverty i play my stake now said he i will throw no chance away he reflected with great bitterness on the misery that want of money had already brought on him and he vowed to reach england rich or go to the bottom of the pacific this may seem a strange vow for a man to make on an unknown island but robert penfold had a powerful understanding sharpened by adversity and his judgment told him truly that he possessed wealth on this island both directly and indirectly in the first place knowledge is sometimes wealth and the knowledge of this island was a thing he could sell to the american merchants on the coast of chili and with this view he put on board his boat specimens of the cassia and other woods fruit spices pitch guano pink and red coral pearl oysters shells cochineal quartz cotton etc etc then he took his chisel and struck all the larger pearls off the shells that lined helens cave the walls and roof yielded nine enormous pearls thirty large ones and a great many of the usual size he made a pocket inside his waistcoat to hold the pearls safe then he took his spade and dug into the spanish ship for treasure but this was terrible work the sand returned upon the spade and trebled his labor the condition to which time and long submersion had reduced this ship and cargo was truly remarkable nothing to be seen of the deck but a thin brown streak that mingled with the sand in patches of the timbers nothing but the uprights and of those the larger half eaten and dissolved he dug five days and found nothing solid on the sixth being now at the bottom the ship he struck his spade against something hard and heavy on inspection it looked like ore but of what metal he could not tell it was as black as a coal he threw this on one side and found nothing more but the next day he turned up a smaller fragment which he took home and cleaned with lime juice it came out bright in places like silver this discovery threw light on the other the piece of black ore weighing about seven pounds was in reality silver coin that a century of submersion had reduced to the very appearance it wore before it ever went into the furnace he dug with fresh energy on this discovery but found nothing more in the ship that day then it occurred to him to carry off a few hundredweight of pink coral he got some fine specimens and while he was at that work he fell in with a piece that looked very solid at the root and unnaturally heavy on a nearer examination this proved to be a foreign substance incrusted with coral it had twined and twisted and curled over the thing in a most unheardof way robert took it home and by rubbing here and there with lemon juice at last satisfied himself that this object was a silver box about the size of an octavo volume it had no keyhole had evidently been soldered up for greater security and robert was left to conjecture how it had come there he connected it at once with the ship and felt assured that some attempt had been made to save it there it had lain by the side of the vessel all these years but falling clear of the sand had been embraced by the growing coral and was now a curiosity if not a treasure he would not break the coral but put it on board his lifeboat just as it was and now he dug no more he thought he could sell the galleon as well as the island by sample and he was impatient to be gone he reproached himself a little unjustly for allowing a woman to undertake the task of clearing him to what annoyances and perhaps affronts have i exposed her said he no it is a mans business to defend not to be defended to conclude at high tide one fine afternoon he went on board with ponto and hoisting his foresail only crossed the bay ranging along the island till he reached the bluff he got under this and by means of his compass and previous observations set the boats head exactly on the line the ducks used to take then he set his mainsail too and stretched boldly out across the great pacific ocean time seems to wear out everything even bad luck it ran strong against robert penfold for years but when it had struck its worst blow and parted him and helen rolleston it relaxed and a tide of good luck set in which unfortunately the brokenhearted man could not appreciate at the time however so it was he wanted oil and a whale came ashore he wanted treasure and the sea gave him a little back of all it had swallowed and now he wanted fine weather and the ocean for days and nights was like peachcolored glass dimpled here and there and soft westerly airs fanned him along by night and day to be sure he was on the true pacific ocean at a period when it is really free from storms still even for that latitude he had wonderful weather for six days and on the seventh he fell in with a schooner the skipper and crew of which looked over the bulwarks at him with wonder and cordiality and casting out a rope astern took him in tow the skipper had been eying him with amazement for some hours through his telescope but he was a man that had seen a great many strange things and it was also a point of honor with him never to allow that he was astonished or taken by surprise or greatly moved wal stranger said he what craft is that the helen where dye hail from not that i am curious from an unknown island do tell what another is it anyways nigh not within seven hundred miles jerusalem have you sailed all that in a cockleshell yes why what are ye the wandering jew afloat or the ancient mariner or only a kinder nautilus im a landsman a landsman then so is neptune what is your name when you are ashore robert penfold the reverend robert penfold the reverend jerusalem may i ask what is your name sir wal i reckon you may stranger im joshua fullalove from the states at present located on the island of juan fernandez joshua fullalove that is lucky ive got something that belongs to you he looked about and found the harpoon and handed it up in a mighty straightforward simple way joshua stared at him incredulously at first but afterward with amazement he handled the harpoon and inquired where robert had fallen in with it robert told him youre an honest man said fullalove you air come aboard he was then pleased to congratulate himself on his strange luck in having drifted across an honest man in the middle of the ocean ive heerd said he of an old chap as groped about all his life with a lantern and couldnt find one lets liquor he had some celestial mixture or other made including rum mint and snow from the andes and then began his interrogatories again disclaiming curiosity at set intervals whither bound honest man the coast of chili what for trade dye buy or sell not that it is my business i wish to sell whats the merchandise knowledge and treasure fullalove scratched his head haint ye got a few conundrums to swap for gold dust as well robert smiled faintly the first time this six weeks i have to sell the knowledge of an island with rich products and i have to sell the contents of a spanish treasureship that i found buried in the sand of that island the yankees eyes glistened wal said he i do business in islands myself ive leased this juan fernandez but one of them is enough at a time im monarch of all i survey but then what i survey is a mixallaneous bilin of irish and otaheitans that its pizen to be monarch of and now them darned irish has taken to converting the heathens to superstition and the worship of images and breaks their heads if they wont and the heathens are all smiles and sweetness and immorality no islands is no bait to me i never asked you said robert what i do ask you is to land me at valparaiso there ill find a purchaser and will pay you handsomely for your kindness that is fair said fullalove dryly what will you pay me ill show you said robert he took out of his pocket the smaller conglomeration of spanish coin and put it into fullaloves hand that said he is silver coin i dug out of the galleon fullalove inspected it keenly and trembled slightly robert then went lightly over the taffrail and slid down the low rope into his boat he held up the black mass we have described this is solid silver i will give it you and my best thanks to land me at valparaiso heave it aboard said the yankee robert steadied himself and hove it on board the yankee caught it heavy as it was and subjected it to some chemical test directly wal said he that is a bargain ill land ye at valparaiso for this jack lay her head sse and by e having given this order he leaned over the taffrail and asked for more samples robert showed him the fruits woods and shells and the pink coral and bade him observe that the boat was ballasted with pearl oysters he threw him up one and a bunch of pink coral he then shinned up the rope again and the interrogatories recommenced but this time he was questioned closely as to who he was and how he came on the island and the questions were so shrewd and penetrating that his fortitude gave way and he cried out in anguish man man do not torture me so oh do not make me talk of my grief and my wrongs they are more than i can bear fullalove forbore directly and offered him a cigar he took it and it soothed him a little it was long since he had smoked one his agitation subsided and a quiet tear or two rolled down his haggard cheek the yankee saw and kept silence but when the cigar was nearly smoked out he said he was afraid robert would not find a customer for his island and what a pity joshua fullalove was cool on islands just now oh said robert i know there are enterprising americans on the coast who will give me money for what i have to sell fullalove was silent a minute then he got a piece of wood and a knife and said with an air of resignation i reckon well have to deal need we say that to deal had been his eager desire from the first he now began to whittle a peg and awaited the attack what will you give me sir what money down and you got nothing to sell but chances why theres an old cuss about that knows where the island is as well as you do then of course you will treat with him said robert sadly darned if i do said the yankee you are in trouble and he is not nor never will be till he dies and then hell get it hot i calclate he is a thief and stole my harpoon you are an honest man and brought it back i reckon ill deal with you and not with that old cuss not by a jugful but it must be on a percentage you tell me the bearings of that there island and ill work it and pay five per cent on the gross would you mind throwing that piece of wood into the sea mr fullalove said robert caent be done nohow i caent deal without whittlin you mean you cant take an unfair advantage without it come mr fullalove let us cut this short i am as you say an honest and most unfortunate man sir i was falsely accused of a crime and banished my country i can prove my innocence now if i can but get home with a great deal of money so much for me you are a member of the vainest and most generous nation in the world wal now thats kinder honey and vinegar mixed said fullalove pretty good for a britisher though you are a man of that nation which in all the agonies and unparalleled expenses of civil war smarting too under anonymous taunts from england did yet send over a large sum to relieve the distresses of certain poor englishmen who were indirect victims of that same calamity the act the time the misery relieved the taunts overlooked prove your nation superior to all others in generosity at least my reading which is very large affords no parallel to it either in ancient or modern history mr fullalove please to recollect that you are a member of that nation and that i am very unhappy and helpless and want money to undo cruel wrongs but have no heart to chaffer much take the island and the treasures and give me half the profits you make is not that fair fullalove wore a rueful countenance darn the critter said he hell take skin off my bones if i dont mind fust britisher ever i met as had the sense to see that twas rather handsome warnt it wal human nature is deep every man you tackle in business larns ye something what with picking ye out o the sea and you giving me back the harpoon the cuss stole and your face like a young calf when you are the cutest fox out and you giving the great united states their due im no more fit to deal than mashed potatoes now i cave it is only for once next time dont you try to palaver me draw me a map of our island britisher and mark where the spaniard lies i tell you i know her name and the year she was lost in learned that at lima one day kinder startled me you did when you showed me the coin out of her wal theres my hand on haelf profits and if im keen im squar soon after this he led robert to his cabin and robert drew a large map from his models and fullalove being himself an excellent draughtsman and provided with proper instruments aided him to finish it next day they sighted valparaiso and hove to outside the port all the specimens of insular wealth were put on board the schooner and secreted for fullaloves first move was to get a lease of the island from the chilian government and it was no part of his plan to trumpet the article he was going to buy after a moments hesitation he declined to take the seven pounds of silver he gave as a reason that having made a bargain which compelled him to go to valparaiso at once he did not feel like charging his partner a fancy price for towing his boat thither at the same time he hinted that after all this the next customer would find him a very difficult yankee to get the better of with this understanding he gave robert a draft for eighty pounds on account of profits and this enabled him to take a passage for england with all his belongings he arrived at southampton very soon after the events last related and thence went to london fully alive to the danger of his position he had a friend in his long beard but he dared not rely on that alone like a mole he worked at night chapter lxvi helen asked arthur wardlaw why he was so surprised at the prayerbook being brought back was it worth twenty pounds to any one except herself arthur looked keenly at her to see whether she intended more than met the ear and then said he was surprised at the rapid effect of his advertisement that was all now you have got the book said he i do hope you will erase that cruel slander on one whom you mean to honor with your hand this proposal made helen blush and feel very miserable of the obnoxious lines some were written by robert penfold and she had so little of his dear handwriting i feel you are right arthur said she but you must give me time then they shall meet no eye but mine and on our weddingdayof courseall memorials of one tears completed the sentence arthur wardlaw raging with jealousy at the absent penfold as heretofore penfold had raged at him heaved a deep sigh and hurried away while helen was locking up the prayerbook in her desk by this means he retained helens pity he went home directly mounted to his bedroom unlocked a safe and plunged his hand into it his hand encountered a book he drew it out with a shiver and gazed at it with terror and amazement it was the prayerbook he had picked up in the square and locked up in that safe yet that very prayerbook had been restored to helen before his eyes and was now locked up in her desk he sat down with the book in his hand and a great dread came over him hitherto candor and credulity only had been opposed to him but now cunning had entered the field against him a master hand was cooperating with helen yet strange to say she seemed unconscious of that cooperation had robert penfold found his way home by some strange means was he watching over her in secret he had the woman he loved watched night and day but no robert penfold was detected he puzzled his brain night and day and at last he conceived a plan of deceit which is common enough in the east where lying is one of the fine arts but was new in this country we believe and we hope to heaven we shall not be the means of importing it an old clerk of his fathers now superannuated and pensioned off had a son upon the stage in a very mean position once a year however and of course in the dogdays he had a kind of benefit at his suburban theater that is to say the manager allowed him to sell tickets and take half the price of them he persuaded arthur to take some and even to go to the theater for an hour the man played a little part of a pompous sneak with some approach to nature he seemed at home arthur found this man out visited him at his own place he was very poor and mingled pomposity with obsequiousness so that arthur felt convinced he was to be bought body and soul what there was of him he sounded him accordingly and the result was that the man agreed to perform a part for him arthur wrote it and they rehearsed it together as to the dialogue that was so constructed that it could be varied considerably according to the cues which could be foreseen to a certain extent but not precisely since they were to be given by helen rolleston who was not in the secret but while this plot was fermenting other events happened with rather a contrary tendency and these will be more intelligible if we go back to nancy rouses cottage where indeed we have kept joseph wylie in an uncomfortable position a very long time mrs james from next door was at last admitted into nancys kitchen and her first word was i suppose you know what im come about maam which it is to return me the sasspan you borrowed no doubt was nancys ingenuous reply no maam but ill send my girl in with it as soon as she have cleaned it you may depend thank ye i shall be glad to see it again youre not afeard i shall steal it i hope la bless the woman dont fly out at a body like that i cant afford to give away my sasspan sasspans is not in my head nor in your hand neither im come about my lodger a most respectable gentleman which he have met with an accident he did but go to put something away in the chimbley which he is a curious gent and has traveled a good deal and learned the foreign customs when his hand was caught in the brickwork somehows and there he is hard and fast do you know anything about this said nancy to the mite severely no said the mite with a countenance of polished granite la bless me said nancy with a sudden start why is she talking about the thief as you and i catched putting his hand through the wall into my room and made him fast again the policeman comes round thief cried mrs james no more a thief than i am why sure you wouldnt ever be so cruel oh dear oh dear spite goes a far length there take an kill me do and then youll be easy in your mind ah little my poor father thought as ever i should come down to letting lodgings and being maltreated this way i am who is a maltreating of ye why youre dreaming have a drop o gin with them as takes the police to my lodger it would choke me well have a drop and well see about it youre very kind maam im sure heaven knows i need it heres wishing you a good husband and toward burying all unkindness which you means drounding of it ah youre never at a loss for a word maam and always in good spirits but your troubles is to come im a widdy you will let me see what is the matter with my lodger maam why not well go and have a look at him accordingly the three women and the mite proceeded to the little room nancy turned the gas on and then they inspected the imprisoned hand mrs james screamed with dismay and nancy asked her dryly whether she was to blame for seizing a hand which had committed a manifest trespass you have got the rest of his body said she but this here hand belongs to me lord maam what could he take out of your chimbley without twas a handful of soot do pray let me loose him not till i have said two words to him but how can you he isnt here to speak toonly a morsel of him i can go into your house and speak to him mrs james demurred to that but nancy stood firm mrs james yielded nancy whispered her myrmidons and in a few minutes was standing by the prisoner a reverend person in dark spectacles and a gray beard that created commiseration or would have done so but that this stroke of illfortune had apparently fallen upon a great philosopher he had contrived to get a seat under him and was smoking a pipe with admirable sangfroid at sight of nancy however he made a slight motion as if he would not object to follow his imprisoned hand through the partywall it was only for a moment the next he smoked imperturbably well sir said nancy i hopes you are comfortable thank ye miss yes im at a double sheetanchor why do you call me miss i dont know because you are so young and pretty that will do i only wanted to hear the sound of your voice joe wylie and with the word she snatched his wig off with one hand and his beard with the other and revealed his true features to his astonished landlady there mum said she i wish you joy of your lodger she tapped the chimney three times with the poker and telling mr wylie she had a few words to say to him in private retired for the present mrs james sat down and mourned the wickedness of mankind the loss of her lodger who would now go bodily next door instead of sending his hand and the better days she had by iteration brought herself to believe she had seen wylie soon entered nancys house and her first question was the pounds how did you get them no matter how i got them said wylie sulkily what have you done with them put them away that is all right im blest if i didnt think they were gone forever i wish they had never come illgotten money is a curse then she taxed him with scuttling the proserpine and asked him whether that money had not been the bribe but joe was obdurate i never split on a friend said he and you have nobody to blame but yourself you wouldnt splice without pounds i loved you and i got it how i could dye think a poor fellow like me can make pounds in a voyage by hauling in ropes and tying truelovers knots in the foretop nancy had her answer ready but this remembrance pricked her own conscience and paved the way to a reconciliation nancy had no highflown notions she loved money but it must be got without palpable dishonesty per contra she was not going to denounce her sweetheart but then again she would not marry him so long as he differed with her about the meaning of the eighth commandment this led to many arguments some of them warm some affectionate and so we leave mr wylie under the slow but salutary influence of love and unpretending probity he continued to lodge next door nancy would only receive him as a visitor chapter lxvii helen had complained to arthur of all people that she was watched and followed she even asked him whether that was not the act of some enemy arthur smiled and said take my word for it it is only some foolish admirer of your beauty he wants to know your habits in hopes of falling in with you you had better let me go out with you for the next month or so that sort of thing will soon die away as a necessary consequence of this injudicious revelation helen was watched with greater skill and subtlety and upon a plan well calculated to disarm suspicion a spy watched the door and by a signal unintelligible to any but his confederate whom helen could not possibly see set the latter on her track they kept this game up unobserved for several days but learned nothing for helen was at a standstill at last they got caught and by a truly feminine stroke of observation a showily dressed man peeped into a shop where helen was buying gloves with one glance of her womans eye she recognized a large breastpin in the worst possible taste thence her eye went up and recognized the features of her seedy follower though he was now dressed up to the nine she withdrew her eye directly completed her purchase and went home brooding defense and vengeance that evening she dined with a lady who had a large acquaintance with lawyers and it so happened that mr tollemache and mr hennessy were both of the party now when these gentlemen saw helen in full costume a queen in form as well as face coroneted with her island pearls environed with a halo of romance and courted by women as well as men they looked up to her with astonishment and made up to her in a very different style from that in which they had received her visit tollemache she received coldly he had defended robert penfold feebly and she hated him for it hennessy she received graciously and remembering roberts precept to be supple as a woman bewitched him he was goodnatured able and vain by eleven oclock she had enlisted him in her service when she had conquered him she said slyly but i ought not to speak of these things to you except through a solicitor that is the general rule said the learned counsel but in this case no dark body must come between me and the sun in short he entered into penfolds case with such wellfeigned warmth to please the beauteous girl that at last she took him by the horns and consulted i am followed said she i have no doubt you are and on a large scale if there is room for another i should be glad to join the train ha ha ill save you the trouble ill meet you half way but to be serious i am watched spied and followed by some enemy to that good friend whose sacred cause we have undertaken forgive me for saying we i am too proud of the companionship to let you off we is the word then advise me what to do i want to retaliate i want to discover who is watching me and why can you advise me will you the counsel reflected a moment and helen who watched him remarked the power that suddenly came into his countenance and brow you must watch the spies i have influence in scotland yard and will get it done for you if you went there yourself they would crossexamine you and decline to interfere ill go myself for you and put it in a certain light an able detective will call on you give him ten guineas and let him into your views in confidence then he will work the public machinery for you oh mr hennessy how can i thank you by succeeding i hate to fail and now your cause is mine next day a man with a hooked nose a keen black eye and a solitary foible mosaic called on helen rolleston and told her he was to take her instructions she told him she was watched and thought it was done to baffle a mission she had undertaken but having got so far she blushed and hesitated the more you tell me miss the more use i can be said mr burt thus encouraged and also remembering mr hennessys advice she gave mr burt as coldly as she could an outline of robert penfolds case and of the exertions she had made and the small result burt listened keenly and took a note or two and when she had done he told her something in return miss rolleston said he i am the officer that arrested robert penfold it cost me a grinder that he knocked out oh dear said helen how unfortunate then i fear i cannot reckon on your services why not miss what do you think i hold spite against a poor fellow for defending himself besides mr penfold wrote me a very proper note certainly for a parson the gent is a very quick hitter but he wrote very square said he hoped i would allow for the surprise and the agitation of an innocent man sent me two guineas too and said he would make it twenty but he was poor as well as unfortunate that letter has stuck in my gizzard ever since cant see the color of felony in it your felon is never in a fault and if he wears a good coat he isnt given to show fight it was very improper of him to strike you said helen and very noble of you to forgive it make him still more ashamed of it lay him under a deep obligation if he is innocent ill try and prove it said the detective he then asked her if she had taken notes she said she had a diary he begged to see it she felt inclined to withhold it because of the comments but remembering that this was womanish and that roberts orders to her were to be manly on such occasions she produced her diary mr burt read it very carefully and told her it was a very promising case you have done a great deal more than you thought he said you have netted the fish chapter lxviii i netted the fish what fish the man who forged the promissory note oh mr burt the same man that forged the newspaper extracts to deceive you forged the promissory note years ago and the man who is setting spies on you is the man who forged those extracts so we are sure to nail him he is in the net and very much to your credit leave the rest to me ill tell you more about it tomorrow you must order your carriage at one oclock tomorrow and drive down to scotland yard go into the yard and you will see me follow me without a word when you go back the other spies will be so frightened they will go off to their employer and so we shall nail him helen complied with these instructions strictly and then returned home leaving mr burt to work she had been home about half an hour when the servant brought her up a message saying that a man wanted to speak to her admit him said helen he is dressed very poor miss never mind send him to me she was afraid to reject anybody now lest she might turn her back on information a man presented himself in wellworn clothes with a washleather face and closeshaven chin a little of his forehead was also shaven madam my name is hand helen started i have already had the honor of writing to you yes sir said helen eying him with fear and aversion madam i am comehe hesitatedi am an unfortunate man weighed down by remorse for a thoughtless act that has ruined an innocent man and nearly cost my worthy employer his life i come to expiate as far as in me lies but let me be brief and hurry over the tale of shame i was a clerk at wardlaws office a billbroker called adams was talking to me and my fellowclerks and boasting that nobody could take him in with a feigned signature bets were laid our vanity was irritated by his pretension it was my fortune to overhear my young master and his friend robert penfold speak about a loan of two thousand pounds in an evil hour i listened to the tempter and wrote a forged note for that amount i took it to mr penfold he presented it to adams and it was cashed i intended of course to call next day and tell mr penfold and take him to adams and restore the money and get back the note it was not due for three months alas that very day it fell under suspicion mr penfold was arrested my young master was struck down with illness at his friends guilt though he never could be quite got to believe it and imiserable cowarddared not tell the truth ever since that day i have been a miserable man the other day i came into money and left wardlaws service but i carry my remorse with me madam i am come to tell the truth i dare not tell it to mr wardlaw i think he would kill me but i will tell it to you and you can tell it to him ay tell it to all the world let my shame be as public as his whom i have injured so deeply but heaven knows unintentionally iii mr hand sank all in a heap where he sat and could say no more helens flesh crawled at this confession and at the sight of this reptile who owned that he had destroyed robert penfold in fear and cowardice for a long time her wrath so overpowered all sense of pity that she sat trembling and if eyes could kill mr hand would not have outlived his confession at last she contrived to speak she turned her head away not to see the wretch and said sternly are you prepared to make this statement on paper if called on mr hand hesitated but said yes then write down that robert penfold was innocent and you are ready to prove it whenever you may be called upon write that down said hand unless your penitence is feigned you will sooner than that should be added to my crime i will avow all he wrote the few lines she required now your address that i may know where to find you at a moments notice he wrote j hand warwick street pimlico helen then dismissed him and wept bitterly in that condition she was found by arthur wardlaw who comforted her and on hearing her report of hands confession burst out into triumph and reminded her he had always said robert penfold was innocent my father said he must yield to this evidence and we will lay it before the secretary of state and get his pardon his pardon when he is innocent oh that is the formthe only form the rest must be done by the warm reception of his friends i for one who all these years have maintained his innocence will be the first to welcome him to my house an honored guest what am i saying can i dare i ought i when my wife ah i am more to be pitied than my poor friend is my friend my rival well i leave it to you whether he can come into your husbands house never but at least i can send the springbok out and bring him home and that i will do without one days delay oh arthur cried helen you set me an example of unselfishness i do what i can said arthur i am no saint i hope for a reward helen sighed what shall i do have pity on me your faithful lover and to whom your faith was plighted before ever you saw or knew my unhappy friend what can i do or suffer more than i have done and suffered for you my sweet helen have pity on me and be my wife i will some day bless you bless you one effort more what day i cant i cant my heart is dead this day fortnight let me speak to your father let him name the day as she made no reply he kissed her hand devotedly and did speak to her father sir edward meaning all for the best said this day fortnight chapter lxix the next morning came the first wedding presents from the jubilant bridegroom who was determined to advance step by step and give no breathing time when helen saw them laid out by her maid she trembled at the consequences of not giving a plump negative to so brisk a wooer the second post brought two letters one of them from mrs undercliff the other contained no words but only a pearl of uncommon size and pearshaped helen received this at first as another wedding present and an attempt on arthurs part to give her a pearl as large as those she had gathered on her dear island but looking narrowly at the address she saw it was not written by arthur and presently she was struck by the likeness of this pearl in shape to some of her own she got out her pearls laid them side by side and began to be moved exceedingly she had one of her instincts and it set every fiber quivering with excitement it was some time before she could take her eyes off the pearls and it was with a trembling hand she opened mrs undercliffs letter that missive was not calculated to calm her it ran thus my dear young ladya person called here last night and supplied the clew if you have the courage to know the truth you have only to come here and to bring your diary and all the letters you have received from any person or persons since you landed in england i am yours obediently jane undercliff the courage to know the truth this mysterious sentence affected helen considerably but her faith in robert was too great to be shaken she would not wait for the canonical hour at which young ladies go out but put on her bonnet directly after breakfast early as she was a visitor came before she could startmr burt the detective she received him in the library mr burt looked at her dress and her little bag and said im very glad i made bold to call so early you have got information of importance to communicate to me i think so miss and he took out his notebook the person you are watched by is mr arthur wardlaw the girl stared at him both spies report to him twice a day at his house in russell square be careful mr burt this is a serious thing to say and may have serious consequences well miss you told me you wanted to know the truth of course i want to know the truth then the truth is that you are watched by order of mr wardlaw burt continued his report a shabbylike man called on you yesterday yes it was mr hand mr wardlaws clerk and oh mr burt that wretched creature came and confessed the truth it was he who forged the note out of sport and for a bet and then was too cowardly to own it she then detailed hands confession his penitence comes too late said she with a deep sigh it hasnt come yet said burt dryly of course my lambs followed the man he went first to his employer and then he went home his name is not hand he is not a clerk at all but a little actor at the corinthian saloon hand is in america went three months ago i ascertained that from another quarter oh goodness cried helen what a wretched world i cant see my way a yard for stories how should you miss it is clear enough for all that mr wardlaw hired this actor to pass for hand and tell you a lie that he thought would please you helen put her hand to her brow and thought but her candid soul got sadly in the way of her brain mr burt said she will you go with me to mr undercliff the expert with pleasure maam but let me finish my report last night there was something new your house was watched by six persons two were wardlaws three were burts but the odd man was there on his own hook and my men could not make him out at all but they think one of wardlaws men knew him for he went off to russell square like the wind and brought mr wardlaw here in disguise now miss that is all and shall i call a cab and well hear undercliffs tale the cab was called and they went to undercliff on the way helen brooded but the detective eyed every man and everything on the road with the utmost keenness edward undercliff was at work at lithographing he received helen cordially nodded to burt and said she could not have a better assistant he then laid his facsimile of the forged note on the table with john wardlaws genuine writing and penfolds indorsement look at that mr burt burt inspected the papers keenly you know burt i swore at robert penfolds trial that he never wrote that forged note i remember said burt the other day this lady instructed me to discover if i could who did write the forged note but unfortunately the materials she gave me were not sufficient but last night a young man dropped from the clouds that i made sure was an agent of yours miss rolleston under that impression i was rather unguarded and i let him know how far we had got and could get no further i think i can help you says this young man and puts a letter on the table well mr burt a glance at that letter was enough for me it was written by the man who forged the note a letter said helen yes ill put the letter by the side of the forged note and if you have any eye for writing at all youll see at once that one hand wrote the forged note and this letter i am also prepared to swear that the letters signed hand are forgeries by the same person he then coolly put upon the table the letter from arthur wardlaw that helen had received on board the proserpine and was proceeding to point out the many points of resemblance between the letter and the document when he was interrupted by a scream from helen ah she cried he is here only one man in the world could have brought that letter i left it on the island robert is here he gave you that letter you are right said the expert and what a fool i must be i have no eye except for handwriting he had a beard and such a beard it is robert cried helen in raptures he is come just in time in time to be arrested said burt why his time is not out hell get into trouble again oh heaven forbid cried helen and turned so faint she had to be laid back on a chair and salts applied to her nostrils she soon came to and cried and trembled but prepared to defend her robert with all a womans wit burt and undercliff were conversing in a low voice and burt was saying he felt sure wardlaws spies had detected robert penfold and that robert would be arrested and put into prison as a runaway convict go to scotland yard this minute mr burt said helen eagerly what for why you must take the commission to arrest him you are our friend burt slapped his thigh with delight that is firstrate miss said he ill take the real felon first you may depend now mr undercliff write your report and hand it to miss helen with facsimiles it will do no harm if you make a declaration to the same effect before a magistrate you miss rolleston keep yourself disengaged and please dont go out you will very likely hear from me again today he drove off and helen though still greatly agitated by roberts danger and the sense of his presence now sat down trembling a little and compared arthurs letter with the forged document the effect of this comparison was irresistible the expert however asked her for some letter of arthurs that had never passed through robert penfolds hands she gave him the short note in which he used the very words robert penfold he said he would make that note the basis of his report while he was writing it mrs undercliff came in and helen told her all she said i came to the same conclusion long ago but when you said he was to be your husband ah said helen we women are poor creatures we can always find some reason for running away from the truth now explain about the prayerbook well miss i felt sure he would steal it so i made ned produce a facsimile and he did steal it what you got back was your mothers prayerbook of course i took care of that oh mrs undercliff cried helen do let me kiss you then they had a nice little cry together and by the time they had done the report was ready in duplicate ill declare this before a magistrate said the expert and then ill send it you at four oclock of this eventful day helen got a message from burt to say that he had orders to arrest robert penfold and that she must wear a mask and ask mr wardlaw to meet her at old mr penfolds at nine oclock but she herself must be there at halfpast eight without fail and bring undercliffs declaration and report with her and the prayerbook etc accordingly helen went down to old mr penfolds at halfpast eight and was received by nancy rouse and ushered into mr penfolds room that is to say nancy held the door open and on her entering the room shut it sharply and ran down stairs helen entered the room a man rose directly and came to her but it was not michael penfoldit was robert a faint scream a heavenly sigh and her head was on his shoulder and her arm round his neck and both their hearts panting as they gazed and then clung to each other and then gazed again with love unutterable after a while they got sufficient composure to sit down hand in hand and compare notes and helen showed him their weapons of defense the prayerbook the experts report etc a discreet tap was heard at the door it was nancy rouse on being invited to enter she came in and said oh miss helen ive got a penitent outside which he done it for love of me and now hell make a clean breast and the fault was partly mine come in joe and speak for yourself on this joe wylie came in hanging his head piteously she is right sir said he im come to ask your pardon and the ladys not as i ever meant you any harm but to destroy the ship it was a bad act and ive never throve since nance she have got the money ill give it back to the underwriters and if you and the lady will forgive a poor fellow that was tempted with love and money why ill stand to the truth for you though its a bitter pill i forgive you said robert and i accept your offer to serve me and so do i said helen indeed it is not us you have wronged but oh i am glad for nancys sake that you repent miss ill go through fire and water for you said wylie lifting up his head here old michael came in to say that arthur wardlaw was at the door with a policeman show him in said robert oh no robert said helen he fills me with horror show him in said robert gently sit down all of you now burt had not told arthur who was in the house so he came rather uneasy in his mind but still expecting only to see helen robert penfold told helen to face the door and the rest to sit back and this arrangement had not been effected one second when arthur came in with a lovers look and taking two steps into the room saw the three men waiting to receive him at sight of penfold he started and turned pale as ashes but recovering himself said my dearest helen this is indeed an unexpected pleasure you will reconcile me to one whose worth and innocence i never doubted and tell him i have had some little hand in clearing him his effrontery was received in dead silence this struck cold to his bones and being naturally weak he got violent he said allow me to send a message to my servant he then tore a leaf out of his memorandumbook wrote on it robert penfold is here arrest him directly and take him away and inclosing this in an envelope sent it out to burt by nancy helen seated herself quietly and said mr wardlaw when did mr hand go to america arthur stammered out i dont know the exact date two or three months ago yes then the person you sent to me to tell me that falsehood was not mr hand i sent nobody oh for shame for shame why have you set spies why did you make away with my prayerbook or what you thought was my prayerbook here is my prayerbook that proves you had the proserpine destroyed and i should have lost my life but for another whom you had done your best to destroy look robert penfold in the face if you can arthurs eyes began to waver i can said he i never wronged him i always lamented his misfortune you were not the cause neverso help me heaven monster said helen turning away in contempt and horror oh that is itis it said arthur wildly you break faith with me for him you insult me for him i must bear anything from you for i love you but at least i will sweep him out of the path he ran to the door opened it and there was burt listening are you an officer yes then arrest that man this moment he is robert penfold a convict returned before his time burt came into the room locked the door and put the key in his pocket well sir said he to robert penfold i know you are a quick hitter dont let us have a row over it this time if you have got anything to say say it quiet and comfortable i will go with you on one condition said robert you must take the felon as well as the martyr this is the felon and he laid his hand on arthurs shoulder who cowered under the touch at first but soon began to act violent indignation take the ruffian away at once he cried what before i hear what he has got to say would you listen to him against a merchant of the city of london a man of unblemished reputation well sir you see we have got a hint that you were concerned in scuttling a ship and that is a felony so i think ill just hear what he has got to say you need not fear any mans tongue if you are innocent sit down if you please and examine these documents said robert penfold as to the scuttling of the ship here is the deposition of two seamen taken on their deathbed and witnessed by miss rolleston and myself and that book he tried to steal said helen robert continued and here is undercliffs facsimile of the forged note here are specimens of arthur wardlaws handwriting and here is undercliffs report the detective ran his eye hastily over the report which we slightly condense on comparing the forged note with genuine specimens of john wardlaws handwriting no less than twelve deviations from his habits of writing strike the eye and every one of these twelve deviations is a deviation into a habit of arthur wardlaw which is an amount of demonstration rarely attained in cases of forgery the capital lcompare in london forged note with the same letter in london in wardlaws letter the capital dcompare this letter in date with the same letter in dearest the capital tcompare it in two and tollemache the word to see to pay in forged note and third line of letter small o formed with a loop in the upstroke the manner of finishing the letter v ditto the letter w the imperfect formation of the small a this and the looped o run through the forged note and arthur wardlaws letter and are habits entirely foreign to the style of john wardlaw see the th in connection ditto the of in connection the incautious use of the greek e john wardlaw never uses this e arthur wardlaw never uses any other apparently the writer of the forged note began right but at the word robert penfold glided insensibly into his greek e and maintained it to the end of the forgery this looks as if he was in the habit of writing those two words compare the words robert penfold in the forged document with the same words in the letter the similarity is so striking that on these two words alone the writer could be identified beyond a doubt great pains were taken with the signature and it is like john wardlaws writing on the surface but go below the surface and it is all arthur wardlaw the looped o the small r the l drooping below the d the open a are all arthur wardlaws the open loop of the final w is a still bolder deviation into a w s own hand the final flourish is a curious mistake it is executed with skill and freedom but the writer has made the lower line the thick one yet john wardlaw never does this how was the deviation caused examine the final flourish in arthur wardlaws signature it contains one stroke only but then that stroke is a thick one he thought he had only to prolong his own stroke and bring it round he did this extremely well but missed the deeper characteristicthe thick upper stroke this is proof of a high character and altogether i am prepared to testify upon oath that the writer of the letter to miss rolleston who signs himself arthur wardlaw is the person who forged the promissory note to these twelve proofs one more was now added arthur wardlaw rose and with his knees knocking together said dont arrest him burt let him go dont let him go cried old penfold a villain i have got the number of the notes from benson i can prove he bribed this poor man to destroy the ship dont let him go he has ruined my poor boy at this arthur wardlaw began to shriek for mercy oh mr penfold said he you are a father and hate me but think of my father ill say anything do anything ill clear robert penfold at my own expense i have lost her she loathes me now have mercy on me and let me leave the country he cringed and crawled so that he disarmed anger and substituted contempt ay said burt he dont hit like you mr penfold this is a chap that ought to have been in newgate long ago but take my advice make him clear you on paper and then let him go ill go downstairs awhile i mustnt take part in compounding a felony oh yes robert said helen for his fathers sake very well said robert now then reptile take the pen and write in your own hand if you can he took the pen and wrote to dictation i arthur wardlaw confess that i forged the promissory note for pounds and sent it to robert penfold and that pounds of it was to be for my own use and to pay my oxford debts and i confess that i bribed wylie to scuttle the ship proserpine in order to cheat the underwriters penfold then turned to wylie and asked him the true motive of this fraud why the gold was aboard the shannon said wylie i played hankypanky with the metals in whites store put that down said penfold now go on make a clean breast said wylie i have say as how you cooked the proserpines log and forged hiram hudsons writing and the newspaper extracts you sent me said helen and the letters from mr hand arthur groaned must i tell all that said he every word or be indicted said robert penfold sternly he wrote it all down and then sat staring stupidly and the next thing was he gave a loud shriek and fell on the floor in a fit they sprinkled water over him and burt conveyed him home in a cab advising him to leave the country but at the same time promising him not to exasperate those he had wronged so deeply but rather to moderate them if required then he gave burt fifty guineas robert penfold at helens request went with her to mr hennessy and with the proofs of arthurs guilt and roberts innocence and he undertook that the matter should go in proper form before the secretary of state but somehow it transpired that the proserpine had been scuttled and several of the underwriters wrote to the wardlaws to threaten proceedings wardlaw senior returned but one answer to these gentlemen bring your proofs to me at my place of business next monday at twelve and let me judge the case before you go elsewhere that is high and mighty said one or two but they conferred and agreed to these terms so high stood the old merchants name they came they were received with stiff courtesy the deposition of cooper and welch was produced and wylie kept up to the mark by nancy told the truth and laid his two thousand pounds intact down on the table now that is off my stomach said he and im a man again ay and ill marry you next week said nancy well gentlemen said old wardlaw my course seems very clear i will undo the whole transaction and return you your money less the premiums but plus five per cent interest and this he did on the spot for the firm was richer than ever when they were gone robert penfold came in and said i hear sir you devote this day to repairing the wrongs done by your firm what can you do for me he laid a copy of arthurs confession before him the old man winced a moment where he sat and the iron passed through his soul it was a long time before he could speak at last he said this wrong is irreparable i fear robert said nothing sore as his own heart was he was not the one to strike a grand old man struggling so bravely against dishonor wardlaw senior touched his handbell request mr penfold to step this way michael penfold came gentlemen said the old merchant the house of wardlaw exists no more it was built on honesty and cannot survive a fraud wardlaw and son were partners at will i had decided to dissolve that partnership wind up the accounts and put up the shutters but now if you like i will value the effects and hand the business over to penfold and son on easy terms robert penfold has been accused of forging john wardlaws name to prove this was a calumny i put penfold over my door instead of wardlaw the city of london will understand that gentlemen believe me mr wardlaw said robert you are a just a noble he could say no more ah sir said michael if the young gentleman had only been like you mention his name no more to me his crime and his punishment have killed me oh said robert hastily he shall not be punished for your sake not be punished it is not in your hands to decide god has punished him he is insane good heavens quite madquite mad gentlemen i can no longer support this interview send me your solicitors address the deeds shall be prepared i wish the new firm success probity is the road to it goodday he wound up the affairs had his name and arthurs painted out at his own expense and directed the painters to paint the penfolds in at theirs went home to elmtrees and died in three days he died lamented and honored and robert penfold was much affected he got it into his head that he had killed him with arthurs confession putting it before him so suddenly i have forgotten who said vengeance is mine said robert penfold the merchant priest left the office to be conducted by his father he used the credit of the new firm to purchase a living in the vale of kent and thither he retired grateful to providence but not easy in his conscience he now accused himself of having often distrusted god and seen his fellow creatures in too dark a light he turned toward religion and the care of souls past suffering enlightens a man and makes him tender and people soon began to walk and drive considerable distances to hear the new vicar he had a lake with a peninsula the shape of which he altered at a great expense as soon as he came there he wrote to helen every day and she to him neither could do anything con amore till the post came in one afternoon as he was preaching with great unction he saw a long puritanical face looking up at him with a droll expression of amazement and halfirony the stranger called on him and began at once wal parson you are a buster you air you ginn it us hotyou did im darned if i aint kinder ashamed to talk of this worlds goods to a saint upon airth like you but i never knowed a parson yet as couldnt collar the dollars after this preamble he announced that he had got a lease of the island from chili dug a lot of silver plate out of the galleon sold ten tons of choice coral and a shipload of cassia and cocoanuts he had then disposed of his lease to a californian company for a large sum and his partners share of net profits came to pounds s d which sum he had paid to michael for robert penfold in drafts on baring at thirty days after sight robert shook his hand and thanked him sincerely for his ability and probity he stayed that night at the vicarage and by that means fell in with another acquaintance general rolleston and his daughter drove down to see the parsonage helen wanted to surprise robert and as often happens she surprised herself she made him show her everything and so he took her on to his peninsula lo the edges of it had been cut and altered so that it presented a miniature copy of godsend island as soon as she saw this helen turned round with a sudden cry of love oh robert and the lovers were in each others arms what could any other man ever be to me and what could any other woman ever be to me they knew that before but this miniature island made them speak out and say it the weddingday was fixed before she left her majesty pardoned this scholar hero and worthy the crime he had never committed nancy rouse took the penitent wylie without the pounds but old penfold who knew the whole story lent the money at three per cent so the wylies pay a groundrent of pounds a year for a property which by mrs wylies industry and judgment is worth at least pounds she pays this very cheerfully and appeals to joe whether that is not better than the other way why joe says she to a woman like me thats afoot all day tis worth sixty pounds a year to be a good sleeper and i shouldnt be that if i had wronged my neighbor arthur wardlaw is in a private lunatic asylum and is taken great care of in his lucid intervals he suffers horrible distress of mind but though sad to see these agonies furnish the one hope of his ultimate recovery when not troubled by these returns of reason he is contented enough his favorite employment is to get mr undercliffs facsimiles and to write loveletters to helen rolleston which are duly deposited in the postoffice of the establishment these letters are in the handwriting of charles i paoli lord bacon alexander pope lord chesterfield nelson lord shaftesbury addison the late duke of wellington and so on and strange to say the greek e never appears in any of them they are admirably like though the matter is not always equally consistent with the characters of those personages helen rolleston married robert penfold on the weddingday the presents were laid out and among them there was a silver box incrusted with coral female curiosity demanded that this box should be opened helen objected but her bridesmaids rebelled the whole company sided with them and robert smiled a careless assent a blacksmith and carpenter were both enlisted and with infinite difficulty the poor box was riven open inside was another box locked but with no key that was opened with comparative ease and then handed to the bride it contained nothing but papal indulgences and rough stones and fair throats were opened in some disappointment a lady however of more experience examined the contents and said that in her opinion many of them were uncut gems of great price there was certainly a quantity of jaspers and bloodstones and others of no value at all but look at these two pearlshaped diamonds said she why they are a little fortune and oh the stone that struck this fair creature dumb was a rough ruby as big as a blackbirds egg and of amazing depth and fire no lady in england said she has a ruby to compare with this the information proved correct the box furnished helen with diamonds and emeralds of great thickness and quality but the huge ruby placed her on a level with sovereigns she wears it now and then in london but not often it attracts too much attention blazing on her fair forehead like a star and eclipses everything well what her ruby is among stones she is among wives and he is worthy of her through much injustice suffering danger and trouble they have passed to health happiness and peace and that entire union of two noble hearts in loyal friendship and wedded love which is the truest bliss this earth affords

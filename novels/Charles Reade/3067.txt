foreign words are ignored two chapters named chapter xli preface hard cash like the cloister and the hearth is a matteroffact romancethat is a fiction built on truths and these truths have been gathered by long severe systematic labour from a multitude of volumes pamphlets journals reports bluebooks manuscript narratives letters and living people whom i have sought out examined and crossexamined to get at the truth on each main topic i have striven to handle the madhouse scenes have been picked out by certain disinterested gentlemen who keep private asylums and periodicals to puff them and have been met with bold denials of public facts and with timid personalities and a little easy cant about sensation novelists but in reality those passages have been written on the same system as the nautical legal and other scenes the best evidence has been ransacked and a large portion of this evidence i shall be happy to show at my house to any brother writer who is disinterested and really cares enough for truth and humanity to walk or ride a mile in pursuit of them charles reade bolton row mayfair december this slang term is not quite accurate as applied to me without sensation there can be no interest but my plan is to mix a little character and a little philosophy with the sensational element hard cash prologue in a snowy villa with a sloping lawn just outside the great commercial seaport barkington there lived a few years ago a happy family a lady middleaged but still charming two young friends of hers and a periodical visitor the lady was mrs dodd her occasional visitor was her husband her friends were her son edward aged twenty and her daughter julia nineteen the fruit of a misalliance mrs dodd was originally miss fountain a young lady well born high bred and a denizen of the fashionable world under a strange concurrence of circumstances she coolly married the captain of an east indiaman the deed done and with her eyes open for she was not to say in love with him she took a judicious lineand kept it no hankering after mayfair no talking about lord this and lady that to commercial gentlewomen no amphibiousness she accepted her place in society reserving the right to embellish it with the graces she had gathered in a higher sphere in her home and in her person she was little less elegant than a countess yet nothing more than a merchantcaptains wife and she reared that commanders children in a suburban villa with the manners which adorn a palace when they happen to be there she had a bugbear slang could not endure the smart technicalities current their multitude did not overpower her distaste she called them jargonslang was too coarse a word for her to apply to slang she excluded many a good racy idiom along with the real offenders and monosyllables in general ran some risk of having to show their passports if this was pedantry it went no further she was open free and youthful with her young pupils and had the art to put herself on their level often when they were quite young she would feign infantine ignorance in order to hunt trite truth in couples with them and detect by joint experiment that rainbows cannot or else will not be walked into nor jackolantern be gathered like a cowslip and that dissect we the vocal dogwhose hair is so like a lambsnever so skilfully no fragment of palpable bark no sediment of tangible squeak remains inside him to bless the inquisitive little operator c c when they advanced from these elementary branches to languages history tapestry and what not she managed still to keep by their side learning with them not just hearing them lessons down from the top of a high tower of maternity she never checked their curiosity but made herself share it never gave them as so many parents do a whitelying answer wooed their affections with subtle though innocent art thawed their reserve obtained their love and retained their respect briefly a female chesterfield her husbands lover after marriage though not before and the mild monitress the elder sister the favourite companion and bosom friend of both her children they were remarkably dissimilar and perhaps i may be allowed to preface the narrative of their adventures by a delineation as in country churches an individual pipes the keynote and the tune comes raging after edward then had a great calm eye that was always looking folk full in the face mildly his countenance comely and manly but no more too square for apollo but sufficed for john bull his figure it was that charmed the curious observer of male beauty he was five feet ten had square shoulders a deep chest masculine flank small foot high instep to crown all this a head overflowed by ripples of dark brown hair sat with heroic grace upon his solid white throat like some glossy falcon new lighted on a parian column this young gentleman had decided qualities positive and negative he could walk up to a fivebarred gate and clear it alighting on the other side like a fallen feather could row all day and then dance all night could fling a cricket ball a hundred and six yards had a lathe and a toolbox and would make you in a trice a chair a table a doll a nutcracker or any other moveable useful or the very reverse and could not learn his lessons to save his life his sister julia was not so easy to describe her figure was tall lithe and serpentine her hair the colour of a horsechestnut fresh from its pod her ears tiny and shelllike her eyelashes long and silky her mouth small when grave large when smiling her eyes pure hazel by day and tinged with a little violet by night but in jotting down these details true as they are i seem to myself to be painting fire with a little snow and saffron mixed on a marble pallet there is a beauty too spiritual to be chained in a string of items and julias fair features were but the china vessel that brimmed over with the higher loveliness of her soul her essential charm was what shall i say transparence you would have said her very body thought modesty intelligence and above all enthusiasm shone through her and out of her and made her an airy fiery household joy briefly an incarnate sunbeam this one could learn her lessons with unreasonable rapidity and until edward went to eton would insist upon learning his into the bargain partly with the fond notion of coaxing him on as the company of a swift horse incites a slow one partly because she was determined to share his every trouble if she could not remove it a little choleric and indeed downright prone to that more generous indignation which fires at the wrongs of others when heated with emotion or sentiment she lowered her voice instead of raising it like the rest of us she called her mother lady placid and her brother sir imperturbable and so much for outlines mrs dodd laid aside her personal ambition with her maiden name but she looked high for her children perhaps she was all the more ambitious for them that they had no rival aspirant in mrs dodd she educated julia herself from first to last but with true feminine distrust of her power to mould a lordling of creation she sent edward to eton at nine this was slackening her tortoise for at eton is no female master to coax dry knowledge into a slow head however he made good progress in two branchesaquatics and cricket after eton came the choice of a profession his mother recognised but four and these her discreet ambition speedily sifted down to two for military heroes are shot now and then however pacific the century and naval ones drowned she would never expose her edward to this class of accidents glory by all means glory by the pail but safe glory please or she would none of it remained the church and the bar and within these reasonable limits she left her dear boy free as air and not even hurriedthere was plenty of time to choose he must pass through the university to either this last essential had been settled about a twelvemonth and the very day for his going to oxford was at hand when one morning mr edward formally cleared his throat it was an unusual act and drew the ladies eyes upon him he followed the solemnity up by delivering calmly and ponderously a connected discourse which astonished them by its length and purport mamma dear let us look the thing in the face this was his favourite expression as well as habit i have been thinking it quietly over for the last six months why send me to the university i shall be out of place there it will cost you a lot of money and no good now you take a fools advice dont you waste your money and papas sending a dull fellow like me to oxford i did bad enough at eton make me an engineer or something if you were not so fond of me and i of you id say send me to canada with a pickaxe you know i have got no headpiece mrs dodd had sat aghast casting edward deprecating looks at the close of each ponderous sentence but too polite to interrupt a soul even a son talking nonsense she now assured him she could afford very well to send him to oxford and begged leave to remind him that he was too good and too sensible to run up bills there like the young men who did not really love their parents then as for learning why we must be reasonable in our turn do the best you can love we know you have no great turn for the classics we do not expect you to take high honours like young mr hardie besides that might make your head ache he has sad headaches his sister told julia but my dear an university education is indispensable do but see how the signs of it follow a gentleman through life to say nothing of the valuable acquaintances and lasting friendships he makes there even those few distinguished persons who have risen in the would without it have openly regretted the want and have sent their children and that says volumes to me why edward it is the hallmark of a gentleman said julia eagerly mrs dodd caught a flash of her daughter and my silver shall never be without it said she warmly she added presently in her usual placid tone i beg your pardon my dears i ought to have said my gold with this she kissed edward tenderly on the brow and drew an embrace and a little grunt of resignation from him take the dear boy and show him our purchases love said mrs dodd with a little gentle accent of half reproach scarce perceptible to a male ear oh yes and julia rose and tripped to the door there she stood a moment half turned with arching neck colouring with innocent pleasure come darling oh you goodfornothing thing the pair found a little room hard by paved with china crockery glass baths kettles c there sir look them in the face and us if you can well you know i had no idea you had been and bought a cartload of things for oxford his eye brightened he whipped out a twofoot rule and began to calculate the cubic contents ill turn to and make the cases ju the ladies had their way the cases were made and despatched and one morning the bus came for edward and stopped at the gate of albion villa at this sight mother and daughter both turned their heads quickly away by one independent impulse and set a bad example apparently neither of them had calculated on this paltry little detail they were game for theoretical departures to impalpable universities and an airdrawn bus a bus of the mind would not have dejected for a moment their lofty spartan souls on glory bent safe glory but here was a bus of wood and edward going bodily away inside it the victim kissed them threw up his portmanteau and bag and departed serene as italian skies the victors watched the pitiless bus quite out of sight then went up to his bedroom all disordered by packing and on the very face of it vacant and sat down on his little bed intertwining and weeping edward was received at exeter college as young gentlemen are received at college and nowhere else i hope for the credit of christendom they showed him a hole in the roof and called it an attic grim pleasantry being a puncture in the modern athens they inserted him told him what hour at the top of the morning he must be in chapel and left him to find out his other ills his cases were welcomed like christians by the whole staircase these undergraduates abused one anothers crockery as their own the joint stock of breakables had just dwindled very low and mrs dodds bountiful contribution was a godsend the new comer soon found that his views of a learned university had been narrow out of place in it why he could not have taken his wares to a better market the modern athens like the ancient cultivates muscle as well as mind the captain of the university eleven saw a cricketball thrown all across the ground he instantly sent a professional bowler to find out who that was through the same ambassador the thrower was invited to play on club days and proving himself an infallible catch and longstop a mighty thrower a swift runner and a steady though not very brilliant bat he was after one or two repulses actually adopted into the university eleven he communicated this ray of glory by letter to his mother and sister with genuine delight coldly and clumsily expressed they replied with feigned and fluent rapture advancing steadily in that line of academic study towards which his genius lay he won a hurdle race and sent home a little silver hurdle and soon after brought a pewter pot with a latin inscription recording the victory at fives of edward dodd but not too arrogantly for in the centre of the pot was this device the lord is my illumination the curate of sandford who pulled number six in the exeter boat left sandford for witney on this he felt he could no longer do his college justice by water and his parish by land nor escape the charge of pluralism preaching at witney and rowing at oxford he fluctuated sighed kept his witney and laid down his oar then edward was solemnly weighed in his jersey and flannel trousers and proving only eleven stone eight whereas he had been ungenerously suspected of twelve stone was elected to the vacant oar by acclamation he was a picture in a boat and oh well pulled six was a hearty ejaculation constantly hurled at him from the bank by many men of other colleges and even by the more genial among the cads as the exeter glided at ease down the river or shot up it in a race there was at this time a prejudice against weight which has yielded to experience he was now as much talked of in the university as any man of his college except one singularly enough that one was his townsman but no friend of his he was much edwards senior in standing though not in age and this is a barrier the junior must not step overwithout direct encouragementat oxford moreover the college was a large one and some of the sets very exclusive young hardie was doge of a studious clique and careful to make it understood that he was a reading man who boated and cricketed to avoid the fatigue of lounging not a boatman or cricketer who strayed into aristotle in the intervals of perspiration his public running since he left harrow was as follows the prize poem in his fourth term the sculls in his sixth the ireland scholarship in his eighth he pulled second for it the year before stroke of the exeter in his tenth and reckoned sure of a first class to consummate his twofold career to this young apollo crowned with variegated laurel edward looked up from a distance the brilliant creature never bestowed a word on him by land and by water only such observations as the following time six well pulled six very well pulled six except bythebye one race when he swore at him like a trooper for not being quicker at starting the excitement of nearly being bumped by brasenose in the first hundred yards was an excuse however hardie apologised as they were dressing in the barge after the race but the apology was so stiff it did not pave the way to an acquaintance young hardie rising twentyone thought nothing human worthy of reverence but intellect invited to dinner on the same day with the emperor of russia and with voltaire and with meek st john he would certainly have told the coachman to put him down at voltaire his quick eye detected edwards character but was not attracted by it says he to one of his adherents what a goodnatured spoon that dodd is phoebus what a name edward on the other hand praised this brilliant in all his letters and recorded his triumphs and such of his witty sayings as leaked through his own set to reinvigorate mankind this roused julias ire it smouldered through three letters but burst out when there was no letter but mrs dodd meaning heaven knows no harm happened to say meekly a propos of edward you know love we cannot all be young hardies no and thank heaven said julia defiantly yes mamma she continued in answer to mrs dodds eyebrow which had curved your mild glance reads my soul i detest that boy mrs dodd smiled are you sure you know what the word detest means and what has young mr hardie done that you should bestow so violent a sentiment on him mamma i am edwards sister was the tragic reply then kicking off the buskin pretty nimbly there he beats our boy at everything and ours sits quietly down and admires him for it oh how can a man let anybody or anything beat him i wouldnt without a desperate struggle she clenched her white teeth and imagined the struggle to be sure she owned she had never seen this mr hardie but after all it was only jane hardies brother as edward was hers and would i sit down and let jane beat me at things never never never i couldnt your friend to the death dear was not that your expression oh that was a slip of the tongue dear mamma i was off my guard i generally am by the way but now i am on it and propose an amendment now i second it now i carry it and now let me hear it she is my friend till deathor eclipse and that means until she eclipses me of course but she added softly and with sudden gravity ah jane hardie has a fault which will always prevent her from eclipsing your humble servant in this wicked world what is that she is too good much par exemple too religious oh that is another matter for shame mamma i am glad to hear it for i scorn a life of frivolity but then again i should not like to give up everything you know mrs dodd looked a little staggered too at so vast a scheme of capitulation but everything was soon explained to mean balls concerts dinnerparties in general teaparties without exposition of scripture races and operas cards charades and whatever else amuses society without perceptibly sanctifying it all these by julias account miss hardie had renounced and was now denouncing with the young the latter verb treads on the very heels of the former and you know she is a district visitor this climax delivered julia stopped short and awaited the result mrs dodd heard it all with quiet disapproval and cool incredulity she had seen so many young ladies healed of many young enthusiasms by a wedding ring but while she was searching diligently in her mine of ladylike englishmine with plenty of water in it begging her pardonfor expressions to convey inoffensively and roundabout her conviction that miss hardie was a little furious simpleton the post came and swept the subject away in a moment two letters one from calcutta one from oxford they came quietly in upon one salver and were opened and read with pleasurable interest but without surprise or misgiving and without the slightest foretaste of their grave amid singular consequences rivers deep and broad start from such little springs davids letter was of unusual length for him the main topics were first the date and manner of his return home his ship a very old one had been condemned in port and he was to sail a fine new teakbuilt vessel the agra as far as the cape where her captain just recovered from a severe illness would come on board and convey her and him to england in future dodd was to command one of the companys large steamers to alexandria and back it is rather a comedown for a sailor to go straight ahead like a wheelbarrow in all weathers with a steampot and a crew of coalheavers but then i shall not be parted from my sweetheart such long dreary spells as i have been thus twenty years my dear love so is it for me to complain the second topic was pecuniary the transfer of their savings from india where interest was higher than at home but the capital not so secure and the third was ardent and tender expressions of affection for the wife and children he adored these effusions of the heart had no separate place except in my somewhat arbitrary analysis of the honest sailors letter they were the under current mrs dodd read part of it out to julia in fact all but the money matter that concerned the heads of the family more immediately and cash was a topic her daughter did not understand nor care about and when mrs dodd had read it with glistening eyes she kissed it tenderly and read it all over again to herself and then put it into her bosom as naively as a milkmaid in love edwards letter was short enough and mrs dodd allowed julia to read it to her which she did with panting breath and glowing cheeks and a running fire of comments dear mamma i hope you and ju are quite well ju murmured mrs dodd plaintively and that there is good news about papa coming home as for me i have plenty on my hands just now all this term i have been training scratched out and another word put in c r oh i know cramming cramming love yes that is the oxfordish for studying for smalls mrs dodd contrived to sigh interrogatively julia who understood her every accent reminded her that smalls was the new word for little go cramming for smalls and now i am in two races at henley and that rather puts the snaffie on reading and gooseberry pie goodness me and adds to my chance of being ploughed for smalls what does it all mean inquired mamma gooseberry pie and the snaffle and ploughed well the gooseberry pie is really too deep for me but ploughed is the new oxfordish for plucked o mamma have you forgotten that plucked was vulgar so now they are ploughed for smalls but i hope i shall not be to vex you and puss heaven forbid he should be so disgraced but what has the cat to do with it nothing on earth puss that is me how dare he did i not forbid all these nicknames and all this oxfordish by proclamation last long last long hem last protracted vacation dear mamma sometimes i cannot help being down in the mouth why it is a string of pearls to think you have not got a son like hardie at this unfortunate reflection it was julias turn to suffer she deposited the letter in her lap and fired up now have not i cause to hate and scorn and despise le petit hardie julia i mean to dislike with propriety and gently to abominatemr hardie junior dear mamma do come to henley on the tenth you and ju the university eights will not be there but the head boats of the oxford and cambridge river will and the oxford head boat is exeter you know and i pull six then i am truly sorry to hear it my poor boy will overtask his strength and how unfair of the other young gentlemen it seems ungenerous unreasonable my poor child against so many and i am entered for the sculls as well and if you and the impetuosity vengeance were looking on from the bank i do think i should be lucky this time henley is a long way from barkington but it is a pretty place all the ladies admire it and like to see both the universities out and a stunning race oh well there is an epithet one would think thunder was going to race lightning instead of oxford cambridge if you can come please write and i will get you nice lodgings i will not let you go to a noisy inn love to julia and no end of kisses to my pretty mamma from your affectionate son edward dodd they wrote off a cordial assent and reached henley in time to see the dullest town in europe and also to see it turn one of the gayest in an hour or two so impetuously came both the universities pouring into itin all known vehicles that could go their paceby land and water chapter i it was a bright hot day in june mrs dodd and julia sat half reclining with their parasols up in an open carriage by the brink of the thames at one of its loveliest bends about a furlong up stream a silvery stone bridge just mellowed by time spanned the river with many fair arches through these the coming river peeped sparkling a long way above then came meandering and shining down loitered cool and sombre under the dark vaults then glistened on again crookedly to the spot where sat its two fairest visitors that day but at that very point flung off its serpentine habits and shot straight away in a broad stream of scintillating water a mile long down to an island in midstream a little fairy island with old trees and a white temple to curl round this fairy isle the broad current parted and both silver streams turned purple in the shade of the grove then winded and melted from the sight this noble and rare passage of the silvery thames was the henley racecourse the startingplace was down at the island and the goal was up at a point in the river below the bridge but above the bend where mrs dodd and julia sat unruffled by the racing and enjoying luxuriously the glorious stream the mellow bridge crowded with carriageswhose fair occupants stretched a broad band of bright colour above the dark figures clustering on the battlementsand the green meadows opposite with the motley crowd streaming up and down nor was that sense which seems especially keen and delicate in women left unregaled in the general bounty of the time the green meadows on the opposite bank and the gardens at the back of our fair friends flung their sweet fresh odours at their liquid benefactor gliding by and the sun himself seemed to burn perfumes and the air to scatter them over the motley merry crowd that bright hot smiling airy day in june thus tuned to gentle enjoyment the fair mother and her lovely daughter leaned back in a delicious languor proper to their sex and eyed with unflagging though demure interest and furtive curiosity the wealth of youth beauty stature agility gaiety and good temper the two great universities had poured out upon those obscure banks all dressed in neat but easyfitting clothes cut in the height of the fashion or else in jerseys white or striped and flannel trousers and straw hats or cloth caps of bright and various hues betting strolling laughing chaffing larking and whirling stunted bludgeons at aunt sally but as for the sport itself they were there to see the center of all these bright accessories the racing my ladies did not understand it nor try nor care a hookandeye about it but this mild dignified indifference to the main event received a shock at p m for then the first heat for the cup came on and edward was in it so then racing became all in a moment a most interesting pastimean appendage to loving he left to join his crew and soon after the exeter glided down the river before their eyes with the beloved one rowing quietly in it his jersey revealed not only the working power of his arms as sunburnt below the elbow as a gipsys and as corded above as a blacksmiths but also the play of the great muscles across his broad and deeply indented chest his oar entered the water smoothly gripped it severely then came out clean and feathered clear and tunably on the ringing rowlock the boat jumped and then glided at each neat easy powerful stroke oh how beautiful and strong he is cried julia i had no idea presently the competitor for this heat came down the cambridge boat rowed by a fine crew in broadstriped jerseys oh dear said julia they are odious and strong in this boat too i wish i was in itwith a gimlet he should win poor boy which corkscrew staircase to honour being inaccessible the race had to be decided by two unfeminine trifles called speed and bottom few things in this vale of tears are more worthy a pen of fire than an english boatrace is as seen by the runners of whom i have often been one but this race i am bound to indicate not describe i mean to show how it appeared to two ladies seated on the henley side of the thames nearly opposite the winningpost these fair novices then looked all down the river and could just discern two whitish streaks on the water one on each side the little fairy isle and a great black patch on the berkshire bank the threatening streaks were the two racing boats the black patch was about a hundred cambridge and oxford men ready to run and hallo with the boats all the way or at least till the last puff of wind should be run plus halloed out of their young bodies others less fleet and enduring but equally clamorous stood in knots at various distances ripe for a shorter yell and run when the boats should come up to them of the natives and country visitors those who were not nailed down by bounteous fate ebbed and flowed up and down the bank with no settled idea but of getting in the way as much as possible and of getting knocked into the thames as little as might be there was a long uneasy suspense at last a puff of smoke issued from a pistol down at the island two oars seemed to splash into the water from each white streak and the black patch was moving so were the threatening streaks presently was heard a faint continuous distant murmur and the streaks began to get larger and larger and larger and the eight splashing oars looked four instead of two every head was now turned down the river groups hung craning over it like nodding bulrushes next the runners were swelled by the stragglers they picked up so were their voices and on came the splashing oars and roaring lungs now the colours of the racing jerseys peeped distinct the oarsmens heads and bodies came swinging back like one and the oars seemed to lash the water savagely like a connected row of swords and the spray squirted at each vicious stroke the boats leaped and darted side by side and looking at them in front julia could not say which was ahead on they came nearer and nearer with hundreds of voices vociferating go it cambridge well pulled oxford you are gaining hurrah well pulled trinity hurrah oxford cambridge now is your time hardie pick her up oh well pulled six well pulled stroke up up lift her a bit cambridge oxford hurrah at this julia turned red and pale by turns o mamma said she clasping her hands and colouring high would it be very wrong if i was to pray for oxford to win mrs dodd had a monitory finger it was on her left hand she raised it and that moment as if she had given a signal the boats foreshortened no longer shot out to treble the length they had looked hitherto and came broadside past our palpitating fair the elastic rowers stretched like greyhounds in a chase darting forward at each stroke so boldly they seemed flying out of the boats and surging back as superbly an eightfold human wave their nostrils all open the lips of some pale and glutinous their white teeth all clenched grimly their young eyes all glowing their supple bodies swelling the muscles writhing beneath their jerseys and the sinews starting on each bare brown arm their little shrill coxswains shouting imperiously at the young giants and working to and fro with them like jockeys at a finish nine souls and bodies flung whole into each magnificent effort water foaming and flying rowlocks ringing crowd running tumbling and howling like mad and cambridge a boats nose ahead they had scarcely passed our two spectators when oxford put on a furious spurt and got fully even with the leading boat there was a louder roar than ever from the bank cambridge spurted desperately in turn and stole those few feet back and so they went fighting every inch of water bang a cannon on the bank sent its smoke over both competitors it dispersed in a moment and the boats were seen pulling slowly towards the bridgecambridge with four oars oxford with six as if that gum had winged them both the race was over but who had won our party could not see and must wait to learn a youth adorned with a blue and yellow rosette cried out in the hearing of mrs dodd i say they are properly pumped both crews are then jumping on to a spoke of her carriagewheel with a slight apology he announced that two or three were shut up in the exeter the exact meaning of these two verbs passive was not clear to mrs dodd but their intensity was she fluttered and wanted to go to her boy and nurse him and turned two most imploring eyes on julia and julia straightway kissed her with gentle vehemence and offered to ruin and see what amongst all those young gentlemen love i fear that would not be proper see all the ladies remain apart so they kept quiet and miserable after the manner of females meantime the cantabs quick eye had not deceived him in each racing boat were two young gentlemen leaning collapsed over their oars and two more who were in a cloud and not at all clear whether they were in this world still or in their zeal had pulled into a better but their malady was not a rare one in racing boats and the remedy always at hand it combined the rival systems thames was sprinkled in their faceshomoeopathy and brandy in a teaspoon trickled down their throatsallopathy youth and spirits soon did the rest and the moment their eyes opened their mouths opened and the moment their mouths opened they fell a chaffing mrs dodds anxiety and julias were relieved by the appearance of mr edward in a tweed shootingjacket sauntering down to them hands in his pockets and a cigar in his mouth placidly unconscious of their solicitude on his account he was received with a little guttural cry of delight the misery they had been in about him was duly concealed from him by both and julia asked him warmly who had won oh cambridge cambridge why then you are beaten rather puff and you can come here with that horrible calm and cigar owning defeat and puffing tranquillity with the same mouth mamma we are beaten beaten actually never mind said edward kindly you have seen a capital race the closest ever known on this river and one side or other must lose and if they did not quite win they very nearly did observed mrs dodd composedly then with heartfelt content he is not hurt and that is the main thing well my lady placid and mr imperturbable i am glad neither of your equanimities is disturbed but defeat is a bitter pill to me julia said this in her earnest voice and drawing her scarf suddenly round her so as almost to make it speak digested her bitter pill in silence during which process several exeter men caught sight of edward and came round him and an animated discussion took place they began with asking him how it had happened and as he never spoke in a hurry supplied him with the answers a stretcher had broken in the exeter no but the cambridge was a much better built boat and her bottom cleaner the bow oar of the exeter was ill and not fit for work each of these solutions was advanced and combated in turn and then all together at last the babel lulled and edward was once more appealed to well i will tell you the real truth said he how it happened puff there was a pause of expectation for the young mans tone was that of conviction knowledge and authority the cambridge men pulled faster than we did puff the hearers stared and then laughed come old fellows said edward never win a boatrace on dry land that is such a plain thing to do gives the other side the laugh as well as the race i have heard a stretcher or two told but i saw none broken puff their boat is the worst i ever saw it dips every stroke puff their strength lies in the crew it was a good race and a fair one cambridge got a lead and kept it puff they beat us a yard or two at rowing but hang it all dont let them beat us at telling the truth not by an inch puff all right old fellow was now the cry one observed however that stroke did not take the matter so coolly as six for he had shed a tear getting out of the boat shed a fiddlestick squeaked a little sceptic no said another he didnt quite shed it his pride wouldnt let him so he decanted it and put it by for supper suggested edward and puffed none of your chaff six he had a gulp or two and swallowed the rest by main force dont you talk you can swallow anything it seems puff well i believe it said one of hardies own set dodd doesnt know him as we do taff hardie cant bear to be beat when they were gone mrs dodd observed dear me what if the young gentleman did cry a little it was very excusable after such great exertions it was disappointing mortifying i pity him for one and wish he had his mother alive and here to dry them oh where and oh where was her lindley murray gone mamma it is you for reading us cried edward slapping his thigh well then since you can feel for a fellow hardie was a good deal cut up you know the university was in a manner beaten and he took the blame he never cried that was a cracker of those fellows but he did give one great sob that was all and hung his head on one side a moment but then he fought out of it directly like a man and there was an end of it or ought to have been hang chatterboxes and what did you say to console him edward inquired julia warmly whatme console my senior and my stroke no thank you at this thunderbolt of etiquette both ladies kept their countenances this was their muscular feat that dayand the racing for the sculls came on six competitors two cambridge three oxford one london the three heats furnished but one good race a sharp contest between a cambridge man and hardie ending in favour of the latter the londoner walked away from his opponent sir imperturbables competitor was impetuous and ran into him in the first hundred yards sir i consenting calmly the umpire appealed to on the spot decided that it was a foul mr dodd being in his own water he walked over the course and explained the matter to his sister who delivered her mind thus oh if races are to be won by going slower than the other we may shine yet only i call it cheating not racing he smiled unmoved she gave her scarf the irony twist and they all went to dinner the business recommenced with a race between a london boat and the winner of yesterdays heat cambridge here the truth of edwards remark appeared the cambridge boat was too light for the men and kept burying her hose the london craft under a heavy crew floated like a cork the londoners soon found out their advantage and overrating it steered into their opponents water prematurely in spite of a warning voice from the bank cambridge saw and cracked on for a foul and for about a minute it was anybodys race but the londoners pulled gallantly and just scraped clear ahead this peril escaped they kept their backs straight and a clear lead to the finish cambridge followed a few feet in their wake pulling wonderfully fast to the end but a trifle out of form and much distressed at this both universities looked blue their humble aspiration being first to beat off all the external world and then tackle each other for the prize just before edward left his friends for the sculls the final heat a note was brought to him he ran his eye over it and threw it open into his sisters lap the ladies read it its writer had won a prize poem and so now is our time to get a hint for composition dear siroxford must win something suppose we go in for these sculls you are a horse that can stay silcock is hot for the lead at starting i hear so i mean to work him out of wind then you can wait on us and pick up the race my head is not well enough today to win but i am good to pump the cockney he is quick but a little staleyours truly alfred hardie mrs dodd remarked that the language was sadly figurative but she hoped edward might be successful in spite of his correspondents style julia said she did not dare hope it the race is not always to the slowest and the dearest this was in allusion to yesterdays foul the skiffs started down at the island and as they were longer coming up than the eight oars she was in a fever for nearly ten minutes at last near the opposite bank up came the two leading skiffs struggling both men visibly exhaustedsilcock ahead but his rudder overlapped by hardies bow each in his own water we are third sighed julia and turned her head away from the river sorrowfully but only for a moment for she felt mrs dodd start and press her arm and lo edwards skiff was shooting swiftly across from their side of the river he was pulling just within himself in beautiful form and with far more elasticity than the other two had got left as he passed his mother and sister his eyes seemed to strike fire and he laid out all his powers and went at the leading skiffs hand over head there was a yell of astonishment and delight from both sides of the thames he passed hardie who upon that relaxed his speed in thirty seconds more he was even with silcock then came a keen struggle but the new comer was the horse that could stay he drew steadily ahead and the stern of his boat was in a line with silcocks person when the gun fired and a fearful roar from the bridge the river and the banks announced that the favourite university had picked up the sculls in the person of dodd of exeter in due course he brought the little silver sculls and pinned them on his mother while she and julia were telling him how proud they were and how happy they should be but for their fears that he would hurt himself beating gentlemen ever so much older than himself came two exeter men with wild looks hunting for him oh dodd hardie wants you directly dont you go edward whispered julia why should you be at mr hardies beck and call i never heard of such a thing that youth will make me hate him oh i think i had better just go and see what it is about replied edward i shall be back directly and on this understanding he went off with the men halfanhour passed an hour two hours and he did not return mrs dodd and julia sat wondering what had become of him and were looking all around and getting uneasy when at last they did hear something about him but indirectly and from an unexpected quarter a tall young man in a jersey and flannel trousers and a little straw hat with a purple rosette came away from the bustle to the more secluded part where they sat and made eagerly for the thames as if he was a duck and going in but at the brink he flung himself into a sitting posture and dipped his white handkerchief into the stream then tied it viciously round his brow doubled himself up with his head in his hands and rocked himself like an old womanminus the patience of course mrs dodd and julia sitting but a few paces behind him interchanged a look of intelligence the young gentleman was a stranger but they had recognised a faithful old acquaintance at the bottom of his pantomime they discovered too that the afflicted one was a personage for he had not sat there long when quite a little band of men came after him observing his semicircularity and general condition they hesitated a moment and then one of them remonstrated eagerly for heavens sake come back to the boat there is a crowd of all the colleges come round us and they all say oxford is being sold we had a chance for the fouroared race and you are throwing it away what do i care what they all say was the answer delivered with a kind of plaintive snarl but we care care then i pity you and he turned his back fiercely on them and then groaned by way of half apology another tried him come give us a civil answer please people that intrude upon a mans privacy racked with pain have no right to demand civility replied the sufferer more gently but sullenly enough do you call this privacy it was a minute ago do you think i left the boat and came here among the natives for company and noise with my head splitting here julia gave mrs dodd a soft pinch to which mrs dodd replied by a smile and so they settled who this petulant young invalid must be there it is no use observed one sotto voce the bloke really has awful headaches like a girl and then he always shuts up this way you will only rile him and get the rough side of his tongue here then the conference drew towards a close but a wadham man who was one of the ambassadors interposed stop a minute said he mr hardie i have not the honour to be acquainted with you and i am not here to annoy you nor to be affronted by you but the university has a stake in this race and the university expostulates through usthrough me if you like who have i the honour inquired hardie assuming politeness sudden and vast badham of wadham badham o wadham hear that ye tuneful nine well badham o wadham you are no acquaintance of mine so you may possibly not be a fool let us assume by way of hypothesis that you are a man of sense a man of reason as well as of rhyme then follow my logic hardie of exeter is a good man in a boat when he has not got a headache when he has got a headache hardie of exeter is not worth a straw in a boat hardie of exeter has a headache now ergo the university would put the said hardie into a race headache and all and reduce defeat to a certainty and ergo on the same premises i not being an egotist nor an ass have taken hardie of exeter and his headache out of the boat as i should have done any other cripple secondly i have put the best man on the river into this cripples place total i have given the university the benefit of my brains and the university not having brains enough to see what it gains by the exchange turns again and rends me like an animal frequently mentioned in scripture but nota bene never once with approbation and the afflicted rhetorician attempted a diabolical grin but failed signally and groaned instead is this your answer to the university sir at this query delivered in a somewhat threatening tone the invalid sat up all in a moment like a poked lion oh if badham o wadham thinks to crush me auctoritate sua et totius universitatis badham o wadham may just tell the whole university to go and be dd from the chancellor down to the junior cook at skimmery hall with my compliments illconditioned brute muttered badham of wadham serve you right if the university were to chuck you into the thames and with this comment they left him to his ill temper one remained sat quietly down a little way off struck a sweetly aromatic lucifer and blew a noisome cloud but the only one which betokens calm as for hardie he held his aching head over his knees absorbed in pain and quite unconscious that sacred pity was poisoning the air beside him and two pair of dovelike eyes resting on him with womanly concern mrs dodd and julia had heard the greatest part of this colloquy they had terribly quick ears and nothing better to do with them just then indeed their interest was excited julia went so far as to put her salts into mrs dodds hand with a little earnest look but mrs dodd did not act upon the hint she had learned who the young man was had his very name been strange to her she would have been more at her ease with him moreover his rudeness to the other men repelled her a little above all he had uttered a monosyllable and a stinger a thorn of speech not in her vocabulary nor even in societys those might be his manners even when not aching still it seems a feather would have turned the scale in his favour for she whispered i have a great mind if i could but catch his eye while feminine pity and social reserve were holding the balance so nicely and nonsensically about half a split straw one of the racing fouroars went down close under the berkshire bank london observed hardies adherent what are you there old fellow murmured hardie in a faint voice now that is like a friend a real friend to sit by me and not make a row thank you thank you presently the cambridge fouroar passed it was speedily followed by the oxford the last came down in midstream and hardie eyed it keenly as it passed there he cried was i wrong there is a swing for you there is a stroke i did not know what a treasure i had got sitting behind me the ladies looked and lo the lauded stroke of the fouroar was their edward sing out and tell him it is not like the sculls we must fight for the lead at starting and hold it with his eyelids when he has got it the adherent bawled this at edward and edwards reply came ringing back in a clear cheerful voice we mean to try all we know what is the odds inquired the invalid faintly even on london two to one against cambridge three to one against us take all my tin and lay it on sighed the sufferer fork it out then hallo eighteen pounds fancy having eighteen pounds at the end of term ill get the odds up at the bridge directly heres a lady offering you her smellingbottle hardie rose and turned round and sure enough there were two ladies seated in their carriage at some distance one of whom was holding him out three pretty little things enough a little smile a little blush and a little cutglass bottle with a gold cork the last panegyric on edward had turned the scale hardie went slowly up to the side of the carriage and took off his hat to them with a halfbewildered air now that he was so near his face showed very pale the more so that his neck was a good deal tanned his eyelids were rather swollen and his young eyes troubled and almost filmy with the pain the ladies saw and their gentle bosoms were touched they had heard of him as a victorious young apollo trampling on all difficulties of mind and body and they saw him wan and worn with feminine suffering the contrast made him doubly interesting arrived at the side of the carriage he almost started at julias beauty it was sunlike and so were her two lovely earnest eyes beaming soft pity on him with an eloquence he had never seen in human eyes before for julias were mirrors of herself they did nothing by halves he looked at her and her mother and blushed and stood irresolute awaiting their commands this sudden contrast to his petulance with his own sex paved the way you have a sad headache sir said mrs dodd oblige me by trying my salts he thanked her in a low voice and mamma inquired julia ought he to sit in the sun certainly not you had better sit there sir and profit by our shade and our parasols yes mamma but you know the real place where he ought to be is bed oh pray dont say that implored the patient but julia continued with unabated severity and that is where he would go this minute if i was his mamma instead of his junior and a stranger said mrs dodd somewhat coldly dwelling with a very slight monitory emphasis on the stranger julia said nothing but drew in perceptibly and was dead silent ever after oh madam said hardie eagerly i do not dispute her authority nor yours you have a right to send me where you please after your kindness in noticing my infernal head and doing me the honour to speak to me and lending me this but if i go to bed my head will be my master besides i shall throw away what little chance i have of making your acquaintance and the race just coming off we will not usurp authority sir said mrs dodd quietly but we know what a severe headache is and should be glad to see you sit still in the shade and excite yourself as little as possible yes madam said the youth humbly and sat down like a lamb he glanced now and then at the island and now and then peered up at the radiant young mute beside him the silence continued till it was broken bya fish out of water an undergraduate in spectacles came mooning along all out of his element it was mr kennet who used to rise at four every morning to his plato and walk up shotover hill every afternoon wet or dry to cool his eyes for his evening work with what view he deviated to henley has not yet been ascertained he was blind as a bat and did not care a button about any earthly boatrace except the one in the aeneid even if he could have seen one however nearly all the men of his college went to henley and perhaps some branch hitherto unexplored of animal magnetism drew him after at any rate there was his body and his mind at oxford and athens and other venerable but irrelevant cities he brightened at sight of his doge and asked him warmly if he had heard the news no what nothing wrong i hope why two of our men are ploughed that is all said kennet affecting with withering irony to undervalue his intelligence confound it kennet how you frightened me i was afraid there was some screw loose with the crew at this very instant the smoke of the pistol was seen to puff out from the island and hardie rose to his feet they are off cried he to the ladies and after first putting his palms together with a hypocritical look of apology he laid one hand on an old barge that was drawn up ashore and sprang like a mountain goat on to the bow lighting on the very gunwale the position was not tenable an instant but he extended one foot very nimbly and boldly and planted it on the other gunwale and there he was in a moment headache and all in an attitude as large and inspired as the boldest gesture antiquity has committed to marblehe had even the advantage in stature over most of the sculptured forms of greece but a double operaglass at his eye spoiled the lot as mr punch says i am not to repeat the particulars of a distant race coming nearer and nearer the main features are always the same only this time it was more exciting to our fair friends on account of edwards high stake in it and then their grateful though refractory patient an authority in their eyes indeed all but a rivergod stood poised in air and in excited whispers interpreted each distant and unintelligible feature down to them cambridge was off quickest but not much anybodys race at present madam if this lasts long we may win none of them can stay like us come the favourite is not so very dangerous cambridge looks best i wouldnt change with either so far now in forty seconds more i shall be able to pick out the winner julia went up this ladder of thrills to a high state of excitement and indeed they were all so tuned to racing pitch that some metal nerve or other seemed to jar inside all three when the piercing grating voice of kennet broke in suddenly with how do you construe greek text the wretch had burrowed in the intellectual ruins of greece the moment the pistol went off and college chat ceased hardie raised his operaglass and his first impulse was to brain the judicious kennet gazing up to him for an answer with spectacles goggling like supernatural eyes of dead sophists in the sun how do you construe hoc age you incongruous dog hold your tongue and mind the race there i thought so wheres your three to one now the cockneys are out of this event any way go on universities and order their suppers but which is first sir asked julia imploringly oh which is first of all neither never mind it looks well london is pumped and if cambridge cant lead him before this turn in the river the race will be ours now look out by jove we are ahead the leading boats came on oxford pulling a long lofty sturdy stroke that seemed as if it never could compete with the quick action of its competitor yet it was undeniably ahead and gaining at every swing young hardie writhed on his perch he screeched at them across the thames well pulled stroke well pulled all splendidly pulled dodd you are walking away from them altogether hurrah oxford for ever hurrah the gun went off over the heads of the oxford crew in advance and even mrs dodd and julia could see the race was theirs we have won at last cried julia all on fire and fairly only think of that hardie turned round grateful to beauty for siding with his university yes and the fools may thank me or rather my man dodd dodd for ever hurrah at this climax even mrs dodd took a gentle share in the youthful enthusiasm that was boiling around her and her soft eyes sparkled and she returned the fervid pressure of her daughters hand and both their faces were flushed with gratified pride and affection dodd broke in the incongruous dog with a voice just like a saws dodd ah thats the man who is just ploughed for smalls ice has its thunderbolts chapter ii winning boatraces was all very fine but a hundred such victories could not compensate mr kennets female hearers for one such defeat as he had announceda defeat that to their minds carried disgrace their edward plucked at first they were benumbed and sat chilled with red cheeks bewildered between present triumph and mortification at hand then the colour ebbed out of their faces and they encouraged each other feebly in whispers might it not be a mistake but unconscious kennet robbed them of this timid hope he was now in his element knew all about it rushed into details and sawed away all doubt from their minds the sum was this dodds general performance was mediocre but passable he was plucked for his logic hardie said he was very sorry for it what does it matter answered kennet he is a boatingman well and i am a boatingman why you told me yourself the other day poor dodd was anxious about it on account of his friends and bythebye that reminds me they say he has got two pretty sisters here says kennet briskly ill go and tell him i know him just to speak to what doesnt he know how can he know said kennet jealously the testamurs were only just out as i came away and within this he started on his congenial errand hardie took two or three of his long strides and fairly collared him you will do nothing of the kind what not tell a man when hes ploughed that is a good joke no theres time enough tell him after chapel tomorrow or in chapel if you must but why poison his triumphal cup and his sisters too why spoil their pleasure hang it all not a word about ploughing to any living soul today to his surprise kennets face expressed no sympathy nor even bare assent at this hardie lost patience and burst out impetuously take care how you refuse me take care how you thwart me in this he is the bestnatured fellow in college it doesnt matter to you and it does to him and if you do then take my name off the list of your acquaintance for ill never speak a word to you again in this world no not on my deathbed by heaven the threat was extravagant but youths glowing cheek and eye and imperious lip and simple generosity made it almost beautiful kennet whined oh if you talk like that there is an end to fair argument end it then and promise me upon your honour why not what bosh there i promise now how do you construe greek text the incongruous dog i thank thee taff for teaching me that word put this query with the severity of an inquisitor bringing back a garrulous prisoner to the point hardie replied gaily any way you like now you are a good fellow again come that is evasive my tutor says it cannot be rendered by any one english word no more can greek text why what on earth can he know about english greek text is a cormorant greek text is a skinflint and your tutor is a duffer hush keep dark now here he comes and he went hastily to meet edward dodd and by that means intercepted him on his way to the carriage give me your hand dodd he cried you have saved the university you must be stroke of the eightoar after me let me see more of you than i have old fellow within all my heart replied edward calmly but taking the offered hand cordially though he rather wanted to get away to his mother and sister we will pull together and read together into the bargain continued hardie read together you and i what do you mean well you see i am pretty well up in the imigliner books what i have got to rub up is my divinity and my logicespecially my logic will you grind logic with me say yes for i know you will keep your word it is too good an offer to refuse hardie but now i look at you you are excited wonderfully excited within the race eh now justyouwaitquietlytill next week and then if you are so soft as to ask me in cool blood wait a week cried the impetuous youth no not a minute it is settled there we cram logic together next term and he shook edwards hand again with glistening eyes and an emotion that was quite unintelligible to edward but not to the quick sensitive spirits who sat but fifteen yards off you really must excuse me just now said edward and ran to the carriage and put out both hands to the fair occupants they kissed him eagerly with little tender sighs and it cost them no slight effort not to cry publicly over the beloved the victorious the ploughed young hardie stood petrified what these ladies dodds sisters why one of them had called the other mamma good heavens all his talk in their hearing had been of dodd and kennet and he between them had let out the very thing he wanted to conceal especially from dodds relations he gazed at them and turned hot to the very forehead then not knowing what to do or say and being after all but a clever boy not a cool never unready man of the world he slipped away blushing kennet followed goggling left to herself mrs dodd would have broken the bad news to edward at once and taken the line of consoling him under her own vexation it would not have been the first time that she had played that card but young mr hardie had said it would be unkind to poison edwards day and it is sweet womans nature to follow suit so she and julia put bright faces on and edward passed a right jocund afternoon with them he was not allowed to surprise one of the looks they interchanged to relieve their secret mortification but after dinner as the time drew near for him to go back to oxford mrs dodd became silent and a little distraite and at last drew her chair away to a small table and wrote a letter in directing it she turned it purposely so that julia could catch the address edward dodd esq exeter college oxford julia was naturally startled at first and her eye roved almost comically to and fro the letter and its destination seated calm and unconscious of womans beneficent wiles but her heart soon divined the mystery it was to reach him the first thing in the morning and spare him the pain of writing the news to them and doubtless so worded as not to leave him a day in doubt of their forgiveness and sympathy julia took the missive unobserved by the destination and glided out of the room to get it quietly posted the servantgirl was waiting on the secondfloor lodgers and told her so with a significant addition viz that the post was in this street and only a few doors off julia was a little surprised at her coolness but took the hint with perfect good temper and just put on her shawl and bonnet and went with it herself the postoffice was not quite so near as represented but she was soon there for she was eager till she had posted it but she came back slowly and thoughtfully here in the street lighted only by the moon and an occasional gaslight there was no need for selfrestraint and soon her mortification betrayed itself in her speaking countenance and to think that her mother on whom she doted should have to write to her son there present and post the letter this made her eyes fill and before she reached the door of the lodging they were brimming over as she put her foot on the step a timid voice addressed her in a low tone of supplication may i venture to speak one word to you miss doddone single word she looked up surprised and it was young mr hardie his tall figure was bending towards her submissively and his face as well as his utterance betrayed considerable agitation and what led to so unusual a rencontre between a young gentleman and lady who had never been introduced the tender passion says a reader of many novels why yes the tenderest in all our nature wounded vanity naturally proud and sensitive and inflated by success and flattery alfred hardie had been torturing himself ever since he fled edwards female relations he was mortified to the core he confounded the fools his favourite synonym for his acquaintance for going and calling dodds mother an elder sister and so not giving him a chance to divine her and then that he who prided himself on his discrimination should take them for ladies of rank or at all events of the highest fashion and climax of humiliation that so great a man as he should go and seem to court them by praising dodd of exeter by enlarging upon dodd of exeter by offering to grind logic with dodd of exeter who would believe that this was a coincidence a mere coincidence they could not be expected to believe it female vanity would not let them he tingled and was not far from hating the whole family so bitter a thing is that which i have ventured to dub the tenderest passion he itched to soothe his irritation by explaining to edward dodd was a frank goodhearted fellow he would listen to facts and convince the ladies in turn hardie learned where dodds party lodged and waited about the door to catch him alone dodd must be in college by twelve and would leave henley before ten he waited till he was tired of waiting but at last the door opened he stepped forward and out tripped miss dodd confound it muttered hardie and drew back however he stood and admired her graceful figure and action her ladylike speed without bustling had she come back at the same pace he would never have ventured to stop her on such a thread do things hang but she returned very slowly hanging her head her look at him and his headache recurred to hima look brimful of goodness she would do as well as edward better perhaps he yielded to impulse and addressed her but with all the trepidation of a youth defying the giant etiquette for the first time in his life julia was a little surprised and fluttered but did not betray it she had been taught selfcommand by example if not by precept certainly mr hardie said she within a modest composure a young coquette might have envied under the circumstances hardie had now only to explain himself but instead of that he stood looking at her within silent concern the fair face she raised to him was wet with tears so were her eyes and even the glorious eyelashes were fringed with that tender spray and it glistened in the moonlight this sad and pretty sight drove the vain but generous youths calamity clean out of his head why you are crying miss dodd what is the matter i hope nothing has happened julia turned her head away a little fretfully with a no no but soon her natural candour and simplicity prevailed a simplicity not without dignity she turned round to him and looked him in the face why should i deny it to you sir who have been good enough to sympathise with us we are mortified sadly mortified at dear edwards disgrace and it has cost us a struggle not to disobey you and poison his triumphal cup with sad looks and mamma had to write to him and console him against tomorrow but i hope he will not feel it so severely as she does and i have just posted it myself and when i thought of our dear mamma being driven to such expedients ioh and the pure young heart having opened itself by words must flow a little more oh pray dont cry said young hardie tenderly dont take such a trifle to heart so you crying makes me feel guilty for letting it happen it shall never occur again if i had only known it should never have happened at all once is enough sighed julia indeed you take it too much to heart it is only out of oxford a plough is thought much of especially a single one that is so very common you see miss dodd an university examination consists of several items neglect but one and crichton himself would be ploughed because brilliancy in your other papers is not allowed to count that is how the most distinguished man of our day got ploughed for smalls i had a narrow escape i know for one but miss dodd if you knew how far your brothers performance on the river outweighs a mere slip in the schools in all university mens eyes the dons and all you would not make this bright day end sadly to oxford by crying why i could find you a thousand men who would be ploughed tomorrow with glory and delight to win one such race as your brother has won two julia sighed again but it sounded now half like a sigh of reliefthe final sigh with which the fair consent to be consoled and indeed this improvement in the music did not escape hardie he felt he was on the right tack he enumerated fluently and by name many good men besides dean swift who had been ploughed yet had cultivated the field of letters in their turn and in short he was so earnest and plausible that something like a smile hovered about his hearers lips and she glanced askant at him with furtive gratitude from under her silky lashes but it soon recurred to her that this was rather a long interview to accord to a stranger and under the moon so she said a little stiffly and was this what you were good enough to wish to say to me mr hardie no miss dodd to be frank it was not my motive in addressing you without the right to take such a freedom was egotistical i came here to clear myself ii was afraid you must think me a humbug you know i do not understand you indeed well i feared you and mrs dodd might think i praised dodd so and did what little i did for him knowing who you were and wishing to curry favour with you by all that and that is so underhand and paltry a way of going to work i should despise myself oh mr hardie said the young lady smiling how foolish why of course we knew you had no idea indeed i had not but how could you know it why we saw it do you think we have no eyes ah and much keener ones than gentlemen have it is mamma and i who are to blame if anybody we ought to have declared ourselves it would have been more generous moremanly but we cannot all be gentlemen you know it was so sweet to hear edward praised by one who did not know us it was like stolen fruit and by one whom others praise so if you can forgive us our slyness there is an end of the matter forgive you you have taken a thorn out of my soul then i am so glad you summoned courage to speak to me without ceremony mamma would have done better though but after all do not i know her my mamma is all goodness and intelligence and be assured sir she does you justice and is quite sensible of your disinterested kindness to dear edward with this she was about to retire ah but you miss dodd with whom i have taken this unwarrantable liberty said hardie imploringly me mr hardie you do me the honour to require my opinion of your performances including of course this selfintroduction hardie hung his head there was a touch of satire in the ladys voice he thought her soft eyes rested demurely on him a moment she saw he was a little abashed my opinion of it all is that you have been very kind to us in being most kind to our poor edward i never saw nor read of anything more generous more manly and then so thoughtful so considerate so delicate so instead of criticising you as you seem to expect his sister only blesses you and thanks you from the very bottom of her heart she had begun within a polite composure borrowed from mamma but once launched her ardent nature got the better her colour rose and rose and her voice sank and sank and the last words came almost in a whisper and such a lovely whisper a gurgle from the heart and as she concluded her delicate hand came sweeping out with a heaventaught gesture of large and sovereign cordiality that made even the honest words and the divine tones more eloquent it was too much the young man ardent as herself and not in reality half so timorous caught fire and seeing a white eloquent hand rather near him caught it and pressed his warm lips on it in mute adoration and gratitude at this she was scared and offended oh keep that for the queen cried she turning scarlet and tossing her fair head into the air like a startled stag and she drew her hand away quickly and decidedly though not roughly he stammered a lowly apologyin the very middle of it she said quietly goodbye mr hardie and swept with a gracious little curtsey through the doorway leaving him spellbound and so the virginal instinct of selfdefence carried her off swiftly and cleverly but none too soon for on entering the house that external composure her two mothers mesdames dodd and nature had taught her fell from her like a veil and she fluttered up the stairs to her own room with hot cheeks and panted there like some wild thing that has been grasped at and grazed she felt young hardies lips upon the palm of her hand plainly they seemed to linger there still it was like light but live velvet this and the ardent look he had poured into her eyes set the young creature quivering nobody had looked at her so before and no young gentleman had imprinted living velvet on her hand she was alarmed ashamed and uneasy what right had he to look at her like that what shadow of a right to go and kiss her hand he could not pretend to think she had put it out to be kissed ladies put forth the back of the hand for that not the palm the truth was he was an impudent fellow and she hated him now and herself too for being so simple as to let him talk to her mamma would not have been so imprudent when she was a girl she would not go down for she felt there must be something of this kind legibly branded on her face oh oh just look at this young lady she has been letting a young gentleman kiss the palm of her hand and the feel has not gone off yet you may see that by her cheeks but then poor edward she must go down so she put a wet towel to her telltale cheeks and dried them by artistic dabs avoiding friction and came downstairs like a mouse and turned the doorhandle noiselessly and glided into the sittingroom looking so transparent conscious and all on fire with beauty and animation that even edward was startled and in a whisper bade his mother observe what a pretty girl she was beats all the country girls in a canter mrs dodd did look and consequently as soon as ever edward was gone to oxford she said to julia you are feverish love you have been excited with all this you had better go to bed julia complied willingly for she wanted to be alone and think she retired to her own room and went the whole day over again and was happy and sorry exalted and uneasy by turns and ended by excusing mr hardies escapade and throwing the blame on herself she ought to have been more distant gentlemen were not expected nor indeed much wanted to be modest a little assurance did not misbecome them really i think it sets them off said she to herself grand total what must he think of me time gallops in reverie the town clock struck twelve and with its iron tongue remorse entered her youthful conscience was this obeying mamma mamma had said go to bed not go upstairs and meditate upon young gentlemen she gave an expressive shake of her fair shoulders like a swan flapping the water off its downy wings and so dismissed the subject from her mind then she said her prayers then she rose from her knees and in tones of honey said puss puss pretty puss and awaited a result thieves and ghosts she did not believe in yet credited cats under beds and thought them neither harmless nor necessary there after tenderly evoking the dreaded and chimerical quadruped she proceeded none the less to careful research especially of cupboards the door of one resisted and then yielded with a crack and blew out the candle there now said she it was her only light except her beauty they allotted each hebe but one candle in that ancient burgh well she thought there is moonlight enough to undress by she went to draw back one of the curtains but in the act she started back with a little scream there was a tall figure over the way watching the house the moon shone from her side of the street full on him and in that instant her quick eye recognised mr hardie well said she aloud and with an indescribable inflexion and hid herself swiftly in impenetrable gloom but after a while eves daughter must have a peep she stole with infinite caution to one side of the curtain and made an aperture just big enough for one bright eye yes there he was motionless ill tell mamma said she to him malignantly as if the sound could reach him unconscious of the direful threat he did not budge she was unaffectedly puzzled at this phenomenon and not being the least vain fell to wondering whether he played the nightly sentinel opposite every ladys window who exchanged civilities within him because if he does he is a fool said she promptly but on reflection she felt sure he did nothing of the kind habitually for he had too high an opinion of himself she had noted that trait in him at a very early stage she satisfied herself by cautious examination that he did not know her room he was making a temple of the whole lodging how ridiculous of him yet he appeared to be happy over it there was an exalted look in his moonlit face she seemed now first to see his soul there she studied his countenance like an inscription and deciphered each rapt expression that crossed it and stored them in her memory twice she left her ambuscade to go to bed and twice curiosity or something drew her back at last having looked peered and peeped till her feet were cold and her face the reverse she informed herself that the foolish thing had tired her out goodnight mr policeman said she pretending to bawl to him and oh do rain as hard as ever you can with this benevolent aspiration a little too violent to be sincere she laid her cheek on her pillow doughtily but her sentinel when out of sight had more power to disturb her she lay and wondered whether he was still there and what it all meant and whatever mamma would say and which of the two she or he was the head culprit in this strange performance to which earth she conceived had seen no parallel and above all what he would do next her pulse galloped and her sleep was broken and she came down in the morning a little pale mrs dodd saw it at once with the quick maternal eye and moralised it is curious youth is so fond of pleasure yet pleasure seldom agrees with youth this little excitement has done your mother good who is no longer young but it has been too much for you i shall be glad to have you back to our quiet home ah will that home be as tranquil now chapter iii the long vacation commenced about a month afterwards and hardie came to his fathers house to read for honours unimpeded by university races and college lectures and the ploughed and penitent one packed up his aldrich and his whately the then authorities in logic and brought them home together with a firm resolution to master that joyous science before the next examination for smalls in october but lo ere he had been an hour at home he found his things put neatly away in his drawers on the feminine or vertical systemdeep strata of waistcoats strata of trousers strata of coats strata of papersand his logic gone in the course of the evening he taxed his sister goodhumouredly and asked what earthly use that book was to her not wearing curls i intend to read it and study it and teach you it replied julia rather languidlyconsidering the weight of the resolve oh if you have boned it to read i say no more the crime will punish itself be serious edward and think of mamma i cannot sit with my hands before me and let you be reploughed i dont want butreploughedhaw haw but you cant help me at logic as you used at syntax why all the world knows a girl cant learn logic a girl can learn anything she chooses to learn what she cant learn is things other people set her down to before edward could fully digest this revelation she gave the argument a new turn by adding fretfully and dont be so unkind thwarting and teasing me and all in a moment she was crying halloa ejaculated edward taken quite by surprise what is the matter dears inquired maternal vigilance from the other end of the room you did not speak brusquely to her edward no no said julia eagerly it is i that am turned so cross and so peevish i am quite a changed girl mamma what is the matter with me and she laid her brow on her mothers bosom mrs dodd caressed the lovely head soothingly with one hand and made a sign over it to edward to leave them alone she waited quietly till julia was composed and then said softly come tell me what it is nothing that edward said to you for i heard almost every word and i was just going to smile or nearly when you and my love it is not the first time you know i would not tell edward but i have more than once seen your eyes with tears in them have you mamma said julia scarcely above a whisper why you know i have but i said to myself it was no use forcing confidence i thought i would be very patient and wait till you came to me with it so now what is it my darling why do you speak of one thing and think of another and cry without any reason that your mother can see i dont know mamma said julia hiding her head i think it is because i sleep so badly i rise in the morning hot and quivering and more tired than i lay down mrs dodd inquired how long this had been julia did not answer this question she went on with her face still hidden mamma i do feel so depressed and hysterical or else in violent spirits but not nice and cheerful as you are and i used to be and i go from one thing to another and can settle to nothingeven in church i attend by fits and starts i forgot to water my very flowers last night and i heard mrs maxley out of my window tell sarah i am losing my colour am i but what does it matter i am losing my sense for i catch myself for ever looking in the glass and that is a sure sign of a fool you know and i cannot pass the shops i stand and look in and long for the very dearest silks and for diamonds in my hair a deep sigh followed the confession of these multiform imperfections and the culprit half raised her head to watch their effect as for mrs dodd she opened her eyes wide with surprise but at the end of the heterogeneous catalogue she smiled and said i cannot believe that if ever there was a young lady free from personal vanity it is my julia why your thoughts run by nature away from yourself you were born for others her daughter kissed her gratefully and smiled but after a pause said sorrowfully ah that was the old julia as seen with your dear eyes i have almost forgotten her the new one is what i tell you dear mamma and that within sudden fervour is a dreamy wandering vain egotistical hysterical abominable girl let me kiss this monster that i have brought into the world said mrs dodd and now let me think she rested her eyes calm and penetrating upon her daughter and at this mere look but a very searching one the colour mounted and mounted in julias cheek strangely after all said mrs dodd thoughtfully yours is a critical age perhaps my child is turning to a woman my rosebud to a rose and she sighed mothers will sigh at things none other ever sighed at to a weed i fear replied julia what will you say when i own i felt no real joy at edwards return this time and yesterday i cried do get away and dont pester me to your brother oh oh no mamma that was to poor spot he jumped on me in a reverie all affection poor thing well for your comfort dogs do not appreciate the niceties of our language i am afraid they do when we kick them mrs dodd smiled at the admission implied here and the deep penitence it was uttered with but julia remonstrated oh no no dont laugh at me but help me within your advice you are so wise and so experienced you must have been a girl before you were an angel you must know what is the matter with me oh do pray cure me or else kill me for i cannot go on like this all my affections deadened and my peace disturbed and now the mother looked serious and thoughtful enough and the daughter watched her furtively julia said mrs dodd very gravely if it was not my child reared under my eye and never separated from me a single day i should say this young lady is either afflicted with some complaint and it affects her nerves and spirits or else she hasshe iswhat inexperienced young people call in love you need not look so frightened child nobody in their senses suspects you of imprudence or indelicacy and therefore i feel quite sure that your constitution is at a crisis or your health has suffered some shockpray heaven it may not be a serious one you will have the best advice and without delay i promise you chapter iv that very evening mrs dodd sent a servant into the town with a note like a cockedhat for mr osmond a consulting surgeon who bore a high reputation in barkington he came and proved too plump for that complete elegance she would have desired in a medical attendant but had a soft hand a gentle touch and a subdued manner he spoke to the patient with a kindness which won the mother directly had every hope of setting her right without any violent or disagreeable remedies but when she had retired altered his tone and told mrs dodd seriously she had done well to send for him in time it was a case of hyperaesthesia mrs dodd clasped her hands in alarm or as unprofessional persons would say excessive sensibility mrs dodd was somewhat relieved translation blunts thunderbolts she told him she had always feared for her child on that score but was sensibility curable could a nature be changed he replied that the idiosyncrasy could not but its morbid excess could especially when taken in time advice was generally called in too late however here the only serious symptom was the insomnia we must treat her for that said he writing a prescription but for the rest active employment long walks or rides and a change of scene and associations will be all that will be required in these cases resumed mr osmond connected as they are with hyperaemia some medical men considered moderate venesection to be indicated he then put on his gloves saying the diet of course must be antiphlogistic let us say then for breakfast dry toast with very little butterno coffeecocoa from the nibs or weak tea for luncheon beeftea or muttonbroth for dinner a slice of roast chicken and tapioca or semolina pudding i would give her one glass of sherry but no more and barleywater it would be as well to avoid brown meats at all events for the present with these precautions my dear madam i think your anxiety will soon be happily removed julia took her long walks and light diet and became a little pale at times and had fewer bursts of high spirits in the intervals of depression her mother went with her case to a female friend the lady said she would not trust to surgeons and apothecaries she would have a downright physician why not go to the top of the tree at once and call in dr short you have heard of him oh yes i have even met him in society a most refined person i will certainly follow your advice and consult him oh thank you mrs bosanquet a propos do you consider him skilful oh immensely he is a particular friend of my husbands this was so convincing that off went another threecocked note and next day a darkgreen carriage and pair dashed up to mrs dodds door and dr short bent himself in an arc got out and slowly mounted the stairs he was six feet two wonderfully thin livid and gentlemanlike fine homing head keen eye lantern jaws at sight of him mrs dodd rose and smiled julia started and sat trembling he stepped across the room inaudibly and after the usual civilities glanced at the patients tongue and touched her wrist delicately pulse is rapid said he mrs dodd detailed the symptoms dr short listened within the patient politeness of a gentleman to whom all this was superfluous he asked for a sheet of notepaper and divided it so gently he seemed to be persuading one thing to be two he wrote a pair of prescriptions and whilst thus employed looked up every now and then and conversed with the ladies you have a slight subscapular affection miss dodd i mean a little pain under the shoulderblade no sir said julia quietly dr short looked a little surprised his female patients rarely contradicted him was it for them to disown things he was so a good as to assign them ah said he you are not conscious of it all the better it must be slight a mere uneasiness no more he then numbered the prescriptions and advised mrs dodd to drop no after the eighth day and substitute no to be continued until convalescence he put on his gloves to leave mrs dodd then with some hesitation asked him humbly whether she might ask him what the disorder was certainly madam said he graciously your daughter is labouring under a slight torpidity of the liver the first prescription is active and is to clear the gland itself and the biliary ducts of the excretory accumulation and the second is exhibited to promote a healthy normal habit in that important part of the vascular system what then it is not hyperaemia hyperaemia there is no such disorder in the books you surprise me said mrs dodd dr osmond certainly thought it was hyperaemia and she consulted her little ivory tablets whereon she had written the word but meantime dr shorts mind to judge by his countenance was away roaming distant space in search of osmond osmond osmond i do not know that name in medicine oh oh oh cried julia and they both live in the same street mrs dodd held up her finger to this outspoken patient but a light seemed to break in on dr short ah you mean mr osmond a surgeon a very respectable man a most respectable man i do not know a more estimable personin his grade of the professionthan my good friend mr osmond and so he gives opinions in medical cases does he dr short paused apparently to realise this phenomenon in the world of mind he resumed in a different tone you may have misunderstood him hyperaemia exists of course since he says so but hyperaemia is not a complaint it is a symptom of biliary derangement my worthy friend looks at disorders from a mental point very natural his interest lies that way perhaps you are aware but profounder experience proves that mental sanity is merely one of the results of bodily health and i am happy to assure you that the biliary canal once cleared and the secretions restored to the healthy habit by these prescriptions the hyperaemia and other concomitants of hepatic derangement will disperse and leave our interesting patient in the enjoyment of her natural intelligence her friends affectionate admiration and above all of a sound constitution ladies i have the honour and the doctor eked out this sentence by rising oh thank you dr short said mrs dodd rising within him you inspire me with confidence and gratitude as if under the influence of these feelings only she took dr shorts palm and pressed it of the two hands which met for a moment then one was soft and melting the other a bunch of bones but both were very white and so equally adroit that a double fee passed without the possibility of a bystander suspecting it for the benefit of all young virgins afflicted like julia dodd here are the doctors prescriptions for miss dodd rx pil hydrarg chlor co singuml nocte sumend decoc aloes co j omni mane viii sept j s for miss dodd rx conf

idea that a skeleton was such a gentlemanlike thing i never saw one before mrs dodd admitted he was very thin oh no mamma thin implies some little flesh when he felt my pulse a chill struck to my heart death in a black suit seemed to steal up to me and lay a finger on my wrist and mark me for his own mrs dodd forbade her to give way to such gloomy ideas and expostulated firmly with her for judging learned men by their bodies however said she if the good kind doctors remedies do not answer his expectations and mine i shall take you to london directly i do hope papa will soon be at home poor mrs dodd was herself slipping into a morbid state a mother collecting doctors it is a most fascinating kind of connoisseurship grows on one like drink like polemics like melodrama like the millennium like any thing sure enough the very next week she and julia sat patiently at the morning levee of an eminent and titled london surgeon full forty patients were before them so they had to wait and wait at last they were ushered into the presencechamber and mrs dodd entered on the beaten ground of her daughters symptoms the noble surgeon stopped her civilly but promptly auscultation will give us the clue said he and drew his stethoscope julia shrank and cast an appealing look at her mother but the impassive chevalier reported on each organ in turn without moving his ear from the keyhole lungs pretty sound said he a little plaintively so is the liver now for thehum there is no kardiac insufficiency i think neither mitral nor tricuspid if we find no tendency to hypertrophy we shall do very well ah i have succeeded in diagnosing a slight diastolic murmur very slight he deposited the instrument and said not without a certain shade of satisfaction that his research had not been fruitless the heart is the peccant organ oh sir is it serious said poor mrs dodd by no means try this he scratched a prescription which would not have misbecome the tomb of cheops and come again in a month ting he struck a bell that ting said go live guinea and let another come heartdisease now said mrs dodd sinking back in her hired carriage and the tears were in her patient eyes my own own mamma said julia earnestly do not distress yourself i have no disease in the world but my old old old one of being a naughty wayward girl as for you mamma you have resigned your own judgment to your inferiors and that is both our misfortunes dear dear mamma do take me to a doctress next time if you have not had enough to a what love a shedoctor then a female physician child there is no such thing no assurance is becoming a characteristic of our sex but we have not yet intruded ourselves into the learned professions thank heaven excuse me mamma there are one or two for the newspapers say so well dear there are none in this country happily what not in london no then what is the use of such a great overgrown place all smoke if there is nothing in it you cannot find in the country let us go back to barkington this very day this minute this instant oh pray pray and so you shalltomorrow but you must pity your poor mothers anxiety and see dr chalmers first oh mamma not another surgeon he frightened me he hurt me i never heard of such a thing oh please not another surgeon it is not a surgeon dear it is the court physician the court physician detected a somewhat morbid condition of the great nervous centres to an inquiry whether there was heartdisease he replied pooh on being told sir william had announced heartdisease he said ah that alters the case entirely he maintained however that it must be trifling and would go no further the nervous system once restored to its healthy tone o jupiter aid us blue pill and seidhitz powder dr kenyon found the mucous membrane was irritated and required soothing o jupiter c mrs dodd returned home consoled and confused julia listless and apathetic tea was ordered with two or three kinds of bread thinnest slices of meat and a little blane mange c their favourite repast after a journey and whilst the tea was drawing mrs dodd looked over the cardtray and enumerated the visitors that had called during their absence dr short mr osmondmrs hetheringtonmr alfred hardielady dewrymrs and miss bosanquet what a pity edward was not at home dear mr alfred hardies visit must have been to him oh of course mamma a very manly young gentleman oh yes no he is so rude is he ah he was ill just then and pain irritates gentlemen they are not accustomed to it poor things that is like you dear mamma making excuses for one julia added faintly but he is so impetuous i have a daughter who reconciles me to impetuosity and he must have a good heart he was so kind to my boy julia looked down smiling but presently seemed to be seized with a spirit of contradiction she began to pick poor alfred to pieces he was this that and the other and then so bold she might say impudent mrs dodd replied calmly that he was very kind to her boy oh mamma you cannot approve all the words he spoke it is not worth while to remember all the words young gentlemen speak nowadays he was very kind to my boy i remember that the tea was now ready and mrs dodd sat down and patted a chair with a smile of invitation for julia to come and sit beside her but julia said in one minute dear and left the room when she came back she fluttered up to her mother and kissed her vehemently then sat down radiant ah said mrs dodd why you are looking yourself once more how do you feel now better how do i feel let me see the world seems one enormous flowergarden and me the butterfly it all belongs to she spake and to confirm her words the airy thing went waltzing sailing and fluttering round the room and sipping mamma every now and then on the wing in this buoyancy she remained some twentyfour hours and then came clouds and chills which in their turn gave way to exultation duly followed by depression her spirits were so uncertain that things too minute to justify narration turned the scale either way a word from mrs dodda new face at st annes church looking devoutly her waya piece of town gossip distilled in her ear by mrs maxleyand she was sprightly or languid and both more than reason one drizzly afternoon they were sitting silent and saddish in the drawingroom mrs dodd correcting the mechanical errors in a drawing of julias and admiring the rare dash and figure and julia doggedly studying dr whatelys logic with now and then a sigh when suddenly a trumpet seemed to articulate in the little hall mestress doedd at home the lady rose from her seat and said with a smile of pleasure i hear a voice the door opened and in darted a greyheaded man with handsome but strongly marked features laughing and shouting like a schoolboy broke loose he cried out ah ive found y out at last mrs dodd glided to meet him and put out both her hands the palms downwards with the prettiest air of ladylike cordiality he shook them heartily the vagabins said y had left the town but y had only flitted from the quay to the subbubs twas a pashint put me on the scint of ye and how are y all these years an hows sawmill sawmill what is that its just your husband isnt his name sawmill dear no have you forgottendavid ou ay i knew it was some scripcher petrarch or another daavid or naathan or sawmill and how is he and where is he mrs dodd replied that he was on the seas but expect then i wish him well off em confound em oncannall halloa why this will be the little girl grown up int a wumman while ye look round yes my good friend and her mothers darling and shes a bonny lass i can tell ye but no freend to the dockers i see ah said mrs dodd sadly looks are deceitful she is under medical advice at this very well that wont hurt her unless she takes it and he burst into a ringing laugh but in the middle of it stopped dead short and his face elongated lord sake madm said he impressively mind what y are at though barktons just a trap for fanciful femuls theres a noily ass called osmond and a canting cutthroat called stephenson and a genteel cadaveris old assassin called short as long as a maypole theyd soon take the rose out of miss florees cheek here why theyd starve cupid an veneseck venus an blister pomonee the vagabins mrs dodd looked a little confused and exchanged speaking glances with julia however she said calmly i have consulted mr osmond and dr short but have not relied on them alone i have taken her to sir william best and to dr chalmers and to dr kenyon and she felt invulnerable behind her phalanx of learning and reputation good hivens roared the visitor what a gauntlet o gabies for one girl to run and come out alive and the picter of health my faith miss floree y are tougher than ye look my daughters name is julia observed mrs dodd a little haughtily but instantly recovering herself she said this is dr sampson lovean old friend of your mothers and th author an invintor of th great chronothairmal therey o midicine th unity perriodicity an remittency of all disease put in the visitor with such prodigious swiftness of elocution that the words went tumbling over one another like railway carriages out on pleasure and the sentence was a pile of loud indistinct syllables julias lovely eyes dilated at this clishmaclaver and she bowed coldly dr sampson had revealed in this short interview nearly all the characteristics of voice speech and manner she had been taught from infancy to shun boisterous gesticulatory idiomatic and had taken the discourse out of her mammas mouth twice now albion villa was a red indian hut in one respect here nobody interrupted mrs dodd had little personal egotism but she had a mothers and could not spare this opportunity of adding another doctor to her collection so she said hurriedly will you permit me to show you what your learned confreres have prescribed her julia sighed aloud and deprecated the subject with earnest furtive signs mrs dodd would not see them now dr sampson was himself afflicted with what i shall venture to call a mental ailment to wit a furious intolerance of other mens opinions he had not even patience to hear them maidearmadm said he hastily when youve told me their names thats enough short treats her for liver sir william goes in for lung disease or heart chalmers sis its the nairves and kinyon the mookis membrin and i say they are fools and lyres all four julia ejaculated mrs dodd this is very extraordinary no it is not extraordinary cried dr sampson defiantly nothing is extraordinary dye think ive known these shallow men thirty years and not plumbed um shallow my good friend excuse me they are the ablest men in your own branch of your own learned profession th ablest oh you mean the moneymakingest now listen me our lairned profession is a rascally one it is like a barrel of beer what rises to the top here he paused for a moment then answered himself furiously the scum this blast blown he moderated a little look see said he up to three or four thousand a year a docker is often an honest man and sometimes knows something of midicine not much because it is not taught anywhere but if he is making over five thousand he must be a rogue or else a fool either he has booed an booed an cript an crawled int wholesale collusion with th apothecary an the accoucheurthe two jockeys that drive john bulls faemily coachand they are sucking the pashint togither like a leash o leeches or else he has turned spicialist has tacked his name to some poplar disorder real or imaginary it neednt exist to be poplar now those four you have been to are spicialists and that means monomaniuestheir buddies exspatiate in westind squares but their souls dwell in a nalley ivery man jack of em aberfords in stomich alley

o consultin three bats an a nowl at a guinea the piece send direct to me and ill give y all their opinions and all their prescriptions gratis and deevilich dear yell find em at the price if ye swallow m mrs dodd thanked him coldly for the offer but said she would be more grateful if he would show his superiority to persons of known ability by just curing her daughter on the spot well i will said he carelessly and all his fire died out of him put out your tonguenow your pulse mrs dodd knew her man ladies are very apt to fathom their male acquaintancetoo apt i think and to pin him to the only medical theme which interested her seized the opportunity while he was in actual contact with julias wrist and rapidly enumerated her symptoms and also told him what mr osmond had said about hyperaesthesia goose greece barked sampson loud clear and sharp as an irritated watchdog but this one bowwow vented he was silent as abruptly mrs dodd smiled and proceeded to hyperaemia and thence to the antiphlogistic regimen at that unhappy adjective sampson jumped up cast away his patients hand forgot her existenceshe was but a charming individualand galloped into his native region generalities antiphlogistic maidearmadm that one long fragmint of asss jaw has slain a million adapted to the weakness of human nature which receives with rivirince ideas however childish that come draped in longtailed and exotic words that aasimine polysyllable has riconciled the modern mind to the chimeras of th ancients and outbutchered the guillotine the musket and the sword ay and but for me had barred the door for cinturies more on the great coming sceince the sceince of healing diseases instead of defining and dividing em and lengthening their names and their durashin and shortening nothing but the pashint th antiphlogistic therey is this that disease is fiery and that any artificial exhaustion of vital force must cool the system and reduce the morbid fire called in their donkey latin flamma and in their compound donkey latin inflammation and in their goose greece phlogosis phlegmon c and accordingly th antiphlogistic practice is to cool the sick man by bleeding him and when blid either to rebleed him with a change of instrument bites and stabs instid of gashes or else to rake the blid and then blister the blid and raked and then push mercury till the teeth of the blid raked and blistered shake in their sockets and to starve the blid purged salivated blistered wretch from first to last this is the antiphlogistic system it is seldom carried out entire because the pashint at the first or second link in their rimedial chain expires or else gives such plain signs of sinking that even these assassins take fright and try t undo their own work not diseases by tonics an turtle and stimulants which things given at the right time instead of the wrong given when the pashint was merely weakened by his disorder and not enfeebled by their didly rinmedies would have cut th ailment down in a few hours dear me said mrs dodd and now my good friend with respect to my daughter n list me clashed sampson yere goen to fathom th antiphlogistics since they still survive an slay in holes and corners like barkton and ditly ive driven the vamperes out o the cintres o civilisation begin with their coolers exhaustion is not a cooler it is a feverer and they know it the way parrots know sentences why are we all more or less feverish at night because we are weaker starvation is no cooler it is an inflamer and they know itas parrots know truths but cant apply them for they know that burning fever rages in ivery town street camp where famine is as for bloodletting their prime cooler it is inflammatory and they know it parrotwise for the thumping heart and bounding pulse of pashints blid by butchers in black and bullocks blid by butchers in blue prove it and they have recorded this in all their books yet stabbed and bit and starved and mercuried and murdered on but mind ye all their sham coolers are real weakeners i wonder they didnt inventory satin and his brimstin lake among their refrijrators and this is the point whence t appreciate their imbecility and the sairvice i have rendered mankind in been the first t attack their banded school at a time it seemed imprignable ah this promises to be very interesting sighed mrs dodd and before you enter on so large a field perhaps it would be as well to dispose of a little matter which lies at my heart here is my poor daughter nlissmee a human bean is in a constant state of flux and reflux his component particles move change disappear and are renewed his life is a round of exhaustion and repair of this repair the brain is the sovereign ajint by night and day and the blood the great living material and digestible food th indispensible supply and this balance of exhaustion and repair is too nice to tamper with disnt a single sleepless night or dinnerless day write some pallor on the face and tell against the buddy so does a single excessive perspiration a trifling diary or a cut finger though it takes but half an ounce of blood out of the system and what is the cause of that rare ivintwhich occurs only to pashmints that cant afford dockingdith from old age think ye the man really succumms under years or is mowed down by time nay yons just potry an bosh nashins have been thinned by the lancet but niver by the scythe and years are not forces but misures of events no centenarius decays and dies bekase his bodil expindituire goes on and his bodil income falls off by failure of the reparative and reproductive forces and now suppose bodil exhaustion and repair were a mere matter of pecuniary instead of vital economy what would you say to the steward or housekeeper who to balance your accounts and keep you solvent should open every known channel of expinse with one hand and with the otherstop the supplies yet this is how the dockers for thirty cinturies have burned th human candle at both ends yet wondered the light of life expired under their hands it seems irrational then in my daughters case you would looksee a pashint falls sick what haps directly why the balance is troubled and exhaustion exceeds repair for proof obsairve the buddy when disease is fresh and you will always find a loss of flesh to put it economikly and then you must understand it bein a housekeeper whativer the disease its form or essence expinditure goes on and income lessens but to this sick and therefore weak man comes a docker purblind with cinturies of cant pricidint blood and goose greece imagines him a fiery pervalid though the common sense of mankind through its interpreter common language pronounces him an invalid gashes him with a lancet spills out the great liquid material of all repair by the gallon and fells this weak man wounded now and pale and fainting with dith stamped on his face to th earth like a bayoneted soldier or a slaughtered ox if the weak man wounded thus and weakened survives then the chartered thugs who have drained him by the bunghole turn to and drain him by the spigot they blister him and then calomel him and lest nature should have the ghost of a chance to conterbalance these frightful outgoings they keep strong meat and drink out of his system emptied by their stabs bites purges mercury and blisters damdijjits and that asia excipted was profissional midicine from hippocrates to sampsin antiphlogistic is but a modern name for an assassinating rouutine which has niver varied a hair since scholastic midicine the silliest and didliest of all the hundred forms of quackery first roseunlike seeince art religion and all true sunsin the west to wound the sick to weaken the weak and mutilate the hurt and thin mankind the voluble impugner of his own profession delivered these two last words in thunder so sudden and effective as to strike julias work out of her hands but here as in nature a moments pause followed the thunderclap so mrs dodd who had long been patiently watching her opportunity smothered a shriek and edged in a word this is irresistible you have confuted everybody to their hearts content and now the question is what course shall we substitute she meant in the great case which occupies me but sampson attached a nobler wider sense to her query what course why the great chronothairmal practice based on the remittent and febrile character of all disease above all on the law of perriodicity a law midicine yet has wells of light to draw by remittency i mean th ebb of disease by perriodicity th ebb and also the flow the paroxysm and the remission these remit and recur and keep tune like the tides not in ague and remittent fever only as the profission imagines to this day but in all diseases from a scirrhus in the pylorus t a toothache and i discovered this and the new path to cure of all diseases it opens alone i did it and what my reward hooted insulted belied and called a quack by the banded school of profissional assassins who in their day hooted harvey and jinnerauthors too of great discoveries but discoveries narrow in their consequences compared with mine t appreciate chronothairmalism ye must begin at the beginning so just answer mewhat is man at this huge inquiry whirring tip all in a moment like a cockpheasant in a wood mrs dodd sank back in her chair despondent seeing her hors de combat sampson turned to julia and demanded twice as loud what is man julia opened two violet eyes at him and then looked at her mother for a hint how to proceed how can that child answer such a question sighed mrs dodd let us return to the point i have never strayed an inch from it its about young physic no excuse me it is about a young lady universal medicine what have i to do with that now this is the way with them all cried sampson furious there lowed john bull the men and women of this benighted nashin have an ear for anything provided it matters nothing talk jology conchology entomology theology meteorology astronomy deuteronomy botheronomy or boshology and one is listened to with rivirence because these are all faroff things in fogs but at a word about the

snailshells in the backyard of the moon but dont ask us to know ourselvesijjits the eloquent speaker depressed by the perversity of englishmen in giving their minds to every part of creation but their bodies suffered a momentary loss of energy then mrs dodd who had long been watching lynxlike glided in let us compound you are for curing all the world beginning with nobody my ambition is to cure my girl and leave mankind in peace now if you will begin with my julia i will submit to rectify the universe in its proper turn any time will do to set the human race right you own it is in no hurry but my childs case presses so do pray cure her for me or at least tell me what her indisposition is oh what didnt i tell you well theres nothing the matter with her at receiving this cavalier reply for the reward of all her patience mrs dodd was so hurt and so nearly angry that she rose with dignity from her seat her cheek actually pink and the water in her eyes sampson saw she was ruffled and appealed to juliaof all people there now miss julia said he ruefully she is in a rage because i wont humbug her poplus voolt decipee i tell you maam it is not a midical case give me disease and ill cure t stop ill tell ye what do let her take and swallow the barkton docks prescriptions and butcher bests and canting kinyons and after those four tinkers therell be plenty holes to mend then send for me here was irony mrs dodd retorted by finesse she turned on him with a treacherous smile and said never mind doctors and patients it is so long since we met i do hope you will waive ceremony and dine with me en ami he accepted with pleasure but must return to his inn first and get rid of his dirty boots and pashints and with this he whipped out his watch and saw that dealing with universal medicine he had disappointed more than one sick individual so shot out as hard as he had shot in and left the ladies looking at one another after the phenomenon well said julia with a world of meaning yes dear replied mrs dodd he is a little eccentric i think i will request them to make some addition to the dinner no mamma if you please not to put me off so transparently if i had interrupted and shouted and behaved so you would have packed me off to bed or somewhere directly dont say packed love dismissed me to bed ah cried julia that privileged person is gone and we must all mind our ps and qs once more mrs dodd with an air of nonchalance replied to the effect that dr sampson was not her offspring and so she was not bound to correct his eccentricities and i suppose said she languidly we must accept these extraordinary people as we find them but that is no reason why you should say ps and qs darling that day her hospitable board was spread over a trap blessed with an oracle irrelevantly fluent and dumb to the point she had asked him to dinner with maternal address he could not be on his guard eternally sooner or later through inadvertence or in a moment of convivial recklessness or in a parenthesis of some grand generality he would cure her child or perhaps at his rate of talking would wear out all his idle themes down to the very wellbeing of mankind and them julias mysterious indisposition would come on the blank tapis with these secret hopes she presided at the feast all grace and gentle amity julia too sat down with a little design but a very different one viz of being chilly company for she disliked this new acquaintance and hated the science of medicine the unconscious object chatted away with both and cut their replies very short and did strange things sent away julias chicken regardless of her scorn and prescribed mutton called for champagne and made her drink it and pout and thus excited mrs dodds hopes that he was attending to the case by degrees but after dinner julia to escape medicine universal and particular turned to her mother and dilated on treachery of her literary guide the criticaster it said odds and ends was a good novel to read by the seaside so i thought then oh how different it must be from most books if you can sit by the glorious sea and even look at it so i sent for it directly and would you believe it was an ignoble thing all flirtations and curates the sea indeed a pond would be fitter to read it by and one with a good many geese on was ever such simplicity said mrs dodd why my dear that phrase about the sea does not mean anything i shall have you believing that mr soandso a novelist can wither fashionable folly and that a painful incident to one shopkeeper has thrown a gloom over a whole markettown and so on nowadays every third phrase is of this character a starlings note once it appears there was an age of gold and then came one of iron and then of brass all these are gone and the age of jargon has succeeded she sighed and sampson generalised he plunged from the seaside novel into the sea of fiction he rechristened that joyous art feckshin and lashed its living professors you devour their three volumes greedily said he but after your meal you feel as empty as a drum there is no leading idea in um now there always isin moliere and he comprehended the midicine of his age but what fundamental truth dour novelists iver convey all they can do is pile incidents their customers dictate th article unideaed melodrams for unideaed girls the writers and their feckshins belong to one species and thats the nonvertebrated animals and their midicine is bosh why they bleed still for falls and fevers and niver mention vital chronometry then they dont look straight at nature but see with their ears and repeat one another twelve deep now listen me there are the cracters for an ideaed feckshin in barkington and id write it too only i havent time at this julia forgetting her resolution broke out romantic characters in barkington who who who should they be but my pashints ay ye may lauch miss julee but wait till ye see them he was then seized with a fit of candour and admitted that some even of his pashints were colourless indeed not to mince the matter six or seven of that sacred band were nullity in person i can compare the beggars to nothing said he but the globules of the donothings deed insipid and nothing in em but the others make up man alive ive got a rosycheeked miser and an illused attorney and an honest screwhe is a gardener with a head like a carthorse mamma mamma that is mr maxley cried julia clapping her hands and thawing in her own despite then theres my virgin martyr and my puppy they are brother and sister and theres their father but he is an impenetrable dogwont unbosom howiver he sairves to draw chicks for the other two and so keep em goen bythebye you know my puppy we have not that honour do we know dr sampsons puppy love inquired mrs dodd rather languidly mammaiiknow no one of that name dont tell me why it was he sent me here told me where you lived and i was to make haste for miss dodd was very ill it is young hardie the bankers son ye know mrs dodd said goodhumouredly but with a very slight touch of irony that really they were very much flattered by the interest mr alfred hardie had shown especially as her daughter had never exchanged ten words with him julia coloured at this statement the accuracy of which she had good reason to doubt and the poor girl felt as if an icicle passed swiftly along her back and then for the first the in her life she thought her mother hardly gracious and she wanted to say she was obliged to mr alfred hardie but dared not and despised herself for not daring her composure was further attacked by mrs dodd looking full at her and saying interrogatively i wonder how that young gentleman could know about your being ill at this julia eyed her plate very attentively and murmured i believe it is all over the town and seriously too so mrs maxley says for she tells me that in barkington if more than one doctor is sent for that bodes ill for the patient deevelich ill cried sampson heartily for two physicians like a pair of oars conduck him faster to the styjjin shores garth julia looked him in the face and coldly ignored this perversion of mrs maxleys meaning and mrs dodd returned pertinaciously to the previous topic mr alfred hardie interests me he was good to edward i am curious to know why you call him a puppy only because he is one maam and that is no reason at all with the six he is a juveneel pidant and a puppy and contradicts ivery new truth bekase it isnt in aristotle and th eton grammar and hes such a chatterbox ye cant get in a word idgeways and he and his sisterthats my virgin martyrare a farce he keeps sneerin at her relijjin and that puts her in such a rage she threatens t intercede for him at the throne jargon sighed mrs dodd and just shrugged her lovely shoulders we breathe itwe float in an atmosphere of it my love and she floated out of the room and julia floated after sampson sat meditating on the gullibility of man in matters medical this favourite speculation detained him late and almost his first word on entering the drawingroom was good night little girl julia coloured at this broad hint drew herself up and lighted a bedcandle she went to mrs dodd kissed her and whispered in her ear i hate him and as she retired her whole elegant person launched ladylike defiance under which brave exterior no little uneasiness was hidden oh what will become of me thought she if he has gone and told him about henley lets see the prescriptions maam said dr sampson delighted at this concession mrs dodd took them out of her desk and spread them earnestly he ran his eye over them and pointed out that the mucousmembrane man and the nerve man had prescribed the same medicine on irreconcilable grounds and a medicine moreover whose effect on the nerves was nil and on the mucous membrane was not to soothe it but plough it and harrow it and did not that open her eyes he then reminded her that all these doctors in consultation would have contrived to agree but you said he have baffled the collusive hoax by which dox arrived at a sham uniformityhonest uniformity can never exist till scientific principles obtain listme to begin is the pashint in love the doctor put this query in just the same tone in which they inquire any expectoration but mrs dodd in reply was less dry and businesslike she started and looked aghast this possibility had once for a moment occurred to her but only to be rejected the evidence being all against it in love said she that child and i not know it he said he had never supposed that but i thought id just ask ye for she has no bodily ailment and the passions are all counterfeit diseases they are connected like all diseases with cerebral instability have their hearts and chills like all diseases and their paroxysms and remissions like all diseases nlistme you have detected the signs of a slight cerebral instability i have ascertained th absence of all physical cause then why make this healthy pashints buddy a testtube for poisons sovereign drugs i deal with no other i leave the nullities to the noodles are either counterpoisons or poisons and here there is nothing to counterpoison at prisent so im for caushin and working on the safe side th hidge till we are less in the dark mind ye young women at her age are kittle cattle they have gusts o this and gusts o that th unreasonable imps dye see these two pieces pasteboard they are tickets for a ball in barkton townhall yes of course i see them said mrs dodd dolefully well i prescribe em and when they have been taken and the pashint well shaken perhaps we shall see whether we are on the right system and if so well dose her with youthful society in a more irrashinal form conversaziones cookeyshines et citera and if we find ourselves on the wrong tack why then well hark back stick blindly to a course the dockers cry but it does me harm then twill do good byandbye where lairned ye that echoes of echoes say the killer ploughs a course the healer feels his way so mysterious are the operations of the human mind that when we have exploded in verse tuneful as the above we lapse into triumph instead of penitence not that doggrel meets with reverence here belowthe statues to it are few and not in marble but in the material itselfbut then an impromptu a moment ago our posy was not and now is with the speed if not the brilliancy of lightning we have added a handful to the intellectual dustheap of an oppressed nation from this bad eminence sampson then looked down complacently and saw mrs dodds face as long as his arm she was one that held current opinions and the world does not believe poetry can sing the practical verse and useful knowledge pass for incompatibles and though doggrel is not poetry yet it has a lumbering proclivity that way and so forfeits the confidence of grave sensible people this versification and this impalpable and unprecedented prescription she had waited for so long seemed all of a piece to poor mamma wild unpractical andoh horror horroreccentric sampson read her sorrowful face after his fashion oh i see maam cried he cure is not welcome unless it comes in the form consecrated by cinturies of slaughter well then give me a sheet he took the paper and rent it asunder and wrote this on the larger fragment rx die mercur circa x hor vespert eat in musca ad aulam oppid saltet cum xiii canicul praesertim meo dom reddita hora matutin dormiat at prand repetat stultit pro re nata he handed this with a sort of spiteful twinkle to mrs dodd and her countenance lightened again her sex will generally compound with whoever can give as well as take now she had extracted a real grave prescription she acquiesced in the ball though not a county one to satisfy your whim my good kind friend to whom i owe so much sampson called on his way back to town and in course of conversation praised nature for her beautiful instincts one of which he said had inspired miss julee at a credulous age not to swallow the didly drastics of the tinkering dox mrs dodd smiled and requested permission to contradict him her daughter had taken the several prescriptions sampson inquired brusquely if she took him for a fool she replied calmly no for a very clever but rather opinionated personage opinionated so is ivery man who has grounnds for his opinin dye think because dockers short an bist an kinyon an cuckoo an jackdaw an starling an co dont know the dire effecks of calomel an drastics on the buddy i dont knowt her eye her tongue her skin her voice her elastic walk all tell me she has not been robbed of her vital resources why if she had taken that genteel old thief shorts rimidies alone the girls gums would be sore and herself at diths door mrs dodd was amused julia this is so like the gentlemen they are in love with argumeunt they go on till they reason themselves out of their reason why beat about the bush when there she sits what go t a wumman for the truth when i can go t infallible inference you may always go to my davids daughter for the truth said mrs dodd with dignity she then looked the inquiry and julia replied to her look as follows first she coloured very high then she hid her face in both her hands then rose and turning her neck swiftly darted a glance of fiery indignation and bitter reproach on dr meddlesome and left the apartment mighty staglike maircy on us cried sampson did ye see that maam yons just a bonny basilisk another such thunderbolt as she dispinsed and yell be ringing for your maid to sweep up the good physicians ashes julia did not return till the good physician was gone back to london then she came in with a rush and demonstrative toad embraced mrs dodds knees and owned she had cultivated her geraniums with all those medicines liquid and solid and only one geranium had died there is a fascinating age when an intelligent girl is said to fluctuate between childhood and womanhood let me add that these seeming fluctuations depend much on the company she is in the budding virgin is princess of chameleons and to confine ourselves to her two most piquant contrasts by her mothers side she is always more or less childlike but let a nice young fellow engage her apart and hey presto she shall be every inch a woman perhaps at no period of her life are the purely mental characteristics of her sex so supreme in her thus her type the rosebud excels in essence of rosehood the rose itself my reader has seen julia dodd play both parts but it is her childs face she has now been turning for several pages so it may be prudent to remind him she has shone on alfred hardie in but one light a young but junolike woman had she shown my puppy her childish qualities he would have despised herhe had left that department himself so recently but nature guarded the budding fair from such a disaster we left alfred hardie standing in the moonlight gazing at her lodging this was sudden but let slow coaches deny it as loudly as they like fast coaches exist and love is a passion which like hate envy avarice c has risen to a great height in a single day not that alfreds was love at first sight for he had seen her beauty in the full blaze of day with no deeper feeling than admiration but in the moonlight he came under more sovereign spells than a fair face her virtues and her voice the narrative of their meeting has indicated the first and as to the latter julia was not one of those whose beauty goes out with the candle her voice was that rich mellow moving organ which belongs to no rank nor station is born not made and flow it from the lips of dairymaid or countess touches every heart gentle or simple that is truly male and this divine contralto full yet penetrating dame nature had inspired her to lower when she was moved or excited instead of raising it and then she was enchanting all unconsciously she cast this crowning spell on alfred and he adored her in a word he caught a childwoman away from its mother his fluttering captive turned put on composure and bewitched him she left him and the moonlight night seemed to blacken but within his young breast all was light new light he leaned opposite her window in an elysian reverie and let the hours go by he seemed to have vegetated till then and lo true life had dawned he thought he should love to die for her and when he was calmer he felt he was to live for her and welcomed his destiny with rapture he passed the rest of the oxford term in a soft ecstasy called often on edward and took a sudden and prodigious interest in him and counted the days glide by and the happy time draw near when he should be four months in the same town with his enchantress this one did not trouble the doctors he glowed with a steady fire no heats and chills and sad misgivings for one thing he was not a woman a being tied to that stake suspense and compelled to wait and wait for others actions to him lifes path seemed paved with roses and himself to march in eternal sunshine buoyed by perfumed wings he came to barkington to try for the lovely prize then first he had to come down from loves sky and realise how hard it is here below to court a young ladywho is guarded by a motherwithout an introduction in the usual form the obvious course was to call on edward having parted from him so lately he forced himself to wait a few days and then set out for albion villa as he went along he arranged the coming dialogue for all the parties edward was to introduce him mrs dodd to recognise his friendship for her son he was to say he was the gainer by it julia silent at first was to hazard a timid observation and he to answer gracefully and draw her out and find how he stood in her opinion the sprightly affair should end by his inviting edward to dinner that should lead to their inviting him in turn and then he should have a word with julia and find out what houses she visited and get introduced to their proprietors arrived at this point his mind went over hedge and ditch faster than my poor pen can follow as the crow flies so flew he and had reached the churchporch under a rain of nosegays with juliain imaginationby then he arrived at albion villa in the body yet he knocked timidly his heart beat almost as hard as his hand sarah the blackeyed housemaid answered the door mr edward dodd not at home sir left last week for long i dont rightly know sir but he wont be back this week i dont think perhaps stammered alfred the ladiesmrs doddmight be able to tell me oh yes sir but my mistress shes in london just now alfreds eyes flashed could i learn from miss dodd la sir she is in london along with her ma why tis for her they are gone to insult the great doctors he started she is not ill nothing serious well sir we do hope not she is pinning a bit as young ladies will alfred was anything but consoled by this offhand account he became alarmed and looked wretched seeming him so perturbed sarah who was blunt but goodnatured added but cook she says hard work would cure our miss of all she ails but who shall i say was asking for my work is a bit behindhand alfred took the hint reluctantly and drew out his cardcase saying for mr edward dodd she gave her clean but wettish hand a hasty wipe with her apron and took the card he retired she stood on the step and watched him out of sight said oho and took his card to the kitchen for preliminary inspection and discussion alfred hardie was resolute but sensitive he had come on the wings of love and hope he went away heavily a housemaids tongue had shod his elastic feet with lead in a moment of all misfortunes sickness was what he had not anticipated for she looked immortal perhaps it was that fair and treacherous disease consumption well if it was he would love her all the more would wed her as soon as he was of age and carry her to some soft southern clime and keep each noxious air at bay and prolong her life perhaps save it and now he began to chafe at the social cobwebs that kept him from her but just as his impatience was about to launch him into imprudence he was saved by a genuine descendant of adam james maxley kept mr hardies little pleasaunce trim as trim could be by yearly contract this entailed short but frequent visits and alfred often talked with him for the man was really a bit of a character had a shrewd rustic wit and a ready tongue was rather too fond of law and much too fond of money but scrupulously honest head as long as cudworths but broader and could not read a line one day he told alfred that he must knock off now and take a look in at albion villee the captain was due and on no account would he maxley allow that there ragged box round the captains quarterdeck that is how he do name their little mossel of a lawn and there he walks for a wager athirt and across across and athirt five steps and then about and id amost bet ye a halfpenny he thinks hisself on the salt sea ocean bless his silly old heart all this time alfred after the first start of joyful surprise was secretly thanking his stars for sending him an instrument to learn whether she had returned he asked maxley whether the ladies had sent for him not they said maxley rather contemptuously what do womenfolk care about a border without tis a lace one to their nightcaps for none but the father of all vanity to see not as i have ought to say again the pair they keep their turf tidyishand pay ready moneyand a few flowers in their pots but the rest may shift for itself ye see master alfred explained maxley wagging his head wisely nobodys pride can be everywhere now theirs is inadoors their withdrawingroom its like the queens palace my missus tells me she is wrapped up in em ye know but the captain for my money the sage shouldered his tools and departed but he left a good hint behind him alfred hovered about the backdoor the next day till he caught mrs maxley she supplied the house with eggs and vegetables could she tell him whether his friend edward dodd was likely to come home soon she thought not he was gone away to study he havent much headpiece you know not like what miss julia have mrs and miss are to be home today they wrote to cook this morning i shall be there tomorrow sartain and ill ask in the kitchen when master edward is acoming back she prattled on the ladies of albion villa were good kind ladies the very maidservants loved them miss was more for religion than her mother and went to st annes church thursday evenings and sundays morning and evening and visited some poor women in the parish with food and clothes mrs dodd could not sleep a wink when the wind blew hard at night but never complained only came down pale to breakfast miss julias ailment was nothing to speak of but they were in care along of being so wrapped up in her and no wonder for if ever there was a duck acting on this intelligence alfred went early the next sunday to st annes church and sat down in the side gallery at its east end while the congregation flowed quietly in the organist played the agnus dei of mozart those pious tender tones stole over his hot young heart and whispered peace be still he sighed wearily and it passed through his mind that it might have been better for him and especially for his studies if he had never seen her suddenly the aisle seemed to lighten up she was gliding along it beautiful as may and modesty itself in dress and carriage she went into a pew and kneeled a minute then seated herself and looked out the lessons for the day alfred gazed at her face devoured it but her eyes never roved she seemed to have put off feminine curiosity and the world at the church door indeed he wished she was not quite so heavenly discreet her lashes were delicious but he longed to see her eyes once more to catch a glance from them and by it decipher his fate but no she was there to worship and did not discern her earthly lover whose longing looks were glued to her and his body rose and sank with the true worshippers but with no more spirituality than a piston or a jackinthebox in the last hymn before the sermon a wellmeaning worshipper in the gallery delivered a leading note a high one with great zeal but small precision being about a semitone flat at this outrage on her toosensitive ear julia dodd turned her head swiftly to discover the offender and failed but her two sapphire eyes met alfreds pointblank she was crimson in a moment and lowered them on her book again as if to look that way was to sin it was but a flash but sometimes a flash fires a mine the lovely blush deepened and spread before it melted away and alfreds late cooling heart warmed itself at that sweet glowing cheek she never looked his way again not once which was a sad disappointment but she blushed again and again before the service ended only not so deeply now there was nothing in the sermon to make her blush i might add there was nothing to redden her cheek with religious excitement there was a little candid sournessoil and vinegaragainst sects and low churchmen but thin generality predominated total acetate of morphia for dry souls to sip so alfred took all the credit of causing those sweet irrelevant blushes and gloated the young wretch could not help glorying in his power to tint that fair statue of devotion with earthly thoughts but stay that dear blush was it pleasure or pain what if the sight of him was intolerable he would know how he stood with her and on the spot he was one of the first to leave the church he made for the churchyard gate and walked slowly backwards and forwards by it with throbbing heart till she came out she was prepared for him now and bowed slightly to him with the most perfect composure and no legible sentiment except a certain marked politeness many of our young ladies think wasted upon young gentlemen and are mistaken alfred took off his hat in a tremor and his eyes implored and inquired but met with no further response and she walked swiftly home though without apparent effort he looked longingly after her but discretion forbade he now crawled by albion villa twice every day wet or dry and had the good fortune to see her twice at the drawingroom window he was constant at st annes church and one thursday crept into the aisle to be nearer to her and he saw her steal one swift look at the gallery and look grave but soon she detected him and though she looked no more towards him she seemed demurely complacent alfred had learned to note these subtleties now for love is a microscope what he did not know was that his timid ardour was pursuing a masterly course that to find herself furtively followed everywhere and hovered about for a look is apt to soothe womanly pride and stir womanly pity and to keep the female heart in a flutter of curiosity and emotions two porters that open the hearts great gate to love now the evening before his visit to the dodds dr sampson dined with the hardies and happened to mention the dodds among his old patients the dodds of albion villa inquired miss hardie to her brothers no little surprise albyn fiddlestick said the polished doctor no they live by the waterside used to but now they have left the town i hear he is a seacaptain and a fine lad and mrs dodd is just the bestbred woman i ever prescribed for except mrs sampson it is the dodds of albion villa said miss hardie they have two children a son his name is edward and a daughter julia she is rather goodlooking a gentlemans beauty alfred stared at his sister was she blind with her rather goodlooking sampson was quite pleased at the information n listen me i saved that girls life when she was a year old then she is ill now doctor said alfred hastily do go and see her hum the fact is her brother is a great favourite of mine he then told him how to find albion villa jenny dear said he when sampson was gone you never told me you knew her knew who dear whom why dodds sister oh she is a new acquaintance and not one to interest you we only meet in the lord i do not visit albion villa her mother is an amiable worldling unpardonable combination said alfred with a slight sneer so you and miss dodd meet only at church at church hardly she goes to st annes sits under a preacher who starves his flock with moral discourses and holds out the sacraments of the church as the means of grace alfred shook his head goodhumouredly now jenny that is a challenge and you know we both got into a fury the last time we were betrayed into that miserable waste of time and temper theological discussion no no let sects delight to bark and bite for tis their nature to let gown and surplice growl and fight for satan makes them so but let you and i cut high church and low church and be brother and sister do tell me in english where you meet julia dodd thats a dear for young ladies meeting in the lord conveys no positive idea to my mind jane hardie sighed at this confession we meet in the cottages of the poor and the sick whom he loved and pitied when on earth and we his unworthy servants try to soothe their distress and lead them to him who can heal the soul as well as the body and wipe away all the tears of all his people then it does you infinite credit jane said alfred warmly now that is the voice of true religion and not the whine of this sect nor the snarl of that and so she joins you in this good work i am not surprised we meet in it now and then dear but she can hardly be said to have joined me i have a district you know but poor mrs dodd will not allow julia to enlist in the service she visits independently and by fits and starts and i am afraid she thinks more of comforting their perishable bodies than of feeding their souls it was but the other day she confessed to me her backwardness to speak in the way of instruction to women as old as her mother she finds it so much easier to let them run on about their earthly troubles and of course it is much easier ah the world holds her still in some of its subtle meshes the speaker uttered this sadly but presently brightening up said with considerable bonhomie and almost a sprightly air but she is a dear girl and the lord will yet light her candle alfred pulled a face as of one that drinketh verjuice unawares but let it pass hypercriticism was not his cue just then well jenny said he i have a favour to ask you introduce me to your friend miss dodd will you miss hardie coloured faintly i would rather not dear alfred the introduction could not be for her eternal good julias soul is in a very ticklish state she wavers as yet between this world and the other world and it wont do it wont do there is no middle path you would very likely turn the scale and then i should have fought against her everlasting welfaremy friends what am i an infidel inquired alfred angrily jane looked distressed oh no alfred but you are a worldling alfred smothering a strong sense of irritation besought her to hear reason these big words were out of place here it is dodds sister and he will introduce me at a word worldling as i am then why urge me to do it against my conscience asked the young lady as sharply as if she had been a woman of the world you cannot be in love with her as you do not know her alfred did not reply to this unlucky thrust but made a last effort to soften her can you call yourself my sister and refuse me this trifling service which her brother who loves her and esteems her ten times more sincerely than you do would not think of refusing me if he was at home why should he he is in the flesh himself let the carnal introduce one another i really must decline but i am very very sorry that you feel hurt about it and i am very sorry i have not an amiable worldling for my sister instead of an unamiable and devilish conceited christian and with these bitter words alfred snatched a candle and bounced to bed in a fury so apt is one passion to rouse up others jane hardie let fall a gentle tear but consoled herself with the conviction that she had done her duty and that alfreds anger was quite unreasonable and so he would see as soon as he should cool the next day the lover smarting under this check and spurred to fresh efforts invaded sampson that worthy was just going to dine at albion villa so alfred postponed pumping him till next day well he called at the inn next day and if the doctor was not just gone back to london alfred wandered disconsolate homewards in the middle of buchanan street an agitated treble called after him mr halfred hoh mr halfred he looked back and saw dick absalom a promising young cricketer brandishing a document and imploring aid oh master halfred dooce please come here i durstnt leave the shop there is a tie between cricketers far too strong for social distinctions to divide and though alfred muttered peevishly whose cat is dead now he obeyed the strange summons the distress was a singular one master absalom i must premise was the youngest of two lads in the employ of mr jenner a benevolent old chemist a disciple of malthus jenner taught the virtues of drugs and minerals to tender youths at the expense of the public scarcely ten minutes had elapsed since a pretty servant girl came into the shop and laid a paper on the counter saying please to make that up young man now at fifteen we are gratified by inaccuracies of this kind from ripe female lips so master absalom took the prescription with a complacent grin his eye glanced over it it fell to shaking in his hand chill dismay penetrated his heart and to speak with oriental strictness his liver turned instantly to water however he made a feeble clutch at mercantile mendacity and stammered out heres a many ingredients and the governors out walking and hes been and locked the drawer where we keeps our haulhoppy you couldnt come again in half an hour miss could ye she acquiesced readily for she was not habitually called miss and she had a follower a languid one living hard by and belonged to a class which thinks it consistent to come after its followers dicky saw her safe off and groaned at his ease here was a prescription full of new chemicals sovereign no doubt ie deadly when applied jennerically and the very directions for use were in latin words he had encountered in no prescription before a year ago dicky would have counted the prescribed ingredients on his fingers and then taken down an equal number of little articles solid or liquid mixed them delivered them and so to cricket serene but now his mind to apply the universal cant was in a transition state a years practice had chilled the youthful valour which used to scatter epsom salts or oxalic acid magnesia or corrosive sublimate an experiment or two by himself and his compeers with comments by the coroner had enlightened him as to the final result on the human body of potent chemicals fearlessly administered leaving him dark as to their distinctive qualities applied remedially what should he do run with the prescription to old taylor in the next street a chemist of forty years alas at his tender age he had not omitted to chaff that reverend rival persistently and publicly humble his establishment before the king street one sooner perish drugs and come eternal cricket and after all why not drummerboys and powdermonkeys and other imps of his age that dealt destruction did not depopulate gratis mankind acknowledged their services in cash but old jenner taught by philosophy through its organ the newspapers that knowledge is riches was above diluting with a few shillings a week the wealth a boy acquired behind his counter so his apprentices got no salary then why not shut up the old rogues shutters and excite a little sympathy for him to be followed by a powerful reaction on his return from walking and go and offer his own services on the cricketground to field for the gentlemen by the hour or bowl at a shilling on their balls bowling is the lay for me said he you get money for that and you only bruise the gents a bit and break their thumbs you cant put their vital sparks out as you can at this work by a striking coincidence the most influential member of the cricket club passed while dick was in this quandary oh mr halfred you was always very good to me on the groundyou couldnt have me hired by the club could ye for i am sick of this trade i wants to bowl you little duffer said alfred cricket is a recreation not a business besides it only lasts five months unless you adjourn to the anitipodes stick to the shop like a man and make your fortune oh mr halfred said dick sorrowfully how can i find fortune here jenner dont pay and the crowner declares he will not have it and the barton chronicle says us

ha ha and who is the woman that is to do all this i wonder woman indeed said a treble at the door no more than i am its for a young lady o jiminy this polite ejaculation was drawn out by the speakers sudden recognition of alfred who had raised his head at her remonstrance and now started in his turn for it was the blackeyed servant of albion villa they looked at one another in expressive silence yes sir it is for my young lady is it ready young man no it aint and never will squealed dick angrily its a vile oax and you ought to be ashamed of yourself bringing it into a respectable shop alfred silenced him and told sarah he thought miss dodd ought to know the nature of this prescription before it went round the chemists he borrowed paper of dick and wrote mr alfred hardie presents his compliments to miss dodd and begs leave to inform her that he has by the merest accident intercepted the enclosed prescription as it seems rather a sorry jest and tends to attract attention to miss dodd and her movements he has ventured with some misgivings to send it back with a literal translation on reading which it will be for miss dodd to decide whether it is to circulate on wednesday at ten pm let her go in a fly to the townhall and dance with thirteen little little dogs puppies whelps especially with mine return home at six am and sleep till dinner and repeat the folly as occasion serves suppose i could get it into misss hands when shes alone whispered sarah you would earn my warmest gratitude warmest gratitude is that a warm gownd or a warm clock i wonder it is both when the man is a gentleman and a pretty darkeyed girl pities him and stands his friend sarah smiled and whispered give it me ill do my best alfred enclosed the prescription and his note in one cover handed them to her and slipped a sovereign into her hand he whispered be prudent im dark sir said she and went off briskly homewards and alfred stood rapt in dreamy joy and so selfelated that had he been furnished like a peacock he would have instantly become a thing all eyes and choked up jenners shop and swept his counter he had made a step towards familiarity had written her a letter and then if this prescription came as he suspected from dr sampson she would perhaps be at the ball this opened a delightful vista meantime mrs dodd had communicated sampsons opinion to julia adding that there was a prescription besides gone to be made up however he insists on your going to this ball julia begged hard to be excused said she was in no humour for balls and mrs dodd objecting that the tickets had actually been purchased she asked leave to send them to the dartons they will be a treat to rose and alice they seldom go out mamma i do so fear they are poorer than people think may i it would be but kind said mrs dodd though really why my child should always be sacrificed to other peoples children oh a mighty sacrifice said julia she sat down and enclosed the tickets to rose darton with a little sugared note sarah being out elizabeth took it sarah met her at the gate but did not announce her return she lurked in ambush till julia happened to go to her own room then followed her and handed alfreds missive and watched her slily and being herself expeditious as the wind in matters of the heart took it for granted the enclosure was something very warm indeed so she said with feigned simplicity i suppose it is all right now miss and retreated swelling with a secret and tormented her fellowservants all day with innuendoes dark as erebus julia read the note again and again her heart beat at those few ceremonious lines he does not like me to be talked of she said to herself how good he is what trouble he takes about me ah he will be there she divined rightly on wednesday at ten alfred hardie was in the ballroom it was a magnificent room well lighted and at present not half filled though dancing had commenced the figure alfred sought was not there and he wondered he had been so childish as to hope she would come to a city ball he played the fine gentleman would not dance he got near the door with another oxonian and tried to avenge himself for her absence on the townspeople who were there by quizzing them but in the middle of this amiable occupation and indeed in the middle of a sentence he stopped short and his heart throbbed and he thrilled from head to foot for two ladies glided in at the door and passed up the room with the unpretending composure of wellbred people they were equally remarkable but alfred saw only the radiant young creature in flowing muslin with the narrowest sash in the room and no ornament but a necklace of large pearls and her own vivid beauty she had altered her mind about coming with apologies for her vacillating disposition so penitent and disproportionate that her indulgent and unsuspecting mother was really quite amused alfred was not so happy as to know that she had changed her mind with his note perhaps even this knowledge could have added little to that exquisite moment when unhoped for she passed close to him and the fragrant air from her brushed his cheek and seemed to whisper follow me and be my slave chapter v he did follow her and convinced that she would be engaged ten deep in five minutes hustled up to the master of the ceremonies and begged an introduction the great bankers son was attended to at once julia saw them coming as her sex can see without looking her eyes were on fire and a delicious blush on her cheeks when the m c introduced mr alfred hardie with due pomp he asked her to dance i am engaged for this dance sir said she softly the next asked hardie timidly with pleasure but when they had got so far they were both seized with bashful silence and just as alfred was going to try and break it cornet bosanquet aged height feet inches strutted up with clanking heel and glancing haughtily up at him carried julia off like a steamtug towing away some fair schooner to these little thorns society treats all anxious lovers but the incident was new to alfred and discomposed him and besides he had nosed a rival in sampsons prescription so now he thought to himself that little ensign is his puppy to get rid of mrs dodd he offered to conduct her to a seat she thanked him she would rather stand where she could see her daughter dance on this he took her to the embrasure of a window opposite where julia and her partner stood and they entered a circle of spectators the band struck up and the solemn skating began who is this lovely creature in white asked a middleaged solicitor in white i did not see any beauty in white replied his daughter why there before your eyes said the gentleman loudly what that girl dancing with the little captain i dont see much beauty in her and what a rubbishing dress it never cost a pound making and all suggested another barkingtonian nymph but what splendid pearls said a third can they be real real what an idea ejaculated a fourth who puts on real pearls as big as peas with muslin at twenty pence the yard weasels muttered alfred and quivered all over and he felt to mrs dodd so like a savage going to spring that she laid her hand upon his wrist and said gently but with authority be calm sir and oblige me by not noticing these people then they threw dirt on her bouquet and then on her shoes while she was winding in and out before their eyes a grace and her soft muslin drifting and flowing like an appropriate cloud round a young goddess a little starch would make it set out better its as limp as a towel on the line ill be sworn it was washed at home where it was made i call it a rag not a gown do let us move whispered alfred i am very comfortable here whispered mrs dodd how can these things annoy my ears while i have eyes look at her she is the bestdressed lady in the room her muslin is indian and of a quality unknown to these provincial shopkeepers a rajah gave it us her pearls were my mothers and have been in every court in europe and she herself is beautiful would be beautiful dressed like the dowdies who are criticising her and i think sir she dances as well as any lady can encumbered with an atom that does not know the figure all this with the utmost placidity then as if to extinguish all doubt julia flung them a heavenly smile she had been furtively watching them all the time and she saw they were talking about her the other oxonian squeezed up to hardie do you know the beauty she smiled your way ah said hardie deliberately you mean that young lady with the court pearls in that exquisite indian muslin which floats so gracefully while the other muslin girls are all crimp and stiff like little pigs clad in crackling ha ha ha yes introduce me i could not take such a liberty with the queen of the ball mrs dodd smiled but felt nervous and ill at ease she thought to herself now here is a generous impetuous thing as for the hostile party staggered at first by the masculine insolence of young hardy it soon recovered and true to its sex attacked him obliquely through his white ladye who is the beauty of the ball asked one haughtily i dont know but not that mawkish thing in limp muslin i should say miss hetherington is the belle suggested a third which is miss hetherington asked the oxonian coolly of alfred oh she wont do for us it is that little chalkfaced girl dressed in pink with red roses the pink of vulgarity and bad taste at this both oxonians laughed arrogantly and mrs dodd withdrew her hand from the speakers arm and glided away behind the throng julia looked at him with marked anxiety he returned her look and was sore puzzled what it meant till he found mrs dodd had withdrawn softly from him then he stood confused regretting too late he had not obeyed her positive request and tried to imitate her dignified forbearance the quadrille ended he instantly stepped forward and bowing politely to the cornet said authoritatively mrs dodd sends me to conduct you to her with your permission sir his arm was offered and taken before the little warrior knew where he was he had her on his arm soft light and fragrant as zephyr and her cool breath wooing his neck oh the thrill of that moment but her first word was to ask him with considerable anxiety why did mamma leave you miss dodd i am the most unhappy of men no doubt no doubt said she a little crossly she added with one of her gushes of naivete and i shall be unhappy too if you go and displease mamma what could i do a gang of snobbesses were detracting fromsomebody to speak plainly they were running down the loveliest of her sex your mamma told me to keep quiet and so i did till i got a fair chance and then i gave it them in their teeth he ground his own and added i think i was very good not to kick them julia coloured with pleasure and proceeded to turn it off oh most forbearing and considerate said she ah by the way i think i did hear some ladies express a misgiving as to the pecuniary value of my costume ha ha ohyoufoolishfancy noticing that why it is in little sneers that the approval of the ladies shows itself at a ball and it is a much sincerer compliment than the gentlemens bombastical praises the fairest of her sex and so on that none but the silliest of her sex believe miss dodd i never said the fairest of her sex i said the loveliest oh that alters the case entirely said julia whose spirits were mounting with the lights and music and alfreds company so now come and be reconciled to the best and wisest of her sex ay and the beautifullest if you but knew her sweet dear darling face as i do there she is let us fly mamma here is a penitent for you real or feigned i dont know which real mrs dodd said alfred i had no right to disobey you and risk a scene you served me right by abandoning me i feel the rebuke and its justice let me hope your vengeance will go no further mrs dodd smiled at the grandiloquence of youth and told him he had mistaken her character i saw i had acquired a generous hotheaded ally who was bent on doing battle with insects so i withdrew but so i should at waterloo or anywhere else where people put themselves in a passion the band struck up again ah said julia and i promised you this dance but it is a waltz and my guardian angel objects to the valse a deux temps decidedly should all the mothers in england permit their daughters to romp and wrestle in public and call it waltzing i must stand firm till they return to their senses julia looked at alfred despondently he took his cue and said with a smile well perhaps it is a little rompy a donkeys gallop and then twirl her like a mop since you admit that perhaps you can waltz properly said mrs dodd alfred said he ought he had given his whole soul to it in germany last long then i can have the pleasure of dropping the tyrant away with you both while there is room to circulate alfred took his partner delicately they made just two catlike steps forward and melted into the oldfashioned waltz it was an exquisite moment to most young people love comes after a great deal of waltzing but this pair brought the awakened tenderness and trembling sensibilities of two burning hearts to this their first intoxicating whirl to them therefore everything was an event everything was a thrillthe first meeting and timid pressure of their hands the first delicate enfolding of her supple waist by his strong arm but trembling hand the delightful unison of their unerring feet the movement the music the soft delicious whirl her cool breath saluting his neck his ardent but now liquid eyes seeking hers tenderly and drinking them deep hers that now and then sipped his so sweetlyall these were new and separate joys that linked themselves in one soft delirium of bliss it was not a waltz it was an ecstasy starting almost alone this peerless pair danced a gauntlet on each side admiration and detraction buzzed all the time beautiful they are turning in the air quite gone by thats how the old fogies dance chorus of shallow males how well she waltzes chorus of shallow females how well he waltzes but they noted neither praise nor detraction they saw nothing heard nothing felt nothing but themselves and the other music till two valsers a deux temps plunged into them thus smartly reminded they had not earth all to themselves they laughed goodhumouredly and paused ah i am happy gushed from julia she hushed at herself and said severely you dance very well sir this was said to justify her unguarded admission and did after a fashion i think it is time to go to mamma said she demurely so soon and i had so much to say to you oh very well i am all attention the sudden facility offered set alfred stammering a little i wanted to apologise to you for somethingyou are so good you seem to have forgotten itbut i dare not hope thati mean at henleywhen the beauty of your character and your goodness so overpowered me that a fatal impulse what do you mean sir said julia looking him full in the face like an offended lion while with true feminine and julian inconsistency her bosom fluttered like a dove i never exchanged one word with you in my life before today and i never shall again if you pretend the contrary alfred stood stupified and looked at her in piteous amazement i value your acquaintance highly mr hardie now i have made it as acquaintances are made but please to observe i never saw you beforescarcely not even in church as you please said he recovering his wits in part what you say ill swear to then i say never remind a lady of what you ought to wish her to forget i was a fool and you are an angel of tact and goodness oh now i am sure it is time to join mamma said she in the driest drollest way valsons they waltzed down to mrs dodd exchanging hearts at every turn and they took a good many in the space of a round table for in truth both were equally loth to part at two oclock mrs dodd resumed commonplace views of a daughters health and rose to go her fly had played her false and being our island home it rained buckets alfred ran before they could stop him and caught a fly he was dripping mrs dodd expressed her regrets he told her it did not matter for him the ball was now over the flowers faded and the lights darkness visible the extravagance of these children said mrs dodd to julia with a smile as soon as he was out of hearing julia made no reply next day she was at evening church the congregation was very sparse the first glance revealed alfred hardie standing in the very next pew he wore a calm front of conscious rectitude under which peeped sheepfaced misgivings as to the result of this advance for like all true lovers he was half impudence half timidity and both on the grand scale now julia in a ballroom was one creature another in church after the first surprise which sent the blood for a moment to her cheek she found he had come without a prayerbook she looked sadly and half reproachfully at him then put her white hand calmly over the wooden partition and made him read with her out of her book she shared her hymnbook with him too and sang her makers praise modestly and soberly but earnestly and quite undisturbed by her lovers presence it seemed as if this pure creature was drawing him to heaven holding by that good book and by her touching voice he felt good all over to be like her he tried to bend his whole mind on the prayers of the church and for the first time realised how beautiful they are after service he followed her to the door island home again by the pailful and she had a thick shawl but no umbrella he had brought a large one on the chance he would see her home quite unnecessary it is so near he insisted she persisted and persisting yielded they said but little yet they seemed to interchange volumes and at each gaslight they passed they stole a look and treasured it to feed on that night was one broad step more towards the great happiness or great misery which awaits a noble love such loves somewhat rare in nature have lately become so very rare in fiction that i have ventured with many misgivings to detail the peculiarities of its rise and progress but now for a time it advanced on beaten tracks alfred had the right to call at albion villa and he came twice once when mrs dodd was out this was the time he stayed the two hours a mrs james invited jane and him to tea and exposition there he met julia and edward who had just returned edward was taken with jane hardies face and dovelike eyes eyes that dwelt with a soft and chastened admiration on his masculine face and his model form and their owner felt she had received a call to watch over his spiritual weal so they paired off julias fluctuating spirits settled now into a calm demure complacency her mother finding this strange remedial virtue in youthful society gave young parties inviting jane and alfred in their turn jane hesitated but as she could no longer keep julia from knowing her worldly brother and hoped a way might be opened for her to rescue edward she relaxed her general rule which was to go into no company unless some religious service formed part of the entertainment yet her conscience was ill at ease and to set them an example she took care when she asked the dodds in return to have a clergyman there of her own party who could pray and expound with unction mrs dodd not to throw cold water on what seemed to gratify her children accepted miss hardies invitation but she never intended to go and at the last moment wrote to say she was slightly indisposed the nature of her indisposition she revealed to julia alone that young lady keeps me on thorns i never feel secure she will not say or do something extravagant or unusual she seems to suspect sobriety and good taste of being in league with impiety here i succeed in bridling her a little but encounter a female enthusiast in her own house merci after all there must be something good in her since she is your friend and you are hers but i have something more serious to say before you go there it is about her brother he is a flirt in fact a notorious one more than one lady tells me julia was silent but began to be very uneasy they were sitting and talking after sunset yet without candles she profited for once by that prodigious gap in the intelligence of the sex i hear he pays you compliments and i have seen a disposition to single you out now my love you have the good sense to know that whatever a young gentleman of that age says to you he says to many other ladies but your experience is not equal to your sense so profit by mine a girl of your age must never be talked of with a person of the other sex it is fatal fatal but if you permit yourself to be singled out you will be talked of and distress those who love you it is easy to avoid injudicious duets in society oblige me by doing so tonight to show how much she was in earnest mrs dodd hinted that were her admonition neglected she should regret for once having kept clear of an enthusiast julia had no alternative she assented in a faint voice after a pause she faltered out and suppose he should esteem me seriously mrs dodd replied quickly then that would be much worse but said she i have no apprehensions on that score you are a child and he is a precocious boy and rather a flirt but forewarned is forearmed so now run away and dress sweet one my lecture is quite ended the sensitive girl went up to her room with a heavy heart all the fears she had lulled of late revived she saw plainly now that mrs dodd only accepted alfred as a pleasant acquaintance as a soninlaw he was out of the question oh what will she say when she knows all thought julia next day sitting near the window she saw him coming up the road after the first movement of pleasure at the bare sight of him she was sorry he had come mammas suspicions awake at last and here he was again the third call in one fortnight she dared not risk an interview with him ardent and unguarded under that penetrating eye which she felt would now be on the watch she rose hurriedly said as carelessly as she could i am going to the school and tying her bonnet on all in a flurry whipped out at the backdoor with her shawl in her hand just as sarah opened the front door to alfred she then shuffled on her shawl and whisked through the little shrubbery into the open field and reached a path that led to the school and so gratified was she at her dexterity in evading her favourite that she hung her head and went murmuring cruel cruel cruel alfred entered the drawingroom gaily with a goodsized card and a prepared speech his was not the visit of a friend but a functionary the treasurer of the cricketground come to book two of his eighteen to play against the allengland eleven next month as for you my worthy sir turning to edward i shall just put you down without ceremony but i must ask leave to book captain dodd mrs dodd i come at the universal desire of the club they say it is sure to be a dull match without captain dodd besides he is a capital player mamma dont you be caught by his chaff said edward quietly papa is no player at all anything more unlike cricket than his way of making runs but he makes them old fellow now you and i at lords the other day played in firstrate form left shoulder well up and achievedwith neatness precision dexterity and despatchthe british ducksegg misericorde what is that inquired mrs dodd why a round o said the other oxonian coming to his friends aid and what is that pray alfred told her the round o which had yielded to the ducks egg and was becoming obsolete meant the cypher set by the scorer against a players name who is out without making a run i see sighed mrs dodd the jargon of the day penetrates to your very sports and games and why british oh british is redundant thrown in by the universities but what does it mean it means nothing that is the beauty of it british is inserted in imitation of our idols the greeks they adored redundancy in short poor alfred though not an m p was talking to put off time till julia should come in so he now favoured mrs dodd of all people with a flowery description of her husbands play which i who have not his motive for volubility suppress however he wound up with the captains moral influence last match said he barkington did not do itself justice several that could have made a stand were frightened out rather than bowled by the london professionals then captain dodd went in and treated those artists with the same goodhumoured contempt he would a parish bowler and in particular sent mynnes overtossed balls flying over his head for five or to square leg for four and on his retiring with twentyfive scored in eight minutes the remaining barkingtonians were less funky and made some fair scores mrs dodd smiled a little ironically at this tirade but said she thought she might venture to promise mr dodds cooperation should he reach home in time then to get rid of alfred before julias return the amiable worldling turned to edward your sister will not be back so you may as well ring the bell for luncheon at once perhaps mr hardie will join us alfred declined and took his leave with far less alacrity than he had entered edward went downstairs with him miss dodd gone on a visit asked alfred affecting carelessness only to the school bythebye i will go and fetch her no dont do that call on my sister instead and then you will pull me out of a scrape i promised to bring her here but her saintship was so long adorning the poor perishable body that i came alone i dont understand you said edward i am not the attraction here it is julia how do you know that when a young lady interests herself in an undergraduates soul it is a pretty sure sign she likes the looks of him but perhaps you dont want to be converted if so keep clear of her bar the fell dragons blighting way but shun that lovely snare on the contrary said edward calmly i only wish she could make me as good as she is or half as good give her the chance old fellow and then it wont be your fault if she makes a mess of it call at two and jenny will receive you very kindly and will show you you are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity now wont that be nice i will go said edward gravely they parted where alfred went the reader can perhaps guess edward to luncheon mamma said he with that tranquillity which sat so well on him dont you think alfred hardie is spoony upon our julia mrs dodd suppressed a start and perhaps to gain time before replying sincerely said she had not the honour of knowing what spoony meant why sighs for her and dies for her and fancies she is prettier than miss hardie he must be over head and ears to think that fie child was the answer if i thought so i should withdraw from their acquaintance excuse me i must put on my bonnet at once not to lose this fine afternoon edward did not relish her remark it menaced more spoons than one however he was not the man to be cast down at a word he lighted a cigar and strolled towards hardies house mr hardie senior had left three days ago on a visit to london miss hardie received him he passed the afternoon in calm complacency listening reverently to her admonitions and looking her softly out of countenance and into earthly affections with his lion eyes meantime his remark so far from really seeming foolish to mrs dodd was the true reason for her leaving him so abruptly even this dear slow thing sees it thought she she must talk to julia more seriously and would go to the school at once she went upstairs and put on her bonnet and shawl before the glass then moulded on her gloves and came down equipped on the stairs was a large window looking upon the open field she naturally cast her eyes through it in the direction she was going and what did she see but a young lady and gentleman coming slowly down the path towards the villa mrs dodd bit her lip with vexation and looked keenly at them to divine on what terms they were and the more she looked the more uneasy she grew the head the hand the whole body of a sensitive young woman walking beside him she loves betray her heart to experienced eyes watching unseen and especially to female eyes and why did julia move so slowly especially after that warning why was her head averted from that encroaching boy and herself so near him why not keep her distance and look him full in the face mrs dodds first impulse was that of leopardesses lionesses hens and all the mothers in nature to dart from her ambush and protect her young but she controlled it by a strong effort it seemed wiser to descry the truth and then act with resolution besides the young people were now almost at the shrubbery so the mischief if any was done they entered the shrubbery to mrs dodds surprise and dismay they did not come out this side so quickly she darted her eye into the plantation and lo alfred had seized the fatal opportunity foliage offers even when thinnish he held julias hand and was pleading eagerly for something she seemed not disposed to grant for she turned away and made an effort to leave him but mrs dodd standing there quivering with maternal anxiety and hot with shame could not but doubt the sincerity of that graceful resistance if she had been quite in earnest julia had fire enough in her to box the little wretchs ears she ceased even to doubt when she saw that her daughters opposition ended in his getting hold of two hands instead of one and devouring them with kisses while julia still drew her head and neck away but the rest of her supple frame seemed to yield and incline and draw softly towards her besieger by some irresistible spell i can bear no more gasped mrs dodd aloud and turned to hasten and part them but even as she curved her stately neck to go she caught the lovers parting and a very pretty one too if she could but have looked at it as these things ought always to be looked at artistically julias head and lovely throat unable to draw the rest of her away compromised they turned declined drooped and rested one half moment on her captors shoulder like a settling dove the next she scudded from him and made for the house alone mrs dodd deeply indignant but too wise to court a painful interview with her own heart beating high went into the drawingroom and there sat down to recover some little composure but she was hardly seated when julias innocent voice was heard calling mamma mamma and soon she came bounding into the drawingroom brimful of good news her cheeks as red as fire and her eyes wet with happy tears and there confronted her mother who had started up at her footstep and now with one hand nipping the back of the chair convulsively stood lofty looking strangely agitated and hostile the two ladies eyed one another silent yet expressive like a picture facing a statue but soon the colour died out of julias face as well and she began to cower with vague fears before that stately figure so gentle and placid usually but now so discomposed and stern where have you been julia only at the school she faltered who was your companion home oh dont be angry with me it was alfred alfred his christian name you try my patience too hard forgive me i was not to blame this time indeed indeed you frighten me what will become of me what have i done for my own mamma to look at me so mrs dodd groaned was that young coquette i watched from my window the child i have reared no face on earth is to be trusted after this what have you done indeed only risked your own mothers esteem and nearly broken her heart and with these words her own courage began to give way and she sank into a chair with a deep sigh at this julia screamed and threw herself on her knees beside her and cried kill me oh pray kill me but dont drive me to despair with such cruel words and looks and fell to sobbing so wildly that mrs dodd altered her tone with almost ludicrous rapidity there do not terrify me with your impetuosity after grieving me so be calm child let me see whether i cannot remedy your sad imprudence and that i may pray tell me the whole truth how did this come about in reply to this question which she somewhat mistook julia sobbed out he met me ccoming out of the school and asked to ssee me home i said no thank you because i ththought of your warning oh yes said he and would walk with me and keep saying he loved me so to stop him i said mmuch obliged but i was bbusy and had no time to flirt nor have i the ininclination said he that is not what others say of you said iyou know what you ttold me mammaso at last he said ddid ever he ask any lady to be his wife i suppose not said i or you would be ppprivate property by now instead of ppublic now there was a foolish speech as much as to say nobody could resist him wwasnt it and nno more they could you have no idea how he makes love so unladylike keeps advancing and advancing and never once retreats nor even stops but i ask you to be my wife said he oh mamma i trembled so why did i tremble i dont know i made myself cold and haughty i should make no reply to such ridiculous questions say that to mamma if you dare i said mrs dodd bit her lip and said was there ever such simplicity simple why that was my cunning you are the only creature he is afraid of so i thought to stop his mouth with you but instead of that my lord said calmly that was understood he loved me too well to steal me from her to whom he was indebted for me oh he has always an answer ready and that makes him such a ppest it was an answer that did him credit dear mamma now did it not then at parting he said he would come tomorrow and ask you for my hand but i must intercede with you first or you would be sure to say no so i declined to interfere wwwhat was it to me i said he begged and prayed me was it likely you would give him such a treasure as me unless i stood his friend for the bbbrazen thing turns humble now and then and oh mamma he did so implore me to pity him and kept saying no man ever loved as he loved me and with his begging and praying me so passionatelyoh so passionatelyi felt something warm drop from his poor eyes on my hand oh oh oh ohwhat could i do and then you know i wanted to get away from him so i am afraid i did just say yes but only in a whisper mamma my own good kind darling mamma have pity on him and on me we love one another so a shower of tender tears gushed out in support of this appeal and in a moment she was caught up with loves mighty arms and her head laid on her mothers yearning bosom no word was needed to reconcile these two after a long silence mrs dodd said this would be a warning never to judge her sweet child from a distance again nor unheard and therefore said she let me hear from your own lips how so serious an attachment could spring up why it is scarcely a month since you were first introduced at that ball mamma murmured julia hanging her head you are mistaken we knew each other before mrs dodd looked all astonishment now i will ease my heart said julia impetuously addressing some invisible obstacle i tell you i am sick of having secrets from my own mother and with this out it all came she told the story of her heart better than i have and womanlike dwelt on the depths of loyalty and delicate love she had read in alfreds moonlit face that night at henley she said no eloquence could have touched her like it mamma something said to me ay look at him well for that is your husband to be she even tried to solve the mystery of her soidisant sickness i was disturbed by a feeling so new and so powerful but above all by having a secret from you the firstthe last perhaps even this faint attempt at selfanalysis was due to the influence of dr whately for by nature young ladies of this age seldom turn the eye inward well darling then why have a secret why not trust me your friend as well as your mother ah why indeed i am a puzzle to myself i wanted you to know and yet i could not tell you i kept giving you hints and hoped so you would take them and make me speak out but when i tried to tell you plump something kept pullpullpulling me inside and i couldnt mark my words some day it will turn out that i am neither more nor less than a fool mrs dodd slighted this ingenious solution she said after a moments reflection that the fault of this misunderstanding lay between the two i remember now i have had many hints my mind must surely have gone to sleep i was a poor simple woman who thought her daughter was to be always a child and you were very wrong to go and set a limit to your mothers love there is nonenone whatever she added i must import a little prudence and respect for the worlds opinion into this new connection but whoever you love shall find no enemy in me next day alfred came to know his fate he was received with ceremonious courtesy at first he was a good deal embarrassed but this was no sooner seen than it was relieved by mrs dodd with tact and gentleness when her turn came she said your papa of course you have communicated this step to him alfred looked a little confused and said no he left for london two days ago as it happens that is unfortunate said mrs dodd your best plan would be to write to him at once i need hardly tell you that we shall enter no family without an invitation from its head alfred replied that he was well aware of that and that he knew his father and could answer for him no doubt said mrs dodd but as a matter of reasonable form i prefer he should answer for himself alfred would write by this post it is a mere form said he for my father has but one answer to his children please yourselves he sometimes adds and how much money shall you want these are his two formulae he then delivered a glowing eulogy on his father and mrs dodd to whom the boys character was now a grave and anxious study saw with no common satisfaction his cheek flush and his eyes moisten as he dwelt on the calm sober unvarying affection and reasonable indulgence he and his sister had met with all their lives from the best of parents returning to the topic of topics he proposed an engagement i have a ring in my pocket said this brisk wooer looking down but this mrs dodd thought premature and unnecessary you are nearly of age said she and then you will be able to marry if you are in the same mind but upon being warmly pressed she half conceded even this well said she on receiving your fathers consent you can propose an engagement to julia and she shall use her own judgment but until then you will not even mention such a thing to her may i count on so much forbearance from you sir dear mrs dodd said alfred of course you may i should indeed be ungrateful if i could not wait a post for that may i write to my father here added he naively mrs dodd smiled furnished him with writing materials and left him with a polite excuse albion villa september my dear fatheryou are too thorough a man of the world and too well versed in human nature to be surprised at hearing that i so long invulnerable have at last formed a devoted attachment to one whose beauty goodness and accomplishments i will not now enlarge upon they are indescribable and you will very soon see them and judge for yourself the attachment though short in weeks and months has been a very long one in hopes and fears and devotion i should have told you of it before you left but in truth i had no idea i was so near the goal of all my earthly hopes there were many difficulties but these have just cleared away almost miraculously and nothing now is wanting to my happiness but your consent it would be affectation or worse in me to doubt that you will grant it but in a matter so delicate i venture to ask you for something more the mother of my ever and only beloved julia is a lady of high breeding and sentiments she will not let her daughter enter any family without a cordial invitation from its head indeed she has just told me so i ask therefore not your bare consent of which i am sure since my happiness for life depends on it but a consent so gracefully wordedand who can do this better than youas to gratify the just pride and sensibilities of the highminded family about to confide its brightest ornament to my care my dear father in the midst of felicity almost more than mortal the thought has come that this letter is my first step towards leaving the paternal roof under which i have been so happy all my life thanks to you i should indeed be unworthy of all your goodness if this thought caused me no emotion yet i do but yield to natures universal law and should i be master of my own destiny i will not go far from you i have been unjust to barkington or rather i have echoed without thought oxonian prejudices and affectation on mature reflection i know no better residence for a married man do you remember about a year ago you mentioned a miss lucy fountain to us as the most perfect gentlewoman you had ever met well strange to say it is that very ladys daughter and i think when you see her you will say the breed has anything but declined in spite of horace mind his damnosa quid non her brother is my dearest friend and she is jennys so a more happy alliance for all parties was never projected write to me by return dear father and believe me ever your dutiful and grateful son alfred hardle as he concluded julia came in and he insisted on her reading this masterpiece she hesitated then he told her with juvenile severity that a good husband always shares his letters with his wife his wife alfred and she coloured all over dont call me names said she turning it off after her fashion i cant bear it it makes me tremble with fury this will never do sweet one said alfred gravely you and i are to have no separate existence now you are to be i and i am to be you come no you read me so much of it as is proper for me to hear i shall not like it so well from your lips but never mind when he came to read it he appreciated the delicacy that had tempered her curiosity he did not read it all to her but nearly it is a beautiful letter said she a little pomposer than mamma and i write the paternal roof but all that becomes you you are a scholar and dear alfred if i should separate you from your papa i will never estrange you from him oh never never may i go for my work for methinks o most erudite the maternal dame on domestic cares intent hath confided to her offspring the recreation of your highness the gay creature dropt him a curtsey and fled to tell mrs dodd the substance of the sweet letter the dear highflown thing had written by then he had folded and addressed it she returned and brought her work charity childrens great cloaks her mother had cut them and in the height of the fashion to jane hardies dismay and julia was binding hooding etcetering them how demurely she bent her lovely head over her charitable work while alfred poured his tale into her ears how careful she was not to speak when there was a chance of his speaking how often she said one thing so as to express its opposite a process for which she might have taken out a patent how she and alfred compared heartnotes and their feelings at each stage of their passion their hearts put forth tendril after tendril and so curled and clung round each other in the afternoon of the second blissful day julia suddenly remembered that this was dull for her mother to have such a thought was to fly to her and she flew so swiftly that she caught mrs dodd in tears and trying adroitly and vainly to hide them what is the matter i am a wretch i have left you alone do not think me so peevish love you have but surprised the natural regrets of a mother at the loss of her child oh mamma said julia warmly and do you think all the marriage in the world can ever divide you and mecan make me lukewarm to my own sweet darling beautiful blessed angel mother look at me i am as much your julia as ever and shall be while i live your son is your son till he gets him a wife but your daughters your daughter allthedaysof her life divine power of native eloquence with this trite distich you made hexameters tame it gushed from that great young heart with a sweet infantine ardour that even virtue can only pour when young and youth when virtuous and at the words i have emphasised by the poor device of capitals two lovely supple arms flew wide out like a soaring albatrosss wings and then went all round the sad mother and gathered every bit of her up to the generous young bosom i know it i know it cried mrs dodd kissing her i shall never lose my daughter while she breathes but i am losing my child you are turning to a woman visibly and you were such a happy child hence my misgivings and these weak tears which you have dried with a word see and she contrived to smile and now go down dearest he may be impatient mens love is so fiery the next day mrs dodd took julia apart and asked her whether there was an answer from mr hardie julia replied from alfred that jane had received a letter last night and to judge by the contents mr hardie must have left london before alfreds letter got there he is gone to see poor uncle thomas why do you call him poor oh he is not very clever has not much mind alfred says indeed hardly any you alarm me julia cried mrs dodd what madness in the family you propose to marry into oh no mamma said julia in a great hurry no madness only a little imbecility mrs dodds lip curved at this julian answer but just then her mind was more drawn to another topic a serious doubt passed through her whether if mr hardie did not write soon she ought not to limit his sons attendance on her daughter he follows her about like a little dog said she half fretfully next day by previous invitation dr sampson made albion villa his headquarters darting in from london he found alfred sitting very close to julia over a book lordsake cried he heres my puppy and m enthusiast cheek by chowl julia turned scarlet and alfred ejaculated so loudly that sampson inquired what on airth was the matter now oh nothing only here have i been jealous of my own shadow and pestering her who your puppy was and she never would tell me all i could get from her added he turning suddenly from gratitude to revenge was that he was no greater a puppy than yourself doctor oh alfred no i only said no vainer cried julia in dismay well it is true said sampson contentedly and proceeded to dissect himself just as he would a stranger i am a vain man a remarkably vain man but then im a man of great mirit all vain people are that suggested alfred dryly who should know better than you young oxford y have got a hidache no indeed dont tell lies now ye cant deceive me man ive an eye like a hawk and whats that yere studying with her ovid for a pound no medicine a treatise on your favourite organ the brain by one dr whately he is chaffing you doctor said edward it is logic he is coaching her and then she will coach me then i forbid the chaffcutting young pidant logic is an ill plaster to a sore head oh the labour we delight in physics pain jinnyus jinnyus take care o your carkuss retorted the master of doggrel and that is a profounder remark than you seem to think by your grinning all of ye julia settled the question by putting away the book and she murmured to alfred i wish i could steal your poor dear headaches you might give me half of them at least you would too if you really loved me this sound remonstrance escaped criticism by being nearly inaudible and by mrs dodd entering at the same moment after the first greeting sampson asked her with merry arrogance how his prescription had worked is her sleep broken still maam are her spirits up and down shall we have to go back t old short and his black draught hows her mookis membrin and her biliary ducks anshes off like a flash and no wonder said mrs dodd reproachfully thus splashed sampson among the ducks one of them did not show her face again till dinner jane hardie accompanied her brother by invitation the general amity was diversified and the mirth nowise lessened by constant passages of arms between messrs sampson and alfred hardie after tea came the first contretemps sampson liked a game of cards he could play yet talk chronothermalism as the fair can knit babies shoes and imbibe the poetasters of the day mrs dodd had asked edward to bring a fresh pack he was seen by his guardian angel to take them out of his pocket and undo them presently sampson in his rapid way clutched hold of them and found a slip of paper curled round the ace of spades with this written very clear in pencil remember thy creator in the days of thy youth what is this cried sampson and read it out aloud jane hardie coloured and so betrayed herself her word in season had strayed it was the young and comely edward she wished to save from the diabolical literature the painted perdition and not the uninteresting old sinner sampson who proceeded to justify her preference by remarking that remember not to trump your partners best card ladies would be more to the point everybody except this hardened personage was thoroughly uncomfortable as for alfred his face betrayed a degree of youthful mortification little short of agony mrs dodd was profoundly disgusted but fortunately for the hardies caught sight of his burning cheeks and compressed lips dr sampson said she with cold dignity you will i am sure oblige me by making no more comments sincerity is not always discreet but it is always respectable it is one of your own titles to esteem i dare say added she with great sweetness our resources are not so narrow that we need shock anybodys prejudices and as it happens i was just going to ask julia to sing open the piano love and try if you can persuade miss hardie to join you in a duet at this jane and julia had an earnest conversation at the piano and their words uttered in a low voice were covered by a contemporaneous discussion between sampson and mrs dodd jane no you must not ask me i have forsworn these vanities i have not opened my piano this two years julia oh what a pity music is so beautiful and surely we can choose our songs as easily as our words ah how much more easily jane oh i dont go so far as to call music wicked but music in society is such a snare at least i found it so my playing was highly praised and that stirred up vanity and so did my singing with which i had even more reason to be satisfied snares snares julia goodness me i dont find them so now you mention it gentlemen do praise one but dear me they praise every lady even when we have been singing every other note out of tune the little unmeaning compliments of society can they catch anything so great as a soul jane i pray daily not to be led into temptation and shall i go into it of my own accord julia not if you find it a temptation at that rate i ought to decline jane that doesnt follow my conscience is not a law to yours besides your mamma said sing and a parent is not to be disobeyed upon a doubt if papa were to insist on my going to a ball even or reading a novel i think i should obey and lay the whole case before him mrs dodd from a distance come my dears dr sampson is getting so impatient for your song sampson hum for all that young ladies singing is a poor substitute for cards and even for conversation mrs dodd that depends upon the singer i presume sampson maidearmadam they all sing alike just as they all write alike i can hardly tell one fashionable tune from another and nobody can tell one word from another when they cut out all the consonants n listen me this is what i heard sung by a lady last night eu un da ei u aa an oo by oo eeeeyee aa vaullee vaullee vaullee vaullee vaullee om is igh eeaa an ellin in is ud mrs dodd that sounds like gibberish sampson it is gibberish but its drydenish in articulating mouths it is he sung darius great and good by too severe a fate fallen fallen fallen fallen fallen from his high estate and wiltering in his blood mrs dodd i think you exaggerate i will answer for julia that she shall speak as distinctly to music as you do in conversation sampson all unconscious of the tap time will show madam at prisent they seem to be in no hurry to spatter us with their wordjelly does some spark of pity linger in their marble bosms or do they prefer inaudble chitchat t inarticulate mewing julia thus pressed sang one of those songs that come and go every season she spoke the words clearly and with such variety and intelligence that sampson recanted and broke in upon thevery prettyhow sweetand who is it by of the others by shouting very weak trash very cleanly sung now give us something worth the wear and tear of your orgins immortal vairse widded t immortal sounds that is what i understand b a song alfred whispered no no dearest sing something suitable to you and me out of the question then go farther away dear i shall have more courage he obeyed and she turned over two or three musicbooks and finally sung from memory she cultivated musical memory having observed the contempt with which men of sense visit the sorry pretenders to music who are tuneless and songless among the nightingales and anywhere else away from their books how will they manage to sing in heaven answer me that the song julia dodd sang on this happy occasion to meet the humble but heterogeneous views of messrs sampson and hardie was a simple eloquent irish song called aileen aroon whose history bythebye was a curious one early in this century it occurred to somebody to hymn a son of george the third for his double merit in having been born and going to a ball people who thus apply the fine arts in modern days are seldom artists accordingly this parasite could not invent a melody so he coolly stole aileen aroon soiled it by inserting sordid and incongruous jerks into the refrain and called the stolen and adulterated article robin adair an artisan of the same kidney was soon found to write words down to the degraded ditty and so strong is flunkeyism and so weak is criticism in these islands that the polluted tune actually superseded the clean melody and this sort of thing who was in uniform at the ball silly billy smothered the immortal lines but mrs dodds severe taste in music rejected those ignoble jerks and her enthusiastic daughter having the option to hymn immortal constancy or mortal fat decided thus when like the early rose aileen aroon beauty in childhood glows aileen aroon when like a diadem buds blush around the stem which is the fairest gem aileen aroon is it the laughing eye aileen aroon is it the timid sigh aileen aroon is it the tender tone soft as the stringd harps mean no it is truth alone aileen aroon i know a valley fair aileen aroon i know a cottage there aileen aroon far in that valleys shade i know a gentle maid flower of the hazel glade aileen aroon who in the song so sweet aileen aroon who in the dance so fleet aileen aroon dear are her charms to me dearer her laughter free dearest her constancy aileen aroon youth must with time decay aileen aroon beauty must fade away aileen aroon castles are sacked in war chieftains are scattered far truth is a fixed star aileen areon the way the earnest singer sang these lines is beyond the conception of ordinary singers public or private here one of natures orators spoke poetry to music with an eloquence as fervid and delicate as ever rung in the forum she gave each verse with the same just variety as if she had been reciting and when she came to the last where the thought rises abruptly and is truly noble she sang it with the sudden pathos the weight and the swelling majesty of a truthful soul hymning truth with all its powers all the hearers even sampson were thrilled astonished spellbound so can one wave of immortal music and immortal verse alas how seldom they meet heave the inner man when genius interprets judge then what it was to alfred to whom with these great words and thrilling tones of her rich swelling ringing voice the darling of his own heart vowed constancy while her inspired face beamed on him like an angels even mrs dodd though acquainted with the song and with her daughters rare powers gazed at her now with some surprise as well as admiration and kept a note sarah had brought her open but unread in her hand unable to take her eyes from the inspired songstress however just before the song ended she did just glance down and saw it was signed richard hardie on this her eye devoured it and in one moment she saw that the writer declined politely but peremptorily the proposed alliance between his son and her daughter the mother looked up from this paper at that living radiance and incarnate melody in a sort of stupor it seemed hardly possible to her that a provincial banker could refuse an alliance with a creature so peerless as that but so it was and despite her habitual selfgovernment mrs dodds white hand clenched the note till her nails dented it and she reddened to the brow with anger and mortification julia whom she had trained never to monopolise attention in society now left the piano in spite of remonstrance and soon noticed her mothers face for from red it had become paler than usual are you unwell dear said she sotto voce no love is there anything the matter then hush we have guests our first duty is to them with this mrs dodd rose and endeavouring not to look at her daughter at all went round and drew each of her guests out in turn it was the very heroism of courtesy for their presence was torture to her at last to her infinite relief they went and she was left alone with her children she sent the servants to bed saying she would undress miss dodd and accompanied her to her room there the first thing she did was to lock the door and the next was to turn round and look at her full i always thought you the most lovable child i ever saw but i never admired you as i have tonight my noble my beautiful daughter who would grace the highest family in england with this mrs dodd began to choke and kissed julia eagerly with the tears in her eyes and drew her with tender eloquent defiance to her bosom my own mamma said julia softly what has happened my darling said mrs dodd trembling a little have you pride have you spirit i think i have i hope so for you will need them both read that and she held out mr hardies letter but turned her own head away not to see her girls face under the insult chapter vi julia took mr hardies note and read it madami have received a very juvenile letter from my son by which i learn he has formed a sudden attachment to your daughter he tells me however at the same time that you await my concurrence before giving your consent i appreciate your delicacy and it is with considerable regret i now write to inform you this match is out of the question i have thought it due to you to communicate this to yourself and without delay and feel sure that you will under the circumstances discountenance my sons further visits at your housei am madam with sincere respect your faithful servant richard hardie julia read this letter and reread it in silence it was an anxious moment to the mother shall our pride be less than this parvenus she faltered tell me yourself what ought we to do what we ought to do is never to let the name of hardie be mentioned again in this house this reply was very comforting to mrs dodd shall i write to him or do you feel strong enough i feel that if i do i may affront him he had no right to pretend that his father would consent you write and then we shall not lose our dignity though we are insulted i feel so weary mamma life seems ended i could have loved him well and now show me how to tear him out of my heart or what will become of me while mrs dodd wrote to alfred hardie julia sank down and laid her head on her mothers knees the note was shown her she approved it languidly a long and sad conversation followed and after kissing her mother and clinging to her she went to bed chilly and listless but did not shed a single tear her young heart was benumbed by the unexpected blow next morning early alfred hardie started gaily to spend the day at albion villa not a hundred yards from the gate he met sarah with mrs dodds letter enclosing a copy of his fathers to her mrs dodd here reminded him that his visits had been encouraged only upon a misapprehension of his fathers sentiments for which misapprehension he was in some degree to blame not that she meant to reproach him on that score especially at this unhappy moment no she rather blamed herself for listening to the sanguine voice of youth but the error must now be repaired she and julia would always wish him well and esteem him provided he made no further attempt to compromise a young lady who could not be his wife the note concluded thus individually i think i have some right to count on your honourable feeling to hold no communication with my daughter and not in any way to attract her attention under the present circumstancesi am dear mr alfred hardie with many regrets at the pain i fear i am giving you your sincere friend and wellwisher lucy dodd alfred on reading this letter literally staggered but proud and sensitive as well as loving he manned himself to hide his wound from sarah whose black eyes were bent on him in merciless scrutiny he said doggedly though tremulously very well then turned quickly on his heel and went slowly home mrs dodd with wellfeigned indifference questioned sarah privately the girls account of the abrupt way in which he had received the missive added to her anxiety she warned the servants that no one was at home to mr alfred hardie two days elapsed and then she received a letter from him poor fellow it was the eleventh he had written and torn up ten dear mrs doddi have gained some victories in my life but not one without two defeats to begin with how then can i expect to obtain such a prize as dear julia without a check or two you need not fear that i shall intrude after your appeal to me as a gentleman but i am not going to give in because my father has written a hasty letter from yorkshire he and i must have many a talk face to face before i consent to be miserable for life dear mrs dodd at first receipt of your cruel letter so kindly worded i was brokenhearted but now i am myself again difficulties are made for ladies to yield to and for men to conquer only for pitys sake do not you be my enemy do not set her against me for my fathers fault think if you can how my heart bleeds at closing this letter without one word to her i love better a thousand times better than my lifei am dear mrs dodd yours sorrowfully but not despairing alfred hardie mrs dodd kept this letter to herself she could not read it quite unmoved and therefore she felt sure it would disturb her daughters heart the more alfred had now a soft but dangerous antagonist in mrs dodd all the mother was in arms to secure her daughters happiness coute quil coute and the surest course seemed to be to detach her affections from alfred what hope of a peaceful heart without this and what real happiness without peace but too wise and calm to interfere blindly she watched her daughter day and night to find whether love or pride was the stronger and this is what she observed julia never mentioned alfred she sought occupation eagerly came oftener than usual for money saying it was for luxury she visited the poor more constantly taking one of the maids with her at mrs dodds request she studied logic with edward she went to bed rather early fatigued it would appear by her activity and she gave the clue to her own conduct one day mamma said she nobody is downright unhappy who is good mrs dodd noticed also a certain wildness and almost violence with which she threw herself into her occupations and a worn look about the eyes that told of a hidden conflict on the whole mrs dodd was hopeful for she had never imagined the cure would be speedy or easy to see her child on the right road was much only the great healer time could medicine her to that sweet peace which once she owned and even time cannot give her back her childhood thought the mother with a sigh one day came an invitation to an evening party at a house where they always wound up with dancing mrs dodd was for declining as usual for since that night julia had shunned parties give me the sorrows of the poor and afflicted was her cry the gaiety of the hollow world jars me more than i can bear but now she caught with a sort of eagerness at this invitation accept they shall not say i am wearing the willow my brave girl said mrs dodd joyfully i would not press it but you are right we owe it to ourselves to outface scandal still let there be no precipitation we must not undertake beyond our strength try me tonight said julia you dont know what i can do i dare say he is not pining for me she was the life and soul of the party and indeed so feverishly brilliant that mrs dodd said softly to her gently love moderate your spirits or they will deceive our friends as little as they do me meantime it cost alfred hardie a severe struggle to keep altogether aloof from julia in fact it was a state of daily selfdenial to which he would never have committed himself but that he was quite sure he could gradually win his father over at his age we are apt to count without our antagonist mr richard hardie was a longheaded man he knew the consequence of giving ones reasons eternal discussion ending in war he had taken care not to give any to mrs dodd and he was as guarded and reserved with alfred the young man begged to know the why and the wherefore and being repulsed employed all his art to elicit them by surprise or get at them by inference but all in vain hardie senior was impenetrable and inquiry petulance tenderness logic were all shattered on him as the waves break on ailsa craig thus began dissension decently conducted at first between a father indulgent hitherto and an affectionate son in this unfortunate collision of two strong and kindred natures every advantage was at present on the fathers side age experience authority resolution hidden and powerful motives to which my reader even has no clue as yet a purpose immutable and concealed add to these a colder nature and a far colder affection for alfred loved his father dearly at last one day the impetuous one lost his selfcommand and said he was a son not a slave and had little respect for authority when afraid or ashamed to appeal to reason hardie senior turned on him with a gravity and dignity no man could wear more naturally alfred have i been an unkind father to you all these years oh no father no i have said nothing that can be so construed and that is the mystery to me you are acting quite out of character have i been one of those interfering pragmatical fathers who cannot let their children enjoy themselves their own way no sir you have never interfered except to pay for anything i wanted then make the one return in your power young man have a little faith in such a father and believe that he does not interfere now but for your good and under a stern necessity and that when he does interfere for once and say this thing shall not be it shall not beby heaven alfred was overpowered by the weight and solemnity of this sorrow vexation and despondency all rushed into his heart together and unmanned him for a moment he buried his face in his hands and something very like a sob burst from his young heart at this hardie senior took up the newspaper with imperturbable coldness and wore a slight curl of the lip all this was hardly genuine for he was not altogether unmoved but he was a man of rare selfcommand and chose to impress on alfred that he was no more to be broken or melted than a mere rock it is always precarious to act a part and this cynicism was rather able than wise alfred looked up and watched him keenly as he read the monetary article with tranquil interest and then for the first time in his life it flashed into the young mans mind that his father was not a father i never knew him till now thought he this man is greek text without bowels of affection thus a gesture so to speak sowed the first seed of downright disunion in richard hardies housedisunion a fastgrowing plant when men set it in the soil of the passions alfred unlike julia had no panacea had any lips except perhaps hers told him that to be good is to be happy here below he would have replied negatur contradicted by daily experience it never occurred to him therefore to go out of himself and sympathise with the sordid sorrows of the poor and their bottomless egotism in contact with the welltodo he brooded on his own love and his own unhappiness and his own fathers cruelty his nights were sleepless and his days leaden he tried hard to read for his first class but for once even ambition failed it ended in flinging books away in despair he wandered about dreaming and moping for some change and bitterly regretting his excessive delicacy which had tied his own hands and brought him to a standstill he lost his colour and what little flesh he had to lose for such young spirits as this are never plump in a word being now straitjacketed into feminine inactivity while void of feminine patience his ardent heart was pining and fretting itself out he was in this condition when one day peterson his oxonian friend burst in on him openmouthed with delight and as usual with bright spirits of this calibre did not even notice his friends sadness cupid had clapped him on the shoulder as shakespeare hath it and it was a deal nicer than the bumbailiff rheumatism oh such a divine creature met her twice you know her by sight her name is dodd but i dont care it shall be peterson the rose by any other name c then followed a rapturous description of the ladys person well worth omitting and such a jolly girl brightens them all up wherever she goes and such a dancer did the cachouka with a little spanish bloke bosanquet has got hold of and made his black bolus eyes twinkle like midnight cigars danced it with castanets and smiles and such a what dye call em my boy you know such a go you mean such an abandon groaned alfred turning sick at heart thats the word twice the spirit of duvernay and ten times the beauty but just you hear her sing that is all italian french german english even plaintive songs oh whatever they ask for make you laugh or make you cry to order never says no just smiles and sits down to the musicbox only she wont sing two running they have to stick a duffer in between i shall meet her again next week will you come any friend of mine is welcome wish me joy old fellow im a gone coon this news put alfred in a phrensy of indignation and fear julia dancing the cachouka julia a jolly girl julia singing songs pathetic or merry whichever were asked for the heartless one he called to mind all he had read in the classics and elsewhere about the fickleness of woman but this impression did not last long he recalled julias character and all the signs of a love tender and true she had given him he read her by himself and loverlike laid all the blame on another it was all her coldblooded mother fool that i have been i see it all now she appeals to my delicacy to keep away then she goes to julia and says see he deserts you at a word from his father be proud be gay he never loved you marry another the shallow plotter forgets that whoever she does marry ill kill how many unsuspicious girls have these doublefaced mothers deluded so they do it in half the novels especially in those written by women and why because these know the perfidy and mendacity of their sex better than we do they see them nearer and with their souls undrest war mrs dodd war to the death from this moment i am alone in the world with her i have no friend but alfred hardie and my bitterest enemies are my coldblooded father and her coldblooded mother the above sentences of course were never uttered but they represent his thoughts accurately though in a condensed form and are as it were a miniature of this young heart boiling over from that moment he lay in wait for her and hovered about the house day and night determined to appeal to her personally and undeceive her and baffle her mothers treachery but at this game he was soon detected mrs dodd lived on the watch now julia dressed to go out went to the window one afternoon to look at the weather but retreated somewhat hastily and sat down on the sofa you flutter darling said mrs dodd ah he is there yes you had better take off your things oh yes i tremble at the thoughts of meeting him mamma he is changed sadly changed poor poor alfred she went to her own room and prayed for him she informed the omniscient that though much greater and better in other respects than she was he had not patience she prayed with tears that he might have christian patience granted him from on high heart of stone she shuns me said alfred outside he had seen her in her bonnet mrs dodd waited several days to see whether this annoyance would not die of itself waiting was her plan in most things finding he was not to be tired out she sent sarah out to him with a note carefully sealed mr alfred hardieis it generous to confine my daughter to the houseyours regretfully lucy dodd a line came back instantly in pencil mrs doddis all the generosity and all the good faith to be on one sideyours in despair alfred hardie mrs dodd coloured faintly the reproach pricked her but did not move her she sat quietly down that moment and wrote to a friend in london to look out for a furnished villa in a healthy part of the suburbs with immediate possession circumstances said she making it desirable we should leave barkington immediately and for some months the bosanquets gave a large party mrs and miss dodd were there the latter was playing a part in a charade to the admiration of all present when in came mr peterson introducing his friend alfred hardie julia caught the name and turned a look of alarm on her mother but went on acting presently she caught sight of him at some distance he looked very pale and his glittering eye was fixed on her with a sort of stern wonder such a glance from fiery eyes that had always dwelt tenderly on her till then struck her like a weapon she stopped short and turned red and pale by turns there that is nonsense enough said she bitterly and went and sat by mrs dodd the gentlemen thronged round her with compliments and begged her to sing she excused herself presently she heard an excited voice towards which she dared not look it was inquiring whether any lady could sing aileen aroon with every desire to gratify the young millionaire nobody knew aileen aroon nor had ever heard of it oh impossible cried alfred why it is in praise of constancy a virtue ladies shine in at least they take credit for it mamma whispered julia terrified get me away or there will be a scene he is reckless be calm love said mrs dodd there shall be none she rose and glided up to alfred hardie looked coldly in his face then said with external politeness and veiled contempt i will attempt the song sir since you desire it she waved her hand and he followed her sulkily to the piano she sung aileen aroon not with her daughters eloquence but with a purity and mellowness that charmed the room they had never heard the genius sing it as spirits are said to overcome the man at whose behest they rise so this sweet air and the gush of reminiscence it awakened overpowered him who had evoked them alfred put his hand unconsciously to his swelling heart cast one look of anguish at julia and hurried away half choked nobody but julia noticed a fellow in a rough greatcoat and tattered white hat opened the fly door for mrs dodd as julia followed her he kissed her skirt unseen by mrs dodd but her quick ears caught a heartbreaking sigh she looked and recognised alfred in that disguise the penitent fit had succeeded to the angry one had julia observed to ascertain this without speaking of him mrs dodd waited till they had got some little distance then quietly put out her hand and rested it for a moment on her daughters the girl was trembling violently little wretch came to mrs dodds lips but she did not utter it they were near home before she spoke at all and then she only said very kindly my love you will not be subjected again to these trials a remark intended quietly to cover the last occurrence as well as alfreds open persecution they had promised to go out the very next day but mrs dodd went alone and made excuses for miss dodd on her return she found julia sitting up for her and a letter come from her friend describing a pleasant cottage now vacant near maida vale mrs dodd handed the open letter to julia she read it without comment we will go up tomorrow and take it for three months then the oxford vacation will terminate yes mamma i am now about to relate a circumstance by no means without parallels but almost impossible to account for and as nothing is more common and contemptible than inadequate solutions i will offer none at all but so it was that mrs dodd awoke in the middle of that very night in a mysterious state of mental tremor trouble veiled in obscurity seemed to sit heavy on her bosom so strong though vague was this new and mysterious oppression that she started up in bed and cried aloud davidjuliaoh what is the matter the sound of her own voice dispelled the cloud in part but not entirely she lay awhile and then finding herself quite averse to sleep rose and went to her window and eyed the weather anxiously it was a fine night soft fleecy clouds drifted slowly across a silver moon the sailors wife was reassured on her husbands behalf her next desire was to look at julia sleeping she had no particular object it was the instinctive impulse of an anxious mother whom something had terrified she put on her slippers and dressinggown and lighting a candle at her nightlamp opened her door softly and stepped into the little corridor but she had not taken two steps when she was arrested by a mysterious sound it came from julias room what was it mrs dodd glided softly nearer and nearer all her senses on the stretch the sound came again it was a muffled sob the stifled sound just audible in the dead stillness of the night went through and through her who stood there listening aghast her bowels yearned over her child and she hurried to the door but recollected herself and knocked very gently dont be alarmed love it is only me may i come in she did not wait for the answer but turned the handle and entered she found julia sitting up in bed looking wildly at her with cheeks flushed and wet she sat on the bed and clasped her to her breast in silence but more than one warm tear ran down upon julias bare neck the girl felt them drop and her own gushed in a shower oh what have i done she sobbed am i to make you wretched too mrs dodd did not immediately reply she was there to console and her admirable good sense told her that to do that she must be calmer than her patient so even while she kissed and wept over julia she managed gradually to recover her composure tell me my child said she why do you act a part with me why brave it out under my eye and spend the night secretly in tears are you still afraid to trust me oh no no but i thought i was so strong so proud i undertook miracles i soon found my pride was a molehill and my love a mountain i could not hold out by day if i did not ease my breaking heart at night how unfortunate i kept my head under the bedclothes too but you have such ears i thought i would stifle my grief or else perhaps you would be as wretched as i am forgive me pray forgive me on one condition said mrs dodd struggling with the emotion these simple words caused her anything to be forgiven cried julia impetuously ill go to london ill go to botany bay i deserve to be hanged then from this hour no halfconfidences between us dear me you carry in your own bosom a much harsher judge a much less indulgent friend than i am come trust me with your heart do you love him very much does your happiness depend on him at this pointblank question julia put her head over mrs dodds shoulder not to be seen and clasping her tight murmured scarce above a whisper i dont know how much i love him when he came in at that party i felt his slavehis unfaithful adoring slave if he had ordered me to sing aileen aroon i should have obeyed if he had commanded me to take his hand and leave the room i think i should have obeyed his face is always before me as plain as life it used to come to me bright and loving now it is pale and stern and sad i was not so wretched till i saw he was pining for me and thinks me inconstantoh mamma so pale so shrunk i so reckless he was sorry for misbehaving that night he changed clothes with a beggar to kiss my dress poor thing poor thing who ever loved as he does me i am dying for him i am dying there there said mrs dodd soothingly you have said enough this must be love i am on your alfreds side from this hour julia opened her eyes and was a good deal agitated as well as surprised pray do not raise my hopes she gasped we are parted for ever his father refuses even you seemed averse or have i been dreaming me dearest how can i be averse to anything lawful on which i find your heart is really set and your happiness at stake of course i have stopped the actual intercourse under existing circumstances but these circumstances are not unalterable your only obstacle is mr richard hardie but what an obstacle sighed julia his father a man of iron so everybody says for i have made inquiriesoh and she was abashed she resumed hastily and that letter so cold so cruel i feel it was written by one not open to gentle influences he does not think me worthy of his son so accomplished so distinguished at the very university where our poor edwardhasyou know little simpleton said mrs dodd and kissed her tenderly your iron man is the commonest clay sordid pliable and your stern heroic brutus is a shopkeeper he is open to the gentle influences which sway the kindred souls of the men you and i buy our shoes our tea our gloves our fishkettles of and these influences i think i command and am prepared to use them to the utmost julia lay silent and wondering what she could mean but mrs dodd hesitated now it pained and revolted her to show her enthusiastic girl the world as it is she said as much and addedi seem to be going to aid all these people to take the bloom from my own childs innocence heaven help me oh never mind that cried julia in her ardent way give me truth before error however pleasing mrs dodd replied only by a sigh grand general sentiments like that never penetrated her mind they glided off like water from a ducks back we will begin with this mercantile brutus then said she with such a curl of the lip brutus had rejected her daughter mr richard hardie was born and bred in a bank one where no wild thyme blows my poor enthusiast nor cowslips nor the nodding violet grows but gold and silver chink and things are discounted and men grow rich slowly but surely by lawful use of other peoples money breathed upon by these gentle influences he was from his youth a remarkable manmeasured by trades standard at fiveandtwenty divine what he did he saved the bank you have read of bubbles the mississippi bubble and the south sea bubble well in the year it was not one bubble but a thousand mines by the score and in distant lands companies by the hundred loans to every nation or tribe down to guatemala patagonia and greece two hundred new ships were laid on the stocks in one year for your dear papa told me in short a fever of speculation and the whole nation raging with it my dear princes dukes duchesses bishops poets lawyers physicians were seen struggling with their own footmen for a place in the exchange and at last good steady old mr hardie alfreds grandfather was drawn into the vortex now to excuse him and appreciate the precocious richard you must try and realise that these bubbles when they rise are as alluring and reasonable as they are ridiculous and incredible when one looks back on them even soap bubbles you know have rainbow hues till they burst and indeed the blind avarice of men does but resemble the blind vanity of women look at our grandmothers hoops and our mothers short waists and monstrous heads yet in their day what woman did not glory in these insanities well then mr richard hardie at twentyfive was the one to foresee the end of all these bubbles he came down from london and brought his people to their senses by sober reason and sound commercial principlesthat means i believe get other peoples money but do not risk your own his superiority was so clear that his father resigned the helm to him and thanks to his ability the bank weathered the storm while all the other ones in the town broke or suspended their trade now you know youth is naturally ardent and speculative but richard hardies was colder and wiser than other peoples old age and that is one trait some years later in the height of his prosperityi reveal this only for your comfort and on your sacred promise as a person of delicacy never to repeat it to a soulrichard hardie was a suitor for my hand mamma do not ejaculate sweetest it discomposes me nothing is extraordinary as that good creature dr sampson says he must have thought it would answer in one way or another to have a gentlewoman at the head of his table and i was not penniless bien entendu failing in this he found a plain little thing with a gloomy temper and no accomplishments nor graces but her father could settle twenty thousand pounds he married her directly and that is a trait he sold his fathers and grandfathers house and place of business in spite of all their associations and obtained a lease of his present place from my uncle fountain it seemed a more moneymaking situation a trait he gives me no reason for rejecting my daughter why because he is not proud of his reasons this walking avarice has intelligence a trait now put all this together and who more transparent than the profound mr hardie he has declined our alliance because he takes for granted we are poor when i undeceive him on that head he will reopen negotiations in a letterno of the correspondence copied by one of his clerksit will be calm plausible flattering in short it will be done like a gentleman though he is nothing of the kind and this brings me to what i ought to have begun with your dear father and i have always lived within our income for our childrens sake he is bringing home the bulk of our savings this very voyage and it amounts to fourteen thousand pounds oh what an enormous sum no dearest it is not a fortune in itself but it is a considerable sum to possess independent of ones settlement and ones income it is loose cash to speak a la hardie that means i can do what i choose with it and of course i chooseto make you happy how i shall work on what you call iron and i venture to call clay must be guided by circumstances i think of depositing three or four thousand pounds every month with mr hardie he is our banker you know he will most likely open his eyes and make some move before the whole sum is in his hands if he does not i shall perhaps call at his bank and draw a cheque for fourteen thousand pounds the wealthiest provincial banker does not keep such a sum floating in his shoptills his commercial honour the one semichivalrous sentiment in his soul would be in peril he would yield and with grace none the less readily that his house and his bank which have been long heavily mortgaged to our trustees were made virtually theirs by agreement yesterday i set this on foot with twelve hours of mr irons impertinent letter and he will say to himself she canpost me i think these people call itthis afternoon for not cashing her cheque and she can turn me and my bank into the street tomorrow and then of course he shall see by my manner the velvet paw is offered as well as the claw he is pretty sure to ask himself which will suit the ledger bestthis cats friendship and her fourteen thousand pounds oran insulted mothers enmity and mrs placids teeth made a little click just audible in the silent night oh mamma my heart is sick am i to be bought and sold like this mrs dodd sighed but said calmly you must pay the penalty for loving a parvenus son come julia no peevishness no more romance no more vacillation you have tried pride and failed pitiably now i insist on your trying love child it is the bane of our sex to carry nothing out from that weakness i will preserve you and bythebye we are not going to marry mr richard hardie but mr alfred now mr alfred with all his faults and defects mamma what faults what defects is a gentleman thanks to oxford and harrow and nature my darling pray to heaven night and day for your dear fathers safe return for on him and him alone your happiness depends as mine does mamma cried julia embracing her what do poor girls do who have lost their mother look abroad and see was the grave reply mrs dodd then begged her to go to sleep like a good child for her healths sake all would be well and with this was about to return to her own room but a white hand and arm darted out of the bed and caught her what hope has come to me by night in the form of an angel and shall i let her go back to her own room never never never never never and she patted the bed expressively and with the prettiest impatience well let hope take off her earrings first suggested mrs dodd no no come here directly earrings and all no thank you or i shall have them wounding you next mrs hope quietly removed her earrings and the tender pair passed the rest of the night in one anothers arms the young girls tears were dried and hope revived and life bloomed again only henceforth her longing eyes looked out to sea for her father homeward bound next day as they were seated together in the drawingroom julia came from the window with a rush and kneeled at mrs dodds knees with bright imploring face upturned he is there andi am to speak to him is that it dear dear dear mamma was the somewhat oblique reply well then bring me my things she was ten minutes putting them on julia tried to expedite her and retarded her she had her pace and could not go beyond it now by this time alfred hardie was thoroughly miserable unable to move his father shunned by julia sickened by what he had heard and indeed seen of her gaiety and indifference to their separation stung by jealousy and fretted by impatience he was drinking nearly all the bitters of that sweet passion love but as you are aware he ascribed julias inconstancy lightness and cruelty all to mrs dodd he hated her cordially and dreaded her into the bargain he played the sentinel about her door all the more because she had asked him not to do it always do what your enemy particularly objects to said he applying to his own case the wisdom of a greek philosopher one of his teachers so when the gate suddenly opened and instead of julia this very mrs dodd walked towards him his feelings were anything but enviable he wished himself away heartily but was too proud to retreat he stood his ground she came up to him a charming smile broke out over her features ah mr hardie said she if you have nothing better to do will you give me a minute he assented with surprise and an ill grace may i take your arm he offered it with a worse she laid her hand lightly on it and it shuddered at her touch he felt like walking with a velvet tigress by some instinct she divined his sentiment and found her task more difficult than she had thought she took some steps in silence at last as he was no dissembler he burst out passionately why are you my enemy i am not your enemy said she quietly not openly but all the more dangerous you keep us apart you bid her be gay and forget me you are a cruel hardhearted lady no i am not sir said mrs dodd simply oh i believe you are good and kind to all the rest of the world but you know you have a heart of iron for me i am my daughters friend but not your enemy it is you who are too inexperienced to know how delicate how difficult my duties are it is only since last night i see my way clear and look i come at once to you with friendly intentions suppose i were as impetuous as you are i should perhaps be calling you ungrateful he retorted bitterly give me something to be grateful for and you shall see whether that baseness is in my nature i have a great mind to put you to the proof said she archly let us walk down this lane then you can be as unjust to me as you think proper without attracting public attention in the lane she told him quietly she knew the nature of his fathers objections to the alliance he had so much at heart and they were objections which her husband on his return would remove on this he changed his tone a little and implored her piteously not to deceive him i will not said she upon my honour if you are as constant as my daughter is in her esteem for younotwithstanding her threadbare gaiety worn over loyal regret and to check a parcel of idle ladies tonguesyou have nothing to fear from me and everything to expect come alfredmay i take that liberty with youlet us understand one another we only want that to be friends this was hard to resist and at his age his lip trembled he hesitated but at last gave her his hand she walked two hours with him and laid herself out to enlighten soothe and comfort his sore heart his hopes and happiness revived under her magic as julias had in the midst of it all the wise woman quietly made terms he was not to come to the house but on her invitation unless indeed he had news of the agra to communicate but he might write once a week to her and enclose a few lines to julia on this concession he proceeded to mumble her white wrist and call her his best dearest loveliest friend his mother oh remember said he with a relic of distrust you are the only mother i can ever hope to have that touched her hitherto he had been to her but a thing her daughter loved her eyes filled my poor warmhearted motherless boy she said pray for my husbands safe return for on that your happiness depends and hers and mine so now two more bright eyes looked longingly seaward for the agra homeward bound chapter vii north latitude longitude east the time march of this same year the wind southerly the port whampoa in the canton river ships at anchor reared their tall masts here and there and the broad stream was enlivened and coloured by junks and boats of all sizes and vivid hues propelled on the screw principle by a great scull at the stern with projecting handles for the crew to work and at times a gorgeous mandarin boat with two great glaring eyes set in the bows came flying rowed with forty paddles by an armed crew whose shields hung on the gunwale and flashed fire in the sunbeams the mandarin in conical and buttoned hat sitting on the top of his cabin calmly smoking paradise alias opium while his gong boomed and his boat flew fourteen miles an hour and all things scuttled out of his celestial way and there looking majestically down on all these waterants the huge agra cynosure of so many loving eyes and loving hearts in england lay at her moorings homeward bound her tea not being yet on board the ships hull floated high as a castle and to the subtle intellectual dollfaced boluseyed people that sculled to and fro busy as bees though looking forked mushrooms she sounded like a vast musical shell for a lusty harmony of many mellow voices vibrated in her great cavities and made the air ring cheerily around her the vocalists were the cyclops to judge by the tremendous thumps that kept clean time to their sturdy tune yet it was but human labour so heavy and so knowing that it had called in music to help it was the third mate and his gang completing his floor to receive the coming teachests yesterday he had stowed his dunnage many hundred bundles of light flexible canes from sumatra and malacca on these he had laid tons of rough saltpetre in lb gunnybags and was now mashing it to music bags and all his gang of fifteen naked to the waist stood in line with huge wooden beetles called commanders and lifted them high and brought them down on the nitre in cadence with true nautical power and unison singing as follows with a ponderous bump on the first note in each bar music notation and so up to fifteen when the stave was concluded with a shrill spell oh and the gang relieved streaming with perspiration when the saltpetre was well mashed they rolled ton waterbutts on it till the floor was like a billiard table a fleet of chop boats then began to arrive so many per day with the teachests mr grey proceeded to lay the first tier on his saltpetre floor and then built the chests tier upon tier beginning at the sides and leaving in the middle a lane somewhat narrower than a teachest then he applied a screw jack to the chests on both sides and so enlarged his central aperture and forced the remaining teachests in and behold the enormous cargo packed as tight as ever shopkeeper packed a boxnineteen thousand eight hundred and six chests sixty half chests fifty quarter chests while mr grey was contemplating his work with singular satisfaction a small boat from canton came alongside and mr tickell midshipman ran up the side skipped on the quarterdeck saluted it first and then the first mate and gave him a line from the captain desiring him to take the ship down to second barfor her waterat the turn of the tide two hours after receipt of this order the ship swung to the ebb instantly mr sharpe unmoored and the agra began her famous voyage with her head at right angles to her course for the wind being foul all sharpe could do was to set his topsails driver and jib and keep her in the tide way and clear of the numerous craft by backing or filling as the case required which he did with considerable dexterity making the sails steer the helm for the nonce he crossed the bar at sunset and brought to with the best bower anchor in five fathoms and a half here they began to take in their water and on the fifth day the sixoared gig was ordered up to canton for the captain the next afternoon he passed the ship in her going down the river to lintin to board the chinese admiral for his chop or permission to leave china all night the agra showed three lights at her mizen peak for him and kept a sharp look out but he did not come he was having a very serious talk with the chinese admiral at daybreak however the gig was reported in sight sharpe told one of the midshipmen to call the boatswain and man the side soon the gig ran alongside two of the ships boys jumped like monkeys over the bulwarks lighting one on the main channels the other on the midship port and put the side ropes assiduously in the captains hands he bestowed a slight paternal smile on them the first the imps had ever received from an officer and went lightly up the sides the moment his foot touched the deck the boatswain gave a frightful shrill whistle the men at the sides uncovered the captain saluted the quarterdeck and all the officers saluted him which he returned and stepping for a moment to the weather side of his deck gave the loud command all hands heave anchor he then directed mr sharpe to get what sail he could on the ship the wind being now westerly and dived into his cabin the boatswain piped three shrill pipes and all hands up anchor was thrice repeated forward followed by private admonitions rouse and bitt show a leg c and up tumbled the crew with homeward bound written on their tanned faces pipe up all hammocks in ten minutes the ninety and odd hammocks were all stowed neatly in the netting and covered with a snowy hammockcloth and the hands were active unbitting the cable shipping the capstan bars c all ready below sir cried a voice man the bars returned mr sharpe from the quarterdeck play up fifer heave away out broke the merry fife with a rhythmical tune and tramp tramp tramp went a hundred and twenty feet round and round and with brawny chests pressed tight against the capstan bars sixty fine fellows walked the ship up to her anchor drowning the fife at intervals with their sturdy song as pat to their feet as an echo heave with a will ye jolly boys heave around were off from chainee jolly boys homeward bound short stay apeak sir roars the boatswain from forward unship the bars way aloft loose sails let fall the ship being now over her anchor and the topsails set the capstan bars were shipped again the men all heaved with a will the messenger grinned the anchor was torn out of china with a mighty heave and then ran up with a luff tackle and secured the ships head cast to port up with the jibman the taupsle halliardsall hands make sail round she came slow and majestically the sails filled and the good ship bore away for england she made the bogue forts in three or four tacks and there she had to come to again for another chop china being a place as hard to get into as heaven and to get out of aschancery at three pm she was at macao and hove to four miles from the land to take in her passengers a gun was fired from the forecastle no boats came off sharpe began to fret for the wind though light had now got to the nw and they were wasting it after a while the captain came on deck and ordered all the carronades to be scaled the eight heavy reports bellowed the great ships impatience across the water and out pulled two boats with the passengers while they were coming dodd sent and ordered the gunner to load the carronades with shot and secure and apron them the first boat brought colonel kenealy mr fullalove and a prodigious negro who all mounted by the sideropes but the whip was rigged for the next boat and the honourable mrs beresford and poodle hoisted on board item her white maid item her black nurse item her little boy and male oriental in charge thereof the strangest compound of dignity and servility and of black and white being clad in snowy cotton and japanned to the nine mrs beresford was the wife of a member of council in india she had been to macao for her boys health intending to return to calcutta but meantime her husband was made a director and went home so she was going to join him a tall handsome lady with too curved a nose like most aquiline women she was born to domineer a bit and for the last ten years orientals clinging at her knee and europeans flattering at her ear had nursed this quality high and spoiled her with all their might a similar process had been applied to her boy frederick from infancy he was now nearly six arrogance and caprice shone so in both their sallow faces and spoke so in every gesture that as they came on board sharpe a reader of passengers whispered the second mate bayliss we have shipped the devil and a cargo of his imps grunted mr bayliss mr fullalove was a methodist parsonto the naked eye grave sober lean lankhaired but some men are hidden fires fullalove was one of the extraordinary products of an extraordinary nation the united states of america he was an engineer for one thing and an inventive and practical mechanician held two patents of his own creating which yielded him a good income both at home and in great britain such results are seldom achieved without deep study and seclusion and accordingly joshua fullalove when the inventive fit was on would be buried deep as archimedes for a twelvemonth burning the midnight oil then his active element predominating the pale student would dash into the forest or the prairie with a rifle and an indian and come out bronzed and more or less bepanthered or bebuffaloed thence invariably to sea for a year or two there anglosaxon to the backbone his romance had ever an eye to business he was always after foreign mechanical inventionshe was now importing a excellent one from japanand ready to do lucrative feats of knowledge thus he bought a turkish ship at the bottom of the dardanelles for twelve hundred dollars raised her cargo hardware and sold it for six thousand dollars then weighed the empty ship pumped her repaired he and navigated her himself into boston harbour massachusetts on the way he rescued with his late drowned ship a swedish vessel and received salvage he once fished eighty elephants tusks out of a craft foundered in the firth of forth to the disgust of elder anglosaxons looking on from the shore these unusual pursuits were varied by a singular recreation he played at elevating the african character to european levels with this view he had bought vespasian for eighteen hundred dollars whereof anon america is fertile in mixtures what do we not owe her sherry cobbler gin sling cocktail mint julep brandy smash sudden death eye openers well one day she outdid herself and mixed fullalove quaker nimrod archimedes philanthropist decorous red rover and what not the passenger boats cast loose all hands make sail the boatswain piped the lightheeled topsmen sped up the ratlines and lay out the yards while all on deck looked up as usual to see them work out bellied sail after sail aloft the ship came curtseying round to the southward spread her snowy pinions high and wide and went like a bird over the wrinkled seahomeward bound it was an exhilarating start and all faces were brightbut one the captain looked somewhat grave and thoughtful and often scanned the horizon with his glass he gave polite but very short answers to his friend colonel kenealy who was firing nothings in his ear and sent for the gunner while that personage a crusty old niler called monk is cleaning himself to go on the quarterdeck peep we into captain dodds troubled mind and into the circumstances which connect him with the heart of this story despite the twelve thousand miles of water between him and the lovers at barkington it had always been his pride to lay by money for his wife and children and under advice of an indian friend he had during the last few years placed considerable sums at intervals in a great calcutta house which gave eight per cent for deposits swelled by fresh capital and such high interest the hoard grew fast when his old ship sore battered off the cape was condemned by the companys agents at canton he sailed to calcutta intending to return thence to england as a passenger but while he was at calcutta the greatest firm there suspended payment carrying astonishment and dismay into a hundred families at such moments the press and the fireside ring for a little while with the commonsense cry good interest means bad security as for dodd who till then had revered all these great houses with nautical or childlike confidence a blind terror took the place of blind trust in him he felt guilty towards his children for risking their money he had got to believe it was theirs not his and vowed if he could only get hold of it once more he would never trust a penny of it out of his own hands again except perhaps to the bank of england but should he ever get it it was a large sum he went to messrs anderson anderson and drew for his fourteen thousand pounds to his dismay but hardly to his surprise the clerks looked at one another and sent the cheque into some inner department dodd was kept waiting his heart sank with him there was a hitch the duke of wellington the iron one is the author of this saying meantime came a government officer and paid in an enormous sum in notes and mercantile bills principally the latter presently dodd was invited into the managers room leaving the country captain dodd yes sir you had better take some of your money in bills at sight on london i would rather have notes sir faltered dodd oh bills by oliveira upon baring are just as good even without our endorsement however you can have half and half calcutta does but little in english banknotes you know they gave him his money the bills were all manifestly good but he recognised one of them as having just been paid in by the civilian he found himself somehow safe in the street clutching the cash with one half of his great paternal heart on fire and the other half freezing he had rescued his childrens fortune but he had seen destruction graze it the natural chill at being scraped by peril soon passed the triumphant glow remained the next sentiment was precaution he filled with it to the brim he went and bought a great broad pocketbook with a key to it though he was on dry land he covered it with oiled silk against the water and sewed the whole thing to his flannel waistcoat and felt for it with his hand a hundred times a day the fruit of his own toil his childrens hoard the rescued treasure he was to have the joy of bringing home safe to the dear partner of all his joys unexpectedly he was ordered out to canton to sail the agra to the cape then a novel and strange feeling came over him like a cloud that feeling was a sense of personal danger not that the many perils of the deep were new to him he had faced them this fiveandtwenty years but till now they were little present to his imagination they used to come be encountered be gone but now though absent they darkened the way it was the pocketbook the material treasure the hard cash which had lately set him in a glow seemed now to load his chest and hang heavy round the neck of his heart sailors are more or less superstitious and men are creatures of habit even in their courage now david had never gone to sea with a lot of money on him before as he was a stouthearted man these vague forebodings would perhaps have cleared away with the bustle when the agra set her studding sails off macao but for a piece of positive intelligence he had picked up at lintin the chinese admiral had warned him of a pirate a daring pirate who had been lately cruising in these waters first heard of south the line but had since taken a russian ship at the very mouth of the canton river murdered the crew in sight of land and sold the women for slaves or worse dodd asked for particulars was he a ladroner a malay a bornese in what latitude was he to be looked for the admiral on this examined his memoranda by these it appeared little was known as yet about the miscreant except that he never cruised long on one ground the crew was a mixed one the captain was believed to be a portuguese and to have a consort commanded by his brother but this was doubtful at all events the pair had never been seen at work together the gunner arrived and saluted the quarterdeck the captain on this saluted him and beckoned him to the weather side on this the other officers kept religiously to leeward mr monk said dodd you will clean and prepare all the small arms directly ay ay sir said the old niler with a gleam of satisfaction how many of your deckguns are serviceable this simple question stirred up in one moment all the bile in the poor old gentlemans nature my deckguns serviceable how the can they when that son of a seacook your third mate has been and lashed the water butts to their breechings and jammed his gear in between their nozzles till they cant breathe poor things far less bark i wish he was lashed between the devils hindhocks with a red hot cable as tight as he has jammed my guns be so good as not to swear mr monk said dodd at your age sir i look to you to set an example to the petty officers well i wont swear no more sir dd if i do he added very loudly and with a seeming access of ire and i ax your pardon captain and the decks when a man has a deep anxiety some human midge or mosquito buzzes at him it is a rule to dodd heavy with responsibility and a dark misgiving he must not communicate came delicately and by degrees and with a semigenuflexion every three steps one like a magpie and putting his hands together as our children do to approach the almighty delivered himself thus in modulated tones and good hindostanee the daughter of light in whose beams i ramgolam bask glows with an amicable desire to see the lord commander of the ship resembling a mountain and to make a communication taught by sad experience how weighty are the communications the daughters of light pour into nautical commanders at sea dodd hailed mr tickell a midshipman and sent him down to the ladys cabin mr tickell soon came back reddish but grinning to say that nothing less than the captain would do dodd sighed and dismissed monk with a promise to inspect the gundeck himself then went down to mrs beresford and found her indignant why had he stopped the ship miles and miles from macao and given her the trouble and annoyance of a voyage in that nasty little boat dodd opened his great brown eyes why madam it is shoal water off macao we dare not come in no evasion sir what have i to do with your shoal water it was laziness and want of consideration for a lady who has rented half your ship nothing of the kind madam i assure you are you the person they call gentleman dodd yes then dont contradict a lady or i shall take the liberty to dispute your title dodd took no notice of this and with a patience few nautical commanders would have shown endeavoured to make her see that he was obliged to give macao shoals a wide berth or cast away the ship she would not see it when dodd saw she wanted not an explanation but a grievance he ceased to thwart her i am neglecting my duties to no purpose said he and left her without ceremony this was a fresh offence and as he went out she declared open war and she made it too from that hour a war of pins and needles dodd went on the gundeck and found that the defence of the ship had as usual in these peaceful days been sacrificed to the cargo out of twenty eighteenpounders she carried on that deck he cleared three and that with difficulty to clear any more he must have sacrificed either merchandise or water and he was not the man to do either on the mere chance of a danger so unusual as an encounter with a pirate he was a merchant captain not a warrior meantime the agra had already shown him great sailing qualities the log was hove at sundown and gave eleven knots so that with a good breeze abaft few foreandaft rigged pirates could overhaul her and this wind carried her swiftly past one nest of them at all events the ladrone isles at nine pm all the lights were ordered out mrs beresford had brought a novel on board and refused to comply the masteratarms insisted she threatened him with the vengeance of the company the premier and the nobility and gentry of the british realm the masteratarms finding he had no chance in argument doused the glimpitiable resource of a weak disputantthen basely fled the rhetorical consequences the northerly breeze died out and light variable winds baffled the ship it was the th april ere she passed the macclesfield bank in latitude and now they sailed for many days out of sight of land dodds chest expanded his main anxiety at this part of the voyage lay in the state cabin of all the perils of the sea none shakes a sailor like fire he set a watch day and night on that spoiled child on the st may they passed the great nantuna and got among the bornese and malay islands at which the captains glass began to sweep the horizon again and night and day at the dizzy foretop gallant masthead he perched an eye they crossed the line in longitude with a slight breeze but soon fell into the doldrums a dead calm and nothing to do but kill time dodd had put down neptune that old blackguard could no longer row out on the ships port side and board her on the starboard pretending to come from oceans depths and shave the novices with a rusty hoop and dab a soapy brush in their mouths but champagne popped the sexes flirted and the sailors span fathomless yarns and danced rattling hornpipes fiddled to by the grave fullalove if there is a thing i can dew its fiddle said he he and his friend as he systematically called vespasian taught the crew yankee steps and were beloved one honest saltatory british tar offered that western pair his grog for a week even mrs beresford emerged and walked the deck quenching her austere regards with a familiar smile on colonel kenealy her escort this gallant goodnatured soldier flattered her to the nine and finding her sweeten with his treacle tried to reconcile her to his old friend dodd straight she soured and forbade the topic imperiously by this time the mates and midshipmen of the agra had fathomed their captain mr tickell delivered the mind of the united midshipmen when he proposed dodds health in their messroom as a navigator a mathematician a seaman a gentleman and a brick with three times three dodd never spoke to his officers like a ruffian nor yet palavered them but he had a very pleasant way of conveying appreciation of an officers zeal by a knowing nod with a kindly smile on the heels of it as for the men they seldom came in contact with the captain of a wellofficered ship this crew only knew him at first as a goodtempered soul who didnt bother about nothing but one day as they lay becalmed south of the line a jolly foretopman came on the quarterdeck with a fid of soup and saluting and scraping first to the deck then to the captain asked him if he would taste that yes my man smoked like and blazes your honour axing your pardon and the decks young gentleman said dodd to mr meredith a midshipman be so good as to send the cook aft the cook came and received not an oath nor a threat but a remonstrance and a grim warning in the teeth of this he burnt the soup horribly the very next day the crew sent the lucky foretopman aft again he made his scrape and presented his fid the captain tasted the soup and sent mr grey to bid the boatswains mate pipe the hands on deck and bring the cook aft quartermaster unsling a firebucket and fill it from the mens kids mr tickell see the cook swallow his own mess bosens mate take a bight of the flying jib sheet stand over him and start him if he dailies with it with this the captain went below and the cook supping at the bucket delivered himself as follows well ye lubbers it is firstrate theres no burn in it it goes down like oil curse your ladylike stomachs you aint fit for a ship why dont ye go ashore and man a gingerbread coach and feed off french frogs and italian baccypipe stems whack what the is that for boatswains mate sup more and jaw less well i am supping as fast as i can whack whack bloody end to ye what are ye about whack whack whack oh joe lord bless you i cant eat any more of it whack ill give you my grog for a week only to let me fling the stuff over the side whack whack whack oh good kind dear mr tickell do go down to the captain for me whack whack avast cried the captain reappearing and the uplifted rope fell harmless silence fore and aft pipe the cook has received a light punishment this time for spoiling the mens mess my crew shall eat nothing i cant eat myself my care is heavier than theirs is but not my work nor my danger in time of danger mind that or youll find i can be as severe as any master afloat purser sir double the mens grog they have been cheated of their meal ay ay sir and stop the cooks and his mates for a week ay ay sir bosen pipe down shipmates listen to me said the foretopman this old agra is a dd comfortable ship the oracular sentence was hailed with a ringing cheer still it is unlucky the british seaman is so enamoured of theological terms for he constantly misapplies them after lying a week like a dead log on the calm but heaving waters came a few light puffs in the upper air and inflated the topsails only the ship crawled southward the crew whistling for wind at last one afternoon it began to rain and after the rain came a gale from the eastward the watchful skipper saw it purple the water to windward and ordered the topsails to be reefed and the lee ports closed this last order seemed an excess of precaution but dodd was not yet thoroughly acquainted with his ships qualities and the hard cash round his neck made him cautious the lee ports were closed all but one and that was lowered mr grey was working a problem in his cabin and wanted a little light and a little air so he just drooped his port but not to deviate from the spirit of his captains instructions he fastened a tackle to it that he might have mechanical force to close it with should the ship lie over down came the gale with a whoo and made all crack the ship lay over pretty much and the sea poured in at mr greys port he applied his purchase to close it but though his tackle gave him the force of a dozen hands he might as well have tried to move a mountain on the contrary the tremendous sea rushed in and burst the port wide open grey after a vain struggle with its might shrieked for help down tumbled the nearest hands and hauled on the tackle in vain destruction was rushing on the ship and on them first but meantime the captain with a shrewd guess at the general nature of the danger he could not see had roared out slack the main sheet the ship righted and the port came flying to and terrorstricken men breathed hard up to their waists in water and floating boxes grey barred the unlucky port and went aft drenched in body and wretched in mind to report his own fault he found the captain looking grim as death he told him almost crying what he had done and how he had miscalculated the power of the water dodd looked and saw his distress let it be a lesson sir said he sternly how many ships have been lost by this in fair weather and not a man saved to tell how the craft was fooled away captain bid me fling myself over the side and ill do it hummph im afraid i cant afford to lose a good officer for a fault hewillneverrepeat it blew hard all night and till twelve the next day the agra showed her weak point she rolled abominably a dirty night came on at eight bells mr grey touched by dodds clemency and brimful of zeal reported a light in mrs beresfords cabin it had been put out as usual by the masteratarms but the refractory one had relighted it go and take it away said dodd soon screams were heard from the cabin oh mercy mercy i will not be drowned in the dark dodd who had kept clear of her so long went down and tried to reassure her oh the tempest the tempest she cried and to be drowned in the dark tempest it is blowing half a gale of wind that is all half a gale ah that is the way you always talk to us ladies oh pray give me my light and send me a clergyman dodd took pity and let her have her light with a midshipman to watch it he even made her a hypocritical promise that should there be one grain of danger he would lie to but said he must not make a foul wind of a fair one for a few lee lurches the agra broke plenty of glass and crockery though with her fair wind and her lee lurches wind down at noon next day and a dead calm at two p m the weather cleared the sun came out high in heavens centre and a balmy breeze from the west at six twentyfive the grand orb set calm and red and the sea was gorgeous with miles and miles of great ruby dimples it was the first glowing smile of southern latitude the night stole on so soft so clear so balmy all were loth to chose their eyes on it the passengers lingered long on deck watching the great bear dip and the southern cross rise and overhead a whole heaven of glorious stars most of us have never seen and never shall see in this world no belching smoke obscured no plunging paddles deafened all was musical the soft air sighing among the sails the phosphorescent water bubbling from the ships bows the murmurs from little knots of men on deck subdued by the great calm home seemed near all danger far peace ruled the sea the sky the heart the ship making a track of white fire on the deep glided gently yet swiftly homeward urged by snowy sails piled up like alabaster towers against a violet sky out of which looked a thousand eyes of holy tranquil fire so melted the sweet night away now carmine streaks tinged the eastern sky at the waters edge and that water blushed now the streaks turned orange and the waves below them sparkled thence splashes of living gold flew and settled on the ships white sails the deck and the faces and with no more prologue being so near the line up came majestically a huge fiery golden sun and set the sea flaming liquid topaz instantly the lookout at the foretopgallantmasthead hailed the deck below strange sail right ahead the strange sail was reported to captain dodd then dressing in his cabin he came soon after on deck and hailed the lookout which way is she standing cant say sir cant see her move any dodd ordered the boatswain to pipe to breakfast and taking his deck glass went lightly up to the foretopgallantmast crosstrees thence through the light haze of a glorious morning he espied a long low schooner lateenrigged lying close under point leat a small island about nine miles distant on the weather bow and nearly in the agras course then approaching the straits of gaspar latitude s she is hoveto said dodd very gravely at eight oclock the stranger lay about two miles to windward and still hoveto by this time all eyes were turned upon her and half a dozen glasses everybody except the captain delivered an opinion she was a greek lyingto for water she was a malay coming north with canes and short of hands she was a pirate watching the straits the captain leaned silent and sombre with his arms on the bulwarks and watched the suspected craft mr fullalove joined the group and levelled a powerful glass of his own construction his inspection was long and minute and while the glass was at his eye sharpe asked him half in a whisper could he make out anything wal said he the varmint looks considerable snaky then without removing his glass he let drop a word at a time as if the facts were trickling into his telescope at the lens and out at the sight onetwofourseven false ports there was a momentary murmur among the officers all round but british sailors are undemonstrative colonel kenealy strolling the deck with his cigar saw they were watching another ship with maritime curiosity and making comments but he discerned no particular emotion nor anxiety in what they said nor in the grave low tones they said it in perhaps a brother seaman would though the next observation that trickled out of fullaloves tube was this i judge there are too few hands on deck and too manywhiteeyeballsglittering at the portholes confound it muttered bayliss uneasily how can you see that fullalove replied only by quietly handing his glass to dodd the captain thus appealed to glued his eye to the tube well sir see the false ports and the white eyebrows asked sharpe ironically i see this is the best glass i ever looked through said dodd doggedly without interrupting his inspection i think he is a malay pirate said mr grey sharpe took him up very quickly and indeed angrily nonsense and if he is he wont venture on a craft of this size says the whale to the swordfish suggested fullalove with a little guttural laugh the captain with the american glass at his eye turned half round to the man at the wheel starboard starboard it is steer southsoutheast ay ay sir and the ships course was thus altered two points this order lowered dodd fifty per cent in mr sharpes estimation he held his tongue as long as he could but at last his surprise and dissatisfaction burst out of him wont that bring him out on us very likely sir replied dodd begging your pardon captain would it not be wiser to keep our course and show the blackguard we dont fear him when we do sharpe he has made up his mind an hour ago whether to lie still or bite my changing my course two points wont change his mind but it may make him declare it and i must know what he does intend before i run the ship into the narrows ahead oh i see said sharpe half convinced the alteration in the agras course produced no movement on the part of the mysterious schooner she layto under the land still and with only a few hands on deck while the agra edged away from her and entered the straits between long island and point leat leaving the schooner about two miles and a half distant to the nw ah the strangers deck swarms black with men his sham ports fell as if by magic his gums grinned through the gaps like black teeth his huge foresail rose and filled and out he came in chase the breeze was a kiss from heaven the sky a vaulted sapphire the sea a million dimples of liquid lucid gold chapter viii amongst the curiosities of human reasoning is this one forms a judgment on certain statements they turn out incorrect yet the judgment sound this occurs oftenest when to divine what any known person will do in a case stated we go boldly by his character his habits or his interest for these are great forces towards which men gravitate through various and even contrary circumstances now women sitting at home out of details way are somewhat forced as well as naturally inclined to rely on their insight into character and by this broad clue often pass through false or discoloured data to a sound calculation thus it was mrs dodd applied her native sagacity to divine why richard hardie declined julia for his sons wife and how to make him withdraw that dissent and the fair diviner was much mistaken in detail but right in her conclusion for richard hardie was at that moment the unlikeliest man in barkington to decline julia doddwith hard cash in five figuresfor his daughterinlaw i am now about to make a revelation to the reader that will incidentally lead him to mrs dodds conclusion but by a different path the outline she gave her daughter and my reader of richard hardies cold and prudent youth was substantially correct but something had occurred since then unknown to her unknown to all barkington the centuries had blown a respectable bubble about two hundred and fifty years ago some genius as unknown as the inventor of the lathe laid the first wooden tramroad to enable a horse to draw fortytwo cwt instead of seventeen the coalowners soon used it largely in iron rails were invented but prejudice stronger than that metal kept them down and the wooden ones in vogue for some thirty years then iron prevailed meantime a much greater invention had been creeping up to join the metal way i mean the locomotive power of steam whose history is not needed here enough that in took place as promising a wedding as civilisation ever saw for then an engine built by trevethick a great genius frittered for want of pluck drew carriages laden with ten tons five miles an hour on a welsh railway next stout stephenson came on the scene and insisted on benefiting mankind in spite of themselves and of shallow legislators a priori reasoners and a heavy review whose political motto was stemus super antiquas vias which may be rendered better stand still on turnpikes than move on rails his torments and triumph are history two of his repartees seem neat to lord noodle or lord doodle which was it objecting haughtily and suppose a cow should get in the way of your engine sir he replied why then it would be badfor the coow the objector had overrated the obstructive power of his honoured parent to the a priori reasoners who sat in their studies and demonstrated with complete unanimity that uncogged wheels would revolve on a smooth rail but leave the carriage in statu quo he replied by building an engine with lord ravensworths noble aid hooking on eight carriages and rattling off up an incline solvitur ambulando quoth stephenson the stouthearted to messrs a priori next a coach ran on the stockton and darlington rail next the liverpool and manchester line was projected oh then what bitter opposition to the national benefactors and the good of man awake from the tomb echoes of dead cant the revolving wheels might move the engine on a rail but what would that avail if they could not move them in the closet and on a mathematical paper railways would be bad for canals bad for morals bad for highwaymen bad for roadside inns the smoke would kill the partridges aha thou hast touched us nearly said the country gentlemen the travellers would go slowly to their destination but swift to destruction and the heavy review whose motto was stemus super turnpikes offered to back old father thames against the woolwich railway for any sum and black will who drove the next heaviest ephemeral in the island told a schoolboy who now writes these pages theres nothing can ever be safe at twenty miles an hour without tis a bird in the air and confirmed it with an oath briefly buzz buzz buzz gray was crushed trevethick driven out of the country stout steevie thwarted badgered taunted and even insulted and bespattered with dirti might say with dung since his opponents discharged their own brains at him by speech and writing at last when after the manner of men they had manured their benefactor well they consented to reap him railways prevailed and increased till lo and behold a prime minister with a spade delving one in the valley of the trent the tide turned good working railways from city to city became an approved investment of genuine capital notwithstanding the frightful frauds and extortion to which the projectors were exposed in a parliament which under a new temptation showed itself as corrupt and greedy as any nation or age can parallel when this sober state of things had endured some time there came a year that money was loose and a speculative fever due in the whirligig of time then railways bubbled new ones were advertised fifty a month and all went to a premium high and low scrambled for the shares even when the projected line was to run from the town of nought to the village of nothing across a goose common the flame spread fanned by prospectus and advertisement two mines of glowing fiction compared with which the legitimate article is a mere tissue of understatements princes sat in railway tenders and clove the air like the birds whose effigies surmount their armorials our stiffest peers relaxed into boards bishops warned their clergy against avarice and buttered hudson an inch thick for shares and turned their little aprons into great pockets men stainless hitherto put down their infants nurses included as independent subscribers and bagged the coupons capturi tartaros nearly everything that had a name and by some immense fortuity could write it demanded its part in the new and fathomless source of wealth a charwomans two sons were living in a garret on fifteen shillings apiece per week down went their excellencies names for l worth of bubbling iron another shareholder applied imperiously from a house in grosvenor square he had breakfasted on the steps once more in times whirligig gentlemen and their footmen jostled one another on the exchange and a motley crew of peers and printers vicars and admirals professors cooks costermongers cottonspinners waiters coachmen priests potboys hankers braziers dairymen mailguards barristers spinsters butchers beggars duchesses ragmerchantsin one word of nobs and snobs fought and scrambled pell mell for the popular paper and all to get rich in a day for the humours of the time see the parliamentary return of railway subscribers published franciss british railway evans commercial crisis and the pamphlets and journals of the day richard hardie had some money in existing railways but he declined to invest his hard cash upon hypotheticals he was repeatedly solicited to be a director but always declined once he was offered a canny bribe of a thousand pounds to let his name go on a provisional committee he refused with a characteristic remark i never buy any merchandise at a fancy price not even hard cash antidote to the universal mania barkington had this one wet blanket an unpopular institution but far more salutary than a damp sheet especially in time of bubble nearly all his customers consulted richard hardie and this was the substance of his replies the bubbles of history including the great one of my youth were national as well as individual follies it is not so now the railways that ruin their allottees and directors will be pure additions to the national property and some day remove one barrier more from commerce the dutch tulip frenzy went on a petty fancy the railway fury goes on a great fact our predecessors blew mere soap bubbles we blow an iron bubble but here the distinction ends in the country undertook immediate engagements to fulfil which a centurys income would not have sufficed today a thousand railway companies are registered requiring a capital of six hundred million and another thousand projected to cost another five hundred million where is the money to come from if the world was both cultivated and civilised instead of neither and this nation could be sold with every building ship quadruped jewel and marketable female in it it would not fetch the money to make these railways yet the country undertakes to create them in three years with its floating capital arithmetic of bedlam the thing cannot last a year without collapsing richard hardie talked like this from first to last but when he saw that shares invariably mounted that even those who for want of interest had to buy them at a premium sold them at a profit when he saw paupers making large fortunes in a few months by buying into every venture and selling the next weekhe itched for his share of the booty and determined to profit in act by the credulity of mankind as well as expose it in words he made use of his large connections to purchase shares which he took care to part with speedily he cleared a good deal of money and that made him hungrier he went deeper and deeper into what he called flatcatching till one day he stood to win thirty thousand pounds at a coup but it is dangerous to be a convert real or false to bubble the game is to be rash at once and turn prudent at the full tide when richard hardie was up to his chin in these time bargains came an incident not easy to foresee the conductors of the times either from patriotism or longsighted policy punctured the bladder though they were making thousands weekly by the railway advertisements the time was so well chosen and the pin applied that it was a deathblow shares declined from that morning and the inevitable panic was advanced a week or two the more credulous speculators held on in hopes of a revival but hardie who knew that the collapse had been merely hastened saw the gravity of the situation and sold largely at a heavy loss but he could not sell all the bad paper he had accumulated for a temporary purpose the panic came too swiftly and too strong soon there were no buyers at any price the biter was bit the fox who had said this is a trap ill lightly come and lightly go was caught by the light fantastic toe in this emergency he showed high qualities vast financial ability great fortitude and that sense of commercial honour which mrs dodd justly called his semichivalrous sentiment he mustered all his private resources to meet his engagements and maintain his high position then commenced a long and steady struggle conducted with a spartan dignity and selfcommand and a countenance as close as wax little did any in barkington guess the doubts and fears the hopes and despondencies which agitated and tore the heart and brain that schemed and throbbed and glowed and sickened by turns beneath that steady modulated exterior and so for months and months he secretly battled with insolvency sometimes it threatened in the distance sometimes at hand but never caught him unawares he provided for each coming danger he encountered each immediate attack but not unscathed in morals just as matters looked brighter came a concentration of liabilities he could not meet without emptying his tills and so incurring the most frightful danger of all he had provided for its coming too but a decline greater than he had reckoned on in the value of his good securities made that provision inadequate then it was he committed a fauxpas he was one of his own childrens trustees and the other two signed after him like machines he said to himself my honour is my childrens my position is worth thousands to them i have sacrificed a fortune to preserve it it would be madness to recoil now he borrowed three thousand pounds of the trust money and soon after two thousand more it kept him above water but the peril and the escape on such terms left him gasping inwardly at last when even his granite nature was almost worn down with labour anxiety and struggling all alone without a word of comfortfor the price of one grain of sympathy would have been destructionhe shuffled off his iron burden and breathed again one day he spent in a sort of pleasing lethargy like a strong swimmer who long and sore buffeted by the waves has reached the shore at last the next day his cashier a sharpvisaged baldheaded old man called young skinner invited his attention rather significantly to the high amount of certain balances compared with the cash at his skinners disposal indeed said hardie quietly that must be regulated he added graciously as if conferring a great favour ill look into the books myself skinner he did more he sat up all night over the books and his heart died with him bankruptcy seemed coming towards him slow perhaps but sure and meantime to live with the sword hanging over him by a hair soon matters approached a crisis several large drafts were drawn which would have cleaned the bank out but that the yearly rents of a wealthy nobleman had for some days past been flowing in this nobleman had gone to explore syria and assyria he was a great traveller who contrived to live up to his income at home but had never been able to spend a quarter of it abroad for want of enemies and mastersbetter known as friends and servantsto help him so hardie was safe for some months unless there should be an extraordinary run on him and that was not likely this year the panic had subsided and nota bene his credit had never stood higher the reason was he had been doublefaced had always spoken against railways and his wise words were public whereas his fatal acts had been done in the dark but now came a change a bitter revulsion over this tossed mind hope and patience failed at last and his virtue being a thing of habit and traditions rather than of the soul wore out nay more this man who had sacrificed so nobly to commercial integrity was filled with hate of his idol and contempt of himself idiot said he to throw away a fortune fighting for honoura greater bubble than that which has ruined meinstead of breaking like a man with a hidden purse and starting fair again as sensible traders do no honest man in the country that year repented of his vices so sincerely as richard hardie loathed his virtue and he did not confine his penitence to sentiment he began to spend his days at the bank poring over the books and to lay out his arithmetical genius in a subtle process that should enable him by degrees to withdraw a few thousands from human eyes for his future use despite the feeble safeguards of the existing law in other words richard hardie like thousands before him was fabricating and maturing a false balancesheet one man in his time plays many animals hardie at this period turned mole he burrowed darkling into oes alienum there is often one of these sleek miners in a bank it is a section of human zoology the journals have lately enlarged on and drawn the painstaking creature grubbing and mining away to brief opulenceand briefer penal servitude than one could wish i rely on my reader having read these really able sketches of my contemporaries and spare him minute details that possess scarcely a new feature except one in that bank was not only a mole but a molecatcher and contrary to custom the mole was the master the molecatcher the servant the latter had no hostile views far from it he was rather attached to his master but his attention was roused by the youngest clerk a boy of sixteen being so often sent for into the bank parlour to copy into the books some arithmetical result without its process attention soon became suspicion and suspicion found many little things to feed on till it grew to certainty but the outer world was none the wiser the molecatcher was no chatterbox he was a solitary manno wife nor mistress about him and he revered the mole and liked him better than anything in the worldexcept money thus the great banker stood a colossus of wealth and stability to the eye though ready to crumble at a touch and indeed selfdoomed for bankruptcy was now his game this was a miserable man far more miserable than his son whose happiness he had thwarted his face was furrowed and his hair thinned by a secret struggle and of all the things that gnawed him like the fox beneath his spartan robe none was more bitter than to have borrowed five thousand pounds of his children and sunk it his wifes father a keen man of business who saw there was little affection on his side had settled his daughters money on her for life and in case of her death on the children upon coming of age the marriage of alfred or jane would be sure to expose him settlements would be proposed lawyers engaged to peer into the trust c no they must remain single for the present or else marry wealth so when his son announced an attachment to a young lady living in a suburban villa it was a terrible blow though he took it with outward calm as usual but if instead of prating about beauty virtue and breeding alfred had told him hard cash in five figures could be settled by the brides family on the young couple he would have welcomed the wedding with great external indifference but a secret gush of joy for then he could throw himself on alfreds generosity and be released from that one corroding debt perhaps allowed to go on drawing the interest of the remainder thus in reality all the interests with which this story deals converged towards one point the fourteen thousand pounds richard hardies opposition was a mere misunderstanding and if he had been told of the cash and to what purpose mrs dodd destined it and then put on board the agra in the straits of gaspar he would have calmly taken off his coat and help to defend the bearer of it against all assailants as stoutly and to all appearance imperturbably as he had fought that other bitter battle at home for there was something heroic in this erring man though his rectitude depended on circumstances chapter ix the way the pirate dropped the mask showed his black teeth and bore up in chase was terrible so dilates and bounds the sudden tiger on his unwary prey there were stout hearts among the officers of the peaceable agra but danger in a new form shakes the brave and this was their first pirate their dismay broke out in ejaculations not loud but deep hush said dodd doggedly the lady mrs beresford had just come on deck to enjoy the balmy morning sharpe said dodd in a tone that conveyed no suspicion to the newcomer set the royals and flying jibport port it is cried the man at the helm steer due south and with these words in his mouth dodd dived to the gundeck by this time elastic sharpe had recovered the first shock and the order to crowd sail on the ship galled his pride and his manhood he muttered indignantly the white feather this eased his mind and he obeyed orders briskly as ever while he and his hands were setting every rag the ship could carry on that tack the other officers having unluckily no orders to execute stood gloomy and helpless with their eyes glued by a sort of sombre fascination on that coming fate and they literally jumped and jarred when mrs beresford her heart opened by the lovely day broke in on their nerves with her light treble what a sweet morning gentlemen after all a voyage is a delightful thing oh what a splendid sea and the very breeze is warm ah and theres a little ship sailing along here freddy freddy darling leave off beating the sailors legs and come here and see this pretty ship what a pity it is so far off ah ah what is that dreadful noise for her horrible small talk that grated on those anxious souls like the mockery of some infantine fiend was cut short by ponderous blows and tremendous smashing below it was the captain staving in watercasks the water poured out at the scuppers clearing the lee guns said a middy off his guard colonel kenealy pricked up his ears drew his cigar from his mouth and smelt powder what for action said he briskly wheres the enemy fullalove made him a signal and they went below mrs beresford had not heard or not appreciated the remark she prattled on till she made the mates and midshipmen shudder realise the situation and the strange incongruity between the senses and the mind in these poor fellows the day had ripened its beauty beneath a purple heaven shone sparkled and laughed a blue sea in whose waves the tropical sun seemed to have fused his beams and beneath that fair sinless peaceful sky wafted by a balmy breeze over those smiling transparent golden waves a bloodthirsty pirate bore down on them with a crew of human tigers and a lady babble babble babble babble babble babble babbled in their quivering ears but now the captain came bustling on deck eyed the loftier sails saw they were drawing well appointed four midshipmen a staff to convey his orders gave bayliss charge of the carronades grey of the cutlasses and directed mr tickell to break the bad news gently to mrs beresford and to take her below to the orlop deck ordered the purser to serve out beet biscuit and grog to all hands saying men cant work on an empty stomach and fighting is hard work then beckoned the officers to come round him gentlemen said he confidentially in crowding sail on this ship i had no hope of escaping that fellow on this tack but i was and am most anxious to gain the open sea where i can square my yards and run for it if i see a chance at present i shall carry on till he comes within range and then to keep the companys canvas from being shot to rags i shall shorten sail and to save ship and cargo and all our lives i shall fight while a plank of her swims better be killed in hot blood than walk the plank in cold the officers cheered faintly the captains dogged resolution stirred up theirs the pirate had gained another quarter of a mile and more the ships crew were hard at their beef and grog and agreed among themselves it was a comfortable ship they guessed what was coming and woe to the ship in that hour if the captain had not won their respect strange to say there were two gentlemen in the agra to whom the pirates approach was not altogether unwelcome colonel kenealy and mr fullalove were rival sportsmen and rival theorists kenealy stood out for a smooth bore and a fourounce ball fullalove for a rifle of his own construction many a doughty argument they had and many a bragging match neither could convert the other at last fullalove hinted that by going ashore at the cape and getting each behind a tree at one hundred yards and popping at one another one or other would be convinced well but said kenealy if he is dead he will be no wiser besides to a fellow like me who has had the luxury of popping at his enemies popping at a friend is poor insipid work that is true said the other regretfully but i reckon we shall never settle it by argument theorists are amazing and it was plain by the alacrity with which these good creatures loaded the rival instruments that to them the pirate came not so much as a pirate as a solution indeed kenealy in the act of charging his piece was heard to mutter now this is lucky however these theorists were no sooner loaded than something occurred to make them more serious they were sent for in haste to dodds cabin they found him giving sharpe a new order shorten sail to the taupsles and jib get the colours ready on the halyards and then send the men aft sharpe ran out full of zeal and tumbled over ramgolam who was stooping remarkably near the keyhole dodd hastily bolted the cabindoor and looked with trembling lip and piteous earnestness in kenealys face and fullaloves they were mute with surprise at a gaze so eloquent and yet mysterious he manned himself and opened his mind to them with deep emotion yet not without a certain simple dignity colonel said he you are an old friend you sir are a new one but i esteem you highly and what my young gentlemen chaff you about you calling all men brothers and making that poor negro love you instead of fear you that shows me you have a great heart my dear friends i have been unlucky enough to bring my childrens fortune on board this ship here it is under my shirt fourteen thousand pounds this weighs me down oh if they should lose it after all do pray give me a hand apiece and pledge your sacred words to take it home safe to my wife at barkington if you or either of you should see this bright sun set today and i should not why dodd old fellow said kenealy cheerfully this is not the way to go into action colonel replied dodd to save this ship and cargo i must be wherever the bullets are and i will too fullalove more sagacious than the worthy colonel said earnestlycaptain dodd may i never see broadway again and never see heaven at the end of my time if i fail you theres my hand and mine said kenealy warmly they all three joined hands and dodd seemed to cling to them god bless you both god bless you oh what a weight your true hands have pulled off my heart goodbye for a few minutes the time is short ill just offer a prayer to the almighty for wisdom and then ill come up and say a word to the men and fight the ship according to my lights sail was no sooner shortened and the crew ranged than the captain came briskly on deck saluted jumped on a carronade and stood erect he was not the man to show the crew his forebodings pipe silence fore and aft my men the schooner coming up on our weather quarter is a portuguese pirate his character is known he scuttles all the ships he boards dishonours the women and murders the crew we cracked on to get out of the narrows and now we have shortened sail to fight this blackguard and teach him to molest a british ship i promise in the companys name twenty pounds prizemoney to every man before the mast if we beat him off or outmanoeuvre him thirty if we sink him and forty if we tow him astern into a friendly port eight guns are clear below three on the weather side five on the lee for if he knows his business he will come up on the lee quarter if he doesnt that is no fault of yours nor mine the muskets are all loaded the cutlasses ground like razors hurrah we have got women to defend hurrah a good ship under our feet the god of justice overhead british hearts in our bosoms and british colours flyingrun em upover our heads the ships colours flew up to the fore and the union jack to the mizen peak now lads i mean to fight this ship while a plank of her stamping on the deck swims beneath my foot andwhat do you say the reply was a fierce hurrah from a hundred throats so loud so deep so full of volume it made the ship vibrate and rang in the creepingon pirates ears fierce but cunning he saw mischief in those shortened sails and that union jack the terror of his tribe rising to a british cheer he lowered his mainsail and crawled up on the weather quarter arrived within a cables length he doublereefed his foresail to reduce his rate of sailing nearly to that of the ship and the next moment a tongue of flame and then a gush of smoke issued from his lee bow and the ball flew screaming like a seagull over the agras mizen top he then put his helm up and fired his other bowchaser and sent the shot hissing and skipping on the water past the ship this prologue made the novices wince bayliss wanted to reply with a carronade but dodd forbade him sternly saying if we keep him aloof we are done for the pirate drew nearer and fired both guns in succession hulled the agra amidships and sent an eighteenpound ball through her foresail most of the faces were pale on the quarterdeck it was very trying to be shot at and hit and make no return the next double discharge sent one shot smash through the stern cabin window and splintered the bulwark with another wounding a seaman slightly lie down forward shouted dodd bayliss give him a shot the carronade was fired with a tremendous report but no visible effect the pirate crept nearer steering in and out like a snake to avoid the carronades and firing those two heavy guns alternately into the devoted ship he hulled the agra now nearly every shot the two available carronades replied noisily and jumped as usual they sent one thirtytwo pound shot clean through the schooners deck and side but that was literally all they did worth speaking of curse them cried dodd load them with grape they are not to be trusted with ball and all my eighteenpounders dumb the coward wont come alongside and give them a chance at the next discharge the pirate chipped the mizen mast and knocked a sailor into dead pieces on the forecastle dodd put his helm down ere the smoke cleared and got three carronades to bear heavily laden with grape several pirates fell dead or wounded on the crowded deck and some holes appeared in the foresail this one interchange was quite in favour of the ship but the lesson made the enemy more cautious he crept nearer but steered so adroitly now right astern now on the quarter that the ship could seldom bring more than one carronade to bear while he raked her fore and aft with grape and ball in this alarming situation dodd kept as many of the men below as possible but for all he could do four were killed and seven wounded fullaloves worth came too true it was the swordfish and the whale it was a fight of hammer and anvil one hit the other made a noise cautious and cruel the pirate hung on the poor hulking creatures quarters and raked her at pointblank distance he made her pass a bitter time and her captain to see the splintering hull the parting shrouds the shivered gear and hear the shrieks and groans of his wounded and he unable to reply in kind the sweat of agony poured down his face oh if he could but reach the open sea and square his yards and make a long chase of it perhaps fall in with aid wincing under each heavy blow he crept doggedly patiently on towards that one visible hope at last when the ship was choved with shot and peppered with grape the channel opened in five minutes more he could put her dead before the wind no the pirate on whose side luck had been from the first got half a broadside to bear at long musketshot killed a midshipman by dodds side cut away two of the agras mizen shrouds wounded the gaff and cut the jibstay down fell that powerful sail into the water and dragged across the ships forefoot stopping her way to the open sea she panted for the mates groaned the crew cheered stoutly as british tars do in any great disaster the pirates yelled with ferocious triumph like the devils they looked but most human events even calamities have two sides the agra being brought almost to a standstill the pirate forged ahead against his will and the combat took a new and terrible form the elephant gun popped and the rifle cracked in the agras mizen top and the man at the pirates helm jumped into the air and fell dead both theorists claimed him then the three carronades peppered him hotly and he hurled an iron shower back with fatal effect then at last the long eighteenpounders on the gundeck got a word in the old niler was not the man to miss a vessel alongside in a quiet sea he sent two round shot clean through him the third splintered his bulwark and swept across his deck his mastsfire at his masts roared dodd to monk through his trumpet he then got the jib clear and made what sail he could without taking all the hands from the guns this kept the vessels nearly alongside a few minutes and the fight was hot as fire the pirate now for the first time hoisted his flag it was black as ink his crew yelled as it rose the britons instead of quailing cheered with fierce derision the pirates wild crew of yellow malays black chinless papuans and bronzed portuguese served their side guns twelvepounders well and with ferocious cries the white britons drunk with battle now naked to the waist grimed with powder and spotted like leopards with blood their and their mates replied with loud undaunted cheers and a deadly hail of grape from the quarterdeck while the mastergunner and his mates loading with a rapidity the mixed races opposed could not rival hulled the schooner well between wind and water and then fired chainshot at her masts as ordered and began to play the mischief with her shrouds and rigging meantime fullalove and kenealy aided by vespasian who loaded were quietly butchering the pirate crew two a minute and hoped to settle the question they were fighting for smooth bore v rifle but unluckily neither fired once without killing so there was nothing proven the pirate bold as he was got sick of fair fighting first he hoisted his mainsail and threw rapidly ahead with a slight bearing to windward and dismounted a carronade and stove in the ships quarterboat by way of a parting kick the men hurled a contemptuous cheer after him they thought they had beaten him off but dodd knew better he was but retiring a little way to make a more deadly attack than ever he would soon wear and cross the agras defenceless bows to rake her fore and aft at pistolshot distance or grapple and board the enfeebled ship two hundred strong dodd flew to the helm and with his own hands put it hard aweather to give the deckguns one more chance the last of sinking or disabling the destroyer as the ship obeyed and a deckgun bellowed below him he saw a vessel running out from long island and coming swiftly up on his lee quarter it was a schooner was she coming to his aid horror a black flag floated from her foremast head while dodds eyes were staring almost out of his head at this deathblow to hope monk fired again and just then a pale face came close to dodds and a solemn voice whispered in his ear our ammunition is nearly done dodd seized sharpes hand convulsively and pointed to the pirates consort coming up to finish them and said with the calm of a brave mans despair cutlasses and die hard at that moment the mastergunner fired his last gun it sent a chainshot on board the retiring pirate took off a portuguese head and spun it clean into the sea ever so far to windward and cut the schooners foremast so nearly through that it trembled and nodded and presently snapped with a loud crack and came down like a broken tree with the yard and sail the latter overlapping the deck and burying itself black flag and all in the sea and there in one moment lay the destroyer buffeting and wrigglinglike a heron on the water with his long wings brokenan utter cripple the victorious crew raised a stunning cheer silence roared dodd with his trumpet all hands make sail he set his courses bent a new jib and stood out to windward close hauled in hopes to make a good offing and then put his ship dead before the wind which was now rising to a stiff breeze in doing this he crossed the crippled pirates bows within eighty yards and sore was the temptation to rake him but his ammunition being short and his danger being imminent from the other pirate he had the selfcommand to resist the great temptation he hailed the mizen top can you two hinder them from firing that gun i rather think we can said fullalove eh colonel and he tapped his long rifle the ship no sooner crossed the schooners bows than a malay ran forward with a linstock pop went the colonels ready carbine and the malay fell over dead and the linstock flew out of his hand a tall portuguese with a movement of rage snatched it up and darted to the gun the yankee rifle cracked but a moment too late bang went the pirates bowchaser and crashed into the agras side and passed nearly through her being disabled the schooners head had come round to windward though she was drifting to leeward ye missed him ye missed him cried the rival theorist joyfully he was mistaken the smoke cleared and there was the pirate captain leaning wounded against the mainmast with a yankee bullet in his shoulder and his crew uttering yells of dismay and vengeance they jumped and raged and brandished their knives and made horrid gesticulations of revenge and the white eyeballs of the malays and papuans glittered fiendishly and the wounded captain raised his sound arm and had a signal hoisted to his consort and she bore up in chase and jamming her fore lateen flat as a board lay far nearer the wind than the agra could and sailed three feet to her two besides on this superiority being made clear the situation of the merchant vessel though not so utterly desperate as before monk fired his lucky shot became pitiable enough if she ran before the wind the fresh pirate would cut her off if she lay to windward she might postpone the inevitable and fatal collision with a foe as strong as that she had only escaped by a rare piece of luck but this would give the crippled pirate time to refit and unite to destroy her add to this the failing ammunition and the thinned crew dodd cast his eyes all round the horizon for help the sea was blank the bright sun was hidden now drops of rain fell and the wind was beginning to sing and the sea to rise a little gentlemen said he let us kneel down and pray for wisdom in this sore strait he and his officers kneeled on the quarterdeck when they rose dodd stood rapt about a minute his great thoughtful eye saw no more the enemy the sea nor anything external it was turned inward his officers looked at him in silence sharpe said he at last there must be a way out of them both with such a breeze as this is now if we could but see it ay if groaned sharpe dodd mused again about ship said he softly like an absent man ay ay sir steer due north said he still like one whose mind was elsewhere while the ship was coming about he gave minute orders to the mates and the gunner to ensure cooperation in the delicate and dangerous manoeuvres that were sure to be at hand the wind was wnw lie was standing north one pirate lay on his lee beam stopping a leak between wind and water and hacking the deck clear of his broken mast and yards the other fresh and thirsting for the easy prey came up to weather on him and hang on his quarter pirate fashion when they were distant about a cables length the fresh pirate to meet the ships change of tactics changed his own luffed up and gave the ship a broadside well aimed but not destructive the guns being loaded with ball dodd instead of replying immediately put his helm hard up and ran under the pirates stern while he was jammed up in the wind and with his five eighteen pounders raked him fore and aft then paying off gave him three carronades crammed with grape and canister the rapid discharge of eight guns made the ship tremble and enveloped her in thick smoke loud shrieks and groans were heard from the schooner the smoke cleared the pirates mainsail hung on deck his jibboom was cut off like a carrot and the sail struggling his foresail looked lace lanes of dead and wounded lay still or writhing on his deck and his lee scuppers ran blood into the sea dodd squared his yards and bore away the ship rushed down the wind leaving the schooner staggered and all abroad but for long the pirate wore and fired his bow chasers at the now flying agra split one of the carronades in two and killed a lascar and made a hole in the foresail this done he hoisted his mainsail again in a trice sent his wounded below flung his dead overboard to the horror of their foes and came after the flying ship yawing and firing his bow chasers the ship was silent she had no shot to throw away not only did she take these blows like a coward but all signs of life disappeared on her except two men at the wheel and the captain on the main gangway dodd had ordered the crew out of the rigging armed them with cutlasses and laid them flat on the forecastle he also compelled kenealy and fullalove to come down out of harms way no wiser on the smooth bore question than they went up the great patient ship ran environed by her foes one destroyer right in her course another in her wake following her with yells of vengeance and pounding away at herbut no reply suddenly the yells of the pirates on both sides ceased and there was a moment of dead silence on the sea yet nothing fresh had happened yes this had happened the pirates to windward and the pirates to leeward of the agra had found out at one and the same moment that the merchant captain they had lashed and bullied and tortured was a patient but tremendous man it was not only to rake the fresh schooner he had put his ship before the wind but also by a double daring masterstroke to hurl his monster ship bodily on the other without a foresail she could never get out of her way the pirate crew had stopped the leak and cut away and unshipped the broken foremast and were stepping a new one when they saw the huge ship bearing down in full sail nothing easier than to slip out of her way could they get the foresail to draw but the time was short the deadly intention manifest the coming destruction swift after that solemn silence came a storm of cries and curses as their seamen went to work to fit the yard and raise the sail while their fighting men seized their matchlocks and trained the guns they were well commanded by an heroic able villain astern the consort thundered but the agras response was a dead silence more awful than broadsides for then was seen with what majesty the enduring anglosaxon fights one of that indomitable race on the gangway one at the foremast two at the wheel conned and steered the great ship down on a hundred matchlocks and a grinning broadside just as they would have conned and steered her into a british harbour starboard said dodd in a deep calm voice with a motion of his hand starboard it is the pirate wriggled ahead a little the man forward made a silent signal to dodd port said dodd quietly port it is but at this critical moment the pirate astern sent a mischievous shot and knocked one of the men to atoms at the helm dodd waved his hand without a word and another man rose from the deck and took his place in silence and laid his unshaking hand on the wheel stained with that mans warm blood whose place he took the high ship was now scarce sixty yards distant she seemed to know she reared her lofty figurehead with great awful shoots into the air but now the panting pirates got their new foresail hoisted with a joyful shout it drew the schooner gathered way and their furious consort close on the agras heels just then scourged her deck with grape port said dodd calmly port it is the giant prow darted at the escaping pirate that acre of coming canvas took the wind out of the swift schooners foresail it flapped oh then she was doomed that awful moment parted the races on board her the papuans and sooloos their black faces livid and blue with horror leaped yelling into the sea or crouched and whimpered the yellow malays and brown portuguese though blanched to one colour now turned on death like dying panthers fired two cannon slap into the ships bows and snapped their muskets and matchlocks at their solitary executioner on the ships gangway and out flew their knives like crushed wasps stings crash the indiamans cutwater in thick smoke beat in the schooners broadside down went her masts to leeward like fishingrods whipping the water there was a horrible shrieking yell wild forms heaped off on the agra and were hacked to pieces almost ere they reached the decka surge a chasm in the sea filled with an instant rush of engulphing waves a long awful grating grinding noise never to be forgotten in this world all along under the ships keeland the fearful majestic monster passed on over the blank she had made with a pale crew standing silent and awestruck on her deck a cluster of wild heads and staring eyeballs bobbing like corks in her foaming wake sole relic of the blottedout destroyer and a wounded man staggering on the gangway with hands uplifted and staring eyes shot in two places the head and the breast with a loud cry of pity and dismay sharpe fullalove kenealy and others rushed to catch him but ere they got near the captain of the triumphant ship fell down on his hands and knees his head sunk over the gangway and his blood ran fast and pattered in the midst of them on the deck he had defended so bravely chapter x they got to the wounded captain and raised him he revived a little and the moment he caught sight of mr sharpe he clutched him and cried stunsels oh captain said sharpe let the ship go it is you we are anxious for now at this dodd lifted up his hands and beat the air impatiently and cried again in the thin querulous voice of a wounded man but eagerly stunsels stunsels on this sharpe gave the command make sail all hands set stunsels low and aloft while the unwounded hands swarmed into the rigging the surgeon came aft in all haste but dodd declined him till all his men should have been looked to meantime he had himself carried to the poop and laid on a mattress his bleeding head bound tight with a wet cambric handkerchief and his pale face turned towards the hostile schooner astern she had to hove to and was picking up the survivors of her blottedout consort the group on the agras quarterdeck watched her to see what she would do next flushed with immediate success the younger officers crowed their fears she would not be game to attack them again dodds fears ran the other way he said in the weak voice to which he was now reduced they are taking a wet blanket aboard that crew of blackguards we swamped wont want any more of us it all depends on the pirate captain if he is not drowned then blow wind rise sea or theres trouble ahead for us as soon as the schooner had picked up the last swimmer she hoisted foresail mainsail and jib with admirable rapidity and bore down in chase the agra had meantime got a start of more than a mile and was now running before a stiff breeze with studding sails alow and aloft in an hour the vessels ran nearly twelve miles and the pirate had gained half a mile at the end of the next hour they were out of sight of land wind and sea rising and the pirate only a quarter of a mile astern the schooner was now rising and falling on the waves the ship only nodding and firm as a rock blow wind rise sea faltered dodd another halfhour passed without perceptibly altering the position of the vessels then suddenly the wounded captain laid aside his glass after a long examination and rose unaided to his feet in great excitement and found his manly voice for a moment he shook his fist at the now pitching schooner and roared goodbye ye portuguese lubberoutfoughtoutmanoeuvredand outsailed it was a burst of exultation rare for him he paid for it by sinking faint and helpless into his friends arms and the surgeon returning soon after insisted on his being taken to his cabin and kept quite quiet as they were carrying him below the pirate captain made the same discovery that the ship was gaining on him he hauled to the wind directly and abandoned the chase when the now receding pirate was nearly hull down the sun began to set mr tickell looked at him and said hallo old fellow what are you about why it isnt two oclock the remark was quite honest he really feared for a moment that orb was mistaken and would get himselfand othersinto trouble however the middy proved to be wrong and the sun right to a minute time flies fast fighting mrs beresford came on deck with brat and poodle fred a destructive child clapped his hands with glee at the holes in the canvas snap toddled about smelling the blood of the slain and wagging his tail by halves perplexed well gentlemen said mrs beresford i hope you have made noise enough over ones head and what a time you did take to beat that little bit of a thing freddy be quiet you worry me where is your bearer will anybody oblige me by finding ramgolam i will said mr tickell hastily and ran off for the purpose but he returned after some time with a long face no ramgolam to be found fullalove referred herwith humourtwinkling eyeto vespasian i have a friend here who says he can tell you something about him can you my good man inquired the lady turning haughtily towards the negro iss missy said vespasian showing his white teeth in a broad grin dis child knows where to find dat ar niggar widout him been and absquatulated since then go and fetch him directly vespasian went off with an obedient start this annoyed fullalove interfered with his system madam said he gravely would you oblige me by bestowing on my friend a portion of that courtesy with which you favour me and which becomes you so gracefully certainly not replied mrs beresford mr fullalove i am out of patience with you the idea of a sensible intelligent gentleman like you calling that creature your friend and you an american where they do nothing but whip them from morning till night who ever heard of making friends with a blacknow what is the meaning of this i detest practical jokes for the stalwart negro had returned bringing a tall breadbag in his arms he now set it up before her remarking dis yar bag white outside but him nation black inside to confirm his words he drew off the bag and revealed ramgolam his black skin powdered with meal the goodnatured negro then blew the flour off his face and dusted him a bit the spectators laughed heartily but ramgolam never moved a muscle not a morsel discomposed at what would have made an european miserably ashamed even in a pantomimethe caucasian darkie retained all his dignity while the african one dusted him but being dusted he put on his obsequiousness stepped forward joined his palms together to mrs beresfordlike medieval knights and modern children at their devotionsand addressed her thus daughter of light he who basks in your beams said to himself the pirates are upon us those children of blood whom sheitan their master blast for ever they will ravish the queen of sunshine and the ayahs and throw the sahibs and sailors into the sea but bread being the staff of existence these foxes of the water will not harm it but keep it for their lawless appetites therefore ramgolam son of chittroo son of soonarayan will put the finger of silence on the lip of discretion and be bread in the day of adversity the sons of sheitan will peradventure return to dry land and close the eye of watchfulness then will i emerge like the sun from a cloud and depart in peace oh very well said mrs beresford then you are an abominable egotist that is all and a coward and thank heaven freddy and i were defended by english and americans andhemtheir friends and not by hindoos she added charmingly this shows me my first words on coming here ought to have been to offer my warmest thanks to the brave men who have defended me and my child and swept them so queenly a curtesy that the mens hats and caps flew off in an instant mr black said she turning with a voice of honey to vespasian but aiming obliquely at fullaloves heart would you oblige me by kicking that dog a little he is always smelling what does not belong to himwhy it is blood oh and she turned pale in a moment sharpe thought some excuse necessary you see maam we havent had time to clean the decks since it is the blood of menof the poor fellows who have defended us so nobly faltered the lady trembling visibly well maam said sharpe still half apologetically you know a ship cant fight all day long without an accident or two he added with nautical simplicity and love of cleanliness however the deck will be cleaned and holystoned tomorrow long before you turn out mrs beresford was too much overcome to explain how much deeper her emotion was than a dislike to stained floors she turned faint and on getting the better of that went down to her cabin crying thence issued a royal order that the wounded were to have wine and every luxury they could fancy without limit or stintat her expense the next day a deep gloom reigned in the ship the crew were ranged in their sunday clothes and bareheaded a grating was rigged sharpe read the burial service and the dead each man sewed up in his hammock with a lb shot glided off the grating into the sea with a sullen plunge while their shipmates cried so that the tears dripped on the deck with these regrets for the slain too violent to last was mingled a gloomy fear that death had a heavier blow in store the surgeons report of captain dodd was most alarming he had become delirious about midnight and so continued sharpe commanded the ship and the rough sailors stepped like cats over that part of the deck beneath which their unconscious captain lay if two men met on the quarterdeck a look of anxious but not hopeful inquiry was sure to pass between them among the constant inquirers was ramgolam the grave hindoo often waylaid the surgeon at the captains door to get the first intelligence this marked sympathy with a hero in extremity was hardly expected from a sage who at the first note of wars trumpet had vanished in a mealbag however it went down to his credit one person however took a dark view of this innocent circumstance but then that hostile critic was vespasian a rival in matters of tint he exploded in one of those droll rages darkies seem liable to massa cunnel said he what for dat yar niggar always prowling about the capns door what for he ask so many stupid questions dat ole fox arter no good him heart so black as um skin dam ole niggar fullalove suggested slily that a person with a dark skin might have a grateful heart and the colonel who dealt little in innuendo said come dont you be so hard on jet you ebony bery well gemmen replied vespasian ceremoniously and with seeming acquiescence then with sudden ire because goramighty made you white you tink you bery wise without any more trouble dat ar niggar am an abominable egotisk pray what does that mean inquired kenealy innocently what him mean what him mean yah yah yes what does it mean what him mean yah what didnt you hear missy besford miscall him an abominable egotisk yes said fullalove winking to kenealy but we dont know what it means do you sir iss sar dat ar expression he signify a darned old cuss dat says to dis child my lord vespasium take benevolence on your insidious slave and invest me in a breadbag instead of fighting for de ladies like a freenindependum citizen now you two go fast asleep dis child lie shut one eye and open de oder bery wide open on dat ar niggar and with this mysterious threat he stalked away his contempt for a black skin his ebullitions of unexpected ire his turgid pomposity and love of long terms may make the reader smile but they could hardly amuse his friends just then everything that touched upon dodd was too serious now the surgeon sat up with him nearly all night in the daytime those two friends sat for hours in his cabin watching sadly and silently moistening his burning brow and his parched lips at length one afternoon there came a crisis which took an unfavourable turn then the surgeon speaking confidentially to these two staunch friends inquired if they had asked themselves what should be done with the body why i ask said he is because we are in a very hot latitude and if you wish to convey it to barkington the measures ought to be taken in time in fact within an hour or two after death the poor friends were shocked and sickened by this horrible piece of foresight but colonel kenealy said with tears in his eyes that his old friend should never be buried like a kitten then you had better ask sharpe to give me an order for a barrel of spirits said the surgeon yes yes for two if you like oh dont die dodd my poor old fellow how shall i ever face his wifei remember her the loveliest girl you ever sawwith such a tale as this she will think it a cruel thing i should come out of it without a scratch and a ten times better man to be dead and so it is it is cruel it is unjust it is monstrous him to be lying there and we muffs to be sitting croaking over him and watching for his last breath like three cursed old ravens and the stout colonel groaned aloud when the surgeon left them they fell naturally upon another topic the pledge they had given dodd about the l they ascertained it was upon him next his skin but it seemed as unnecessary as it was repugnant to remove it from his living person they agreed however that instantly on his decease they would take possession of it note the particulars seal it up and carry it to mrs dodd with such comfort as they could hope to give her by relating the gallant act in which his precious life was lost at pm the surgeon took his place by dodds bedside and the pair whom one thing after another had drawn so close together retired to kenealys cabin many a merry chat they had had there and many a gaseonade being rival hunters but now they were together for physical companionship in sorrow rather than for conversation they smoked their cigars in moody silence and at midnight shook hands with a sigh and parted that sigh meant to say that in the morning all would be over they turned in but ere either of them was asleep suddenly the captains cabin seemed to fill with roars and shrieks of wild beasts that made the whole ship ring in the silent night the savage cries were answered on deck by shouts of dismay and many pattering feet making for the companion ladder but the nearest persons to the cabin and the first to reach it were kenealy and fullalove who burst in the former with a drawn sword the latter with a revolver both in their nightgowns and there saw a sight that took their breath away the surgeon was not there and two black men one with a knife and one with his bare claws were fighting and struggling and trampling all over the cabin at once and the dying man sitting up in his cot pale and glaring at them chapter xi the two supple dusky forms went whirling so fast there was no grasping them to part them but presently the negro seized the hindoo by the throat the hindoo just pricked him in the arm with his knife and the next moment his own head was driven against the side of the cabin with a stunning crack and there he was pinned and wriggling and bluish with fright whereas the other swart face close against his was darkgrey with rage and its two fireballs of eyes rolled fearfully as none but african eyes can roll fullalove pacified him by voice and touch he withdrew his iron grasp with sullen and lingering reluctance and glared like a disappointed mastiff the cabin was now full and sharpe was for putting both the blacks in irons no splitter of hairs was he but fullalove suggested there might be a moral distinction between things that looked equally dark to the eye well then speak quick both of you said sharpe or ill lay ye both by the heels ye black scoundrels what business have you in the captains cabin kicking up the devils delight thus threatened vespasian panted out his tale he had discovered this nigger as he persisted in calling the hindoo eternally prowling about the good captains door and asking stupid questions he had watched him and on the surgeon coming out with the good news that the captain was better in had crawled this yar abominable egotisk and he raised a ponderous fist to point the polysyllables with this aid the sarcasm would doubtless have been crushing but fullalove hung on the sable orators arm and told him drily to try and speak without gesticulating the darned old cuss said vespasian with a pathetic sigh at not being let hit him he resumed and told how he had followed the hindoo stealthily and found him with a knife uplifted over the captaina tremor ran through all presentrobbing him at this a loud murmur filled the room a very ugly one the sort of snarl with which dogs fly at dogs throats with their teeth and men fly at mens throats with a cord be quiet said sharpe imperiously ill have no lynching in a vessel i command now then you sir how do you know he was robbing the captain how do i know yah yah capn if you please you tell dis unskeptical gemman whether you dont miss a lilly book out of your bosom during this extraordinary scene dodd had been looking from one speaker to another in great surprise and some confusion but at the negros direct appeal his hand went to his breast and clutched it with a feeble but heartrending cry oh him not gone far yah yah and vespasian stooped and took up an oilskin packet off the floor and laid it on the bed dis child seen him in dat ar niggars hand and heard him go whack on de floor dodd hurried the packet into his bosom then turned all gratitude to his sable friend now god bless you god bless you give me your honest hand you dont know what you have done for me and mine and sick as he was he wrung vespasians hand with convulsive strength and would not part with it vespasian patted him soothingly all over and whimpered out nebber you mind capn you bery good man this child bery fond of you a long time ago you bery good man outrageous good man dam good man i propose your health invalesee directly while dodd was speaking the others were silent out of respect but now sharpe broke in and with the national desire to hear both sides called on ramgolam for his version the hindoo was now standing with his arms crossed on his breast looking all the martyr meek and dignified he inquired of sharpe in very broken english whether he spoke hindostanee not i nor dont act it neither said sharpe at this confession ramgolam looked down on him with pity and mild contempt mr tickell was put forward as interpreter ramgolam in hindostanee he whom destiny too strong for mortals now oppresses with iron hand and feeds with the bread of affliction mr tickell translating he who by bad luck has got into trouble ramgolam has long observed the virtues that embellish the commander of this ship resembling a mountain and desired to imitate them tickell saw what a good man the captain is and wanted to be like him vespasian the darned old cuss ramgolam seeing him often convey his hand to his bosom i ascribed his unparalleled excellence to the possession of some sovereign talisman tickell managed to translate this sentence all but the word talisman which he renderedwith all a translators cautionarticle finding him about to depart to the regions of the blessed where such auxiliaries are not needed and being eager to emulate his perfections here below i came softly to the place where he lay tickell when i saw him going to slip his cable i wanted to be as good a fellow as he is so i crept alongside ramgolam and gently and without force made myself proprietor of the amulet and inheritor of a good mans qualities tickell and quietly boned the article and the captains virtues i dont know what the beggar means ramgolam then a traitor with a dark skin but darker soul tickell then another blackhearted nigger ramgolam came furiously and misappropriated the charm thus piously obtained tickell ran in and stole it from me ramgolam and bereft me of the excellences i was inheriting and here sharpe interrupted the dialogue by putting the misappropriator of other mens virtues in irons and the surgeon insisted on the cabin being cleared but dodd would not part with the three friends yet he begged them to watch him and see nobody else came to take his childrens fortune ill sink or swim with it but oh i doubt we shall have no luck while it is aboard me i never had a pirate alongside before in all these years what is thisheres something in it nowsomething hardsomething heavy andwhy its a bullet on this announcement an eager inspection took place and sure enough a bullet had passed through dodds coat and waistcoat c and through the oilskin and the leather pocketbook and just dented the hard cash no more there was a shower of comments and congratulations the effect of this discovery on the sick mans spirits was remarkable i was a villain to belie it said he it is my wifes and my childrens and it has saved my life for them he kissed it and placed it in his bosom and soon after sunk into a peaceful slumber the excitement had not the ill effect the surgeon feared it somewhat exhausted him and he slept long but on awakening was pronounced out of danger to tell the truth the tide had turned in his favour overnight and it was to convey the good news on deck the surgeon had left him while dodd was recovering the agra was beating westward with light but contrary winds and a good month elapsed without any incident affecting the hard cash whose singular adventures i have to record in this dearth please put up with a little characteristic trifle which did happen one moonlight night mr fullalove lay coiled below decks in deep abstraction meditating a patent and being in shadow and silent he saw vespasian in the moonlight creeping on all fours like a guilty thing into the bedroom of colonel kenealy then fast asleep a horrible suspicion thrilled through fullalove a suspicion he waited grimly to verify the transatlantic mixture fullalove was not merely an inventor a philanthrope a warrior a preacher a hunter a swimmer a fiddler a sharp fellow a good fellow a puritan and a bohemian he was also a theorist and his theory which dub we the african theory had two branches that the races of men started equal but accident upon accident had walked some tribes up a ladder of civilisation and kicked others down it and left others standing at the foot that the good work of centuries could be done at a pinch in a few generations by artificial condensation of the favourable circumstances for instance secure this worker in ebony years life and he would sign a penal bond to produce negroes of the fourth descent equal in mind to the best contemporary white you can breed brains said he under any skin as inevitably as fat it takes time and the right crosses but so does fator rather it did for fat is an institution now and here our republican must have a slap at thrones compare said he the opportunities of these distinguished gentlemen and ladies with their acts their seats have been high but their minds low i swan they have been breeders for ages and known the two rudiments of the science have crossed and crossed for grenadiers racehorses poultry and prizebullocks and bred in and in for fools but which of them has ever aspired to breed a newton a pascal a shakespeare a solon a raphael yet all these were results to be obtained by the right crosses as surely as a swift horse or a circular sow now fancy breeding shorthorns when you might breed long heads so vespasian was to engender young africa he was to be first elevated morally and intellectually as high as he would go and then set to breed his partner of course to be elected by fullalove and educated as high as she would consent to without an illicit connection with the experimentalist he would be down on their pickaninnies before the parents could transfer the remnant of their own weaknesses to them polysyllables included and would polish these ebony chips and at the next cross reckoned to rear a genius by which time as near as he could calculate he the theorist would be in his dotage and all the better make a curious contrast in favour of young africa vespasian could not hit a barn door sittingwith a rifle it was purely with a view to his moral improvement mind you that fullalove invited him into the mizentop to fight the pirate the patient came gingerly and shivered there with fear but five minutes elapsing and he not killed that weakness gave way to a jocund recklessness and he kept them all gay with his quaint remarks of which i must record but one when they crossed the stern of the pirate the distance was so small that the faces of that motley crew were plainly visible now vespasian was a merciless critic of coloured skins wal said he turning up his nose skyhigh dis child never seen such a mixallaneous biling o darkies as this yar why darned ef there aint every colour in the rainbow from the ace of spades down to the fine dissolving views this amazing description coupled with his look of affront and disgust made the white men roar for men fighting for their lives have a greater tendency to laugh than one would think possible fullalove was proud of the critic and for a while lost sight of the pirate in his theory which also may seem strange but your true theorist is a man apart he can withdraw into himself under difficulties what said one of the breed two thousand years ago media inter praelia semper sideribus coelique plagis superisque vacavi oh the great african heart said fullalove after the battle by my side he fears no danger of all men negroes are the most capable of friendship their affection is a mine and we have only worked it with the lash and that is a ridiculous mining tool i rather think when vespasian came out so strong versus ramgolam fullalove was even more triumphant for after all it is not so much the heart as the intelligence of the negro we albiculi affect to doubt oh the great african intellect said fullalove publicly taking the bull by the horns i know said mrs beresford maliciously it is down in the maps as the great african desert to balance his many excellences vespasian had an infirmity this was an ungovernable itch for brushing whites if he was talking with one of that always admired and now beloved race and saw a speck of dirt on him he would brush him unobtrusively but effectually in full dialogue he would steal behind a knot of whites and brush whoever needed it however little fullalove remonstrated but in vain on this one point instinct would not yield to reason he could not keep his hands off a dusty white he would have died of the miller of dee but the worst was he did not stop at clothes he loathed illblacked shoes woe to all footleather that did not shine his own skin furnished a perilous standard of comparison he was eternally blacking boots en amateur fullalove got in a rage at this and insisted on his letting his fellowcreatures leather alone vespasian pleaded hard especially for leave to black colonel kenealy the cunnell said he pathetically is such a tarnation fine gentleman spoilt for want of a lilly bit of blacking fullalove replied that the colonel had got a servant whose mission it was to black his shoes this simply amused vespasian a servant said he yah yah what is the use of white servants they are not biddable massa fullalove sar goramighty he reared all white men to kick up a dust white servants inspecially and the darkies to brush em and likewise additionally to make their boots she a lilly bit he concluded with a dark hint that the colonels white servants own shoes though better blacked than his masters were anything but mirrors and that this child had his eye on them the black desperado emerged on tiptoe from kenealys cabin just as macbeth does from the murdered duncans chamber only with a pair of boots in his hand instead of a pair of daggers got into the moonlight and finding himself uninterrupted assumed the whistle of innocence and polished them to the nine chuckling audibly fullalove watched him with an eye like a rattlesnake but kept quiet he saw interference would only demoralise him worse for it is more ignoble to black boots clandestinely than bravely men ditto he relieved his heart with idioms darn the critter hes fixed my flint eternally now i cave i swan to man i may just hang up my fiddle for this darkies too hard a row to hoe it was but a momentary dejection the mixture was inter alia a theorist and an anglosaxon two indomitables he concluded to temporise with the brush and breed it out im bound to cross the obsequious cuss with the catawamptiousest gal in guinea and one that never saw a blacking bottle not even in a dream majora canamus being now about a hundred miles south of the mauritius in fine weather with a light breeze dodds marine barometer began to fall steadily and by the afternoon the declension had become so remarkable that he felt uneasy and somewhat to the surprise of the crewfor there was now scarce a breath of airfurled his slight sails treble reefed his topsails had his topgallant and royal yards and gaff topsail bent on deck got his flying jibboom in c and made the ship snug kenealy asked him what was the matter barometer going down moon at the full and jonah aboard was the reply uttered doggedly kenealy assured him it was a beautiful evening precursor of a fine day see how red the sunset is evening red and morning grey are the sure signs of a fine day dodd looked and shook his head the sun was red but the wrong red an angry red and as he dipped into the wave discharged a lurid coppery hue that rushed in a moment like an embodied menace over the entire heavens the wind ceased altogether and in the middle of an unnatural and suspicious calm the glass went down down down the moon rose and instantly all eyes were bent on her with suspicion for in this latitude the hurricanes generally come at the full moon she was tolerably clear however but a light scud sailing across her disc showed there was wind in the upper regions dodd trusted to science barred the leeports and had the dead lights put into the stem cabin and secured then turned in for an hours sleep science proved a prophet just at seven bells in one moment like a thunderbolt from the sky a heavy squall struck the ship under a less careful captain her leeports would have been open and she might have gone to the bottom like a bullet let go the main sheet roared sharpe hastily to a hand he had placed there on purpose he let go and there was the sail flapping like thunder and the sheet lashing everything in the most dangerous way dodd was on deck in a moment helm hard up hands shorten sail pipe all hands furl sail ahoy up tumbled the crew went cheerily to work and by three bells in the middle watch had hauled up what was left of the shivered mainsail and hove the ship to under closereefed main topsail and storm staysails and so the voyage was suspended a heavy sea got up under a scourging wind that rose and rose till the agra under the pressure of that single sail treble reefed heeled over so as to dip her lee channels this went on till the waves rolled so high and the squalls were so bitter that sheets of water were actually torn off their crests and launched incessantly on deck not only drenching dodd and his officers which they did not mind but threatening to flood the ship dodd battened down the hatches and stopped that game then came a danger no skill could avert the ship lurched so violently now as not merely to clip but bury her lower deck portpendents and so a good deal of water found ingress through the windage then dodd set a gang to the pumps for he said we can hardly hope to weather this out without shipping a sea and i wont have water coming in upon water and now the wind raging and roaring like discharges of artillery and not like wind as known in our seas seemed to have put out all the lights of heaven the sky was inky black and quite close to their heads and the wind still increasing the vessel came down to her extreme bearings and it was plain she would soon be on her beam ends sharpe and dodd met and holding on by the lifelines applied their speaking trumpets tight to each others ears and even then they had to bawl she cant carry a rag much longer no sir not half an hour can we furl that main taupsle sharpe shook his head the first moment we start a sheet the sail will whip the mast out of her you are right well then ill cut it away volunteers sir ay twelve no more send them to my cabin sharpes difficulty was to keep the men back so eager were the fine fellows to risk their lives however he brought twelve to the cabin headed by mr grey who had a right as captain of the watch to go with them on which right he insisted in spite of dodds earnest request that he would forego it when dodd saw his resolution he dropped the friend and resumed the captain and spoke to them through a trumpet the first time he had ever used one in a cabin or seen one used mr grey and men going aloft to save the mainmast by cutting the sail away ay ay sir service of danger great danger hurrah but great dangers can be made smaller by working the right way attend lay out all on the yard and take your time from one man at the lee yardarm dont know who that will be but one of the smartest men in the ship order to him is hold his knife hand well up rest to see and then in knives altogether mind and cut from you and below the reef band and then i hope to see all come down alive mr grey and his twelve men left the cabin and hey for the main top the men let the officer lead them as far as jacobs ladder and then hurrah for the lee yardarm that was where all wanted to be and but one could be grey was as anxious as the rest but officers of his rank seldom go aloft and soon fall out of their catlike habits he had done about six ratlines when instead of going hand over head he spread his arms to seize a shroud on each side of him by this he weakened his leverage and the wind just then came fiercer caught him and flattened him against the rigging as tight as if nature had caught up a mountain for a hammer and nailed him with a cedar he was spreadeagled the men accepted him at once as a new patent ratline with a fine resisting power they went up him and bounded three ordinary ratlines at a go off all his promontories especially his shoulders and his head receiving his compliments in the shape of hearty curses they gained the top and lay out on the yard with their hair flying like streamers and who got the place of honour but thompson the jolly foretopman who couldnt stand smoked peasoup so strong and so weak are men thompson raised his knife high there was a pause then in went all their knives and away went the sail into the night of the storm and soon seemed a sheet of writingpaper and more likely to hit the sky than the sea the men came down picked their officer off the rigging had a dram in the captains cabin and saw him enter their names in the logbook for good service and in the pursers for extra grog on sundays from there to gravesend the ship was relieved and all looked well till the chronometer their only guide now announced sunset when the wind incredible as it may appear increased and one frightful squall dipped the muzzles of the lee carronades in the water then was heard the first cry of distress an appalling sound the wail of brave men and they had borne it all so bravely so cheerfully till now but now they knew something must go or else the ship the suspense was awful but very short crack crash the fore and main topmast both gone short off by the caps and the ship recovered slowly hesitatingly tremblingly relieving her from one danger this subjected her to another and a terrible one the heavy spars that had fallen unable to break loose from the rigging pounded the ship so savagely as to threaten to stave in her side add to this that with labouring so long and severely some of the ships seams began now to open and shut and discharge the oakum which is terrible to the bravest seamen yet neither this stout captain nor his crew shirked any danger men had ever grappled with since men were dodd ordered them to cut away the wreck to leeward it was done then to windward this the more ticklish operation was also done smartly the wreck passed under the ships quarter and she drifted clear of it they breathed again at eight bells in the first watch it began to thunder and lighten furiously but the thunder though close was quite inaudible in the tremendous uproar of the wind and sea it blew a hurricane there were no more squalls now but one continuous tornado which in its passage through that great gaunt skeleton the ships rigging and bare poles howled and yelled and roared so terrifically as would have silenced a salvo of artillery fired alongside the overwhelming sea ran in dark watery mountains crested with devilish fire the inky blackness added supernatural horror the wrath of the almighty seemed upon them and his hand to drop the black sky down on them for their funeral pall surely noah from his ark saw nothing more terrible what is that close on the lee bow chose the flash of a gun another another another a ship in distress firing minuteguns in their ears yet no sound human thunder silenced as gods thunder was silenced by the uproar of his greater creatures in their mad rage the agra fired two minuteguns to let the other poor ship know she had a companion in her helplessness and her distress and probably a companion in her fate even this companionship added its mite of danger for both ships were mere playthings of the elements they might be tossed together and then what would be their fate two eggs clashed together in a great boiling caldron and all the life spilt out yet did each flash shoot a ray of humanity and sympathy into the thick black supernatural horror and now came calamity upon calamity a tremendous sea broke the tiller at the rudderhead and not only was the ship in danger of falling off and shipping the sea but the rudder hammered her awfully and bade fair to stave in her counter which is another word for destruction thus death came at them with two hands open at once these vessels always carry a spare tiller they tried to ship it but the difficulty was prodigious no light but the miserable decklanternone glowworm in egypt supernaturally darkenedthe agra never on an even keel and heeling over like a seesaw more than a ship and then every time they did place the tiller and get the strain on with their luff tackles the awful sea gave it a blow and knocked it away like a hair at last they hit it off or thought they had for the ponderous thumps of the rudder ceased entirely however the ship did not obey this new tiller like the old one her head fell off in an unlucky moment when seven waves were rolling in one and on coming to the windward again she shipped a sea it came in over her bow transversely broke as high as the mainstay and hid and buried the whole ship before the mast carried away the waist bulwarks on both sides filled the launch and drowned the live stock which were in it swept four waterbutts and three men away into the sea like corks and straws and sent tons of water down the forescuttle and main hatchway which was partly opened not to stifle the crew and flooded the gundeck ankledeep dodd who was in his cabin sent the whole crew to the pumps except the men at the wheel and prepared for the worst in men so brave as he was when hope dies fear dies his chief care now was to separate the fate of those he loved from his own he took a bottle inserted the fatal money in it with a few words of love to his wife and of direction to any stranger that should fall in with it secured the cork with melted sealingwax tied oilskin over it and melted wax on that applied a preparation to the glass to close the pores and to protect it against other accidents and attract attention fastened a black painted bladder to it by a stout tarred twine and painted agra lost at sea in white on the bladder he had logged each main incident of the storm with that curt businesslike accuracy which reads so cold and small a record of these great and terrible tragedies he now made a final entry a little more in character with the situation about eight bells in the morning watch shipped a heavy sea forward the rudder being now damaged and the ship hardly manageable brought the log and case on check expecting to founder shortly sun and moon hidden this two days and no observation possible but by calculation of wind and current we should be about fifty miles to the southward of the mauritius gods will be done he got on deck with the bottle in his pocket and the bladder peeping out put the log and its case down on deck and by means of the lifelines crawled along on his knees and with great difficulty to the wheel finding the men could hardly hold on and dreading another sea dodd with his own hands lashed them to the helm while thus employed he felt the ship give a slight roll a very slight roll to windward his experienced eye lightened with hope he cast his eager glance to leeward there it is a sailor looks for the first spark of hope ay thereaway was a little gleam of light he patted the helmsman on the shoulder and pointed to it for now neither could one man speak for the wind nor another hear the sailor nodded joyfully presently the continuous tornado broke into squalls hope grew brighter but unfortunately in one furious squall the ship broke round off so as to present her quarter to the sea at an unlucky moment for it came seven deep again a roaring mountain and hurled itself over her stern and quarter the mighty mass struck her stem frame with the weight of a hundred thousand tons of water and drove her forward as a boy launches his toyboat on a pond and though she made so little resistance stove in the dead lights and the port frames burst through the cabin bulkheads and washed out all the furniture and colonel kenealy in his nightgown with a table in his arms borne on water three feet deep and carried him under the poop awning away to the lee quarterdeck scuppers and flooded the lower deck above it swept the quarterdeck clean of everything except the shrieking helmsmen washed dodd away like a cork and would have carried him overboard if he had not brought up against the mainmast and grasped it like grim death half drowned half stunned sorely bruised and gasping like a porpoise ashore he held on by the mast in water and foam panting he rolled his despairing eyes around the bulwarks fore and aft were all in ruins with wide chasms as between the battlements of some decayed castle and through the gaps he saw the sea yawning wide for him he dare not move no man was safe a moment unless lashed to mast or helm he held on expecting death but presently it struck him he could see much farther than before he looked up it was clearing overhead and the uproar abating visibly and now the wind did not decline as after a gale extraordinary to the last it blew itself out sharpe came on deck and crawled on all fours to his captain and helped him to a lifeline he held on by it and gave his orders the wind was blown out but the sea was as dangerous as ever the ship began to roll to windward if that was not stopped her fate was sealed dodd had the main trysail set and then the fore trysail before he would yield to go below though drenched and sore and hungry and worn out those sails steadied the ship the sea began to go down by degrees the celestial part of nature was more generous away flew every cloud out came the heavenly sky bluer and lovelier than ever they had seen it the sun flamed in its centre nature after three days eclipse was so lovely it seemed a new heavens and a new earth if there was an infidel on board who did not believe in god now his soul felt him in spite of the poor little head as for dodd who was naturally pious he raised his eyes towards that lovely sky in heartfelt though silent gratitude to its maker for saving the ship and cargo and her peoples lives not forgetting the private treasure he was carrying home to his dear wife and children with this thought he naturally looked down but missed the bladder that had lately protruded from his pocket he clapped his hand to his pocket all in a flutter the bottle was gone in a fever of alarm and anxiety but with good hopes of finding it he searched the deck he looked in every cranny behind every coil of rope the sea had not carried away in vain the sea acting on the buoyant bladder attached had clearly torn the bottle out of his pocket when it washed him against the mast his treasure then must have been driven much farther and how far who could tell it flashed on the poor man with fearful distinctness that it must either have been picked up by somebody in the ship ere now or else carried out to sea strict inquiry was made amongst the men no one had seen it the fruit of his toil and prudence the treasure love not avarice had twined with his heartstrings was gone in its defence he had defeated two pirates each his superior in force and now conquered the elements at their maddest and in the very moment of that great victoryit was gone chapter xii in the narrative of home events i skipped a little business not quite colourless but irrelevant to the love passages then on hand it has however a connection with the curious events now converging to a point so with the readers permission i will place it in logical sequence disregarding the order of time the day dr sampson splashed among the ducks and one of them hid till dinner the rest were seated at luncheon when two patients were announced as waitingmr and mrs maxley sampson refused to see them on this ground i will not feed and heal but mrs dodd interceded and he yielded well then show them in here they are better cracters than pashints on this a stout freshcoloured woman the picture of health was ushered in and curtseyed all round well what is the matter now inquired sampson rather roughly be seated mrs maxley said mrs dodd benignly i thank ye kindly maam and she sat down doctor it is that pain well dont say that pain describe it now listen all of ye yere goen to get a clinical lecture if you please

said to you what was the cause the cause what of my pain he says what was the cause ay the cause just obsairve jintlemen said sampson addressing imaginary students how startled they all are if a docker deviates from profissional habits into sceince and takes the right eend of the stick for once b asking for the cause the cause was the will of god i do suppose said mrs maxley stuff shouted sampson angrily then why come to mortal me to cure you alfred put in his oar he does not mean the final cause he means the proximate cause my poor dear creature i baint no latiner objected the patient sampson fixed his eyes sternly on the slippery dame what i want to know is had you been running upstairs or eating fast or drinking fast or grizzling over twopence or quarrelling with your husband come now which was it me quarrel with my man we havent never been disagreeable not once since we went to church a pair and came back a couple i dont say but what we maynt have had a word or two at odd

brain is your only real chance now slope and send the male screw anan your husband that i will sir your sarvant doctor your sarvant maam sarvant all the company mrs dodd hoped the poor woman had nothing very serious the matter oh it is a mortal disease replied sampson as cool as a cucumber she has got angina pictoris or bristpang a disorder that admirably eximplifies the pretinsions of midicine t seeince and with this he dashed into monologue maxleys tall gaunt form came slouching in and traversed the floor pounding it with heavy nailed boots he seated himself gravely at mrs dodds invitation took a handkerchief out of his hat wiped his face and surveyed the company grand and calm in james maxley all was ponderous his head was huge his mouth when it fairly opened revealed a chasm and thence issued a voice naturally stentorian by its volume and native vigour but when the owner of this incarnate bassoon had a mind to say something sagacious he sank at once from his habitual roar to a sound scarce above a whisper a contrast mighty comical to hear though on paper nil well what is it maxley rheumatism again no that it aint bellowed maxley defiantly what then come look sharp well then doctor ill tell you im sore troubledwithamouse this malady announced in the tone of a proclamation and coming after so much solemn preparation amused the party considerably although parturient mountains had ere then produced muscipular abortions a mouse inquired sampson disdainfully where up your sleeve dont come to me go t a sawbones and have your arm cut off ive seen em mutilate a pashint for as little maxley said it was not up his sleeve worse luck on this alfred hazarded a conjecture might it not have gone down his throat took his potatotrap for the pantrydoor ha ha ay i hear ye young man alaughing at your own sport said maxley winking his eye but taint the biggest mouth as catches the most you sits yander fit to bust but with a roar like a lion ye never offers me none ont neither sup nor bit at this sudden turn of mr maxleys wit light and playful as a tap of the old english quarterstaff they were a little staggered all but edward who laughed and supplied him zealously with sandwiches youre a gentleman you are said maxley looking full at sampson and alfred to point the contradistinction having thus disposed of his satirists he contemplated the sandwiches with an inquiring and philosophic eye well said he after long and thoughtful inspection you gentlefoiks wont die of hard work your sarvants must cut the very meat to fit your mouths and not to fall behind the gentry in a great and useful department of intelligence he made precisely one mouthful of each sandwich mrs dodd was secretly amazed and taking care not to be noticed by maxley said confidentially monsieur avait bien raison le souris a passe par la the plate cleared and washed down with a tumbler of port maxley resumed and informed the doctor that the mouse was at this moment in his garden eating his bulbs and i be come here to put an end to her if ive any luck at all sampson told him he neednt trouble nature has put an end to her as long as her body mr maxley was puzzled for a moment then opened his mouth from ear to ear in a guffaw that made the glasses ring his humour was perverse he was witproof and funproof but at a feeble jest would sometimes roar like a lion inflated with laughinggas laughed he ever so loud and long he always ended abruptly and without gradationhis laugh was a clean spadeful dug out of merriment he resumed his gravity and his theme all in an instant white arsenic she wont look at for ive tried her but they tell me theres another sweetmeat come up which they call it striek nine hets let the poor beasty alone lifes as sweet tit as tus if you was a gardener youd feel for the bulbs not for the varmin remonstrated maxley rather arrogantly but bein a man of sceince i feel for th higher organisation mice are a part of nature as much as marketgardeners so be stoats and adders and doctors sampson appealed jintlemen heres a pretty pashint reflects on our lairned profission and it never cost him a guinea for the dog never pays dont let my chaff choke ye doctor that warnt meant for you altogether so if you have got a little bit of that ere about you im not a ratcatcher my man i dont go with dith in my pocket like the surgeons that carry a lancet and if i had murder in both pockets you shouldnt get any heres a greedy dog got a thousand pounds in the bank and grudges his healer a guinea and his mouse a standup bite now who have been a telling you lies inquired maxley severely my missus for a farthing im not a thousandpound man im a ninehundredpound man and its all safe at hardies here he went from his roar to his whisper i

physician who declined to doctor the foe of his domestic peace and crocuses quite a passage of arms said edward yes said mrs dodd and of bludgeons and things rather than the polished rapier what

with my dictionary meantime there is another contribution to mine said mrs dodd and they agreed in the gaiety of their hearts to compare their rival lexicons chapter xiii the subsiding sea was now a liquid paradise its great pellucid braes and hillocks shone with the sparkle and the hues of all the jewels in an emperors crown imagineafter three days of inky sea and pitchy sky and deaths deep jaws snapping and barely missingten thousand great slopes of emerald aquamarine amethyst and topaz liquid alive and dancing jocundly beneath a gorgeous sun and you will have a faint idea of what met the eyes and hearts of the rescued looking out of that battered jagged ship upon ocean smiling back to smiling heaven yet one man felt no buoyancy nor gush of joy he leaned against a fragment of the broken bulwark confused between the sweetness of life preserved and the bitterness of treasure losthis wifes and childrens treasured treasure benumbed at heart and almost weary of the existence he had battled for so stoutly he looked so moody and answered so grimly and unlike himself that they all held aloof from him heavy heart among so many joyful ones he was in true solitude the body in a crowd the soul alone and he was sore as well as heavy for of all the lubberly acts he had ever known the way he had lost his dear ones fortune seemed to him the worst a voice sounded in his ear poor thing she has s foundered it was fullalove scanning the horizon with his famous glass foundered who said dodd though he did not care much who sank who swam then he remembered the vessel whose flashing guns had shed a human ray on the unearthly horror of the black hurricane he looked all round blank ay she had perished with all hands the sea had swallowed her and spared himungrateful this turned his mind sharply suppose the agra had gone down the money would be lost as now and his life into the bargaina life dearer to all at home than millions of gold he prayed inwardly to heaven for gratitude and goodness to feel its mercy this softened him a little and his heart swelled so he wished he was a woman to cry over his childrens loss for an hour and then shake all off and go through his duty somehow for now he was paralysed and all seemed ended next nautical superstition fastened on him that pocketbook of his was jonah it had to go or else the ship the moment it did go the storm had broken as by magic now superstition is generally stronger than rational religion whether they lie apart or together in one mind and this superstitious notion did something toward steeling the poor man come said he to himself my loss has saved all these poor souls on board this ship so be it heavens will be done i must bustle or else go mad he turned to and worked like a horse and with his own hands helped the men to rig parallel ropesa substitute for bulwarkstill the perspiration ran down him bayliss now reported the well nearly dry and dodd was about to bear up and make sail again when one of the shipboys a little fellow with a bright eye and a chin like a monkeys came up to him and said please captain then glared with awe at what he had done and broke down well my little man said dodd gently thus encouraged the boy gave a great gulp and burst in in a brogue och your arnr sure theres no rudder on her at all barrin the tiller what dye mean dont murder me your arnr and ill tell ye its meself looked over the starrn just now and i seen there was no rudder at all at all mille diaoul sis i ye old bitch ill tell his arur what yare after slipping your rudder like my grannys list shoe i will dodd ran to the helm and looked down the brat was right the blows which had so endangered the ship had broken the rudder and the sea had washed away more than half of it the sight and the reflection made him faintish for a moment death passing so very close to a man sickens him afterwards unless he has the luck to be brainless what is your name urchin ned murphy sir very well murphy then you are a fine little fellow and have wiped all our eyes in the ship run and send the carpenter aft ay ay sir the carpenter came like most artisans he was clever in a groove take him out of that and lo a mule a pig an owl he was not only unable to invent but so stiffly disinclined a makeshift rudder was clean out of his way and as his whole struggle was to get away from every suggestion dodd made back to groove aforesaid the thing looked hopeless then fullalove who had stood by grinning offered to make a bunkum rudder provided the carpenter and mates were put under his orders but said he i must bargain they shall be disrated if they attempt to reason that is no more than fair said dodd the yankee inventor demanded a spare maincap and cut away one end of the square piece so as to make it fit the stempost through the circle of the cap he introduced a spare mizen topmast to this he seized a length of junk another to that another to that and so on to the outside junk he seized a spare maintopgallant mast and this conglomerate being now nearly as broad as a rudder he planked over all the sea by this time was calm he got the machine over the stern and had the square end of the cap bolted to the sternpost he had already fixed four spans of nineinch hawser to the sides of the makeshift two fastened to tackles which led into the gunroom ports and were housed tautthese kept the lower part of the makeshift close to the stern postand two to which guys were now fixed and led through the aftermost ports on to the quarterdeck where luff tackles were attached to them by means of which the makeshift was to be worked as a rudder some sail was now got on the ship and she was found to steer very well dodd tried her on every tack and at last ordered sharpe to make all sail and head for the cape this electrified the first mate the breeze was very faint but southerly and the mauritius under their lee they could make it in a night and there refit and ship a new rudder he suggested the danger of sailing sixteen hundred miles steered by a gimcrack and implored dodd to put into port dodd answered with a roughness and a certain wildness never seen in him before danger sir there will be no more foul weather this voyage jonah is overboard sharpe stared an inquiry i tell you we shant lower our topgallants once from this to the cape jonah is overboard and he slapped his forehead in despair then stamping impatiently with his foot told sharpe his duty was to obey orders not discuss them certainly sir said sharpe sullenly and went out of the cabin with serious thoughts of communicating to the other mates an alarming suspicion about dodd that now for the first time crossed his mind but long habit of discipline prevailed and he made all sail on the ship and bore away for the cape with a heavy heart the sea was like a millpond but in that he saw only its wellknown treachery to lead them on to this unparalleled act of madness each sail he hoisted seemed one more agent of destruction rising at his own suicidal command towards evening it became nearly dead calm the sea heaved a little but was waveless glassy and the colour of a rose incredibly brave and delicate the lookout reported pieces of wreck to windward as the ship was making so little way dodd beat up towards them he feared it was a british ship that had foundered in the storm and thought it his duty to ascertain and carry the sad news home in two tacks they got near enough to see with their glasses that the fragments belonged not to a stranger but to the agra herself there was one of her waterbutts and a broken mast with some rigging and as more wreck was descried coming in at a little distance dodd kept the ship close to the wind to inspect it on drifting near it proved to be several pieces of the bulwark and a mahogany table out of the cuddy this sort of flotsam was not worth delaying the ship to pick it up so dodd made sail again steering now southeast he had sailed about half a mile when the lookout hailed the deck again a man in the water whereabouts a short league on the weather quarter oh we cant beat to windward for him said sharpe he is dead long ago holds his head very high for a corpse said the lookout ill soon know cried dodd lower the gig ill go myself the gig was lowered and six swift rowers pulled him to windward while the ship kept on her course it is most unusual for a captain to leave the ship at sea on such petty errands but dodd half hoped the man might be alive and he was so unhappy and like his daughter who probably derived the trait from him grasped instinctively at a chance of doing kindness to some poor fellow alive or dead that would soothe his own sore good heart when they had pulled about two miles the sun was sinking into the horizon give way men said dodd or we shall not be able to see him the men bent to their oars and made the boat fly presently the coxswain caught sight of an object bobbing on the water abeam why that must be it said he the lubber to take it for a mans head why it is nothing but a thundering old bladder speckled white what cried dodd and fell atrembling steer for it give way ay ay sir they soon came alongside the bladder and the coxswain grabbed it hallo heres something lashed to it a bottle give it me gasped dodd in a voice choked with agitation give it me back to the ship fly fly cut her off or shell give us the slip now he never spoke a word more but sat in a stupor of joyful wonder they soon caught the ship he got into his cabin he scarce knew how broke the bottle to atoms and found the indomitable cash uninjured with trembling hands he restored it to its old place in his bosom and sewed it tighter than ever until he felt it there once more he could hardly realise a stroke of good fortune that seemed miraculousthough in reality it was less strange than the way he had lost it but now laid bodily on his heart it set his bosom on fire oh the bright eye the bounding pulse the buoyant foot the reckless joy he slapped sharpe on the back a little vulgarly for him jonah is on board again old fellow look out for squalls the agra being much larger than the bottle had drifted faster to leeward in the storm he uttered this foreboding in a tone of triumph and with a gay elastic recklessness which harmonised so well with his makeshift rudder that sharpe groaned aloud and wished himself under any captain in the world but this and in any other ship he looked round to make sure he was not watched and then tapped his forehead significantly this somewhat relieved him and he did his duty smartly for a man going to the bottom with his eyes open but ill luck is not to be bespoken any more than good the agras seemed to have blown itself out the wind veered to the southwest and breathed steadily in that quarter for ten days the topgallant sails were never lowered nor shifted day nor night all that time and not a single danger occurred between this and the cape except to a monkey which i fear i must relate on account of its remoter consequences one fine afternoon everybody was on deck amusing themselves as they could mrs beresford to wit was being flattered under the poop awning by kenealy the feud between her and dodd continued but under a false impression the lady had one advantage over the gentler specimens of her sex she was never deterred from a kind action by want of pluck as they are pluck aquilina was brimful of it when she found dodd was wounded she cast her wrongs to the wind and offered to go and nurse him her message came at an unlucky moment and by an unlucky messenger the surgeon said hastily i cant have him bothered the stupid servant reported he cant be worried and mrs beresford thinking dodd had a hand in this answer was bitterly mortified and with some reason she would have forgiven him though if he had died but as he lived she thought she had a right to detest him and did and showed her sentiments like a lady by never speaking to him nor looking at him but ignoring him with frigid magnificence on his own quarterdeck now among the crew of this ship was a favourite goat goodtempered affectionate and playful but a single vice counterbalanced all his virtues he took a drop a year or two ago some lighthearted tempter taught him to sip grog he took to it kindly and was now arrived at such a pitch that at grogtime he used to butt his way in among the sailors and get close to the canteen and by arrangement an allowance was always served out to him on imbibing it he passed with quadrupedal rapidity through three stages the absurd the choleric the sleepy and was never his own goat again until he awoke from the latter now master fred beresford encountered him in the second stage of inebriety and being a rough playfellow tapped his nose with a battledore instantly billy butted at him mischievous fred screamed and jumped on the bulwarks potangry billy went at him there whereupon the young gentleman with all eldrich screech and a comparative estimate of perils that smacked of inexperience fled into the sea at the very moment when his anxious mother was rushing to save him she uttered a scream of agony and would actually have followed him but was held back uttering shriek after shriek that pierced every heart within hearing but dodd saw the boy go overboard and vaulted over the bulwark near the helm roared in the very air heave the ship to and went splash into the water about ten yards from the place he was soon followed by vespasian and a boat was lowered as quickly as possible dodd caught sight of a broad straw hat on the top of a wave swam lustily to it and found freddy inside it was tied under his chin and would have floated goliath dodd turned to the ship saw the poor mother with white face and arms outstretched as if she would fly at them and held the urchin up high to her with a joyful hurrah the ship seemed alive and to hurrah in return with giant voice the boat soon picked them up and dodd came up the side with freddy in his arms and placed him in his mothers with honest pride and deep parental sympathy guess how she scolded and caressed her child all in a breath and sobbed over him for this no human pen has ever told nor ever will all i can just manage to convey is that after she had all but eaten the little torment she suddenly dropped him and made a great maternal rush at dodd she flung her arms round him and kissed him eagerly almost fiercely then carried away wild by mighty nature she patted him all over in the strangest way and kissed his waistcoat his arms his hands and rained tears of joy and gratitude on them dodd was quite overpowered no no said he dont now pray dont there there i know my dear i know im a father and he was very near whimpering himself but recovered the man and the commander and said soothingly there there and he handed her tenderly down to her cabin all this time he had actually forgotten the packet but now a horrible fear came on him he hurried to his own cabin and examined it a little salt water had oozed through the bullethole and discoloured the leather but that was all he breathed again thank heaven i forgot all about it said he it would have made a cur of me lady beresfords petty irritation against dodd melted at oncebefore so great a thing she longed to make friends with him but for once felt timid it struck her now all of a sudden that she had been misbehaving however she caught dodd alone on the deck and said to him softly i want so to end our quarrel our quarrel madam said he why i know of none oh about the light eh well you see the master of a ship is obliged to be a tyrant in some things i make no complaint said the lady hastily and hung her head all i ask you is to forgive one who has behaved like a fool without even the excuse of being one andwill you give me your hand sir ay and with all my heart said dodd warmly enclosing the soft little hand in his honest grasp and with no more ado these two highflyers ended one of those little misunderstandings petty spirits nurse into a feud the ship being in port at the cape and two hundred hammers tapping at her dodd went ashore in search of captain robarts and made the agra over to him in the friendliest way adding warmly that he had found every reason to be satisfied with the officers and the crew to his surprise captain robarts received all this ungraciously you ought to have remained on board sir and made me over the command on the quarterdeck dodd replied politely that it would have been more formal suppose i return immediately and man the side for you and then you board her say in halfanhour i shall come when i like replied robarts crustily and when will you like to come inquired dodd with imperturbable goodhumour now this moment and ill trouble you to come along with me certainly sir they got a boat and went out to the ship on coming alongside dodd thought to meet his wishes by going first and receiving him but the jealous crossgrained fellow shoved roughly before him and led the way up the ships side sharpe and the rest saluted him he did not return the salute but said hoarsely turn the hands up to muster when they were all aft he noticed one or two with their caps on hats off and be to you cried he do you know where you are do you know who you are looking at if not ill show you im here to restore discipline to this ship so mind how you run athwart my hawse dont you play with the bull my men or youll find his horns sharp pipe down now you sir bring me the logbook he ran his eye over it and closed it contemptuously pirates and hurricanes i never fell in with pirates nor hurricanes i have heard of a breeze and a gale but i never knew a seaman worth his salt say hurricane get another logbook mr sharpe put down that it begins this day at noon and enter that captain robarts came on deck found the ship in a miserable condition took the command mustered the officers and men and stopped the ships companys grog for a week for receiving him with hats on even sharpe that walking obedience was taken aback stopthe ships companysgrogfor a week sir yes sir for a week and if you fling my orders back in my face instead of clapping on sail to execute them ill have you towed ashore on a grating your name is sharpe well my name is dammedsharpe and so youll find in short the new captain came down on the ship like a blight he was especially hard on dodd nothing that commander had done was right nor had he done the contrary would that have been right he was disgracefully behind time and he ought to have put in to the isle of france which would have retarded him his rope bulwarks were lubberly his rudder a disgrace to navigation he robarts was not so green as to believe that any master had really sailed sixteen hundred miles with it and if he had more shame for him briefly a marine criticaster all this was spoken at dodda thing no male does unless he is an awful snoband grieved him it was so unjust he withdrew wounded to the little cabin he was entitled to as a passenger and hugged his treasure for comfort he patted the pocketbook and said to it never you mind the greater tartar he is the less likely to sink you or run you on a lee shore with all his love of discipline robarts was not so fond of the ship as dodd while his repairs were going on he was generally ashore and by this means missed a visit commodore collier one of the smartest sailors afloat espied the yankee makeshift from the quarterdeck of his vessel the salamanca fifty guns in ten minutes he was under the agras stern inspecting it then came on board and was received in form by sharpe and the other officers are you the master of this ship sir he asked no commodore i am the first mate the captain is ashore i am sorry for it i want to talk about his rudder oh he had nothing to do with that replied sharpe eagerly that was our dear old captain he is on board young gentleman ask captain dodd to oblige me by coming on deck hy and mr fullalove too young gentleman inquired collier what the devil officer is that that is a name we give the middies i dont know why nor i neither ha ha dodd and fullalove came on deck and commodore collier bestowed the highest compliments on the makeshift dodd begged him to transfer them to the real inventor and introduced fullalove ay said collier i know you yankees are very handy i lost my rudder at sea once and had to ship a makeshift but it was a cursed complicated thing not a patch upon yours mr fullalove yours is ingenious and simple ship has been in action i see pray how was that if i may be so bold pirates commodore said sharpe we fell in with a brace of portuguese devils lateenrigged and carrying ten guns apiece in the straits of gaspar fought em from noon till sundown riddled one and ran down the other and sunk her in a moment that was all your doing captain so dont try to shift it on other people for we wont stand it if he denies it i wont believe him said collier for he has got it in his eye gentlemen will you do me the honour to dine with me today on board the flagship dodd and fullalove accepted sharpe declined with regret on the score of duty and as the cocked hat went down the side after saluting him politely he could not help thinking to himself what a difference between a real captain who had something to be proud of and his own unlicked cub of a skipper with the manners of a pilotboat he told robarts the next day robarts said nothing but his face seemed to turn greenish and it embittered his hatred of dodd the inoffensive it is droll and sad but true that christendom is full of men in a hurry to hate and a fruitful cause is jealousy the schoolmen or rather certain of the schoolmenfor nothing is much shallower than to speak of all those disputants as one schooldefined woman a featherless biped vehemently addicted to jealousy whether she is more featherless than the male can be decided at a trifling expense of time money and reason you have but to go to court but as for envy and jealousy i think it is pure unobservant antique cant which has fixed them on the female character distinctively as a molehill to a mountain is womens jealousy to mens agatha may have a host of virtues and graces and yet her female acquaintance will not hate her provided she has the moderation to abstain from being downright pretty she may sing like an angel paint like an angel talk write nurse the sick all like an angel and not rouse the devil in her fair sisters so long as she does not dress like an angel but the minds of men being much larger than womens yet very little greater they hang jealousy on a thousand pegs where there was no peg i have seen them do with a pin captain robarts took a pin ran it into his own heart and hung that sordid passion on it he would get rid of all the doddites before he sailed he insulted mr tickell so that he left the service and entered a mercantile house ashore he made several of the best men desert and the ship went to sea short of hands this threw heavier work on the crew and led to many punishments and a steady current of abuse sharpe became a mere machine always obeying never speaking grey was put under arrest for remonstrating against ungentlemanly language and bayliss being at bottom of the same breed as robarts fell into his humour and helped hector the petty officers and men the crew depressed and irritated went through their duties pullyhaulywise there was no song under the forecastle in the first watch and often no grog on the mess table at one bell dodd never came on the quarterdeck without being reminded he was only a passenger and the ship was now under naval discipline i was reared in the royal navy sir would robarts say second lieutenant aboard the atalanta that is the school sir that is the only school that breeds seamen dodd bore scores of similar taunts as a newfoundland puts up with a terrier in office he seldom replied and when he did in a few quiet dignified words that gave no handle robarts who bore the name of a lucky captain had fair weather all the way to st helena the guardship at this island was the salamanca she had left the cape a week before the agra captain robarts with his characteristic goodbreeding went to anchor inshore of her majestys ship the wind failed at a critical moment and a foul became inevitable collier was on his quarterdeck and saw what would happen long before robarts did he gave the needful orders and it was beautiful to see how in half a minute the frigates guns were run in her ports lowered her yards toppled on end and a spring carried out and hauled on the agra struck abreast her own forechains on the salamancas quarter pipe boarders away tomahawks cut everything that holds was heard from the frigates quarterdeck rush came a boarding party on to the merchant ship and hacked away without mercy all her lower rigging that held on to the frigate signal halyards and all others boomed her off with capstan bars c and in two minutes the ships were clear a lieutenant and boats crew came for robarts and ordered him on board the salamanca and to make sure of his coming took him back with them he found commodore collier standing stiff as a ramrod on his quarterdeck are you the master of the agra his quick eye had recognised her in a moment i am sir then she was commanded by a seaman and is now commanded by a lubber dont apply for your papers this week for you wont get them good morning take him away they returned robarts to his ship and a suppressed grin on a score of faces showed him the clear commanding tones of the commodore had reached his own deck he soothed himself by stopping the mens grog and mastheading three midshipmen that same afternoon the night before he weighed anchor this disciplinarian was drinking very late in a low publichouse there was not much moon and the officer in charge of the ship did not see the gig coming till it was nearly alongside then all was done in a flurry hy man the side lanterns there jump you boys or youll catch pepper the boys did jump and little murphy not knowing the surgeon had ordered the ports to be drooped bounded over the bulwarks like an antelope lighted on the midship port which stood at this angle and glanced off into the ocean lantern foremost he made his little hole in the water within a yard of captain robarts that dignity though splashed took no notice of so small an incident as a gone shipboy and if murphy had been wise and stayed with nep all had been well but the poor urchin inadvertently came up again and without the lantern one of the gigs crew grabbed him by the hair and prolonged his existence by an inconsiderate impulse where is the other lantern was robarts first word on reaching the deck as if he didnt know gone overboard sir with the boy murphy stand forward you sir growled robarts murphy stood forward dripping and shivering with cold and fear what dye mean by going overboard with the ships lantern och your arnr sure some unasy divil drooped the port and the lantern and me we had no foothold at all at all and the lantern went into the say bad luck to ut and i went afther to try and save utfor your arnr belay all that said robarts do you think you can blarney me you young monkey here bosens mate take a ropesend and start himagainwarm him wellthats right as soon as the poor childs shrieks subsided into sobs the disciplinarian gave him explanation for ointment i cant have the companys stores expended this way the force of discipline could no farther go than to flog zeal for falling overboard so to avoid anticlimax in that port robarts weighed anchor at daybreak and there was a southwesterly breeze waiting for this favourite of fortune and carried him past the azores off ushant it was westerly and veered to the norwest just before they sighted the lands end never was such a charming passage from the cape the sailor who had the luck to sight old england first nailed his starboard shoe to the mainmast for contributions and all hearts beat joyfullynone more than david dodds his eye devoured the beloved shore he hugged the treasure his own ill luck had jeopardisedbut robarts had sailed it safe into british watersand forgave the man his ill manners for his good luck robarts steered in for the lizard but when abreast the point kept well out again and opened the channel and looked out for a pilot one was soon seen working out towards him and the agra brought to the pilot descended from his lugger into his little boat rowed alongside and came on deck a rough tanned sailor clad in flushing and in build and manner might have passed for robarts twin brother now then you sir what will you take this ship up to the downs for thirty pounds roberts told him roughly he would not get thirty pounds out of him thyse and no higher my bo answered the pilot sturdily he had been splicing the main brace and would have answered an admiral robarts swore at him lustily pilot discharged a volley in return with admirable promptitude robarts retorted the other rough customer rejoined and soon all billingsgate thundered on the agras quarterdeck finding to his infinite disgust his visitor as great a blackguard as himself and not to be outsworn robarts ordered him to quit the ship on pain of being manhandled over the side oh thats it is it growled the other heres fill and be off then he prudently bottled the rest of his rage till he got safe into his boat then shook his fist at the agra and cursed her captain skyhigh you see the fair wind but you dont see the channel fret acoming ye greedy gander downs youll never see them you have saved your money and lost your ship ye lubber robarts hurled back a sugarplum or two of the same and then ordered bayliss to clap on all sail and keep a midchannel course through the night at four bells in the middle watch sharpe in charge of the ship tapped at robarts door blowing hard sir and the weather getting thickish wind fair still yes sir then call me if it blows any harder grunted robarts in two hours more tap tap came bayliss in charge if we dont take sail in theyll take themselves out furl togallensels and call me if it gets any worse in another hour bayliss was at him again blowing a gale sir and a channel fog on reef taupsles and call me if it gets any worse at daybreak dodd was on deck and found the ship flying through a fog so thick that her forecastle was quite invisible from the poop and even her foremast loomed indistinct and looked distant youll be foul of something or other sharpe said he what is that to you inquired a loud rough voice behind him i dont allow passengers to handle my ship then do pray handle her yourself captain is this weather to go tearing happygolucky up the channel i mean to sail her without your advice sir and being a seaman i shall get all i can out of a fair wind that is right captain robarts if you had but the british channel all to yourself perhaps you will leave me my deck all to myself i should be delighted but my anxiety will not let me with this dodd retired a few steps and kept a keen lookout at noon a lusty voice cried land on the weather beam all eyes were turned that way and saw nothing land in sight was reported to captain robarts now that worthy was in reality getting secretly anxious so he ran on deck crying who saw it captain dodd sir ugh nobody else dodd came forward and with a respectful air told him that being on the lookout he had seen the coast of the isle of wight in a momentary lift of the haze isle of fiddlestick was the polite reply isle of wight is eighty miles astern by now dodd answered firmly that he was well acquainted with every outline in the channel and that the land he had seen was st katherines point robarts deigned no reply but had the log heaved it showed the vessel to be running twelve knots an hour he then went to his cabin and consulted his chart and having worked his problem came hastily on deck and went from rashness to wonderful caution turn the hands out and heave the ship to the manoeuvre was executed gradually and ably and scarce a bucketful of water shipped furl taupsles and set the main trysail there mr dodd so much for you and your isle of wight the land you saw was dungeness and you would have run on into the north sea ill be bound when a man habitually calm turns anxious he becomes more irritable and the mixture of timidity and rashness he saw in robarts made dodd very anxious he replied angrily at all events i should not make a foul wind out of a fair one by heaving to and if i did i would heave to on the right tack at this sudden facerone too from a patient manrobarts staggered a moment he recovered and with an oath ordered dodd to go below or he would have him chucked into the hold come dont be an ass robarts said dodd contemptuously then lowering his voice to a whisper dont you know the men only want such an order as that to chuck you into the sea robarts trembled oh if you mean to head a mutiny heaven forbid sir but i wont leave the deck in dirty weather like this till the captain knows where he is towards sunset it got clearer and they drifted past a revenue cutter who was lying to with her head to the northward she hoisted no end of signals but they understood none of them and her captain gesticulated wildly on her deck what is that fantoccio dancing at inquired captain robarts brutally to see a firstclass ship drift to leeward in a narrow sea with a fair wind said dodd bitterly at night it blew hard and the sea ran high and irregular the ship began to be uneasy and robarts very properly ordered the topgallant and royal yards to be sent down on deck dodd would have had them down twelve hours ago the mate gave the order no one moved the mate went forward angry he came back pale the men refused to go aloft they would not risk their lives for captain robarts the officers all assembled and went forward they promised and threatened but all in vain the crew stood sullen together as if to back one another and put forward a spokesman to say that there was not one of them the captain hadnt started and stopped his grog a dozen times he had made the ship hell to them and now her masts and yards and hull might go there along with her skipper for them robarts received this tidings in sullen silence dont tell that dodd whatever you do said he they will come round now they have had their growl they are too near home to shy away their pay robarts had not sufficient insight into character to know that dodd would instantly have sided with him against a mutiny but at this juncture the excaptain of the agra was down in the cabin with his fellowpassengers preparing a general remonstrance he had a chart before him and a pair of compasses in his hand st katherines point lay about eight miles to windward at noon and we have been drifting south and east this twelve hours through lying to on the starboard tack and besides the ship has been conned as slovenly as she is sailed ive seen her allowed to break off a dozen times and gather more leeway ah here is captain robarts captain you saw the rate we passed the revenue cutter that vessel was nearly stationary so what we passed her at was our own rate of drifting and our least rate putting all this together we cant be many miles from the french coast and unless we look sharp and beat to windward i pronounce the ship in danger a horselaugh greeted this conclusion we are nearer yarmouth sands than france i promise you and nothing under our lee nearer than rotterdam a loud cry from the deck above a light on the lee bow there cried robarts with an oath foul of her next through me listening to your nonsense he ran upon deck and shouted through his trumpet all hands wear ship the crew who had heard the previous cry obeyed orders in the presence of an immediate danger and perhaps their growl had really relieved their illhumour robarts with delight saw them come tumbling up and gave his orders lustily brail up the trysel up with the helm in with the weather main brace square the after yards the ships bow turned from the wind and as soon as she got way on her robarts ran below again and entered the cabin triumphant that is all right and now captain dodd a word with you you will either retire at once to your cabin or will cease to breed disaffection in my crew and groundless alarm in my passengers by instilling your own childish ignorant fears the ship has been underlogged a hundred miles sir and but for my caution in lying to for clear weather we should be groping among the fern isl crash an unheardof shock threw the speaker and all the rest in a mass on the floor smashed every lamp put out every light and with a fierce grating noise the ship was hard and fast on the french coast with her stern to the sea one awful moment of silence then amidst shrieks of agony the sea struck her like a rolling rock solid to crush liquid to drown and the comb of a wave smashed the cabin windows and rushed in among them as they floundered on the floor and wetted and chilled them to the marrow a voice in the dark cried o god we are dead men chapter xiv on deck for your lives cried dodd forgetting in that awful moment he was not the captain and drove them all up robarts included and caught hold of mrs beresford and freddy at their cabin door and half carried them with him just as they got on deck the third wave a high one struck the ship and lifted her bodily up canted her round and dashed her down again some yards to leeward throwing them down on the hard and streaming deck at this tremendous shock the ship seemed a live thing shrieking and wailing as well as quivering with the blow but one voice dissented loudly from the general dismay all right men cried dodd firm and trumpetlike she is broadside on now captain robarts look alive sir speak to the men dont go to sleep robarts was in a lethargy of fear at this appeal he started into a fury of ephemeral courage stick to the ship he yelled there is no danger if you stick to the ship and with this snatched a lifebuoy and hurled himself into the sea dodd caught up the trumpet that fell from his hand and roared i command this ship officers come round me men to your quarters come bear a hand here and fire a gun that will show us where we are and let the frenchmen know the carronade was fired and its momentary flash revealed that the ship was ashore in a little bay the land abeam was low and some eighty yards off but there was something black and rugged nearer the ships stern their situation was awful to windward huge black waves rose like tremendous ruins and came rolling fringed with devouring fire and each wave as it charged them curled up to an incredible height and dashed down on the doomed shipsolid to crush liquid to drownwith a ponderous stroke that made the poor souls stagger and sent a sheet of water so clean over her that part fell to leeward and only part came down on deck foretaste of a watery death and each of these fearful blows drove the groaning trembling vessel farther on the sand bumping her along as if she had been but a skiff now it was men showed their inner selves seeing death so near on one hand and a chance of escape on the other seven men proved unable to resist the two great passions of fear and hope on a scale so gigantic and side by side bayliss a midshipman and five sailors stole the only available boat and lowered her she was swamped in a moment many of the crew got to the rum and stupefied themselves to their destruction others rallied round their old captain and recovered their native courage at the brave and hopeful bearing he wore over a heart full of anguish he worked like a horse encouraging commanding doing he loaded a carronade with a pound of powder and a coil of rope with an iron bar attached to a cable and shot the rope and bar ashore a gun was now fired from the guardhouse whose light robarts had taken for a ship but no light being shown any nearer on the coast and the ship expected every minute to go to pieces dodd asked if any one would try to swim ashore with a line made fast to a hawser on board a sailor offered to go if any other man would risk his life along with him instantly fullalove stripped and vespasian next two is enough on such a desperate errand said dodd with a groan but now emulation was up and neither briton yankee nor negro would give way a line was made fast to the sailors waist and he was lowered to leeward his venturesome rivals followed the sea swallowed those three heroes like crumbs and small was the hope of life for them the three heroes being firstrate swimmers and divers and going with the tide soon neared the shore on the ships lee quarter but a sight of it was enough to attempt to land on that rock with such a sea on was to get their skulls smashed like eggshells in a moment they had to coast it looking out for a soft place they found one and tried to land but so irresistible was the suction of the retiring wave that whenever they got foot on the sand and tried to run they were wrenched out to sea again and pounded black and blue and breathless by the curling breaker they met coming in after a score of vain efforts the negro throwing himself on his back went in with a high wave and on touching the sand turned dug all his ten claws into it clenched his teeth and scrambled like a cat at a wall having more power in his toes than the europeans and luckily getting one hand on a firm stone his prodigious strength just enabled him to stick first while the wave went back and then seizing the moment he tore himself ashore but bleeding and bruised all over and with a tooth actually broken by clenching in the convulsive struggle he found some natives dancing about in violent agitation with a rope but afraid to go in and help him and no wonder not being seagulls by the light of their lanterns he saw fullalove washing in and out like a log he seized one end of the rope and dashed in and grabbed his friend and they were hauled ashore together both breathless and fullalove speechless the negro looked round for the sailor but could not see him soon however there was a cry from some more natives about fifty yards off and laterns held up away he dashed with the rope just in time to see jack make a last gallant attempt to land it ended in his being flung up like a straw into the air on the very crest of a wave fifteen feet high and out to sea with his arms whirling and a death shriek which was echoed by every woman within hearing in dashed vespasian with the rope and gripped the drowning mans long hair with his teeth then jerked the rope and they were both pulled ashore with infinite difficulty the goodnatured frenchmen gave them all three lots of vivats and brandy and pats on the back and carried the line for them to a flagstaff on the rocks nearer the stern of the ship the ship began to show the first signs of breaking up hammered to death by the sea she discharged the oakum from her opening seams and her decks began to gape and grin fore and aft corpses of drunken sailors drowned between decks now floated up amidships and washed and rolled about among the survivors feet these seeing no hope went about making up all quarrels and shaking hands in token of a christian end one or two came to dodd with their hands out avast ye lubbers said he angrily do you think i have time for nonsense foksel ahoy axes and cut the weather shrouds it was done the foremast went by the board directly and fell to leeward a few blows of the axe from dodds own hand sent the mainmast after it the agra rose a streak and the next wave carried her a little farther on shore and now the man in charge of the hawser reported with joy that there was a strain on it this gave those on board a hope of life dodd bustled and had the hawser carefully payed out by two men while he himself secured the other end in the mizen top he had left that mast standing on purpose there was no fog here but great heavy black clouds flying about with amazing swiftness extinguished the moon at intervals at others she glimmered through a dull mist in which she was veiled and gave the poor souls on the agra a dim peep of the frail and narrow bridge they must pass to live a thing like a black snake went down from the mizentop bellying towards the yawning sea and soon lost to sight it was seen rising again among some lanterns on the rock ashore but what became of it in the middle the darkness seemed to cut it in two the sea to swallow it yet to get from a ship going to pieces under them the sailors precipitated themselves eagerly on that black thread bellying to the sea and flickering in the wind they went down it one after another and anxious eyes straining after them saw them no more but this was seen that scarce one in three emerged into the lights ashore then dodd got an axe and stood in the top and threatened to brain the first man who attempted to go on the rope we must make it taut first said he bear a hand here with a tackle even while this was being done the other rope whose end he had fired ashore was seen moving to windward the natives it seems had found it half buried in sand dodd unlashed the end from the bulwarks and carried it into the top and made it fast and soon there were two black snakes dipping shrorewards and waving in the air side by side the sailors scrambled for a place and some of them were lost by their own rashness kenealy waited coolly and went by himself finally dodd was left in the ship with mr sharpe and the women and little murphy and ramgolam whom robarts had liberated to show his contempt of dodd he now advised mrs beresford to be lashed to sharpe and himself and venture the passage but she screamed and clung to him and said i dare not oh i dare not then i must lash you to a spar said he for she cant last much longer he ordered sharpe ashore sharpe shook hands with him and went on the rope with tears in his eyes dodd went hard to work lashed mrs beresford to a piece of broken waterbutt filled freds pockets with corks and sewed them up you never caught dodd without a needle only unlike the womens it was always kept threaded mrs beresford threw her arms round his neck and kissed him wildly a way women have in mortal peril it is but their homage to courage all right said dodd interpreting it as appeal to his protection and affecting cheerfulness well get ashore together on the poop awning or somehow never you fear id give a thousand pounds to know where high water is at this moment with a report like a cannon the lower decks burst fore and aft another still louder and the agras back broke she parted amidships with a fearful yawn and the waves went toppling and curling clean through her at this appalling sound and sight the few creatures left on the poop cowered screaming and clinging at dodds knees and fought for a bit of him yes as a flood brings incongruous animals together on some little isle in brotherhood of fearcreatures who never met before without one eating the other and there they cuddleso the thief ramgolam clung to the man he had tried to rob the hindoo ayan and the english maid hustled their mistress the haughty mrs beresford and were hustled by her for a bit of this human pillar and little murphy and fred beresford wriggled in at him where they could and the poor goat crept into the quivering mass trembling like an aspen and not a butt left either in his head or his heart dodd stood in the middle of these tremblers a rock of manhood and when he was silent and they heard only the voice of the waves they despaired and whenever he spoke they started at the astounding calmness of his voice and words and life sounded possible come said he this wont do any longer all hands into the mizentop he helped them all up and stood on the ratlines himself and if you will believe me the poor goat wailed like a child below he found in that new terror and anguish a voice goat was never heard to speak in before but they had to leave him on deck no help for it dodd advised mrs beresford once more to attempt the rope she declined i dare not i dare not she cried but she begged dodd hard to go on it and save himself it was a strong temptation he clutched the treasure in his bosom and one sob burst from the strong man that sob was but the tax paid by nature for pride humanity and manhood stood staunch in spite of it no no i cant said he i mustnt dont tempt me to leave you in this plight and be a cur live or die i must be the last man on her heres something coming out to us the lord in heaven be praised a bright light was seen moving down the black line that held them to the shore it descended slowly within a foot of the billows and lighting them up showed their fearful proximity to the rope in midpassage they had washed off many a poor fellow at that part look at that thank heaven you did not try it said dodd to mrs beresford at tins moment a higher wave than usual swallowed up the light there was a loud cry of dismay from the shore and a wail of despair from the ship no not lost after all the light emerged and mounted and mounted towards the ship it came near and showed the black shiny body of vespasian with very little on but a handkerchief and a lanternthe former round his waist and the latter lashed to his back he arrived with a yah yah and showed his white teeth in a grin mrs beresford clutched his shoulder and whimpered oh mr black iss missy dis child bring good news capn massah fullalove send you his congratulations and the compliments of the season and take the liberty to observe the tide am turn in twenty minutes the good news thus quaintly announced caused an outburst of joy from dodd and sailorlike he insisted on all hands joining in a cheer the shore reechoed it directly and this encouraged the forlorn band still more to hear other hearts beating for them so near even the intervening waves could not quite annul the sustaining power of sympathy at this moment came the first faint streaks of welcome dawn and revealed their situation more fully the vessel lay on the edge of a sandbank she was clean in two the stern lying somewhat higher than the stem the sea rolled through her amidships six feet broad frightful to look at and made a clean breach over her forward all except the bowsprit to the end of which the poor sailors were now discovered to be clinging the afterpart of the poop was out of water and in a corner of it the goat crouched like a rabbit four dead bodies washed about beneath the party trembling in the mizentop and one had got jammed in the wheel face uppermost and glared up at them gazing terrorstricken down no sign of the tide turning yet and much reason to fear it would turn too late for them and the poor fellows shivering on the bowsprit these fears were well founded a huge sea rolled in and turned the forepart of the vessel half over buried the bowsprit and washed the men off into the breakers mrs beresford sank down and prayed holding vespasian by the knee fortunately as in that vessel wrecked long syne on melita the hind part of the ship stuck fast and remained immovable but for how long each wave now struck the ships weather quarter with a sound like a cannon fired in a church and sent the water clear into the mizentop it hit them like strokes of a whip they were drenched to the skin chilled to the bone and frozen to the heart with fear they made acquaintance that hour with death ay death itself has no bitterness that forlorn cluster did not feel only the insensibility that ends that bitterness was wanting now the sea you must know was literally strewed with things out of the agra masts rigging furniture teachests bundles of canes chairs tables but of all this jetsam dodds eye had been for some little time fixed on one object a live sailor drifting ashore on a great wooden case it struck him after a while that the man made very little way and at last seemed to go up and down in one place byandbye he saw him nearer and nearer and recognised him it was one of the three washed off the bowsprit he cried joyfully the tide has turned heres thompson coming out to sea then there ensued a dialogue incredible to landsmen between these two sailors the captain of the ship and the captain of the foretop one perched on a stationary fragment of that vessel the other drifting on a pianoforte and both bawling at one another across the jaws of death thompson ahoy hallo whither bound going out with the tide and be dd to me what cant ye swim like a brass figurehead its all over with poor jack sir all over dont tell me look out now as you drift under our stern and well lower you the fourinch hawser lord bless you sir do pray cried thompson losing his recklessness with the chance of life by this time the shore was black with people and a boat was brought down to the beach but to attempt to launch it was to be sucked out to sea at present all eyes were fixed on thompson drifting to destruction dodd cut the fourinch hawser and vespasian on deck lowered it with a line so that thompson presently drifted right athwart it all right sir said he grasping it and amidst thundering acclamations was drawn to land full of salt water and all but insensible the piano landed at dunkirk three weeks later in the bustle of this good and smart action the tide retired perceptibly byandbye the sea struck lower and with less weight at p m dodd took his little party down on deck again being now the safest place for the mast might go it was a sad scene the deck was now dry and the dead bodies lay quiet around them with glassy eyes and grotesquely horrible the long hair of two or three was stiff and crystallised with the saltpetre in the ship mrs beresford clung to vespasian she held his bare black shoulder with one white and jewelled hand and his wrist with the other tight oh mr black said she how brave you are it is incredible why you came back i must feel a brave man with both my hands or i shall die your skin is nice and soft too i shall never outlive this dreadful day and now that the water was too low to wash them off the hawser several of the ships company came back to the ship to help the women down by noon the agras deck was thirty feet from the sand the rescued ones wanted to break their legs and necks but dodd would not permit even that he superintended the whole manoeuvre and lowered first the dead then the living not omitting the poor goat who was motionless and limp with fright when they were all safe on the sand dodd stood alone upon the poop a minute cheered by all the sailors french and english ashore then slid down a rope and rejoined his companions to their infinite surprise the undaunted one was found to be snivelling oh dear what is the matter said mrs beresford tenderly the poor agra maam she was such a beautiful seaboat and just look at her now never sail again never never she was a little crank in beating i cant deny it but how she did fly with the wind abaft she sank a pirate in the straits and weathered a hurricane off the mauritius and after all for a lubber to go and lay her bones ashore in a fair wind poor dear beauty he maundered thus and kept turning back to look at the wreck till he happened to lay his hand on his breast he stopped in the middle of his ridiculous lament wore a look of selfreproach and cast his eyes upward in heartfelt gratitude the companions of so many adventures dispersed a hospitable mayoress entertained mrs beresford and suite and she took to her bed for she fell seriously ill as soon as ever she could do it with impunity colonel kenealy went off to paris ill gain that any way by being wrecked said he if there be a lover of quadrupeds here let him know that billys weakness proved his strength being brandied by a goodnatured french sailor he winked his eye being brandied greatly he staggered up and butted his benefactor like a man fullalove had dry clothes and a blazing fire ready for dodd at a little rude auberge he sat over it and dried a few banknotes he had loose about him and examined his greater treasure his childrens the pocketbook was much stained but no harm whatever done to the contents in the midst of this employment the shadow of an enormous head was projected right upon his treasure turning with a start he saw a face at the window one of those vile mugs which are found to perfection amongst the canaille of the french nationbloated bleareyed grizzly and wildbeast like the ugly thing on being confronted passed slowly out of the sun and dodd thought no more of it the owner of this sinister visage was andre thibout of whom it might be said like face like life for he was one of those illomened creatures who feed upon the misfortunes of their kind and stand on shore in foul weather hoping the worst instead of praying for the best briefly a wrecker he and his comrade jacques moinard had heard the agras gun fired and came down to batten on the wreck but ho at the turn of the tide there were gensdarmes and soldiers lining the beach and the bayonet interposed between theft and misfortune so now the desperate pair were prowling about like hungry baffled wolves curses on their lips and rage at their hearts dodd was extremely anxious to get to barkington before the news of the wreck for otherwise he knew his wife and children would suffer a years agony in a single day the only chance he saw was to get to boulogne in time to catch the nancy sailing packet for it was her day but then boulogne was eight leagues distant and there was no public conveyance going fullalove entering heartily into his feelings was gone to look for horses to hire aided by the british consul the black hero was upstairs clearing out with a pin two holes that had fallen into decay for want of use these holes were in his ears and now worn out by anxiety and hard work dodd began to nod in his chair by the fire he had not been long asleep when the hideous face of thibout reappeared at the window and watched him presently a low whistle was uttered outside and soon the two ruffians entered the room and finding the landlady there as well as dodd called for a little glass apiece of absinthe while drinking it they cast furtive glances towards dodd and waited till she should go about her business and leave them alone with him but the good woman surmised their looks and knowing the character of the men poured out a cup of coffee from a great metal reservoir by the fire and waked dodd without ceremony voici votre cafe monsieur making believe he had ordered it merci madame replied he for his wife had taught him a little french one may sleep mal a propos muttered the woman in his ear my man is at the fair and there are people here who are not worth any great things dodd rubbed his eyes and saw those two foul faces at the end of the kitchen for such it was though called salle a manger humph said he and instinctively buttoned his coat at that thibout touched moinards knee under the table fullalove came in soon after to say he had got two horses and they would be here in a quarter of an hour well but vespasian how is he to go inquired dodd oh well send him on ahead and then ride and tie no no said dodd ill go ahead that will shake me up i think i should tumble off a horse im so dead sleepy accordingly he started to walk on the road to boulogne he had not been gone three minutes when moinard sauntered out moinard had not been gone two minutes when thibout strolled out moinard kept dodd in sight and thibout kept moinard the horses were brought soon after but unfortunately the pair did not start immediately though had they known it every moment was precious they wasted time in argument vespasian had come down with a diamond ring in one ear and a ruby in the other fullalove saw this retrograde step and said grimly have you washed but half your face or is this a return to savagery vespasian wore an air of offended dignity no sar these yar decorations come off a lady ob i cibilisation missy beresford donated em me says she massah blackyah yah she always nicknominates dis child massa blackwhile i was praying goramighty for self and pickaninny i seen you out of one corner of my eye admirationing my rings den just you take em says dat ar aristocracy for i dont admirationise em none ive been shipwrecked so i took em wid incredible condescension and dat ar beautiful lady says to me oh get along wid your nonsense about coloured skins i have inspectionated your conduct massa black and likewise your performances on the slack rope says she in time of shipwreck and darn me says she but you are a man you are no missy says i superciliously dis child am not a man if you please but a coloured gemman he added he had put them in his ears because the biggest would not go on his little finger fullalove groaned and of course the next thing youll ring your snout like a pig or a patagonian there come along ye darndanomaly he was going to say cuss but remembering his pupils late heroic conduct softened it down to anomaly but vespasian always measured the force of words by their length or obscurity anomaly cut him to the heart he rode off in moody silence and dejection asking himself sorrowfully what he had done that such a mountain of vituperation should fall on him anomaly they cantered along in silence for fullalove was digesting this new trait in his pupil and asking himself could he train it out or must he cross it out just outside the town they met captain robarts walking in he had landed three miles off down the coast hallo said fullalove i suppose you thought i was drowned said robarts spitefully but you see im alive still fullalove replied well captain that is only one mistake more youve made i reckon about two english miles from the town they came to a long straight slope up and down where they could see a league before them and there they caught sight of david dodds tall figure mounting the opposite rise behind him at some little distance were two men going the same way but on the grass by the roadside whereas david was on the middle of the road he walks well for jacky tar said fullalove iss sar said vespasian sulkily but dis analogy tink he not walk so fast as those two behind him cos they catch him up now vespasian had hardly uttered these words when a thing occurred so sudden and alarming that the speakers eyes protruded and he was dumfounded a moment the next a loud cry burst from both him and his companion at once and they lashed their horses to the gallop and went tearing down the hill in a fury of rage and apprehension mr fullalove was right i think a sailor is seldom a smart walker but dodd was a cricketer you know as well he swung along at a good pace and in high spirits he had lost nothing but a few clothes and a quadrant and a chronometer it was a cheap wreck to him and a joyful one for peril past is present delight he had saved his life and what he valued more his childrens money never was that dear companion of his perils so precious to him as now one might almost fancy that by some strange sympathy he felt the immediate happiness of his daughter depended on it many in my day believe that human minds can thus communicate overleaping material distances not knowing i cant say however no such solution is really needed here all the members of a united and loving family feel together and work togetherwithout specific concertthough hemispheres lie between it is one of the beautiful traits of true family affection now the dodds father mother sister brother were more one in heart and love than any other family i ever saw woe to them if they had not david then walked towards boulogne that afternoon a happy man already he tasted by anticipation the warm caresses of his wife and children and saw himself seated at the hearth with those beloved ones clustering close round him how would he tell them its adventuresits dangers from piratesits loss at seaits recoveryits wreckits coming ashore dry as a bone and conclude by taking it out of his bosom and dropping it in his wifes lap with cheer boys cheer trudging on in this delightful reverie his ear detected a pitpat at some distance behind him he looked round with very slight curiosity and saw two men coming up even in that hasty glance he recognised the foulface of andre tiribout a face not to be forgotten in a day i dont know how it was but he saw in a moment that face was after him to rob him and he naturally enough concluded it was their object and he was without a weapon and they were doubtless armed indeed thibout was swinging a heavy cudgel poor dodds mind went into a whirl and his body into a cold sweat in such moments men live a year to gain a little time he walked swiftly on pretending not to have noticed them but oh his eyes roved wildly to each side of the road for a chance of escape he saw none to his right was a precipitous rock to his left a profound ravine with a torrent below and the sides scantily clothed with firtrees and bushes he was in fact near the top of a long rising ground called la mauvaise cote on account of a murder committed there two hundred years ago presently he heard the men close behind him at the same moment he saw at the side of the ravine a flint stone about the size of two fists he made but three swift strides snatched it up and turned to meet the robbers drawing himself up high and showing fight in every inch the men were upon him his change of attitude was so sudden and fiery that they recoiled a step but it was only for a moment they had gone too far to retreat they divided and thibout attacked him on his left with uplifted cudgel and moinard on his right with a long glittering knife the latter to guard his head from the stone whipped off his hat and held it before his head but dodd was what is called left handed ambidexter would be nearer the mark he carved and wrote with his right hand heaved weights and flung cricketballs with his left he stepped forward flung the stone in thibouts face with perfect precision and that bitter impetus a good thrower lends at the moment of delivery and almost at the same moment shot out his right hand and caught moinard by the throat sharper and fiercer collision was never seen than of these three thibouts face crashed his blood squirted all round the stone and eight yards off lay that assailant on his back moinard was more fortunate he got two inches of his knife into dodds left shoulder at the very moment dodd caught him in his righthand vice and now one vengeful hand of iron grasped him felly by the throat another seized his knife arm and twisted it back like a childs he kicked and struggled furiously but in half a minute the mighty english arm and iron fingers held the limp body of jacques moinard with its knees knocking temples bursting throat relaxed eyes protruding and livid tongue lolling down to his chin a few seconds more and with the same stalwart arm that kept his relaxed and sinking body from falling dodd gave him one fierce whirl round to the edge of the road then put a foot to his middle and spurned his carcase with amazing force and fury down the precipice crunch crunch it plunged from tree to tree from bush to bush and at last rolled into a thick bramble and there stuck in the form of a crescent but dodd had no sooner sent him headlong by that mighty effort than his own sight darkened his head swam and after staggering a little way he sank down in a state bordering on insensibility meantime fullalove and vespasian were galloping down the opposite hill to his rescue unfortunately andre thibout was not dead nor even mortally wounded he was struck on the nose and mouth that nose was flat for the rest of his life and half of his front teeth were battered out of their sockets but he fell not from the brain being stunned but the body driven to earth by the mere physical force of so momentous a blow knocked down like a ninepin he now sat up bewildered and found himself in a pool of blood his own he had little sensation of pain but he put his hand to his face and found scarce a trace of his features and his hand came away gory he groaned rising to his feet he saw dodd sitting at some distance his first impulse was to fly from so terrible an antagonist but as he made for the ravine he observed that dodd was in a helpless condition wounded perhaps by moinard and where was moinard nothing visible of him but his knife that lay glittering in the road thibout with anxious eye turned towards dodd kneeled to pick it up and in the act a drop of his own blood fell on the dust beside it he snarled like a wounded tiger spat out halfadozen teeth and crept on tiptoe to his safe revenge awake from your lethargy or you are a dead man no thibout got to him unperceived and the knife glittered over his head at this moment the air seemed to fill with clattering hoofs and voices and a pistolshot rang dodd heard and started and so saw his peril he put up his left hand to parry the blow but feebly luckily for him thibouts eyes were now turned another way and glaring with stupid terror out of his mutilated visage a gigantic mounted fiend with black face and white gleaming rolling eyes was coming at him like the wind uttering horrid howls thibout launched himself at the precipice with a shriek of dismay and went rolling after his comrade but ere he had gone ten yards he fell across a young larchtree and hung balanced up came the foaming horses fullalove dismounted hastily and fired three deliberate shots down at thibout from his revolver he rolled off and never stopped again till he splashed into the torrent and lay there staining it with blood from his battered face and perforated shoulder vespasian jumped off and with glistening eyes administered some good brandy to dodd he unconscious of his wound a slight one relieved their anxiety by assuring them somewhat faintly he was not hurt but that ever since that tap on the head he got in the straits of gaspar any angry excitement told on him made his head swim and his temples seem to swell from the inside i should have come off secondbest but for you my dear friends shake hands over it do o lord bless you lord bless you both as for you vespasian i do think you are my guardian angel why this is the second time youve saved my life no it isnt for its the third now you git along massa capn said vespasian you berry good man ridicalous good man and dis child arnt no gardening angel at all he ar a darned anatomy with such a look of offended dignity at fullalove after examining the field of battle and comparing notes they mounted dodd on vespasians horse and walked quietly till dodds head got better and then they cantered on three abreast vespasian in the middle with one sinewy hand on each horses mane and such was his muscular power that he often relieved his feet by lifting himself clean into the air and the rest of the time his toe but touched the ground and he sailed like an ostrich and grinned and chattered like a monkey sad to relate neither thibout nor moinard was ended the guillotine stood on its rights meantime what was left of them crawled back to the town stiff and sore and supped togethermoinard on liquids onlyand vowed revenge on all wrecked people the three reached boulogne in time for the nancy and put dodd on board the pair decided to go to the yankee paradiseparis they parted with regret and tenderly like old tried friends and vespasian told dodd with tears in his eyes that though he was in point of fact only a darned anemo he felt like a coloured gemman at parting from his dear old captain the master of the nancy knew dodd well and gave him a nice cot to sleep in he tumbled in with a bad headache and quite worn out and never woke for fifteen hours and when he did wake he was safe at barkington he and it landed on the quay he made for home on the way he passed hardies bank a firm synonymous in his mind with the bank of england a thrill of joy went through him now it was safe when he first sewed it on in china it seemed secure nowhere except on his own person but since then the manifold perils by sea and land it had encountered through being on him had caused a strong reaction in his mind on that point he longed to see it safe out of his own hands and in good custody he made for hardies door with a joyful rush waved his cap over his head in triumph and entered the bank with it ah chapter xv chronologythe hard cash sailed from canton months before the boat race at henley recorded in chapter i but it landed in barkington a fortnight after the last home event i recorded in its true series now this fortnight as it happens was fruitful of incidents and must be dealt with at once after that love and cash the converging branches of this story will flow together in one stream alfred hardie kept faith with mrs dodd and by an effort she appreciated forbore to express his love for julia except by the pen he took in lloyds shipping news and got it down by rail in hopes there would be something about the agra then he could call at albion villa mrs dodd had given him that loophole meantime he kept moping for an invitation which never came julia was now comparatively happy and so indeed was alfred but then the male of our species likes to be superlatively happy not comparatively and that mrs dodd forgot or perhaps had not observed one day sampson was at albion villa and alfred knew it now though it was a point of honour with poor alfred not to hang about after julia until her fathers return he had a perfect right to lay in wait for sampson and hear something about her and he was so deep in love that even a word at secondhand from her lips was a drop of dew to his heart so he strolled up towards the villa he had nearly reached it when a woman ran past him making the most extraordinary sounds i can only describe it as screaming under her breath though he only saw her back he recognised mrs maxley one back differeth from another whatever you may have been told to the contrary in novels and plays he called to her she took no notice and darted wildly through the gate of albion villa alfreds curiosity was excited and he ventured to put his head over the gate but mrs maxley had disappeared alfred had half a mind to go in and inquire if anything was the matter it would be a good excuse while he hesitated the diningroom window was thrown violently up and sampson looked out hy hardie my good fellow for heavens sake a fly and a fast one it was plain something very serious had occurred so alfred flew towards the nearest flystand on the way he fell in with a chance fly drawn up at a publichouse he jumped on the box and drove rapidly towards albion villa sampson was hobbling to meet himhe had sprained his ankle or would not have asked for a conveyanceto save time he got up beside alfred and told him to drive hard to little friar street on the way he explained hurriedly mrs maxley had burst in on him at albion villa to say her husband was dying in torment and indeed the symptoms she gave were alarming and if correct looked very like lockjaw but her description had been cut short by a severe attack which choked her and turned her speechless and motionless and white to the very lips oho sis i bristpang and at such a time ye know but these women are as unseasonable as they are unreasonable now angina pictoris or bristpang is not curable

interest have i in their lives they never pay but ye see customs second nature an dive formed a vile habit ive got to be a healer among the killers an da triton amongthe millers here we are at last hiven be praised and he hopped into the house faster than most people can run on a good errand alfred flung the reins to a cad and followed him the room was nearly full of terrified neighbours sampson shouldered them all roughly out of his way and there on a bed lay maxleys gaunt figure in agony his body was drawn up by the middle into an arch and nothing touched the bed but the head and the heels the toes were turned back in the most extraordinary contortion and the teeth set by the rigour of the convulsion and in the mans white face and fixed eyes were the horror and anxiety that so often show themselves when the body feels itself in the grip of death mr osmond the surgeon was there he had applied a succession of hot cloths to the pit of the stomach and was trying to get laudanum down the throat but the clenched teeth were impassable he now looked up and said politely ah dr sampson i am glad to see you here the seizure is of a cataleptic nature i apprehend the treatment hitherto has been hot epithems to the abdomen and here sampson who had examined the patient keenly and paid no more attention to osmond than to a fly buzzing interrupted him as unceremoniously poisoned said he philosophically poisoned screamed the people poisoned cried mr osmond in whose little list of stereotyped maladies poisoned had no place is there any one you have reason to suspect i dont suspect nor conject sir i know the man is poisoned the substance strychnine now stand out of the way you gaping gabies and let me work hy young oxford you are a man get behind and hold both his arms for your life thats you he whipped off his coat laid hold of osmonds epithems chucked them across the room saying you may just as well squirt rosewater at a house on fire drenched his handkerchief with chloroform sprang upon the patient like a mountain cat and chloroformed him with all his might attacked so skilfully and resolutely maxley resisted little for so strong a man but the potent poison within fought virulently as a proof the chloroform had to be renewed three times before it could produce any effect at last the patient yielded to the fumes and became insensible then the arched body subsided and the rigid muscles relaxed and turned supple sampson kneaded the man like dough by way of comment it is really very extraordinary said osmond maidearrsirr nothings extraornary t a man that knows the reason of iverything he then inquired if any one in the room had noticed at what intervals of time the pains came on i am sorry to say it is continuous said osmond maidearrsirr nothing on airth is continuous iverything has paroxysms and remissionsfrom a toothache t a cancer he repeated his query in various forms till at last a little girl squeaked out ifyouplease sir the throes do come about every ten minutes for i was a looking at the clock i carries father his dinner at twelve if you please maam theres half a guinea for you for not being such an ijjit as the rest of the world especially the dockers and he jerked her half a sovereign a stupor fell on the assembly they awoke from it to examine the coin and see if it was real or only yellow air maxley came to and gave a sigh of relief when he had been insensible yet out of pain nearly eight minutes by the clock sampson chloroformed him again ill puzzle ye my friend strych said he how will ye get your perriodical paroxysms when the man is insensible the dox say y act direct on the spinal marrow well theres the spinal marrow where you found it just now act on it again my lad i give ye leaveif ye can ye cant bekase ye must pass through the brain to get there and i occupy the brain with a swifter ajint than y are and mean to keep y out of it till your power to kill evaporates being a vigitable with this his spirits mounted and he indulged in a harmless and favourite fiction he feigned the company were all males and medical students osmond included and he the lecturer now jintlemen said he obsairve the great therey of the perriodeecity and remitteney of all disease in conjunckshin with its practice all diseases have paroxysms and remissions which occur at intervals sometimes its a year sometimes a day an hour ten minutes but whatever th interval they are true to it they keep time only when the disease is retirin the remissions become longer the paroxysms return at a greater interval and just the revairse when the pashint is to die this jintlemen is mans life from the womb to the grave the throes that precede his birth are remittent like ivery thing else but come at diminished intervals when he has really made up his mind to be born his first mistake sirs but not his last and the paroxysms of his mortal disease come at shorter intervals when he is really goon off the hooks but still chronometrically just as watches keep time whether they go fast or slow now jintlemen isnt this a beautiful therey oh mercy oh good people help me oh jesus christ have pity on me and the sufferers body was bent like a bow and his eyes filled with horror and his toes pointed at his chin the doctor hurled himself on the foe come said he smell to this lad thats right he is better already jintlemen or he couldnt howl ye know deevil a howl in um before i gave um puff chlorofm ah would ye would ye oh oh oh oh ughah the doctor got off the insensible body and resumed his lecture calmly like one who has disposed of some childish interruption and now to th application of the therey if the poison can reduce the tin minutes interval to five minutes this pashint will die and if i can get the tin minutes up t half hour this pashint will live any way jintlemen we wont detain y unreasonably the case shall be at an end by one oclock on hearing this considerate stipulation up went three womens aprons to their eyes alack poor james maxley he is at his last hour it be just gone twelve and a dies at one sampson turned on the weepers who says that y ijjits i said the case would end at one a case ends when the pashint gets well or dies oh that is good news for poor susan maxley her man is to be well by one oclock doctor says sampson groaned and gave in he was strong but not strong enough to make the populance suspend an opinion yet methinks it might be done by chloroforming them the spasms came at longer intervals and less violent and maxley got so fond of the essence of insensibility that he asked to have some in his own hand to apply at the first warning of the horrible pains sampson said any fool can complete the cure and by way of practical comment left him in mr osmonds charge but with an understanding that the treatment should not be varied that no laudanum should be given but in due course a stiff tumbler of brandy and water or two if he gets drunk all the better a little intoxication weakens the bodys memory of the pain it has endured and so expedites the cure now off we go to th other the bodys memory said mr osmond to himself what on earth does the quack mean the driver de jure of the fly was not quite drunk enough to lose his horse and vehicle without missing them he was on the look out for the robber and as alfred came round the corner full pelt darted at the reins with a husky remonstrance and alfred cut into him with the whip an angry explanationa guineaand behold the driver sitting behind complacent and nodding arrived at albion villa alfred asked sampson submissively if he might come in and see the wife cured why of course said sampson not knowing the delicate position then ask me in before mrs dodd murmured alfred coaxingly oo ay said the doctor knowingly i see mrs maxley was in the diningroom she had got well of herself but was crying bitterly and the ladies would not let her go home yet they feared the worst and that some one would blurt it out to her to this anxious trio entered sampson radiant there its all right come little maxley ye neednt cry he has got lots more mischief to do in the world yet but o wumman it is lucky you came to me and not to any of the tinkering dox no more cat and dog for you and him but for the chronothairmal therey and you may bless my puppys four bones too he ran and stole a fly like a man and drove hilterskilter now if i had got to your house two minutes later your jamie would have lairned the great secret ere this he threw up the window haw you come away and receive the applause due from beauty t ajeelity alfred came in timidly and was received with perfect benignity and selfpossession by mrs dodd but julias face was dyed with blushes and her eyes sparkled the eloquent praise she was ashamed to speak before them all but such a face as her scarce needed the help of a voice at such a time and indeed both the lovers faces were a pretty sight and a study how they stole loving glances but tried to keep within bounds and not steal more than three per minute and how unconscious they endeavoured to look the intervening seconds and what windows were the demure complacent visages they thought they were making shutters of innocent love has at least this advantage over melodramatic that it can extract exquisite sweetness out of so small a thing these sweethearts were not alone could not open their hearts must not even gaze too long yet to be in the same room even on such terms was a taste of heaven but dear heart said mrs maxley ye dont tell me what he ailed maam if you had seen him you would have said he was taken for death pray what is the complaint inquired mrs dodd oh didnt i tell ye poisoned this intelligence was conveyed with true scientific calmness and received with feminine ejaculations of horror mrs maxley was indignant into the bargain dont ye go giving my house an ill name we keeps no poison sampson fixed his eyes sternly on her wumman ye know better ye keep strychnine for th use and delectation of your domestic animal strychnine i never heard tell of it is that latin for arsenic now isnt this lamentable why arsenic is a mital strychnine a vigitable nhist me your man was here seeking strychnine to poison his mouse a harmless domistic necessary mouse i told him mice were a part of nature as much as maxleys and life as sweet tit as tim but he was dif to scientific and chrisehin preceps so i told him to go to the deevil i will sis he and went t a docker the two assassins have poisoned the poor beastie between em and thin been the greatest miser in the world except one he will have roasted his victim and ate her on the sly imprignated with strychnine ill steal a march on tother miser sis he and thats you t his brain flew the strychnine his brain sint it to his spinal marrow and we found my lorrd bent like a bow and his jaw locked and nearer knowin the great secret than any man in england will be this year to live and sairves the assassinating old vagabin right heaven forgive you doctor said mrs maxley half mechanically for curin a murrderer not likely mrs maxley who had shown signs of singular uneasiness during sampsons explanation now rose and said in a very peculiar tone she must go home directly mrs dodd seemed to enter into her feelings and made her go in the fly taking care to pay the fare and the driver out of her own purse as the woman got into the fly sampson gave her a piece of friendly and practical advice nixt time he has a mind to breakfast on strychnine you tell me and ill put a pinch of arsenic in the saltcellar and cure him safe as the bank but this time hed have been did and stiff long before such a slow ajint as arsenic could get a hold on um they sat down to luncheon but neither alfred nor julia fed much except upon sweet stolen looks and soon the active sampson jumped up and invited alfred to go round his patients alfred could not decline but made his adieux with regret so tender and undisguised that julias sweet eyes filled and her soft hand instinctively pressed his at parting to console him she blushed at herself afterwards but at the time she was thinking only of him maxley and his wife came up in the evening with a fee they had put their heads together and proffered one guinea man and wife be one flesh you know doctor said the rustic miser sampson whose natural choler was constantly checked by his humour declined this profuse proposal heres vanity said he now do you really think your two lives are worth a guinea why its pence farthings the pair affected disappointmentvilely at all events he must accept this basket of gudgeons maxley had brought along being poisoned was quite out of maxleys daily routine and had so unsettled him that he had got up and gone fishingto the amazement of the parish sampson inspected the basket why they are only fish said he i was in hopes they were pashints he accepted the gudgeons and inquired how maxley got poisoned it came out that mrs maxley seeing her husband set apart a portion of his welsh rabbit had grizzled and asked what that was for and being told for the mouse and to mind her own business had grizzled still more and furtively conveyed a portion back into the pan for her masters own use she had been quaking dismally all the afternoon at what she had done but finding maxleyhard but justdid not attack her for an involuntary fault she now brazened it out and said men didnt ought to have poison in the house unbeknown to their wives jem had got no more than he worked for c but like a woman she vowed vengeance on the mouse whereupon maxley threatened her with the marital correction of necktwisting if she laid a finger on it my eyes be open now to what a poor creature do feel as dies poisoned let her a be theres room in our place for her and we next day he met alfred and thanked him with warmth almost with emotion there aint many in barkington as ever done me a good turn master alfred you be one on em you comes after the captain in my book now alfred suggested that his claims were humble compared with sampsons no no said maxley going down to his whisper and looking monstrous wise doctor didnt go out of his business for me you did the sage misers gratitude had not time to die a natural death before circumstances occurred to test it on the morning of that eventful day which concluded my last chapter he received a letter from canada his wife was out with eggs so he caught little rose sutton that had more than once spelled an epistle for him and she read it out in a loud and reckless whine at noon this very daie muster hardies agent aguent dis dis hon honoured dishonouredabill and sayed here she made a full stop then on to the next verse there were no more asses mercy on us but it cant be asses wench drive your spead intot again assets assets ah go an go an now fatther if you leave a shilling shilling at hardies after this blame bleam your self not me for this is the waie the rogues rogews all break they go at a distance distance first and then at home whuoame dear fatther lawk o daisy what ails you daddy maxley you be as white as a sunday smock be you poisoned again if you please worse than thatworse groaned maxhey trembling all over hushhold your tongue give me that letter dont you never tell nobody nothing of what you have been a reading to me and illillits only jems fun he is allus running his rigsthats a good wench now and ill give ye a halfpenny la daddy said the child opening her eyes i never heeds what i reads i be wrapped up in the spelling dear heart what a sight of long words folks puts in a letter more than ever drops out of their mouths which their fingers be longer than their tongues i do suppose maxley hailed thus information characteristically then well say no more about the halfpenny at this rose raised a lamentable cry and pearly tears gushed forth there there said maxley deprecatingly heres two apples for ye ye cant get them for less and a halfpenny or a haporth is all one to you but it is a great odds to me and apples they rot halfpence dont it was now nine oclock the bank did not open till ten but maxley went and hung about the door to be the first applicant as he stood there trembling with fear lest the bank should not open at all he thought hard and the result was a double resolution he would have his money out to the last shilling and this done would button up his pockets and padlock his tongue it was not his business to take care of his neighbours nor to blow the hardies if they paid him his money on demand so not a word to my missus nor yet to the towncrier said he ten oclock struck and the bank shutters remained up five minutes more and the watcher was in agony three minutes more and up came a boy of sixteen whistling and took down the shutters with an indifference that amazed him bless your handsome face said maxley with a sigh of relief he now summoned up all his firmness and having recourse to an art in which these shrewd rustics are supreme made his face quite inexpressive and so walked into the bank the everyday maxley externally but within a volcano ready to burst if there should be the slightest hesitation to pay him his money good morning mr maxley said young skinner good morning sir what can we do for you oh ill wait my turn sir well it is your turn now if you like how much have you got of mine if you please sir your balance ill see nine hundred and four pounds well sir then if you please ill draa that it has come thought skinner what going to desert us he stammered no said the other trembling inwardly but not moving a facial muscle it is only for a day or two sir ah i see going to make a purchase bythebye i believe mr hardie means to offer you some grounds he is buying outside the town will that suit your book i dare say it will sir then perhaps you will wait till our governor comes in i have no objection he wont be long fine weather for the gardens mr maxley moderate sir ill take my money if you please counting it out that will help pass the time till muster hardie comes you hant made away with it what dye mean sir hardies baint turned thieves be they are you mad or intoxicated mr maxley neither sir but i wants my own and i wool have it too so count out on this here counter or ill cry the town round that there door henry score james maxleys name off the books said skinner with cool dignity but when he had said this he was at his wits end there were not nine hundred pounds of hard cash in the bank nor anything like it chapter xvi skinnercalled young because he had once had a father on the premiseswas the molecatcher the feelings with which he had now for some months watched his master grubbing were curiously mingled there was the grim sense of superiority every successful detective feels as he sees the watched one working away unconscious of the eye that is on him but this was more than balanced by a long habit of obsequious reverence when a has been looking up to b for thirty years he cannot look down on him all of a sudden merely because he catches him falsifying accounts why man is a cooking animal bankrupt man especially and then richard hardie overpowered skinners senses he was dignity in person he was six feet two and always wore a black surtout buttoned high and a hat with a brim a little broader than his neighbours yet not broad enough to be eccentric or slang he moved down the street touching his hatwhile other hats were lifted high to hima walking volume of cash and when he took off this ebon crown and sat in the bank parlour he gained in appearance more than he lost for then his whole head was seen long calm majestic that senatorial front and furrowed face overawed all comers even the little sharpfaced clerk would stand and peep at it utterly puzzled between what he knew and what he eyed nor could he look at that head and face without excusing them what a lot of money they must have sunk before they came down to fabricating a balancesheet and byandbye custom somewhat blunted his sense of the dishonesty and he began to criticise the thing arithmetically instead of morally that view once admitted he was charmed with the ability and subtlety of his dignified sharper and so the molecatcher began gradually but effectually to be corrupted by the mole he who watches a dishonest process and does not stop it is half way towards conniving who connives is half way towards abetting the next thing was skinner felt mortified at his master not trusting him did he think old bob skinners son would blow on hardie after all these years this rankled a little and set him to console himself by admiring his own cleverness in penetrating this great distrustful man now of all sentiments vanity is the most restless and the surest to peep out skinner was no sooner inflated than his demure obsequious manner underwent a certain change slight and occasional only but hardie was a subtle man and the perilous path he was treading made him wonderfully watchful suspicious and sagacious he said to himself what has come to skinner i must know so he quietly watched his watcher and soon satisfied himself he suspected something amiss from that hour skinner was a doomed clerk it was two oclock hardie had just arrived and sat in the parlour catolike and cooking skinner was in high spirits it was owing to his presence of mind the bank had not been broken some hours ago by maxley so now while concluding his work he was enjoying by anticipation his employers gratitude he cant hold aloof after this said skinner he must honour me with his confidence and i will deserve it i do deserve it a grave calm passionless voice invited him into the parlour he descended from his desk and went in swelling with demure complacency he found mr hardie seated garbling his accounts with surpassing dignity the great man handed him an envelope and cooked majestic on a wave of that imperial hand and skinner had mingled with the past for know that the envelope contained three things a cheque for a months wages a character and a dismissal very polite and equally peremptory skinner stood paralysed the complacency died out of his face and rueful wonder came instead it was some time before he could utter a word at last he faltered turn me away sir turn away noah skinner your father would never have said such a word to my father skinner uttered this his first remonstrance in a voice trembling with awe but gathered courage when he found he had done it yet lived mr hardie evaded his expostulation by a very simple means he made no reply but continued his work dignified as brutus inexorable as fate cool as cucumber skinners anger began to rise he watched mr hardie in silence and said to himself curse you you were born without a heart he waited however for some sign of relenting and hoping for it the water came into his own eyes but hardie was impassive as ice then the little clerk mortified to the core as well as wounded ground his teeth and drew a little nearer to this incarnate arithmetic and said with an excess of obsequiousness will you condescend to give me a reason for turning me away all in a moment after fiveandthirty years faithful services men of business do not deal in reasons was the cool reply it is enough for you that i give you an excellent character and that we part good friends that we do not replied skinner sharply if we stay together we are friends but we part enemies if we do part as you please mr skinner i will detain you no longer and mr hardie waved him away so grandly that he started and almost ran to the door when he felt the handle it acted like a prop to his heart he stood firm and rage supplied the place of steady courage he clung to the door and whispered at his mastersuch a whisper so loud so cutting so full of meaning and malice it was like a serpent hissing at a man but ill give you a reason a good reason why you had better not insult me so cruel and what is more ill give you two and one is that but for me the bank must have closed this day at ten oclockay you may stare it was i saved it not youand the other is that if you make an enemy of me you are done for i know too much to be made an enemy of sira great deal too much at this mr hardie raised his head from his book and eyed his crouching venomous assailant full in the face majestically as one can fancy a lion rearing his ponderous head and looking lazily and steadily at a snake that has just hissed in a corner each word of skinners was a barbed icicle to him yet not a muscle of his close countenance betrayed his inward suffering one thing however even he could not master his blood it retired from that stoical cheek to the chilled and foreboding heart and the sudden pallor of the resolute face told skinner his shafts had gone home come sir said he affecting to mingle good fellowship with his defiance why bundle me off these premises when you will be bundled off them yourself before the week is out you insolent scoundrel humph explain mr skinner ah what have i warmed your marble up a bit yes ill explain the bank is rotten and cant last fortyeight hours oh indeed blighted in a dayby the dismissal of mr noah skinner do not repeat that after you have been turned into the streets or you will be indicted at present we are confidential anything more before you quit the rotten bank yes sir plenty ill tell you your own history past present and to come the road to riches is hard and rugged to the likes of me but your good father made it smooth and easy to you sir you had only to take the money of a lot of fools that fancy they cant keep it themselves invest it in consols and exchequer bills live on half the profits put by the rest and roll in wealth but this was too slow and too sure for you you must be rothschild in a day so you went into blind speculation and flung old mr hardies savings into a well and now for the last eight months you have been doctoring the ledgerhardie winced just perceptiblyyou have put down our gains in white our losses in black and so you keep feeding your pocketbook and empty our tills the pear will soon be ripe and then you will let it drop and into the bankruptcy court we go but what you forget fraudulent bankruptcy isnt the turnpike way of trade it is a broad road but a crooked one skirts the prison wall sir and sights the herringpond an agony went across mr hardies great face and seemed to furrow as it ran not but what you are all right sir resumed his little catlike tormentor letting him go a little way to nail him again byandbye you have cooked the books in time and cocker was a fool to you twill be all down in black and white great sacrifices no reserve creditors take everything dividend fourpence in the pound furniture of house and bank mrs hardies portrait and down to the coalscuttle bankrupt saves nothing but his honour andthe six thousand pounds or so he has stitched into his old greatcoat hands his new one to the official assignees like an honest man hardie uttered something between a growl and a moan now comes the per contra poor little despised noah skinner has kept genuine books while you have been preparing false ones i took the real figures home every afternoon on loose leaves and bound em and very curious they will read in court alongside of yours i did it for amusement o nights im so solitary and so fond of figures i must try and turn them to profit for im out of place now in my old age dearee me how curious that you should go and pick out me of all men to turn into the streetlike a doglike a doglike a dog hardie turned his head away and in that moment of humiliation and abject fear drank all the bitterness of moral death his manhood urged him to defy skinner and return to the straight path cost what it might but how could he his own books were all falsified he could place a true total before his creditors by simply adding the contents of his secret hoard to the assets of the bank but with this true arithmetical result he could not square his books except by conjectural and fabricated details which would be detected and send him to prison for who would believe he was lying in figures only to get back to the truth no he had entangled himself in his own fraud and was at the mercy of his servant he took his line skinner it was your interest to leave me whilst the bank stood then you would have got a place directly but since you take umbrage at my dismissing you for your own good i must punish youby keeping you i am quite ready to stay and serve you sir replied skinner hastily and as for my angry words think no more of them it went to my heart to be turned away at the very time you need me most hypocritical rogue thought hardie that is true skinner said he i do indeed need a faithful and sympathising servant to advise support and aid me ask yourself whether any man in england needs a confidant more than i it was bitter at first to be discovered even by you but now i am glad you know all for i see i have undervalued your ability as well as your zeal thus mr hardie bowed his pride to flatter skinner and soon saw by the little fellows heightened colour that this was the way to make him a clerk of wax the banker and his clerk were reconciled then the latter was invited to commit himself by carrying on the culinary process in his own hand he trembled a little but complied and so became an accomplice on this his master took him into his confidence and told him everything it was impossible to hide from him and now sir said skinner let me tell you what i did for you this morning then perhaps you wont wonder at my being so peppery maxley suspects he came here and drew out every shilling i was all in a perspiration what to do but i put a good face on and skinner then confided to his principal how he had evaded maxley and saved the bank and the stratagem seemed so incredible and droll that they both laughed over it long and loud and in fact it turned out a firstrate practical jest cost two lives while they were laughing the young clerk looked in and said captain dodd to speak with you sir captain dodd and all mr hardies forced merriment died away and his face betrayed his vexation for once did you go and tell him i was here yes sir i had no orders and he said you would be sure to see him unfortunate well you may show him in when i ring your bell the youngster being gone mr hardie explained to his new ally in a few hurried words the danger that threatened him from miss julia dodd and now said he the women have sent her father to soften his i shall be told his girl will die if she cant have my boy c as if i care who lives or dies on this skinner got up all in a hurry and offered to go into the office on no account said mr hardie sharply i shall make my business with you the excuse for cutting this lovenonsense mighty short take your book to the desk and seem buried in it he then touched the bell and both confederates fell into an attitude never were a pair so bent over their little accountslies like themselves instead of the heartbroken father their comedy awaited in came the gallant sailor with a brown cheek reddened by triumph and excitement and almost shouted in a genial jocund voice how dye do sir it is a long time since i came across your hawse and with this he held out his hand cordially hardie gave his mechanically and remained on his guard but somewhat puzzled dodd shook his cold hand heartily well sir here i am just come ashore and visiting you before my very wife what dye think of that i am highly honoured sir said hardie then rather stiffly and incredulously and to what may i owe this extraordinary preference will you be good enough to state the purport of this visitbrieflyas mr skinner and i are much occupied the purport why what does one come to a banker about i have got a lot of money i want to get rid of hardie stared but was as much on his guard as ever only more and more puzzled then david winked at him with simple cunning took out his knife undid his shirt and began to cut the threads which bound the cash to his flannel at this skinner wheeled round on his stool to look and both he and mr hardie inspected the unusual pantomime with demure curiosity dodd next removed the oilskin cover and showed the pocketbook brought it down with a triumphant smack on the hollow of his hand and in the pride of his heart the joy of his bosom and the fever of his bloodfor there were two red spots on his cheek all the timetold the cold pair its adventures in a few glowing words the calcutta firmthe two piratesthe hurricanethe wreckthe landsharkshe had saved it from and here it is safe in spite of them all but i wont carry it on me any more it is unlucky so you must be so good as to take charge of it for me sir very well captain dodd you wish it placed to mrs dodds account i suppose no no i have nothing to do with that this is between you and me as you please ye see it is a good lump sir oh indeed said hardie a little sneeringly i call it a thundering lot o money but i suppose it is not much to a rich banker like you then he lowered his voice and said with a certain awe itsfourteenthousand pounds fourteen thousand pounds cried hardie then with sudden and consummate coolness why certainly an established bank like this deals with more considerable deposits than that skinner why dont you give the captain a chair no no said dodd ill heaveto till i get this off my mind but i wont anchor anywhere but at home he then opened the pocketbook and spread the contents out before mr hardie who ran over the notes and bills and said the amount was l s d dodd asked for a receipt why it is not usual when there is an account dodds countenance fell oh i should not like to part with it unless i had a receipt you mistake me said hardie with a smile an entry in your bankers book is a receipt however you can have one in another form he then unlocked a desk took out a bankers receipt and told skinner to fill it in this done he seemed to be absorbed in some more important matter skinner counted the notes and left them with mr hardie the bills he took to his desk to note them on the back of the receipt whilst he was writing this with his usual slowness and precision poor dodds heart overflowed it is my childrens fortune ye see i dont look on a sixpence of it as mine that it is what made me so particular it belongs to my little julia bless hershe is a rosebud if ever there was one and oh such a heart and so fond of her poor father but not fonder than he is of herand to my dear boy edward he is the honestest young chap you ever saw what he says you may swear to with your eyes shut but how could they miss either good looks or good hearts and her children the best wife and the best mother in england she has been a true consort to me this many a year and i to her in deep water and shoal let the wind blow high or low here is a simple simon vaunting his own flesh and blood no wonder that little gentleman there is grinning at me well grin away lad perhaps you havent got any children but you have sir and you know how it is with us fathers our hearts are so full of the little darlings out it must come you can understand how joyful i feel at saving their fortune from landsharks and seasharks and landing it safe in an honest mans hands like you and your father before you skinner handed him the receipt he cast his eye over it all right little gentleman now my heart is relieved of such a weight i feel to have just cleared out a cargo of bricks goodbye shake hands i wish you were as happy as i am i wish all the world was happy god bless you god bless you both and with this burst he was out of the room and making ardently for albion villa the banker and his clerk turned round on their seats and eyed one another a long time in silence and amazement was this thing a dream their faces seemed to ask then mr hardie rested his senatorial head on his hand and pondered deeply skinner too reflected on this strange freak of fortune and the result was that he burst in on his principals reverie with a joyful shout the bank is saved hardies is good for another hundred years the banker started for skinners voice sounded like a pistolshot in his ear so high strung was he with thought hush hush he said and pondered again in silence at last he turned to skinner you think our course is plain i tell you it is so dark and complicated it would puzzle solomon to know what is best to be done save the bank sir whatever you do how can i save the bank with a few thousand pounds which i must refund when called on you look keenly into what is under your eye skinner but you cannot see a yard beyond your nose let me think after a while he took a sheet of paper and jotted down the materials as he called them and read them out to his accomplice a bank too far gone to be redeemed if i throw this money into it i shall ruin captain dodd and do myself no good but only my creditors miss julia dodd virtual proprietor of this l or of the greater part if i choose the child that marries first usually jockeys the other alfred hardie my son and my creditor deep in love with no and at present somewhat alienated from me by my thwarting a silly love affair which bids fair to improve into a sound negotiation the l paid to me personally after banking hours and not entered on the banking books nor known but to you and me now suppose i treat this advance as a personal trust the bank breaks the money disappears consternation of the dodds who until enlightened by the public settlement will think it has gone into the well in that interval i talk alfred over and promise to produce the l intact with my paternal blessing on him and miss dodd provided he will release me from my debt to him and give me a life interest in half the money settled on him by my wifes father to my most unjust and insolent exclusion their passion will soon bring the young people to reason and then they will soon melt the old ones skinner was struck with this masterly little sketch but he detected one fatal flaw you dont say what is to become of me oh i havent thought of that yet but do think of it sir that i may have the pleasure of cooperating it would never do for you and me to be pulling two ways you know i will not forget you said hardie wincing under the chain this little wretch held him with and had jerked him by way of reminder but surely skinner you agree with me it would be a sin and a shame to rob this honest captain of his moneyfor my creditorscurse them ah you are not a father how quickly he found that out well i am and he touched me to the quick i love my little jane as dearly as he loves his julia every bit and i feel for him and then he put me in mind of my own father poor man that seems strange doesnt it a sailor and a banker ah it was because they were both honest men yes it was like a wholesome flower coming into a close room and then out again and heaving a whiff behind was that sailor he left the savour of probity and simplicity behind though he took the things themselves away again why why couldnt he leave us what is more wanted here than even his money his integrity the pearl of price that my father whom i used to sneer at carried to his grave and died simple but wise honest but richrich in money in credit in honour and eternal hopes oh skinner skinner i wish i had never been born skinner was surprised he was not aware that intelligent men who sin are subject to fits of remorse nay more he was frightened for the emotion of this iron man so hard to move was overpowering when it came it did not soften it convulsed him dont talk so sir said the little clerk keep up your heart have a drop of something you are right said mr hardie gloomily it is idle to talk we are all the slaves of circumstances with this he unlocked a safe that stood against the wall chucked the l in and shammed the iron door sharply and as it closed upon the cash with a clang the parlour door burst open as if by concert and david dodd stood on the threshold looking terrible his ruddy colour was all gone and he seemed black and white with anger and anxiety and out of this blanched yet lowering face his eyes glowed like coals and roved keenly to and fro between the banker and the clerk a thundercloud of a man chapter xvii james maxley came out of the bank that morning with nine hundred and four pounds buttoned up tight in the pocket of his leather breeches a joyful man and so to his work and home at one oclock to dinner at pm he was thoughtful uneasy at wretched at he was gardener as well as capitalist and mr hardie owed him s for work such is human nature in general and maxleys in particular that the l in pocket seemed small and the s in jeopardy large i cant afford to go with the creditors argued maxley dividend on s why that will be about thirty pence the change for a hard halfcrown ie a halfcrown in one piece he stuck his spade in the soil and made for his debtors house as he came up the street dodd shot out of the bank radiant and was about to pass him without notice full of his wife and children but maxley stopped him with a right cordial welcome and told him he had given them all a fright this time what is it over the town already that my ship has been wrecked and dodd looked annoyed wrecked no but you have been due this two months ye know wrecked why captain you havent ever been wrecked and he looked him all over as if he expected to see wrecked branded on him by the elements ay james wrecked on the french coast and lost my chronometer and a tiptop sextant but what of that i saved it i have just landed it in the bank goodbye i must sheer off i long to be home stay a bit captain said maxley i am not quite easy in my mind i saw you come out of hardies i thought in course you had been in to draa but you says different now what was it you did leave behind you at that there shop if you please not money not money only l how the man stares why its not mine james its my childrens there goodbye and he was actually off this time but maxley stretched his long limbs and caught him in two strides and griped his shoulder without ceremony be you mad said he sternly no but i begin to think you are that is to be seen said maxley gravely before i lets you go you must tell me whether you be jesting or whether you have really been so simple as to drop fourteenthousandpounds at hardies no judge upon the bench nor bishop in his stall could be more impressive than this gardener was when he subdued the vast volume of his voice to a low grave utterance of this sort dodd began to be uneasy why good heavens there is nothing wrong with the old barkington bank nothing wrong roared maxley then whispered holt i was laad once for slander and cost me thirty pounds nearly killed my missus it did man cried dodd for my childrens sake tell me if you know anything amiss after all im like a stranger here more than two years away at a time ill tell you all i know whispered maxley tis the least i can do what roaring doyouthinkive forgotten you saving my poor boy out o that scrape and getting him a good place in canada andwhy hed have been put in prison but for you and that would ha broken my heart and his mothersand the stout voice began to quaver oh bother all that now said dodd impatiently the bank you have grounded me on thorns well ill tell ye but you must promise faithful not to go and say i told ye or youll get me laad again and i likes to laa them not for they to laa me i promise i promise well then i got a letter today from my boy him as you was so good to and here tis in my breechespocketlaws how things do come round surely why lookee here now if so be you hadnt been a good friend to he he wouldnt be where he is and if so be he warnt where he is he couldnt have writ me this here and then where should you and i be belay your jaw and show me this letter cried david trembling all over that i wool said maxley diving a hand into his pocket hush lookee yander now if there aint master alfred awatching of us two out of his window and he have got an eye like a hawk he have step in the passage captain and ill show it to you he drew him aside into the passage and gave him the letter dodd ran his eye over it hastily uttered a cry like a wounded lion dropped it gave a slight stagger and rushed away maxley picked up his letter and watched dodd into the bank again and reflected on his work his heart was warmed at having made a return to the good captain his head suggested that he was on the road which leads to libel but he had picked up at the assizes a smattering of the law of evidence so he coolly tore the letter in pieces there now said he to himself if hardies do laa me for publishing of this here letter why they pours their water into a sieve ugh and with this exclamation he started and then put his heavy boot on part of the letter and ground it furtively into the mud for a light hand had settled on his shoulder and a keen young face was close to his it was alfred hardie who had stolen on him like a cat im laad thought maxley maxley old fellow said alfred in a voice as coaxing as a womans are you in a good humour well master halfred sight of you mostly puts me in one especially after that there strychnine job then tell me whispered alfred his eyes sparkling and his face beaming who was that you were talking to just now was itwasnt itwho was it chapter xviii while dodd stood lowering in the doorway he was nevertheless making a great effort to control his agitation at last he said in a stern but low voice in which however a quick ear might detect a tremor of agitation i have changed my mind sir i want my money back at this though davids face had prepared him mr hardies heart sank but there was no help for it he said faintly certainly may i ask and there he stopped for it was hardly prudent to ask anything no matter replied dodd his agitation rising even at this slight delay come my money i must and will have it hardie drew himself up majestically captain dodd this is a strange way of demanding what nobody here disputes well i beg your pardon said dodd a little awed by his dignity and fairness but i cant help it the quick supple banker saw the slight advantage he had gained and his mind went into a whirl what should he do it was death to part with this money and gain nothing by it sooner tell dodd of the love affair and open a treaty on this basis he clung to this money like limpet to its rock and so intense and rapid were his thoughts and schemes how to retain it a little longer that davids apologies buzzed in his ear like the drone of a beetle the latter went on to say you see sir its my childrens fortune my boy edwards and my little julias and so many have been trying to get it from me that my blood boils up in a moment about it nowmy poor headyou dont seem to understand what i am saying there then i am a sailor i cant go beating and tacking like you landsmen with the wind dead astern the long and the short is i dont feel it safe here dont feel it safe anywhere except in my wifes lap so no more words heres your receipt give me my money certainly captain dodd call tomorrow morning at the bank and it will be paid on demand in the regular way the bank opens at ten oclock no no i cant wait i should be dead of anxiety before then why not pay it me here and now you took it here we receive deposits till four oclock but we do not disburse after three this is the system of all banks that is all nonsense if you are open to receive money you are open to pay it my dear sir if you were not entirely ignorant of business you would be aware that these things are not done in this way money received is passed to account and the cashier is the only person who can honour your draft on it but stop if the cashier is in the bank we may manage it for you yet skinner run and see whether he has left and if not send him to me directly the cashier took his cue and ran out david was silent the cashier speedily returned saying with a disappointed air the cashier has been gone this quarter of an hour david maintained an ominous silence that is unfortunate remarked hardie but after all it is only till tomorrow morning still i regret this circumstance sir and i feel that all these precautions we are obliged to take must seem unreasonable to you but experience dictates this severe routine and were we to deviate from it our friends money would not be so safe in our hands as it always has been at present david eyed him sternly but let him run on when he had concluded his flowing periods david said quietly so you cant give me my own because your cashier has carried it away hardie smiled no no but because he has locked it up and carried away the key it is not in this room then no are you sure positive what not in that safe of yours there certainly not said hardie stoutly open the safe the keys are in it open the safe what for to show me it is not in the righthand partition of that safe there there and david pointed at the very place where it was the dignified mr hardie felt ready to sink with shame a kind of shudder passed through him and he was about to comply heartsick but then wounded pride and the rage of disappointment stung him and he turned in defiance you are impertinent sir and i shall not reward your curiosity and your insolence by showing you the contents of my safe my money my money cried david fiercely no more words for i shant listen to them i know you now for what you area thief i saw you put it into that safe a liar is always a thief you want to steal my childrens money ill have your life first my money ye pirate or ill strangle you and he advanced upon him purple with rage and shot out his long threatening arm and brown fingers working in the air dye know what i did to a french landshark that tried to rob me of it i throttled him with these fingers till his eyes and his tongue started out of him he came for my childrens money and i killed him sososoas ill kill you you thief you liar you scoundrel his face black and convulsed with rage and his outstretched fingers working convulsively and hungering for a rogues throat made the resolute hardie quake he whipped out of the furious mans way and got to the safe pale and trembling hush no violence he gasped ill give you your money this moment you ruffian while he unlocked the safe with trembling hands dodd stood like a man petrified his arm and fingers stretched out and threatening and skinner saw him pull at his necktie furiously like one choking hardie got the notes and bills all in a hurry and held them out to dodd in which act to his consternation and surprise and indignation he received a backhanded blow on the eye that dazzled him for an instant and there was david with his arms struggling wildly and his fists clenched his face purple and his eyes distorted so that little was seen but the whites the next moment his teeth gnashed loudly together and he fell headlong on the floor with a concussion so momentous that the windows rattled and the room shook violently the dust rose in a cloud a loud ejaculation burst from hardie and skinner and then there was an awful silence chapter xix when david fell senseless on the floor mr hardie was somewhat confused by the backhanded blow from his convulsed and whirling arm but skinner ran to him held up his head and whipped off his neckcloth then hardie turned to seize the bell and ring for assistance but skinner shook his head and said it was useless this was no faint old betty could not help him it is a bad days work sir said he trembling he is a dead man dead heaven forbid apoplexy whispered skinner run for a doctor then lose no time dont let us have his blood on our hands dead and he repeated the word this time in a very different tone a tone too strange and significant to escape skinners quick ear however he laid davids head gently down and rose from his knees to obey what did he see now but mr hardie with his back turned putting the notes and bills softly into the safe again out of sight he saw comprehended and took his own course with equal rapidity come run cried mr hardie ill take care of him every moment is precious wants to get rid of me thought skinner no sir said he be ruled by me let us take him to his friends he wont live and we shall get all the blame if we doctor him already egotism had whispered hardie how lucky if he should die and now a still guiltier thought flashed through him he did not try to conquer it he only trembled at himself for entertaining it at least give him air said he in a quavering voice consenting to a crime yet compromising with his conscience feebly he threw the window open with great zealwith prodigious zeal for he wanted to deceive himself as well as skinner with equal parade he helped carry dodd to the window it opened on the ground this done the selfdeceivers put their heads together and soon managed matters so that two porters known to skinner were introduced into the garden and informed that a gentleman had fallen down in a fit and they were to take him home to his friends and not talk about it there might be an inquest and that was so disagreeable to a gentleman like mr hardie the men agreed at once for a sovereign apiece it was all done in a great hurry and agitation and while skinner accompanied the men to see that they did not blab mr hardie went into the garden to breathe and think but he could do neither he must have a look at it he stole back opened the safe and examined the notes and bills he fingered them they seemed to grow to his finger he lusted after them he said to himself the matter has gone too far to stop i must go on borrowing this money of the dodds and make it the basis of a large fortune it will be best for all parties in the end he put it into his pocketbook that pocketbook into his breastpocket and passed by his private door into the house and to his dressingroom ten minutes later he left the house with a little black bag in his band chapter xx what will ye give me and ill tell ye said maxley to alfred hardie five pounds that is too much five shillings then that is too little lookee here your garden owes me thirty shillings for work suppose you pays me and that will save me from going to your dad for it alfred consented readily and paid the money then maxley told him it was captain dodd he had been talking with i thought so i thought so cried alfred joyfully but i was afraid to believe it it was too delightful maxley youre a trump you dont know what anxiety you have relieved me of some fool has gone and reported the agia wrecked look here and he showed him his lloyds luckily it has only just come so i havent been miserable long well to be sure news flies fast nowadays he have been wrecked for that matter he then surprised alfred by telling him all he had just learned from dodd and was going to let out about the l when he recollected this was the bankers son and while he was talking to him it suddenly struck maxley that this young gentleman would come down in the world should the bank break and then the dodds he concluded judging others by himself would be apt to turn their backs on him now he liked alfred and was disposed to do him a good turn when he could without hurting james maxley mr alfred said he i know the world better than you do you be ruled by me or youll rue it you put on your sunday coat this minute and off like a shot to albyn villee youll get there before the captain he have got a little business to do first that is neither here nor there besides you are young and lissom you be the first to tell missus dodd the good news and when the captain comes there sits you aside miss julee and dont you be shy and shamefaced take him when his heart is warm and tell him why you are there i love her dear says you he be only a sailor and they never has no sense nor prudence he is amost sure to take you by the hand at such a time and once you get his word hell stand good to his own hurt hes one of that sort bless his silly old heart a good deal of this was unintelligible to alfred but the advice seemed goodadvice generally does when it squares with our own wishes he thanked maxley left him made a hasty toilet and ran to albion villa sarah opened the door to him in tears the news of the wreck had come to albion villa just half an hour ago and in that half hour they had tasted more misery than hitherto their peaceful lot had brought them in years mrs dodd was praying and crying in her room julia had put on her bonnet and was descending in deep distress and agitation to go down to the quay and learn more if possible alfred saw her on the stairs and at sight of her pale agitated face flew to her she held out both hands piteously to him o alfred good news he panted he is alivemaxley has seen himi have seen himhe will be here directlymy own love dry your eyescalm your fearshe is safehe is well hurrah hurrah the girls pale face flushed red with hope then pale again with emotion then rosy red with transcendent joy oh bless you bless you she murmured in her sweet gurgle so full of heart then took his head passionately with both her hands as if she was going to kiss him uttered a little inarticulate cry of love and gratitude over him then turned and flew up the stairs crying mamma mamma and burst into her mothers room when two such impetuosities meet as alfred and julia expect quick work what happened in mrs dodds room may be imagined and soon both ladies came hastily out to alfred and he found himself in the drawingroom seated between them and holding a hand of each and playing the man delightfully soothing and assuring them julia believed him at a word and beamed with unmixed delight and anticipation of the joyful meeting mrs dodd cost him more trouble her soft hand trembled still in his and she put question upon question but when he told her he with his own eyes had seen captain dodd talking to maxley and gathered from maxley he had been shipwrecked on the coast of france and lost his chronometer and his sextant these details commanded credit bells were rung the captains dressingroom ordered to be got ready the cook put on her mettle and alfred invited to stay and dine with the longexpected one and the house of mourning became the house of joy and then it was he who brought the good news whispered julia to her mother and that is so sweet yes dear said mrs dodd he will make even me love him the l i hope that was not lost in the wreck oh mamma who cares when his own dear sweet precious life has been in danger and is mercifully preserved why does he not come i shall scold him for keeping us waiting you know i am not a bit afraid of him though he is papa indeed i am ashamed to say i govern him with a rod ofno matter what do do do let us all three put on our bonnets and run and meet him i want him so to love somebody the very first day mrs dodd said well wait a few minutes and then if he is not here you two shall go i dare hardly trust myself to meet my darling husband in the open street julia ran to alfred if he does not come in ten minutes you and i may go and meet him you are an angel murmured alfred you are another said julia haughtily oh dear i cant sit down and i dont want flattery i want papa a waltz a waltz then one can go mad with joy without startling propriety i cant answer for the consequences if i dont let off a little little happiness that i will said mrs dodd for i am as happy as you and happier she played a waltz julias eyes were a challenge alfred started up and took her ready hand and soon the gay young things were whirling round the happiest pair in england but in the middle of the joyous whirl julias quick ear on the watch all the time heard the gate swing to she glided like an eel from alfreds arm and ran to the window arrived there she made three swift vertical bounds like a girl with a skipping rope only her hands were clapping in the air at the same time then down the stairs screaming his chest his chest he is coming coming come alfred ran after her mrs dodd unable to race with such antelopes slipped quietly out into the little balcony julia had seen two men carrying a trestle with a tarpauling over it and a third walking beside dodds heavy seachest had been more than once carried home this way she met the men at the door and overpowered them with questions is it his clothes then he wasnt so much wrecked after all is he with you is he coming directly why dont you tell me the porters at first wore the stolid impassive faces of their tribe but when this bright young creature questioned them brimming over with ardour and joy their countenances fell and they hung their heads the little sharpfaced man who was walking beside the others stepped forward to reply to julia he was interrupted by a terrible scream from the balcony mrs dodd was leaning wildly over it with dilating eyes and quivering hand that pointed down to the other side of the trestle julia julia julia ran round and stood petrified her pale lips apart and all her innocent joy frozen in a moment the tarpauling was scanty there and a mans hand and part of his arm dangled helpless out the hand was blanched and wore a wellknown ring chapter xxi in the terror and confusion no questions were then asked alfred got to davids head and told skinner to take his feet mrs dodd helped and they carried him up and laid him on her bed the servant girls cried and wailed and were of little use mrs dodd hurried them off for medical aid and she and julia though pale as ghosts and trembling in every limb were tearless and almost silent and did all for the best they undid a shirt button that confined his throat they set his head high and tried their poor little eaudecologne and feminine remedies and each of them held an insensible hand in both hers clasping it piteously and trying to hold him tight so that death should not take him away from them my son where is my son sighed mrs dodd alfred threw his arm round her neck you have one son here what shall i do the next minute he was running to the telegraph office for her at the gate he found skinner hanging about and asked him hurriedly how the calamity had happened skinner said captain dodd had fallen down senseless in the street and he had passed soon after recognised him and brought him home i have paid the men sir i wouldnt let them ask the ladies at such a time oh thank you thank you skinner i will repay you it is me you have obliged and alfred ran off with the words in his mouth skinner looked after him and muttered i forgot him it is a nice mess wish i was out of it and he went back hanging his head to alfreds father mr osmond met him skinner turned and saw him enter the villa mr osmond came softly into the room examined dodds eye felt his pulse and said he must be bled at once mrs dodd was averse to this oh let us try everything else first said she but osmond told her there was no other remedy all the functions we rely on in the exhibition of medicines are suspended dr short now drove up and was ushered in mrs dodd asked him imploringly whether it was necessary to bleed but dr short knew his business too well to be entrapped into an independent opinion where a surgeon had been before him he drew mr osmond apart and inquired what he had recommended this ascertained he turned to mrs dodd and said i advise venesection or cupping oh dr short pray have pity and order something less terrible dr sampson is so averse to bleeding sampson sampson never heard of him it is the chronothermal man said osmond oh ah but this is too serious a case to be quacked coma with stertor and a full bounding pulse indicates liberal bloodletting i would try venesection then cup if necessary or leech the temple i need not say sir calomel must complete the cure the case is simple and at present surgical i leave it in competent hands and he retired leaving the inferior practitioner well pleased with him and with himself no insignificant part of a physicians art when he was gone mr osmond told mrs dodd that however crotchety dr sampson might be he was an able man and had very properly resisted the indiscriminate use of the lancet the profession owed him much but in apoplexy the leech and the lancet are still our sheetanchor mrs dodd utter a faint shriek apoplexy oh david oh my darling have you come home for this osmond assured her apoplexy was not necessarily fatal provided the cerebral bloodvessels were relieved in time by depletion the fixed eye and terrible stertorous breathing on the one hand and the promise of relief on the other overpowered mrs dodds reluctance she sent julia out of the room on a pretext and then consented with tears to davids being bled but she would not yield to leave the room no this tender woman nerved herself to see her husbands blood flow sooner than risk his being bled too much by the hard hand of custom let the peevish fools who make their own troubles in love compare their slight and merited pangs with this she was his true lover and his wife yet there she stood with eye horrorstricken yet unflinching and saw the stab of the little lancet and felt it deeper than she would a javelin through her own body and watched the blood run that was dearer to her than her own at the first prick of the lancet david shivered and as the blood escaped his eye unfixed and the pupils contracted and dilated and once he sighed good sign that said osmond oh that is enough sir said mrs dodd we shall faint if you take any more osmond closed the vein observing that a local bleeding would do the rest when he had staunched the blood mrs dodd sank half fainting in her chair by some marvellous sympathy it was she who had been bled and whose vein was now closed osmond sprinkled water on her face she thanked him and said sweetly you see i could not have lost any more when it was over she came to tell julia she found her sitting on the stairs crying and pale as marble she suspected and there was alfred hanging over her and in agony at her grief out came his love for her in words and accents unmistakable and this in osmonds hearing and the maids oh hush hush cried poor mrs dodd and her face was seen to burn through her tears and this was the happy quiet little villa of my opening chapters ah richard hardie richard hardie the patient was cupped on the nape of the neck by mr osmond and on the glasses drawing showed signs of consciousness and the breathing was relieved these favourable symptoms were neither diminished nor increased by the subsequent application of the cupping needles we have turned the corner said mr osmond cheerfully rap rap rap came a telegraphic message from dr sampson and was brought up to the sickroom out visiting patients when yours came in apoplexy with a red face and stertorous breathing put the feet in mustard bath and dash much cold water on the head from above on revival give emetic cure with sulphate of quinine in apoplexy with a white face treat as for a simple faint here emetic dangerous in neither apoplexy bleed coming down by train this message added to mrs dodds alarm the whole treatment varied so far from what had been done she faltered her misgivings osmond reassured her not bleed in apoplexy said he superciliously why it is the universal practice judge for yourself you see the improvement mrs dodd admitted it then as to the cold water said osmond i would hardly advise so rough a remedy and he is going on so well but you can send for ice and meantime give me a goodsized stocking he cut and fitted it adroitly to the patients head then drenched it with eaudecologne and soon the head began to steam byandbye david muttered a few incoherent words and the anxious watchers thanked god aloud for them at length mr osmond took leave with a cheerful countenance and left them all grateful to him and with a high opinion of his judgment and skill especially julia she said dr sampson was very amusing to talk to but she should be sorry to trust to that rash reckless boisterous man in time of danger about two in the morning a fly drove rapidly up to the villa and sampson got out he found david pale and muttering and his wife and children hanging over him in deep distress he shook hands with them in silence and eyed the patient keenly he took the nightcap off removed the pillows lowered his head and said quietly this is the cold fit come on we must not shut our eyes on the pashint why what is this he has been cupped and sampson changed colour and his countenance fell mrs dodd saw and began to tremble i could not hear from you and dr short and mr osmond felt quite sure and he seems better oh dr sampson why were you not here we have bled him as well oh dont dont dont say it was wrong he would have died they said so oh david david your wife has killed you and she knelt and kissed his hand and implored his pardon insensible julia clung sobbing to her mother in a vain attempt to comfort her sampson groaned no no said he dont go on so my poor soul you did all for the best and now we must make the best of what is done hartshorn brandy and caution for those two assassins have tied my hands while applying these timid remedies he inquired if the cause was known they told him they knew nothing but that david had been wrecked on the coast of france and had fallen down senseless in the street a clerk of mr hardies had recognised him and brought him home so alfred said then the cause is mintil said sampson unless he got a blow on the hid in bein wrecked he then examined davids head carefully and found a long scar but this is not it said he this is old mrs dodd clasped her hands and assured him it was new to her her david had no scar there when he left her last pursuing his examination sampson found an open wound in his left shoulder he showed it them and they were all as pale as the patient in a moment he then asked to see his coat and soon discovered a corresponding puncture in it which he examined long and narrowly it is a stabwith a oneedged knife there was a simultaneous cry of horror dont alarm yourselves for that said sampson it is nothing a mere fleshwound it is the veinwound that alarms me this school knows nothing about the paroxysms and remissions of disease they have bled and cupped him for a passing fit it has passed into the cold stage but no quicker than it would have done without stealing a drop of blood tomorrow by diseases nature he will have another hot fit in spite of their bleeding then those ijjits would leech his temples and on that paroxysm remitting by the nature of the disease would fancy their leeches had cured it the words were the old words but the tone and manner was so different no shouting no anger all was spoken low and gently and with a sort of sad and weary and wornout air he ordered a kettle of hot water and a quantity of mustard and made his preparations for the hot fit as he called it maintaining the intermittent and febrile character of all disease the patient rambled a good deal but quite incoherently and knew nobody but about eight oclock in the morning he was quite quiet and apparently sleeping so mrs dodd stole out of the room to order some coffee for sampson and edward they were nodding worn out with watching julia whose highstrung nature could dispense with sleep on such an occasion was on her knees praying for her father suddenly there came from the bed like a thunderclap two words uttered loud and furiously hardie villain up started the drowsy watchers and rubbed their eyes they had heard the sound but not the sense julia rose from her knees bewildered and aghast she had caught the strange words distinctlywords that were to haunt her night and day they were followed immediately by a loud groan and the stertorous breathing recommenced and the face was no longer pale but flushed and turgid on this sampson hurried julia from the room and with edwards help placed david on a stool in the bath and getting on a chair discharged half a bucket of cold water on his head the patient gasped another and david shuddered stared wildly and put his hand to his head a third and he staggered to his feet at this moment mrs dodd coming hastily into the room he looked steadily at her and said lucy she ran to throw her arms round him but sampson interfered gently gently said he we must have no violent emotions oh no i will be prudent and she stood quiet with her arms still extended and cried for joy they got david to bed again anti sampson told mrs dodd there was no danger now from the malady but only from the remedies and in fact david fell into a state of weakness and exhaustion and kept muttering unintelligibly dr short called in the morning and was invited to consult with dr sampson he declined dr sampson is a notorious quack no physician of any eminence will meet him in consultation i regret that resolution said mrs dodd quietly as it will deprive me of the advantage of your skill dr short bowed stifly i shall be at your service madam when that empiric has given the patient up and he drove away osmond finding sampson installed took the politic line he contrived to glide by fine gradations into the empirics opinions without recanting his own which were diametrically opposed sampson before he shot back to town asked him to provide a good reliable nurse he sent a young woman of iron she received sampsons instructions and assumed the command of the sickroom and was jealous of mrs dodd and julia looked on them as mere rival nurses amateurs who if not snubbed might ruin the professionals she seemed to have forgotten in the hospitals all about the family affections and their power of turning invalids themselves into nurses the second night she got the patient all to herself for four hours from eleven till two the ladies having consented to this arrangement its order to recruit themselves for the work they were not so mad as to intrust wholly to a hireling nurses feathers smoothed themselves perceptibly at twelve the patient was muttering and murmuring incessantly about wrecks and money and things of which vain babble nurse showed her professional contempt by nodding at she slept at she snored very loud and woke instantly at the sound she took the thief out of the candle and went like a good sentinel to look at her charge he was not there she rubbed her eyes and held the candle over the place where he ought to bewhere in fact he must be for he was far too weak to move she tore the bedclothes down she beat and patted the clothes with her left hand and the candle began to shake violently in her right the bed was empty mrs dodd was half asleep when a hurried tap came to her door she started up in a moment and great dread fell on her was david sinking maam maam is he here he who cried mrs dodd bewildered why him he cant be far off in a moment mrs dodd had opened the door and her tongue and the nurses seemed to dash together so fast came the agitated words from each in turn and crying call my son alarm the house mrs dodd darted into the sickroom she was out again in a moment and up in the attics rousing the maids while the nurse thundered at edwards door and julias and rang every bell she could get at the inmates were soon alarmed and flinging on their clothes meantime mrs dodd and the nurse scoured the house and searched every nook in it down to the very cellar they found no david but they found something the street door ajar it was a dark drizzly night edward took one road mrs dodd and elizabeth another they were no sooner gone than julia drew the nurse into a room apart and asked her eagerly if her father had said nothing said nothing miss why he was atalking all the night incessant did he say anything particular think now no miss he went on as they all do just before a change i never minds em i hear so much of it oh nurse nurse have pity on me try and recollect well miss to oblige you then it was mostly fights this timeand wrecksand villainsand bankersand sharks bankers asked julia eagerly yes miss and villains they come once or twice but most of the time it was sharks and ships and money andhotchpotch i call it the way they talk bless your heart they know no better everything they ever saw or read or heard tell ofit all comes out higgledypiggledy just before they goes off we that makes it a business never takes no notice of what they says miss and never repeats it out of one sick house into another that you may rely on julia scarcely heard this her hands were tight to her brow as if to aid her to think with all her force the result was she told sarah to put on her bonnet and rushed upstairs she was not gone three minutes but in that short interval the nurses tongue and sarahs clashed together swiftly and incessantly julia heard them she came down with a long cloak on whipped the hood over her head beckoned sarah quickly and darted out sarah followed instinctively but ere they had gone many yards from the house said oh miss nurse thinks you had much better not go nurse thinks nurse thinks what does she know of me and my griefs why miss she is a very experienced woman and she saysoh dear oh dear and such a dark cold night for you to be out nurse nurse what did she say oh i havent the heart to tell you if you would but come back home with me she says as much as that poor masters troubles will be over long before we can get to him and with this sarah burst out sobbing come quicker cried julia despairingly but after a while she said tell me only dont stop me miss she says she nursed mr campbell the young curate that died last harvesttime but one you know and he lay just like master and she expecting a change every hour and oh miss she met him coming downstairs in his nightgown and he said nurse i am all right now says he and died momently in her arms at the stairfoot and she nursed an old farmer that lay as weak as master and just when they looked for him to go lo and behold him dressed and out digging potatoes and fell down dead before they could get hands on him mostly and nurse have a friend that have seen more than she have which she is older than nurse and says a bodys life is all one as a rushlight flares up strong momently just before it goes out altogether dear heart where ever are we going to in the middle of the night dont you see to the quay oh dont go there miss whatever i cant abide the sight of the water when a bodys in trouble here a drunken man confronted them and asked then if they wanted a beau and on their slipping past him in silence followed them and offered repeatedly to treat them julia moaned and hurried faster oh miss said sarah what could you expect coming out at this time of night im sure the breath is all out of me you do tear along so tear we are crawling ah sarah you are not his daughter there follow me i cannot go so slow and she set off to run presently she passed a group of women standing talking at a corner of the street and windows were open with nightcapped heads framed in them she stopped a moment to catch the words they were talking about a ghost which was said to have just passed down the street and discussing whether it was a real ghost or a trick to frighten people julia uttered a low cry and redoubled her speed and was soon at mr richard hardies door but the street was deserted and she was bewildered and began to think she had been too hasty in her conjecture a chill came over her impetuosity the dark drizzly silent night the tall masts the smell of the riverhow strange it all seemed and she to be there alone at such an hour presently she heard voices somewhere near she crossed over to a passage that seemed to lead towards them and then she heard the voices plainly and among them one that did not mingle with the others for it was the voice she loved she started back and stood irresolute would he be displeased with her feet came trampling slowly along the passage his voice came with them she drew back and looked round for sarah while she stood fluttering the footsteps came close and there emerged from the passage into the full light of the gaslamp alfred and two policemen carrying a silent senseless figure in a nightgown with a greatcoat thrown over part of him it was her father mute and ghastly the policemen still tell of that strange meeting under the gaslight by hardies bank and how the young lady flung her arms round her fathers head and took him for death and kissed his pale cheeks and moaned over him and how the young gentleman raised her against her will and sobbed over her and how they though policemen cried like children and to them i must refer the reader i have not the skill to convey the situation they got more policemen to help and carried him to albion villa on the way something cold and mysterious seemed to have come between julia and alfred they walked apart in gloomy silence broken only by foreboding sighs i pass over the tempest of emotions under which that sad burden entered albion villa and hurry to the next marked event next day the patient had lost his extreme pallor and wore a certain uniform sallow hue and at noon just before sampsons return he opened his eyes wide and fixed them on mrs dodd and julia who were now his nurses they hailed this with delight and held their breath to hear him speak to them the first sweet words of reviving life and love but soon to their surprise and grief they found he did not know them they spoke to him each in turn and told him piteously who they were and implored him with tears to know them and speak to them but no he fixed a stony gaze on them that made them shudder and their beloved voices passed over him like an idle wind sampson when he came found the ladies weeping by the bedside they greeted him with affection julia especially the boisterous controversialist had come out a gentle zealous artist in presence of a real danger dr sampson knew nothing of what had happened in his absence he stepped to the bedside cheerfully and the ladies eyes were bent keenly on his face in silence he had no sooner cast eyes on david than his countenance fell and his hard but expressive features filled with concern that was enough for mrs dodd and he does not know me she cried he does not know my voice his voice would call me back from the grave itself he is dying he will never speak to me again oh my poor orphan girl no no said samson you are quite mistaken he will not die but his tongue said no more his grave and sombre face spoke volumes chapter xxii to return to the bank skinner came back from the dodds that miserable afternoon in a state of genuine agitation and regret he was human and therefore mixed and their desolation had shocked him the footman told him mr hardie was not at home gone to london he believed skinner walked away dejected what did this mean had he left the country he smiled at his fears and felt positive mr hardie had misled the servants and was quietly waiting for him in the bank parlour it was now dusk he went round to that little dark nook of the garden the parlour window opened on and tapped there was no reply the room looked empty he tried the sash it yielded mr hardie had been too occupied with embezzling anothers property to take common precautions in defence of his own never in his life before had he neglected to fasten the iron shutters with his own hand and today he had left the very window unfastened this augured ill he is off he has done me along with the rest thought skinner he stepped into the room found a luciferbox shut the shutters lighted a candle and went peering about amongst the bankers papers to see if he could find a clue to his intentions and as he pottered and peered he quaked as well a detector by dishonest means feels thieflike and is what he feels he made some little discoveries that guided him in his own conduct he felt more and more sure his employer would outwit him if he could and resolved it should be diamond cut diamond the church clock struck one he started at the hour crept out and closed the window softly then away by the garden gate a light was still burning in alfreds room and at this skinner had another touch of compunction there is one wont sleep this night along of our work thought he at three next afternoon mr hardie reappeared he had gone up to town to change the form of the deposithe took care to think of it as a deposit still the act of deposit having been complete the withdrawal incomplete and by no fault of his for he had offered it back but fate and accident had interposed he had converted the notes into gold direct and the bills into gold through notes this was like going into the river to hide his trail next process he turned his gold into l notes and came flying home with them his return was greeted by skinner with a sigh of relief hardie heard it interpreted it aright and sent for him into the parlour and there told him with a great affectation of frankness what he had done then asked significantly if there was any news at albion villa skinnier in reply told mr hardie of the distress he had witnessed up at albion villa and sir said he lowering his voice mr alfred helped carry the body upstairs it is a nice mess altogether sir when you come to think ah all the better was the cool reply he will be useful to let us know what we want he will tell jane and jane me you dont think he will live do you live no and then who will know the money is here who should know did not he say he had just landed and been shipwrecked shipwrecked men do not bring fourteen thousand pounds ashore the speakers eyes sparkled skinner watched him demurely skinner said he solemnly i believe my daughter jane is right and that providence really interferes sometimes in the affairs of this world you know how i have struggled to save my family from disgrace and poverty those struggles have failed in a great degree but heaven has seen them and saved this money from the sea and dropped it into my very hands to retrieve my fortunes with i must be grateful spend a portion of it in charity and rear a noble fortune on the rest confound it all and his crestfallen countenance showed some ugly misgiving had flashed on him quite suddenly what sir what asked skinner eagerly the receipt chapter xxiii the receipt oh is that all you have got that said skinner very coolly what makes you think so inquired the other keenly he instantly suspected skinner of having it why sir i saw it in his hand then it has got to albion villa and we are ruined no no sir you wont hear me i am sure i saw it fall out of his hand when he was taken ill and i think but i wont be sure he fell on it anyway there was nothing in his hands when i delivered him at albion villa so it must be here i daresay you have thrown it into a drawer or somewhere promiscuously no no skinner said mr hardie with increasing alarm it is useless for us to deceive ourselves i was not three minutes in the room and thought of nothing but getting to town and cashing the bills he rang the bell sharply and on betty coming in asked her what she had done with that paper that was on the floor took it up and put it on the table sir this was it i think and she had her finger upon a paper no no said mr hardie the one i mean was much smaller than that what said she with that astonishing memory for trifles people have who never read was it a little crumpled up paper lying by the basket yes yes that sounds like it oh i put that into the basket mr hardies eye fell directly on the basket but it was empty she caught his glance and told him she had emptied it in the dusthole as usual mr hardie uttered an angry exclamation betty an old servant of his wifes resented it with due dignity by tossing her head as she retired there is no help for it said mr hardie bitterly we must go and grub in the dusthole now why sir your name is not on it after all what does that matter a man is bound by the act of his agent besides it is my form and my initials on the back come let us put a good face on the thing and he led the way to the kitchen and got up a little laugh and asked the scullerymaid if she could show mr skinner and him the dusthole she stared but obeyed and the pair followed her making merry the dusthole was empty the girl explained it is the dustmans day he came at eleven oclock in the morning and carried all the dust away and grumbled at the paper and the bones he did so i told him beggars musnt be choosers just like his impudence when he gets it for nothing and sells it for a mint outside the town the unwonted visitors left her in dead silence almost before she had finished her sentence mr hardie sat down in his parlour thoroughly discomposed skinner watched him furtively at last the former broke out this is the devils doing the devil in person no intelligence nor ability can resist such luck i almost wish we had never meddled with it we shall never feel safe never be safe skinner made light of the matter treated the receipt as thrown into the sea why sir said he by this time it will have found its way to that monstrous heap of ashes on the london road and who will ever look for it there or notice it if they find it hardie shook his head that monstrous heap is all sold every year to the farmers that receipt worth l to me will be strewed on the soil for manure then some farmers man or some farmers boy that goes to the sundayschool will read it see captain dodds name and bring it to albion villa in hopes of a sixpence a sixpence heaven help the man who does a doubtful act and leaves damnatory evidence on paper kicking about the world from that hour the cash hardie carried in his bosom without a right to it began to blister he thought of telling the dustman he had lost a paper and setting him to examine the mountain of ashes on the london road but here caution stepped in how could he describe the paper without awakening curiosity and defeating his own end he gave that up it was better to let the sleeping dog lie finally he resolved to buy security in a world where after all one has to buy everything so he employed an adroit agent and quietly purchased that mountain the refuse of all barkington but he felt so illused he paid for it in his own notes by this means the treaty reverted to the primitive form of barterashes for rags or exchange of commodities without the aid of money see homer and welsh villages passim this transaction he concealed from his confederate when he had completed it he was not yet secure for another day had passed and captain dodd alive still men often recover from apoplexy especially when they survive the first twentyfour hours should he live he would not now come into any friendly arrangement with the man who had so nearly caused his death so then goodbye to the matrimonial combination hardie had at first relied on to patch his debt to alfred and his broken fortunes then as to keeping the money and defying dodd that would be very difficult and dangerous mercantile bills are traceable things and criminal prosecutions awkward ones he found himself in a situation he could not see his way through by any mental effort there were so many objections to every course and so many to its opposite he walked among fires as the latins say but the more he pondered on the course to be taken should dodd live the plainer did this dilemma stare him in the fade either he must refund or fly the country with another mans money and leave behind him the name of a thief parental love and the remains of selfrespect writhed at this thought and with these combined a sentiment less genuine but by no means feeble the love of reputation so it was with a reluctant and sick heart he went to the shipping office and peered at the posters to see when the next ship sailed for the united states still he did go intent on his own schemes and expecting every day to be struck in front he did not observe that a man in a rusty velveteen coat followed him and observed this act and indeed all his visible acts another perplexity was when he should break there were objections to doing it immediately and objections to putting it off with all this the man was in a ferment by day he sat waiting and fearing by night he lay sleepless and thinking and though his stoical countenance retained its composure the furrows deepened in it and the iron nerves began to twitch at times from strain of mind and want of sleep and that rack suspense not a night that he did not awaken a dozen times from his brief dozes with a start and a dread of exposure by some mysterious unforeseen means it is remarkable how truths sometimes flash on men at night in hours of nervous excitement it was in one of these nightly reveries david dodds pocketbook flashed back upon mr hardie he saw it before his eyes quite plain and on the inside of the leather cover a slip of paper pasted and written on in pencil or pale ink he could not recall which what was that writing it might be the numbers of the notes the description of the bills why had he not taken it out of the dying mans pocket fool fool he groaned to do anything by halves another night he got a far severer shock lying in his bed dozing and muttering as usual he was suddenly startled out of that uneasy slumber by three tremendous knocks at the street door he sprang out of bed and in his confusion made sure the officers of justice were come for him he began to huddle on his clothes with a vague notion of flight he had got on his trousers and slippers and was looking under his pillow for the fatal cash when he heard himself called loudly and repeatedly by name but this time the sound came from the garden into which his bedroom looked he opened it very softly in trepidation and wonder which were speedily doubled by what met his eyes for there right in front of his window stood an unearthly figure corresponding in every particular to that notion of a ghost in which we are reared and which when our nerves are healthy we can ridicule as it deserves but somehow it is never cleaned out of our imagination so thoroughly as it is out of our judgment the figure was white as a sheet and seemed supernaturally tall and it cried out in a voice like a wounded lions you villain you hardie give me back my money my fourteen thousand pounds give me my childrens money or may your children die before your eyes give me my darlings money or may the eternal curse of god light on you and yours you scoundrel and the figure kneeled on the grass and repeated the terrible imprecation almost in the same words with such energy that hardie shrank back and resolute as he was cowered with superstitious awe but this sentiment soon gave way to vulgar fears the man would alarm the town and in fact mr hardie in the midst of his agitation was dimly conscious of hearing a window open softly not very far from him but it was a dark night he put his head out in great agitation and whispered hush hush ill bring it you down directly internally cursing his hard fate he got the fatal cash put on his coat hunted for the key of the bank parlour and having found it went softly down the stairs unlocked the door and went to open the shutters at this moment his ear caught a murmur a low buzzing of voices in the garden he naturally thought that captain dodd was exposing him to some of the townspeople he was puzzled what to do and like a cautious man as he was remained passive but on the watch presently the voices were quiet and he heard footsteps come very slowly towards the window at which he stood and then make for the little gate on this he slipped into the kitchen which faced the street and got to a window there and listened his only idea was to catch their intentions if possible and meet them accordingly he dared not open the window for about him on the pavement he saw a female figure half standing half crouching but soon that figure rushed wildly out of his sight to meet the footsteps and then he ventured to open the window and listening heard cries of despair and a young heartbroken voice say her father was dead ah that is all right muttered hardie still even this profound egotist was not yet so hardened but that he felt one chill of horror at himself for the thoughta passing chill he listened and listened and byandbye he heard the slow feet recommence their journey amidst sobs and sights and those sorrowful feet and the sobs and sighs of his causing got fainter and fainter retreated and left him in quiet possession of the l he had brought down to give it up two minutes ago it was not worth as many pence to him he drew a long breath of relief it is mine i am to keep it it is the will of heaven poor heaven he went to his bed again and by a resolute effort composed himself and determined to sheep and in fact he was just dropping off when suddenly he started wide awake again for it recurred to him vividly that a window in his house had opened while david was cursing him and demanding his childrens money whose window halfadozen people and more slept on that side of the house whose window could it be he walked among fires chapter xxiv not many days after this a crowd of persons stood in front of the old bank looking half stupefied at the shutters and at a piece of paper pasted on them announcing a suspension only for a months or so and laying the blame on certain correspondents not specified so great was the confidence inspired by the old bank that many said it would come round it must come round in a month but other of mr hardies unfortunate clients recognised in the above a mere formula to let them down by degrees they had seen many statements as hopeful end in a dividend of sixpence in the pound before the day closed the scene at the bank door was heartrending respectable persons reduced to pauperism in that day kept arriving and telling their fellowsufferers their little all was with hardie and nothing before them but the workhouse or the almshouse ruined mothers came and held up their ruined children for the banker to see and the doors were hammered at and the house as well as the bank was beleaguered by a weeping wailing despairing crowd but like an idle wave beating on a rock all this human misery dashed itself in vain against the bankers brick walls and shutters hard to them as his very heart the next day they mobbed alfred and hissed him at the backdoor jane was too ashamed and too frightened to stir out mr hardie sat calmly putting the finishing strokes to his fabricated balancesheet some innocent and excited victims went to the mayor for redress to the aldermen the magistratesin vain towards afternoon the bankers cool contempt for his benefactors whose lives he had darkened received a temporary check a heavy stone was flung at the bank shutters this ferocious blow made him start and the place rattle it was the signal for a shower and presently tink tink went the windows of the house and in came the stones starring the mirrors upsetting the chairs denting the papered walls chipping the mantelpieces shivering the bell glasses and statuettes and strewing the room with dirty pebbles and painted fragments and glittering ruin hardie winced this was the sort of appeal to touch him but soon he recovered his sang froid thank you said he im much obliged to you now im in the right and you are in the wrong and he put himself under protection of the police and feed them so royally that they were zealous on his behalf and rough and dictatorial even with those who thronged the place only to moan and lament and hold up their ruined children you must move on you misery said the police and they were right misery gains nothing by stopping the way nothing by bemoaning itself but if the banker naturally egotistical and now entirely wrapped in his own plans and fears and wellearned torments was deaf to the anguish of his clients there were others in his house who felt it keenly and deeply alfred and jane were heartbroken they sat hand in hand in a little room drawn closer by misfortune and heard the groans at their door and the tears of pity ran down their own cheeks hot with shame and alfred wrote on the flyleaf of his ethics a vow to pay every shilling his father owed these poor peoplebefore he died it was like him and like his happy age at which the just and the generous can command in imagination the means to do kindred deeds soon he found to his horror that he had seen but a small percentage of the distress his father had caused the greater griefs as usual stayed at home behind the gadding woes lay a terrible number of silent decent ruined homes and broken hearts and mixed sorrows so unmerited so complicated so piteous and so cruel that he was ready to tear his hair to know them and not be able to relieve them instantly of that mere sample i give a mere sample divine the bulk then and revolve a page of human history often turned by the people but too little studied by statisticians and legislators mr esgar a respectable merchant had heavy engagements to meet which his money lay at the old bank living at a distance he did not hear the news till near dinnertime and he had promised to take his daughters to a ball that night he did so left them there went home packed up their clothes and valuables and next day levanted with them to america taking all the money he could scrape together in london and so he passed his ruin on to others esgar was one of those who wear their honesty long but loose it was his first disloyal act in business dishonesty made me dishonest was his excuse valeat quantum john shaw a steady footman had saved and saved from twentyone years old to thirtyeight for footmans paradise a publichouse he was now engaged to a comely barmaid who sympathised with him therein and he had just concluded a bargain for the rose and crown in the suburbs unluckilyfor himthe money had not been paid over the blow fell he lost his all not his money only but his wasted life he could not be twentyone again so he hanged himself within fortyeight hours and was buried by the parish grumbling a little pitying none james and peter gilpin william scott and joel paton were poor fishermen and anglosaxon heroesthat is heroes with an eye to the main chance they risked their lives at sea to save a ship and get salvage failing there they risked their lives all the same like fine fellows as they were to save the crew they succeeded but ruined their old boat a subscription was raised and prospered so that a boatbuilder built them a new one on tick price l and the publicans said drink boys drink the subscription will cover all it is up to l already the subscription money was swallowed with the rest and the anglosaxon heroes hauled to prison doctor phillips aged seventyfour warned by growing infirmities had sold a tidy practice with house furniture and goodwill for a fair price and put it in the bank awaiting some investment the money was gone now and the poor old doctor with a wife and daughter and a crutch was at once a pauper and an exile for he had sold under the usual condition not to practise within so many miles of his successor he went to that successor and begged permission to be his assistant at a small small salary i want a younger man was the reply then he went round to his old patients and begged a few halfguineas to get him a horse and chaise and keep him over the first month in his new place they pitied him but most of them were sufferers too by hardie and all they gave him did but buy a donkey and cart and with that he and his went slowly and sadly to a village ten miles distant from the place where all his life had been spent in comfort and good credit the poor old gentleman often looked back from his cart at the church spires of barkington from seventeen till now almost fourscore there lived he but now lived there no more at seventeen many their fortunes seek but at fourscore it is too old a week arrived at his village he had to sell his donkey and trust to his crutch and so infirmity crept about begging leave to cure diseasewith what success may be inferred from this miss phillips a ladylike girl of eighteen was taken up by farmer giles before squire langton for stealing turnips out of a field the farmer was hard and his losses in hardies bank had made him bitter hard so the poor girls excuse that she could not let her father starve had no effect on him to jail she should go i find however that squire langton resolutely refused to commit miss phillips the real reason i suspect was that he had a respect for the gospel and not much for the law except those invaluable clauses which restrain poaching the reason he gave was turnips be hanged if she hadnt eaten them the fly would however he found means to muzzle giles and sent the old doctor two couple of rabbits took to the national vice and went to the national dogs thomas fisher a saving tinman and a bachelor so i expect no pity for him to the same goal by the same road dragging their families went the rev henry scudamore a curate philip hall a linendraper neil pratt a shoemaker simon harris a greengrocer and a few more but the above were all prudent laborious men who took a friendly glass but seldom exceeded until hardies bankruptcy drove them to the devil of drink for comfort turned professional thief joseph locke working locksmith who had just saved money enough to buy a shop and goodwill and now lost it every penny turned atheist and burnt the family bible before his weeping wife and terrified children and gaping servantgirl mr williams a sundayschool teacher known hitherto only as a mild respectable man a teetotaler and a good parent and husband he did not take to drinking but he did to cursing and forbade his own flesh and blood ever to enter a church again this man became an outcast shunned by all three elderly sisters the misses lunley well born and bred lived together on their funds which small singly united made a decent competence two of them had refused marriage in early life for fear the third should fall into less tender hands than theirs for miss blanche lunley was a cripple disorder of the spine had robbed her in youths very bloom of the power not only to dance as you girls do but to walk or even stand upright leaving her two active little hands and a heart as nearly angelic as we are likely to see here on earth she lay all day long on a little iron bedstead at the window of their backparlour that looked on a sunny little lawn working eagerly for the poor teaching the poor young and old to read chiefly those of her own sex hearing the sorrows of the poor composing the quarrels of the poor relieving their genuine necessities with a little money and much ingenuity and labour some poor woman in a moment of inspiration called miss blanche the sunshine of the poor the word was instantly caught up in the parish and had now this many years gently displaced lunley and settled on her here below and its echo gone before her up to heaven the poor sunshine of the poor was happy life was sweet to her to know whether this is so it is useless to inquire of the backbone or the limbs look at the face she lay at her window in the kindred sunshine and in a world of sturdy able agile cursers grumblers and yawners her face pale its ashes wore the eternal sunshine of a happy holy smile but there came one to her bedside and told her the bank was broken and all the money gone she and her sisters had lent mr hardie the saint clasped her hands and said oh my poor people what will become of them and the tears ran down her pale and now sorrowful cheeks at this time she did not know the full extent of their losses but they had given mr hardie a power of attorney to draw out all their consols that remorseless man had abused the discretion this gave him and beggared themthey were his personal friends tooto swell his secret hoard when the sunshine of the poor heard this and knew that she was now the poorest of the poor she clasped her hands and cried oh my poor sisters my poor sisters and she could work no more for sighing the next morning found the sunshine of the poor extinct in her little bed ay died of grief with no grain of egotism in it gone straight to heaven without one angry word against richard hardie or any other old betty had a horror of the workhouse to save her old age from it she had deposited her wages in the bank for the last twenty years and also a little legacy from mr hardies father she now went about the house of her master and debtor declaring she was sure he would not rob her and if he did she would never go into the poorhouse ill go out on the common and die there nobody will miss me the next instance led to consequences upon consequences and that is my excuse for telling it the reader somewhat more fully than alfred heard it mrs maxley one night found something rough at her feet in bed what on earth is this said she never you mind said maxley say its my breeches what then why what on earth does the man put his breeches to bed for that is my business roared maxley and whispered drily taint for you to wear em howsever this little spar led to his telling her he had drawn out all their money but when she asked the reason he snubbed her again indirectly recommending her to sleep the fact is the smallclothes were full of banknotes and maxley always followed them into bed now for fear of robbers the bank broke on a tuesday maxley dug on impassive and when curious people came about him to ask whether he was a loser he used to inquire very gravely and dwelling on every syllable doyouseeanythinggreenin this ere eye friday was club day the clubsmen met at the greyhound and talked over their losses maxley sat smoking complacently and when his turn came to groan he said drily i draad all mine a week afore exclamations i had a hinkling my boy jack he wrote to me from canada as how hardies was rotten out there now these here bankers they be like an oak tree they do go at the limbs first and then at the heart the club was wroth what you went and made yourself safe and never gave any of us a chance was that neighbourly was thatclubbable to a hailstorm of similar reproaches maxley made but one reply twarnt my business to take care o you he added however a little sulkily i was laad for slander once scalded dog fears luewarm water oh said one i dont believe him he puts a good face on it but his nine hundred is gone along with ourn taiut gone far then with this he put his hand in his pocket and after some delay pulled out a nice new crisp note and held it up what is that i ask the company looks like a tenpun note james welt the bulk grees with the sample i knows where to find eightscore and nine to match this here the note was handed round and on inspection each countenance in turn wore a malicious smile till at last maxley surrounded by grinning faces felt uneasy what be e all grinning at like a litter o chessy cats warnt ye ugly enough without showing of your rotten teeth haw haw better say taint money at all but only a wenchs curl paper and he got up and snatched it fiercely out of the last inspectors hand ye cant run your rigs on me said he what an if i cant read words i can figures and i spelt the ten out on every one of them afore id take it a loud and general laugh greeted this boast then maxley snatched up his hat in great wrath and some anxiety and went out followed by a peal in five minutes he was at home and tossed the note into his wifes lap she was knitting by a farthing dip dame said he controlling all appearance of anxiety what dye call that she took up the note and held it close to the candle why jem it is a tenpound note one of hardiesas was then what were those fools laughing at and he told her all that had happened mrs maxley dropped her knitting and stood up trembling why you told me you had got our money all safe out well and so i have ye foolish woman and he drew the whole packet out of his pocket and flung them fiercely on the table mrs maxley ran her finger and eye over them and uttered a scream of anger and despair these these be all hardies notes she cried and what vally be hardies notes when hardies be broke maxley staggered as if he had been shot the womans eyes flashed fury at him this is your work ye born idiot mind your own business says you you must despise your wedded wife that has more brains in her finger than you have in all your great long useless carease you must have your secrets one day poison another day beggary you have ruined me you have murdered me get out of my sight for if i find a knife ill put it in you i will and in her ungovernable passion she actually ran to the dresser for a knife at which maxley caught up a chair and lifted it furiously above his head to fling at her luckily the man had more selfcommand than the woman he dashed the chair furiously on the floor and ran out of the house he wandered about half stupid and presently his feet took him mechanically round to his garden he pottered about among his plants looking at them inspecting them closely and scarce seeing them however he covered up one or two and muttered i think there will be a frost tonight i think there will be a frost then his legs seemed to give way he sat down and thought of his weddingday he began to talk to himself out loud as some people do in trouble bless her comely face said he and to think i had my arm lifted to strike her after wearing her so low and finding her good stuff upon the whole well thank my stars i didnt we must make the best ont moneys gone but heres the garden and our hands still and taint as if we were single to gnaw our hearts alone wedded life cuts grief a two lets make it up and begin again sixty come martinmas and susan fortyeight and i be amost weary of turning moulds he went round to his front door there was a crowd round it a buzzing crowd with all their faces turned towards his door he came at their backs and asked peevishly what was to do now some of the women shrieked at his voice the crowd turned about and a score of faces peered at him some filled with curiosity some with pity lord help us said the poor man is there any more trouble a foot today stand aside please and let me know no no cried a woman dont let him not let me go into my own house young woman said maxley with dignity be these your manners oh james i meant you no ill poor man poor soul said another stand aloof said a strange man who has as good a right to be there as he have a lane was made directly and maxley rushed down between two rows of peering faces with his knees knocking together and burst into his own house a scream from the women inside as he entered and a deep groan from the strong man bereaved of his mate told the tragedy poor susan maxley was gone she had died of breastpang within a minute of his leaving her and the last words of two faithful spouses were words of anger all these things and many more less tragic but very deplorable came to alfred hardies knowledge and galled and afflicted him deeply and several of these revelations heaped discredit high upon richard hardie till the young man born with a keen sense of justice and bred amongst honourable minds began to shudder at his own father herein he was alone jane with the affectionate blindness of her sex could throw her arms round her fathers neck and pity him for his lossesby his own dishonestyand pity him most when some victim of his unprincipled conduct died or despaired poor papa will feel this so deeply was her only comment on such occasions alfred was not sorry she could take this view and left her unmolested to confound black with white and wrong with right at affections dictates but his own trained understanding was not to be duped in matters of plain morality and so unable to cure the wrongs he deplored unable to put his conscience into his pocket like richard hardie or into his heart like jane he wandered alone or sat brooding and dejected and the attentive reader if i am so fortunate as to possess one will not be surprised to learn that he was troubled too with dark mysterious surmises he half dreaded yet felt it his duty to fathom these and mrs dodds loss by the bank combined to keep him out of albion villa he often called to ask after captain dodd but was ashamed to enter the house now richard hardies anxiety to know whether david was to die or live had not declined but rather increased if the latter he was now resolved to fly to the united states with his booty and cheat his alienated son along with the rest he had come by degrees down to this it was on alfred he had counted to keep him informed of davids state but on his putting a smooth inquiry the young mans face flushed with shame or anger or something and he gave a very short sharp and obscure reply in reality he did not know much nor did sarah his informant for of late the servants had never been allowed to enter davids room mr hardie after this rebuff never asked alfred again but having heard sampsons name mentioned as dodds medical attendant wrote and asked him to come and dine next time he should visit barkington you will find me a fallen man said he tomorrow we resign our house and premises and furniture to the assignees and go to live at a little furnished cottage not very far from your friends the dodds it is called musgrove cottage there where we have so little to offer besides a welcome none but true friends will come near us indeed there are very few i should venture to ask for such a proof of fidelity to your broken friend r h the goodhearted sampson sent a cordial reply and came to dinner at musgrove cottage now all hardie wanted of him in reality was to know about david so when jane had retired and the decanter circulated he began to pump him by his vanity i understand said he you have wrought one of your surprising cures in this neighbourhood albion villa sampson shook his head sorrowfully mr hardies eyes sparkled alfred watched him keenly and bitterly how can i work a great cure after these assassins short and osmond look see the man had been wounded in the hid and lost blood thin stabbed in the shoulder and lost more bloodboth the hardies uttered an ejaculation of unfeigned surpriseso instid of recruiting the buddy thus exhausted of the great liquid material of all repair the profissional assassin came and exhausted him worse stabbed him while he slept stabbed him unconscious stabbed him in a vein and stole more blood from him wasnt that enough no the routine of profissional assassination had but begun nixt they stabbed him with cuppingneedles and so stole more of his lifeblood and they were goen from their stabs to their bites goen to leech his temples and so hand him over to the sixton but you came in and saved him cried alfred i saved his life said sampson sorrowfully but life is not the only good thing a man may be robbed of by those who steal his lifeblood and so impoverish and water the contints of the vessels of the brain doctor sampson said alfred what do you mean by these mysterious words you alarm me what dont you know havent they told you no i have not had the courage to enter the house since the bank he stopped in confusion ay i understand said sampson however it cant be hidden now he is a maniac sampson made this awful announcement soberly and sorrowfully alfred groaned aloud and even his father experienced a momentary remorse but so steady had been the progress of corruption that he felt almost unmixed joy the next instant and his keenwitted son surprised the latter sentiment in his face and shuddered with disgust sampson went on to say that he believed the poor man had gone flourishing a razor and mrs dodd had said yes kill me david kill the mother of your children and never moved which feminine or in other words irrational behaviour had somehow disarmed him but it would not happen again his sister had come a sensible resolute woman she had signed the order and osmond and he the certificates and he was gone to a private asylum talking of that said sampson rising suddenly i must go and give them a word of comfort for they are just breaking their hearts at parting with him poor things ill be back in an hour on his departure jane returned and made the tea in the diningroom they lived like that now mr hardie took it from his favourites lithe white hand and smiled on her he should not have to go to a foreign land after all who would believe a madman if he should rave about his thousands he sipped his tea luxuriously and presently delivered himself thus with bland selfsatisfaction my dear alfred some time ago you wished to marry a young lady without fortune you thought that i had a large one and you expected me to supply all deficiencies you did not overrate my parental feeling but you did my means i would have done this for you and with pleasure but for my own coming misfortunes as it was i said no and when you demanded somewhat peremptorily my reasons i said trust me well you see i was right such a marriage would have been your utter ruin however i conclude after what dr sampson has told us you have resigned it on other grounds jane my dear captain dodd i am sorry to say is afflicted he has gone mad gone mad oh how shocking what will become of his poor children she thought of edward first we have just heard it from sampson and i presume alfred you are not so far gone as to insist on propagating insanity by a marriage with his daughter at this conclusion which struck her obliquely though aimed at alfred jane sighed gently and her dream of earthly happiness seemed to melt away but alfred ground his teeth and replied with great bitterness and emotion i think sir you are the last man who ought to congratulate yourself on the affliction that has fallen on that unhappy family i aspire to enter all the more that now they have calamities for me to share more fool you put in mr hardie calmly for i much fear you are one of the causes of that calamity mr hardie assumed a puzzled air i dont see how that can be do you jenny sampson told us the causes a wound on the head a wound in the arm bleeding cupping c there may be other causes dr sampson has not been told ofyet possibly i really dont know what you allude to the son fixed his eyes on the father and leaned across the table to him till their faces nearly met the fourteen thousand pounds sir chapter xxv mr hardie was taken by surprise for once and had not a word to say but looked in his sons face mute and gasping as a fish during this painful silence his children eyed him inquiringly but not with the same result for one face is often read differently by two persons to jane whose intelligence had no aids he seemed unaffectedly puzzled but alfred discerned beneath his wonder the terror of detection rising and then thrust back by the strong will that stoical face shut again like an iron door but not quickly enough the right words the open sesame had been spoken and one unguarded look had confirmed alfreds vague suspicions of foul play he turned his own face away he was alienated by the occurrences of the last few months but nature and tender reminiscences still held him by some fibres of the heartin a moment of natural indignation he had applied the touchstone but its success grieved him he could not bear to go on exposing his father so he left the room with a deep sigh in which pity mingled with shame and regret he wandered out into the silent night and soon was leaning on the gate of albion villa gazing wistfully at the windows and sore perplexed and nobly wretched as he was going out mr hardie raised his eyebrows with a look of disinterested wonder and curiosity and touched his forehead to jane as much as to say is he disordered in his mind as soon as they were alone he asked her coolly what alfred meant she said she had no idea then he examined her keenly about this fourteen thousand pounds and found to his relief alfred had never even mentioned it to her and now richard hardie like his son wanted to be alone and think over this new peril that had risen in the bosom of his own family and for once the company of his favourite child was irksome he made an excuse and strolled out in his turn into the silent night it was calm and clear the thousand holy eyes under which men prefer to do their crimesexcept when they are in too great a hurry to waitlooked down and seemed to wonder anything can be so silly as to sin and beneath their pure gaze the man of the world pondered with all his soul he tormented himself with conjectures through what channel did alfred suspect him through the dodds were they aware of their loss had the pocketbook spoken if so why had not mrs dodd or her son attacked him but then perhaps alfred was their agent they wished to try a friendly remonstrance through a mutual friend before proceeding to extremities this accorded with mrs dodds character as he remembered her the solution was reasonable but he was relieved of it by recollecting what alfred had said that he had not entered the house since the bank broke on this he began to hope alfreds might be a mere suspicion he could not establish by any proof and at all events he would lock it in his own breast like a good son his never having given a hint even to his sister favoured this supposition thus meditating mr hardie found himself at the gate of albion villa yet he had strolled out with no particular intention of going there had his mind apprehensive of danger from that quarter driven his body thither he took a look at the house and the first thing he saw was a young lady leaning over the balcony and murmuring softly to a male figure below whose outline mr hardie could hardly discern for it stood in the shadow mr hardie was delighted aha miss juliet said he if alfred does not visit you some one else does you have soon supplied your peevish lovers place he then withdrew softly from the gate not to disturb the intrigue and watched a few yards off determined to see who julias nightly visitor was and give alfred surprise for surprise he had not long to wait the man came away directly and walked head erect past mr hardie and glanced full in his face but did not vouchsafe him a word it was alfred himself mr hardie was profoundly alarmed and indignant the young traitor never enter the house no but he comes and tells her everything directly under her window on the sly and when he is caughtdefies me to my face and now he suspected female cunning and malice in the way that thunderbolt had been quietly prepared for him and launched without warning in his very daughters presence and the result just communicated to julia dodd in a very gloomy mood he followed his son and heard his firm though elastic tread on the frosty ground and saw how loftily he carried his head and from that moment feared and very very nearly hated him the next day he feigned sick and sent for osmond that worthy prescribed a pill and a draught the former laxative the latter astringent this ceremony performed mr hardie gossipped with him and after a detour or two glided to his real anxiety sampson tells me you know more about captain dodds case than he does he is not very clear as to the cause of the poor mans going mad the cause why apoplexy yes but i mean what caused the apoplexy mr osmond replied that apoplexy was often idiopathic captain dodd as he understood had fallen down in the street in a sudden fit but as for the mania that is to be attributed to an insufficient evacuation of blood while under the apoplectic coma arising of itself a term rather hastily applied to disorders the coming signs of which have not been detected by the medical attendant the birth of topsy was idiopathicin that learned ladys opinion not bled enough why sampson says it is because he was bled too much osmond was amused at this and repeated that the mania came of not being bled enough the discussion was turned into an unexpected quarter by the entrance of jane hardie who came timidly in and said oh mr osmond i cannot let you go without telling you how anxious i am about alfred he is so thin and pale and depressed nonsense jane said mr hardie have we not all cause to be dejected in this house but she persisted gently that there was more in it than that and his headaches were worse and she could not be easy any longer without advice ah those headaches said mr osmond they always made me uneasy to tell the truth miss hardie i have noticed a remarkable change in him but i did not like to excite apprehensions and so he mopes does he seeks solitude and is taciturn and dejected yes but i do not mind that so much as his turning so pale and thin oh it is all part of one malady then you know what is the matter i think i do and yours is a wise and timely anxiety your brothers is a very delicate case of hyperaesthetic character and i should like to have the advice of a profound physician let me see dr wycherley will be with me tomorrow may i bring him over as a friend this proposal did not at all suit mr hardie he put his own construction on alfreds pallor and dejection and was uneasy at the idea of his being crossquestioned by a couple of doctors no no said he taff has fancies enough already i cannot have you gentlemen coming here to fill his head with many more oh he has fancies has he said osmond keenly my dear sir we shall not say one word to him that might irritate him but i should like you to hear a truly learned opinion jane looked so imploringly that mr hardie yielded a reluctant assent on those terms so the next day by appointment mr osmond introduced his friend dr wycherley bland and bald with a fine bead and a face naturally intelligent but crossed every now and then by gleams of vacancy a man of large reading and of tact to make it subserve his interests a voluminous writer on certain medical subjects he had so saturated himself with circumlocution that it distilled from his very tongue he talked like an article a quarterly one and so gained two advantages st he rarely irritated a fellowcreature for if he began a sentence hot what with its length and what with its windiness he ended it cool item stabs by polysyllables are pricks by sponges ndly this foible earned him the admiration of fools and that is as invaluable as they are innumerable yet was there in the mothertongue he despised one gem of a word he vastly admired like most quarterly writers that charming word the pet of the polysyllabic was of he opened the matter in a subdued and sympathising tone well calculated to win a loving father such as richard hardiewas not my good friend here informs me sir you are so fortunate as to possess a son of distinguished abilities and who is at present labouring under some of those precursory indications of incipient disease of the cerebropsychical organs of which i have been i may say somewhat successful in diagnosing the symptoms unless i have been misinformed he has for a considerable time experienced persistent headache of a kephalalgic or true cerebral type and has now advanced to the succeeding stage of taciturnity and depression not unaccompanied with isolation and probably constipation but as yet without hallucination though possibly and as my experience of the great majority of these cases would induce me to say probably he is not undisturbed by one or more of those latent and at first trifling aberrations either of the intelligence or the senses which in their preliminary stages escape the observation of all but the expert nosologist anglice accompanied anglice disturbed there you see said osmond dr wycherley agrees with me yet i assure you i have only detailed the symptoms and not the conclusion i had formed from them jane inquired timidly what that conclusion was miss hardie we think it one of those obscure tendencies which are very curable if taken in time dr wycherley ended the sentence but no longer remediable if the fleeting opportunity is allowed to escape and diseased action to pass into diseased organisation jane looked awestruck at their solemnity but mr hardie who was taking advice against the grain turned satirical gentleman said he be pleased to begin by moderating your own obscurity and then perhaps i shall see better how to cure my sons disorder what the deuce are you driving at the two doctors looked at one another inquiringly and so settled how to proceed dr wycherley explained to mr hardie that there was a sort of general unreasonable and superstitious feeling abroad a kind of terror of the complaint with which his son was threatened and which instead of the most remediable of disorders is looked at as the most incurable of maladies it was on this account he had learned to approach the subject with singular caution and even with a timidity which was kinder in appearance than in reality that he must admit well you may speak out as far as i am concerned said mr hardie with consummate indifference oh yes said jane in a fever of anxiety pray conceal nothing from us well then sir i have not as yet had the advantage of examining your son personally but from the diagnostics i have no doubt whatever he is labouring under the first foreshadowings of cerebropsychical perturbation to speak plainly the symptoms are characteristic of the initiatory stage of the germination of a morbid state of the phenomena of intelligence his unprofessional hearers only stared in one word then said dr wycherley waxing impatient at their abominable obtuseness it is the premonitory stage of the precursory condition of an organic affection of the brain oh said mr hardie the brain i see the boy is going mad what a blessing there are a few english words left in all our dialects the doctors stared in their turn at the prodigious coolness of a tender parent not exactly said dr wycherley i am habitually averse to exaggeration of symptoms your sons suggest to me the incubation of insanity nothing more jane uttered an exclamation of horror the doctor soothed her with an assurance that there was no cause for alarm incipient aberration was of easy cure the mischief lay in delay miss hardie said he paternally during a long and busy professional career it has been my painful province to witness the deplorable consequences of the nonrecognition by friends and relatives of the precedent symptoms of those organic affections of the brain the relief of which was within the reach of wellknown therapeutic agents if exhibited seasonably he went on to deplore the blind prejudice of unprofessional persons who choose to fancy that other diseases creep but insanity pounces on a man which he expressed thus neatly that other deviations from organic conditions of health are the subject of clearly defined though delicate gradations but that the worst and most climacteric forms of cerebropsychical disorder are suddenly developed affections presenting no evidence of any antecedent cephalic organic change and unaccompanied by a premonitory stage or by incipient symptoms this chimera he proceeded to confute by experience he had repeatedly been called in to cases of mania described as sudden and almost invariably found the patient had been cranky for years which he condensed thus his conduct and behaviour for many years previously to any symptom of mental aberration being noticed had been characterised by actions quite irreconcilable with the supposition of the existence of perfect sanity of intellect he instanced a parson whom he had lately attended and found him as constipated and as convinced he was john the baptist engaged to the princess mary as could be but continued the learned doctor upon investigation of this afflicted ecclesiastics antecedent history i discovered that for years before this he had exhibited conduct incompatible with the hypothesis of a mind whose equilibrium had been undisturbed he had caused a number of valuable trees to be cut down on his estate without being able to offer a sane justification for such an outrageous proceeding and had actually disposed of a quantity of his patrimonial acres and which clearly he never would have parted with had he been in anything resembling a condition of sanity did he sell the land and timber below the market price inquired mr hardie perking up and exhibiting his first symptoms of interest in the discussion on that head sir my informant his heiratlaw gave me no information nor did i enter into that class of detail you naturally look at morbid phenomena in a commercial spirit but we regard them medicallyand all this time most assiduously visiting the sick of his parish and preaching admirable serious the next instance he gave was of a stockbroker suffering under general paralysis and a rooted idea that all the specie in the bank of england was his and ministers in league with foreign governments to keep him out of it him said the doctor i discovered to have been for years guilty of conduct entirely incompatible with the hypothesis of undisordered mental functions he had accused his domestics of peculation and had initiated legal proceedings with a view of prosecuting in a court of law one of his oldest friends whence you infer that if my son has not for years been doing cranky acts he is not likely to be deranged at present this adroit twist of the argument rather surprised dr wycherley however he was at no loss for a reply it is not insanity but the incubation of insanity which is suspected in your intelligent sons case and the best course will be for me to enumerate in general terms the several symptoms of the incubation of insanity he concluded with some severity after that sir i shall cease to intrude what i fear is an unwelcome conviction the parent whose levity and cold reception of good tidings he had thus mildly yet with due dignity rebuked was a man of the world and liked to make friends not enemies so he took the hint and made a very civil speech assuring dr wycherley that if he ventured to differ from him he was none the less obliged by the kind interest he took in a comparative stranger and would be very glad to hear all about the incubation of insanity dr wycherley bowed slightly and complied one diagnostic preliminary sign of abnormal cerebral action is kephalalgia or true cerebral headache i mean persistent headache not accompanied by a furred tongue or other indicia significant of abdominal or renal disorder as its origin jane sighed he has sad headaches the succeeding symptom is a morbid affection of sleep either the patient suffers from insomnia or else from hypersomnia which we subdivide into sopor carus and lethargus or thirdly from kakosomnia or a propensity to mere dozing and to all the morbid phenomena of dreams papa said jane poor alfred sleeps very badly i hear him walking at all hours of the night i thought as much said dr wycherley insomnia is the commonest feature to resume the insidious advance of morbid thought is next marked by high spirits or else by low spirits generally the latter the patient begins by moping then shows great lassitude and ennui then becomes abstracted moody and occupied with a solitary idea jane clasped her hands and the tears stood in her eyes so well did this description tally with poor alfreds case and at this period continued dr wycherley my experience leads me to believe that some latent delusion is generally germinating in the mind though often concealed with consummate craft by the patient the open development of this delusion is the next stage and with this last morbid phenomenon incubation ceases and insanity begins sometimes however the illusion is physical rather than psychical of the sense rather than of the intelligence it commences at night the incubator begins by seeing nocturnal visions often of a photopsic character or hearing nocturnal sounds neither of which have any material existence being conveyed to his optic or auricular nerves not from without but from within by the agency of a disordered brain these the reason hitherto unimpaired combats at first especially when they are nocturnal only but being reproduced and becoming diurnal the judgment succumbs under the morbid impression produced so repeatedly these are the ordinary antecedent symptoms characteristic of the incubation of insanity to which are frequently added somatic exaltation or in popular language physical excitabilitya disposition to knit the browsgreat activity of the mental facultiesor else a wellmarked decline of the powers of the understandingan exaggeration of the normal conditions of thoughtor a reversal of the mental habits and sentiments such as a sudden aversion to some person hitherto beloved or some study long relished and pursued luminous jane asked leave to note these all down in her notebook mr hardie assented adroitly for he was thinking whether he could not sift some grain out of all this chaff should alfred blab his suspicions here were two gentlemen who would at all events help him to throw ridicule on them dr wycherley having politely aided jane hardie to note down the preliminary process of the incubation of disorders of the intellect resumed now sir your son appears to be in a very inchoate stage of the malady he has cerebral kephalalgia and insomnia and oh doctor said jane he knits his brows often and has given up his studies wont go back to oxford this term exactly and seeks isolation and is a prey to morbid distraction and reverie but has no palpable illusions has he not that i know of said mr hardie well but objected jane did not he say something to you very curious the other night about captain dodd and fourteen thousand pounds mr hardies blood ran cold no he stammered not that i remember oh yes he did papa you have forgotten it but at the time you were quite puzzled what he could meant and you did so she put her finger to her forehead and the doctors interchanged a meaning glance i believe you are right jenny said mr hardie taking the cue so unexpectedly offered him he did say some nonsense i could not make head nor tail of but we all have our crotchets there run away like a good girl and let me explain all this to our good friends here and mind not a word about it to alfred when she was gone he said gentlemen my son is over head and ears in love that is all ay erotic monomania is a very ordinary phase of insanity said dr wycherley his unreasonable passion for a girl he knows he can never marry makes him somewhat crotchety and cranky that and overstudy may have unhinged his mind a little suppose i send him abroad my good brother will find the means or we could advance it him i and the other trustees he comes into ten thousand pounds in a month or two the doctors exchanged a meaning look they then dissuaded him earnestly from the idea of continental travel coelum non animam mutant qui trans mare currunt said wycherley and osmond explained that alfred would brood abroad as well as at home if he went alone and dr wycherley summed up thus the most advisable course is to give him the benefit of the personal superintendence of some skilful physician possessed of means and appliances of every sort for soothing and restraining the specific malady mr hardie did not at first see the exact purport of this oleaginous periphrasis presently he caught a glimpse but said he thought confinement was hardly the thing to drive away melancholy not in all respects replied dr wycherley but on the other hand a little gentle restraint is the safest way of effecting a disruption of the fatal associations that have engendered and tend to perpetuate the disorder besides the medicinal appliances are invaluable including as they do the nocturnal and diurnal attendance of a psychophysical physician who knows the psychosomatic relation of body and mind and can apply physical remedies of the effect of which on the physical instrument of intelligence the grey matter of the brain we have seen so many examples the good doctor then feelingly deplored the inhumanity of parents and guardians in declining to subject their incubators to opportune and salutary restraint under the more than parental care of a psychosomatic physician on this head he got quite warm and inveighed against the abominable cruelty of the thing it is contrary said he to every principle of justice and humanity that a fellowcreature deranged perhaps only on one point should for the want of the early attention of those whose duty it is to watch over him linger out his existence separated from all who are dear to him and condemned without any crime to be a prisoner for life mr hardie was puzzled by this sentence in which the speakers usual method was reversed and the thought was bigger than the words oh said he at last i see we ought to incarcerate our children to keep them from being incarcerated that is one way of putting it with a vengence said mr osmond staring no what my good friend means is this where the patient is possessor of an income of such a character as to enable his friends to show a sincere affection by anticipating the consequences of neglected morbid phenomena of the brain there a lamentable want of humanity is exhibited by the persistent refusal to the patient on the part of his relatives of the incalculable advantage of the authoritative advice of a competent physician accompanied with the safeguards and preventives of but ere the mellifluous pleonast had done oiling his paradox with fresh polysyllables to make it slip into the bankers narrow understanding he met with a curious interruption jane hardie fluttered in to say a man was at the door accusing himself of being deranged how often this sort of coincidence occurs said osmond philosophically do not refuse him dear papa it is not for money he only wants you to give him an order to go into a lunatic asylum now there is a sensible man said dr wycherley well but objected mr hardie if he is a sensible man why does he want to go to an asylum oh they are all sensible at times observed mr osmond singularly so said dr wycherley warmly and he showed a desire to examine this paragon who had the sense to know he was out of his senses it would be but kind of you sir said jane poor poor man she added he did not like to come in and would they mind just going out to him oh no not in the least especially as you seem interested in him and they all three rose and went out together and found the petitioner at the front door who should it be but james maxley his beard was unshaven his face haggard and everything about him showed a man broken in spirit as well as fortune even his voice had lost half its vigour and whenever he had uttered a consecutive sentence or two his head dropped on his breast pitiably indeed this sometimes occurred in the middle of a sentence and then the rest of it died on his lips mr richard hardie was not prepared to encounter one of his unhappy creditors thus publicly and to shorten the annoyance would have dismissed him roughly but he dared not for maxley was no longer alone nor unfriended when jane left him to intercede for him a young man joined him and was now comforting him with kind words and trying to get him to smoke a cigar and this goodhearted young gentleman was the bankers son in the flesh and his opposite in spirit mr alfred hardie finding these two in contact the doctors interchanged demurest glances mr hardie asked maxley sullenly what he wanted of them well sir said maxley despondingly i have been to all the other magistrates in the borough for what with losing my money and what with losing my missus i think i baint quite right in my head i do see such curious things enough to make a bodys skin creep at times and down went his head on his chest well said mr hardie peevishly go on you went to the magistrates and what then maxley looked up and seemed to recover the thread why they said no they couldnt send me to the sylum not from home i must be a pauper first so then my neighbours they said i had better come to you and down went his head again well but said mr hardie you cannot expect me to go against the other magistrates why not sir you have had a hatful o money of me the other gentlemen hant had a farthing they owes me no service but you does nine hundred pounds worth if ye come to that there was no malice in this it was a plain brokenhearted mans notion of give and take but it was a homethrust all the same and mr hardie was visibly discountenanced and alfred more so mr osmond to relieve a situation so painful asked maxley rather hastily what were the curious things he saw maxley shuddered the unreasonablest beasts sir you ever saw or heard tell on mostly snakes and dragons cant stoop my head to do no work for them sir bless your heart if i was to leave you gentlemen now and go and dig for five minutes in my garden they would come about me as thick as slugs on cabbage why twas but yesteren i tried to hoe a bit and up come the fearfullest great fiery sarpint scared me so i heaved my hoe and laid on un properly presently i seemed to come out of a sort of a kind of a red mist into the clear and there laid my poor missuss favourite hen i had been and killed her for a sarpint he sighed then after a moments pause lowered his voice to a whisper now suppose i was to go and take some poor christian for one of these great bloody dragons i do see at odd times i might do him a mischief you know and not mean him no harm neither oh dooee take and have me locked up gentlemen dooee now tellee i aint fit to be about my poor head is so mazed well well said mr hardie ill give you an order for the union what make a pauper of me i cannot help it said the magistrate it is the routine and it was settled at a meeting of the bench last month that we must adhere to the rule as strictly as possible the asylum is so full and you know maxley it is not as if you were dangerous that i be sir i dont know what im a looking at or a doing would i ha gone and killed my poor susans hen if i hadnt a been beside myself and she in her grave poor dear no not for untold gold and i be fond of that tooused to be however but now i dont seem to care for money nor nothing else and his head dropped look here maxley old fellow said alfred sarcastically you must go to the workhouse and stay there till you hoe a pauper take him for a crocodile and kill him then you will get into an asylum whether the barkington magistrates like it or not that is the routine i believe and as reasonable as most routine dr wycherley admired alfred for this and whispered mr osmond how subtly they reason mr hardie did not deign to answer his son who indeed had spoken at him and not to him as for poor maxley he was in sad and sober earnest and could not relish nor even take in alfreds irony he lifted his head and looked mr hardie in the face you be a hard man said he trembling with emotion you robbed me and my missus of our all you ha broke her heart and turned my head and if i was to come and kill you twould only be clearing scores stead of that i comes to you like a lamb and says give me your name on a bit of paper and put me out of harms way no says you go to the workhouse be you in the workhouseyou that owes me nine hundred pounds and my dead missus with this he went into a rage took a packet out of his pocket and flung l of mr hardies paper at mr hardies head before any one could stop him but alfred saw his game stepped forward and caught it with one hand and with the dexterity of a wicketkeeper within a foot of his fathers nose hows that umpire said he then a little sternly dont do that again mr maxley or i shall have to give you a hidingto keep up appearances he then put the notes in his pocket and said quietly i shall give you your money for these before the year ends you wont be quite so mad as that i hope remonstrated his father but he made no reply they very seldom answered one another now oh said dr wycherley inspecting him like a human curiosity nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae nec parvum sine mixtura stultitiae retorted alfred in a moment and met his offensive gaze with a pointblank look of supercilious disdain then having shut him up he turned to osmond come said he prescribe for this poor fellow who asks for a hospital so routine gives him a workhouse come you know there is no limit to your skill and good nature you cured spot of the worms cure poor old maxley of his snakes oblige me that i will mr alfred said osmond heartily and wrote a prescription on a leaf of his memorandumbook remarking that though a simple purgative it had made short work of a great many serpents and dragons and not a few spectres and hobgoblins into the bargain the young gentleman thanked him graciously and said kindly to maxley get that made upheres a guineaand ill send somebody to see how you are tomorrow the poor man took the guinea and the prescription and his head drooped again and he slouched away dr wycherley remarked significantly that his conduct was worth imitating by all persons similarly situated and concluded oracularly prophylaxis is preferable to therapeusis or as porson would say prevention is better than cure with this parting blow the oxonian suddenly sauntered away unconscious it seemed of the existence of his companions i never saw a plainer case of incubation remarked dr wycherley with vast benevolence of manner maxleys oh no that is parochial it is your profoundly interesting son i alluded to did you notice his supercilious departure and his morbid celerity of repartee mr hardie replied with some little hesitation yes and excuse me i thought he had rather the best of the battle with you indubitably so replied dr wycherley they always do at least such is my experience if ever i break a lance of wit with an incubator i calculate with confidence on being unhorsed with abnormal rapidity and rare indeed are the instances in which my anticipations are not promptly and fully realised by a similar rule of progression the incubator is seldom a match for the confirmed maniac either in the light play of sarcasm the coruscations of wit or the severer encounters of dialectical ratiocination dear dear dear then how is one to know a genius from a madman inquired jane by sending for a psychological physician if i understand the doctor right the two things are not opposed remarked mr hardie dr wycherley assented and made a remarkable statement in confirmation one half of the aggregate of the genius of the country is at present under restraint fortunately for the community and still more fortunately for itself he then put on his gloves and with much kindness but solemnity warned mr hardie not to neglect his sons case nor to suppose that matters could go on like this without disintegrating or disorganising the grey matter of the brain i admit said he that in some recorded cases of insanity the brain on dissection has revealed no signs of structural or functional derangement and that on the other hand considerable encephalic disorganisation has been shown to have existed in other cases without aberration or impairment of the reason but such phenomena are to be considered as pathological curiosities with which the empiric would fain endeavour to disturb the sound general conclusions of science the only safe mode of reasoning on matters so delicate and profound is a priori and as it may safely be assumed as a selfevident proposition that disturbed intelligence bears the same relation to the brain as disordered respiration does to the lungs it is not logical reasoning a priori to assume the possibility that the studious or other mental habits of a kephalalgic and gifted youth can be reversed and erotic monomania germinate with all the morbid phenomena of isolation dejection of the spirits and abnormal exaltation of the powers of wit and ratiocination without some considerable impairment derangement disturbance or modification of the psychical motorial and sensorial functions of the great cerebral ganglion but it would be equally absurd to presuppose that these several functions can be disarranged for months without more or less disorganisation of the medullary or even of the cineritious matter of the encephialon thereforedissection of your talented son would doubtless reveal at this moment either steatonatous or atheromatous deposits in the cerebral bloodvessels or an encysted abscess probably of no very recent origin or at the least considerable inspissation and opacity of the membranes of the encephalon or more or less pulpy disorganisation of one or other of the hemispheres of the brain good morning good morning sir and a thousand thanks for your friemidly interest in my unhappy boy the psychocerebrals took their departure psychocerebral for went away and left jane hardie brimful of anxiety alfred was not there to dispose of the tirade in two words petitio principii and so smoke on and not being an university woman she could not keep her eye on the original assumption while following the series of inferences the learned doctor built so neatly story by story on the foundation of the quicksand of a loose conjecture so novices sitting at a conjuror see him take a wedding ring and put it in a little box before a lady then cross the theatre with another little box and put that before another lady hey presto pass in box is discovered a weddingring which is instantly assumed to be the ring on this the green minds are fixed and with this is sham business done box containing the real ring all the time is overlooked and the confederate in livery or not does what he likes with it imprisons it in an orangefor the good of its health so poor argan when fleurant enumerates the consequences of his omitting a singledose shall i sayis terrified by the threatened disorders which succeed to each other logically enough all the absurdity being in the first link of the chain and from that his mind is diverted now not a word of this to alfred said mr hardie i shall propose him a little foreign tour to amuse his mind yes but papa if some serious change is really going on inside his poor head mr hardie smiled sarcastically dont you see that if the mind can wound the brain the mind can cure it then after a while he said parentally my child i must give you a lesson men of the world use enthusiastslike those two i have just been drawing outfor their tools we dont let them make tools of us osmond you know is jackal to an asylum in london dr wycherley i have heard keeps two or three such establishments by himself or his agents blinded by selfinterest and that of their cliquewhat an egotistical world it is to be surethey would confine a melancholy youth in a gloomy house among afflicted persons and give him nothing to do but brood and so turn the scale against his reason but i have my childrens interest at heart more than my own i shall send him abroad and so amuse his mind with fresh objects break off sad associations and restore him to a brilliant career i count on you to second me in my little scheme for his good that i will papa somehow i dont know why he is coolish to me he does not understand you as i do my own papa but he is affectionate with you i think oh yes more than ever trouble has drawn us closer papa in the midst of our sorrow how much we have to be thankful for to the giver of all good things yes little angel and you must improve heavens goodness by working on your brothers affection and persuading him to this continental tour thus appealed to jane promised warmly and the man of the world finding he had a blind and willing instrument in the one creature he loved kissed her on the forehead and told her to run away for here was mr skinner who no doubt wanted to speak on business skinner who had in fact been holding respectfully aloof for some time came forward on janes retiring and in a very obsequious tone requested a private interview mr hardie led the way into the little diningroom they were no sooner alone than skinner left off fawning very abruptly and put on a rugged resolute manner that was new to him i am come for my commission said he sturdily mr hardie looked an inquiry oh you dont know what i mean of course said the little clerk almost brutally ive waited and waited to see if you would have the decency and the gratitude and the honesty to offer me a trifle out of it but i see i might wait till doomsday before you would ever think of thinking of anybody but yourself so now shell out without more words or ill blow the gaff the little wretch raised his voice louder and louder at every sentence hush hush skinner said mr hardie anxiously you are under some delusion when did ever i decline to recognise your services i always intended to make you a present a handsome present then why didnt ye do it without being forced come sir you cant draw the wool over noah skinners eyes i have had you watched and you are looking towards the u s and that is too big a country for me to hunt you in im not to be trifled with im not to be palavered give me a thousand pounds of it this moment or ill blow the whole concern and you along with it a thousand pounds now look at that shrieked skinner serves me right for not saying seven thousand what right have you to a shilling of it more than i have if i had the luck to be a burglars pal instead of a bankers i should have half give it me this moment or ill go to albion villa and have you took up for a thief as you are but i havent got it on me thats a lie you carry it where he did close to your heart i can see it bulge there job was a patient man but his patience went at last with this he ran to the window and threw it open hardie entreated him to be calm ill give it you skinner said he and with pleasure if you will give me some security that you will not turn round as soon as you have got it and be my enemy enemy of a gent that pays me a thousand pounds nonsense why should i we are in the same boat behave like a man and you know you have nothing to fear from me but i willnotgo halves in a theft for nothing would you come how is it to be peace or war will you be content with thirteen thousand pounds that dont belong to you not a shilling of it or will you go to jail a felon and lose it every penny mr hardie groaned aloud but there was no help for it skinner was on sale and must be bought he took out two notes for five hundred pounds each and laid them on the table after taking their numbers skinners eyes glistened thank you sir said he he put them in his pocket then he said quietly now you have taken the numbers sir so ill trouble you for a line to make me safe against the criminal law you are a deep one you might say i robbed you that is a very unworthy suspicion skinner and a childish one oh it is diamond cut diamond a single line sir just to say that in return for his faithful services you have given noah skinner two notes for l nos and with all my hearton your giving me a receipt for them it was skinners turn to hesitate after reflecting however on all the possible consequences he saw nothing to fear so he consented the business completed a magic change took place in the little clerk now we are friends again sir and ill give you a piece of advice mind your eye with mr alfred he is down on us what do you mean inquired mr hardie with illdisguised anxiety ill tell you sir he met me this morning and says he to me skinner old boy i want to speak a word to you he puts his hands on my shoulder and turns me round and says he all at one time the fourteen thousand pounds you might have knocked me down with a feather and he looked me through like a gimlet mind ye come now says he you see i know all make a clean breast of it so then i saw he didnt know all and i brazened up a bit told him i hadnt a notion what he meant oh yes i did he said captain dodds fourteen thousand pounds it had passed through my hands then i began to funk again at his knowing that perhaps he only guessed it after all but at the time i thought he knew it i was flustered ye see but i said id look at the books but i didnt think his deposit was anything like that you little equivocating humbug says he and which was better to tell the truths at once and let captain dodd who never did me any harm have his own or to hear it told me in the felons dock those were his words sir and they made my blood run cold and if he had gone on at me like that i should have split i know i should but he just said there your face has given your tongue the lie you havent brains enough to play the rogue oh and another thinghe said he wouldnt talk to the sparrowhawk any more when there was the kite hard by so by that i guess your turn is coming sir so mind your eye and then he turned his back on me with a look as if i was so much dirt but i didnt mind that i was glad to be shut of him at any price this intelligence discomposed mr hardie terribly it did away with all hope that alfred meant to keep his suspicions to himself why did you not tell me this before said he reproachfully skinners sharp visage seemed to sharpen as he replied because i wanted a thousand pounds first curse your low cunning skinner laughed goodbye sir take care of yourself and ill take care of mine im afraid of mr alfred and the stone jug so im off to london and there ill unskinner myself into mr something or other and make my thousand pounds breed ten and he whipped out leaving his master filled with rage and dismay outwitted even by this little wretch he was now accountable for fourteen thousand pounds and had only thirteen thousand left if forced to reimburse so that it was quite on the cards for him to lose a thousand pounds by robbing his neighbour and risking his own immortal jewel this galled him to the quick and altogether his equable temper began to give way it had already survived half the iron of his nerves he walked up and down the parlour chafing like an irritated lion in which state of his mind the one enemy he now feared and hated walked quietly into the room and begged for a little serious conversation with him it is like your effrontery said mr hardie i wonder you are not ashamed to look your father in the face having wronged nobody i can look anybody in the face replied alfred looking him in the face pointblank at this swift rejoinder mr hardie felt like a too confident swordsman who attacking in a passion suddenly receives a prick that shows him his antagonist is not one to be trifled with he was on his guard directly and said coldly you have been belying me to my very clerk no sir you are mistaken i have never mentioned your name to your clerk mr hardie reflected on what skinner had told him and found he had made another false move he tried again nor to the dodds with an incredulous sneer nor to the dodds replied alfred calmly what not to miss julia dodd no sir i have seen her but once sincei discovered about the fourteen thousand pounds what fourteen thousand pounds inquired mr hardie innocently what fourteen thousand pounds repeated the young man disdainfully then suddenly turning on his father with red brow and flashing eyes the fourteen thousand pounds captain dodd brought home from india the fourteen thousand pounds i heard him claim of you with curses ay miserable son and miserable man that i am i heard my own father called a villain and what did my father reply did you hurl the words back into your accusers throat no you whispered hush hush ill bring it you down oh what a hell shame is mr hardie turned pale and almost sick with these words of alfreds fled all hope of ever deceiving him there there said the young man lowering his voice from rage to profound sorrow i dont come here to quarrel with my father nor to insult him god knows and i entreat you for both our sakes not to try my temper too hard by these childish attempts to blind me and sir pray dismiss from your mind the notion that i have disclosed to any living soul my knowledge of this horrible secret on the contrary i have kept it gnawing my heart and almost maddening me at times for my own personal satisfaction i have applied a test both to you and skinner but that is all i have done i have not told dear julia nor any of her family and now if you will only listen to me and do what i entreat you to do she shall never know oh never oho thought mr hardie he comes with a proposal ill hear it anyway he then took a line well known to artful men he encouraged alfred to show his hand maintaining a complete reserve as to his own you say you did not communicate your illusion about this fourteen thousand pounds to julia dodd that night may i ask then without indiscretion what did pass between you two i will tell you sir she saw me standing there and asked me in her own soft angel voice if i was unhappy i told her i must be a poor creature if i could be happy then she asked me with some hesitation i thought why i was unhappy i said because i could not see the path of honour and duty clear that at least was the purport then she told me that in all difficulties she had found the best way was to pray to god to guide her and she begged me to lay my care before him and ask his counsel and then i thanked her and bade her goodnight and she me and that was all that passed between us two unhappy lovers whom you have made miserable and even cool to one another but not hostile to you and you played the spy on us sir and misunderstood us as spies generally do ah sir a few months ago you would not have condescended to that mr hardie coloured but did not reply he had passed from the irritable into the quietly vindictive stage alfred then deprecated further discussion of what was past and said abruptly i have an offer to make you in a very short time i shall have ten thousand pounds i will not resign my whole fortune that would be unjust to myself and my wife and i loathe and despise injustice in all its forms however romantic or plausible but if you will give the dodds their l i will share my little fortune equally with you and thank you and bless you consider sir with your abilities and experience five thousand pounds may yet be the nucleus of a fortune a fortune built on an honourable foundation i know you will thrive with my five thousand pounds ten times more than with their fourteen thousand and enjoy the blessing of blessings a clear conscience now this offer was no sooner made than mr hardie shut his face and went to mental arithmetic like one doing a sum behind a thick door he would have taken ten thousand but five thousand did not much tempt him besides would it be five thousand clear he already owed alfred two thousand five hundred it flashed through him that a young man who loathed and despised injusticeeven to himselfwould not consent to be diddled by him out of one sum while making him a present of another and then there was skinners thousand to be reimbursed he therefore declined in these terms this offer shows me you are sincere in these strange notions you have taken up i am sorry for it it looks like insanity these nocturnal illusions these imaginary sights and sounds come of brooding on a single idea and often usher in a calamity one trembles to think of you have made me a proposal i make you one take a couple of hundred pounds ill get it from your trustees and travel the continent for four months enlarge and amuse your mind with the contemplation of nature and manners and customs and if that does not clear this phantom l out of your head i am much mistaken alfred replied that foreign travel was his dream but he could not leave barkington while there was an act of justice to be done then do me justice boy said mr hardie with wonderful dignity all things considered instead of brooding on your one fantastical idea and shutting out all rational evidence to the contrary take the trouble to look through my books and they will reveal to you a fortune not of fourteen thousand but of eighty thousand pounds honourably sacrificed in the vain struggle to fulfil my engagements who do you think will believe against such evidence the preposterous tale you have concocted against your poor father already the tide is turning and all who have seen the accounts of the bank pity me they will pity me still more if ever they hear my own flesh and blood insults me in the moment of my fall sees me ruined by my honesty and living in a hovel yet comes into that poor but honest abode and stabs me to the heart by accusing me of stealing fourteen thousand pounds a sum that would have saved me if i could only have laid my hands on it he hid his face to conceal its incongruous expression and heaved a deep sigh alfred turned his head away and groaned after a while he rose from his seat and went to the door but seemed reluctant to go he cast a longing lingering look on his father and said beseechingly oh think you are not my flesh and blood more than i am yours is all the love to be on my side have i no influence even when right is on my side then he suddenly turned and threw himself impetuously on his knees your father was the soul of honour your son loathed fraud and injustice from his cradle you stand between two generations of hardies and belong to neither do but reflect one moment how bright a thing honour is how short and uncertain a thing life is how sure a thing retribution is in this world or the next it is your guardian angel that kneels before you now and not your son oh for christs sake for my mothers sake listen to my last appeal you dont know me i cannot compound with injustice pity me pity her i love pity yourself you young viper cried the father stung with remorse but not touched with penitence get away you amorous young hypocrite get out of my house get out of my sight or i shall spurn you and curse you at my feet enough said alfred rising and turning suddenly calm as a statue let us be gentlemen if you please even though we must be enemies goodbye my father that was and he walked gently out of the room and as he passed the window mr hardie heard his great heart sob he wiped his forehead with his handkerchief a hard tussle thought he and with my own unnatural ungrateful flesh and blood but i have won it he hasnt told the dodds he never will and if he did who would believe him or them at dinner there was no alfred but after dinner a note to jane informing her he had taken lodgings in the town and requesting her to send his books and clothes in the evening jane handed the note to her father and sighed deeply watching his face as he read it she saw him turn rather pale and look more furrowed than ever papa said she what does it all mean i am thinking then after a long pause he ground his teeth and said it meanswar war between my own son and me chapter xxvi long before this open rupture jane hardie had asked her father sorrowfully whether she was to discontinue her intimacy with the dodds she thought of course he would say yes and it cost her a hard struggle between inclination and filial duty to raise the question but mr hardie was anxious her friendship with that family should continue it furnished a channel of news and in case of detection might be useful to avert or soften hostilities so he answered rather sharply on no account the dodds are an estimable family pray be as friendly with them as ever you can jane coloured with pleasure at this most unexpected reply but her wakeful conscience reminded her this answer was given in ignorance of her attachment to edward dodd and urged her to confession but at that nature recoiled edward had not openly declared his love to her so modest pride as well as modest shame combined with female cowardice to hold back the avowal so then miss tender conscience tormented herself and recorded the struggle in her diary but briefly and in terms vague and typical not a word about a young manor crossed in lovebut one obscure and hasty slap at the carnal affections and a good deal about the saints in prison and the battle of armageddon yet to do her justice laxity of expression did not act upon her conduct and warp that as it does most mystical speakers to obey her father to the letter she maintained a friendly correspondence with julia dodd exchanging letters daily but not to disobey him in the spirit she ceased to visit albion villa thus she avoided edward and extracted from the situation the utmost selfdenial and the least possible amount of carnal pleasure as she naively denominated an interchange of worldly affection however distant and respectful one day she happened to mention her diary and say it was a present comfort to her and instructive to review julia catching at every straw of consolation said she would keep one too and asked a sight of janes for a model no dear friend said jane a diary should be ones self on paper this was fortunate it precluded that servile imitation in which her sex excels even mine and consequently the two records reflect two good girls instead of one in two skins and may be trusted to conduct this narrative forward and relieve its monotony a little only of course the reader must not expect to see the plot of a story carried minutely out in two crude compositions written with an object so distinct he must watch for glimpses and make the most of indications nor is this an excessive demand upon his intelligence for if he cannot do this with a book how will he do it in real life where male and female characters reveal their true selves by glimpses only and the gravest and most dramatic events give the diviner so few and faint signs of their coming extracts from julia dodds diary dec thit is all over they have taken papa away to an asylum and the house is like a grave but for our outbursts of sorrow just before he went away the medal cameoh no i cannot poor poor mamma p m in the midst of our affliction heaven sent us a ray of comfort the kindest letter from a lady a perfect stranger it came yesterday but now i have got it to copy oh bless it and the good kind writer dear madami scarcely know whether to hope or to fear that your good husband may have mentioned my name to you however he is just the man to pass over both my misbehaviour and his own gallantry so i beg permission to introduce myself i and my little boy were passengers by the agra i was spoiled by a long residence in india and gave your husband sore trouble by resisting discipline refusing to put out my light at nine oclock and in short by being an unreasonable woman or rather a spoiled child well all my little attempts at a feud failed captain dodd did his duty and kept his temper provokingly the only revenge he took was a noble one he jumped into the sea after my darling freddy and saved him from a watery grave and his mother from madness or death yet he was himself hardly recovered from a wound he had received in defending us all against pirates need i say more to one who is herself a mother you will know how our little misunderstanding ended after that as soon as we were friends i made him talk of his family yourself edward julia i seem to know you all when the ruffian who succeeded our good captain had wrecked poor us and then deserted us your husband resumed the command and saved freddy and me once more by his courage his wonderful coolness and his skill since then the mouse has been at work for the lion i despair of conveying any pleasure by it to a character so elevated as captain dodd his reward must be his own conscience but we poor little women like external shows do we not and so i thought a medal of the humane society might give some pleasure to you and miss dodd never did medal nor order repose on a nobler heart the case was so strong and so well supported that the society did not hesitate and you will receive it very soon after this you will be surprised dear madam at all this from a stranger to yourself and will perhaps set it down to a wish to intrude on your acquaintance well then dear madam you will not be far wrong i should like much to know one whose character i already seem acquainted with and to convey personally my gratitude and admiration of your husband i could pour it out more freely to you you know than to himi am dear madam yours very faithfully louisa beresford and the medal came about an hour before the fly to take him away his dear name was on it and his brave courageous acts oh shall i ever be old enough and hard enough to speak of this without stopping to cry we fastened it round his dear neck with a ribbon mamma would put it inside his clothes for fear the silver should tempt some wretch i should never have thought of that is there a creature so base and we told the men how he had gained it they were servants of the asylum and we showed them how brave and good he was and would be again if they would be kind to him and cure him and mamma bribed them with money to use him kindly i thought they would be offended and refuse it but they took it and their faces showed she was wiser than i am he keeps away from us too it is nearly a fortnight now dec thaunt eve left today mamma kept her room and could not speak to her cannot forgive her interfering between papa and her it does seem strange that any one but mamma should be able to send papa out of the house and to such a place but it is the law and edward who is all good sense says it was necessary he says mamma is unjust grief makes her unreasonable i dont know who is in the right and i dont much care but i know i am sorry for aunt eve and very very sorry for mamma dec thi am an egotist found myself out this morning and it is a good thing to keep a diary it was overpowered at first by grief for mamma but now the house is sad and quiet i am always thinking of him and that is egotism egotism the abstract quality evolved from the concrete term egotist by feminine art without the aid of grammar why does he stay away so i almost wish i could think it was coldness or diminished affection for i fear something worse something to make him wretched those dreadful words papa spoke before he was afflicted words i will never put on paper but they ring in my ears still they appal me and then found at their very door ah and i knew i should find him near that house and now he keeps away dec thall day trying to comfort mamma she made a great effort and wrote to mrs beresford poor mammas letter dear madamyour kind and valued letter reached us in deep affliction and i am little able to reply to you as you deserve my poor husband is very ill so ill that he no longer remembers the past neither the brave acts that have won him your esteem nor even the face of his loving and unhappy wife who now thanks you with many tears for your sweet letter heartbroken as my children and i are we yet derive some consolation from it we have tied the medal round his neck madam and thank you far more than we can find words to express in conclusion i pray heaven that in your bitterest hour you may find the consolation you have administered to us no no i pray you may never never stand in such need of comforti am dear madam yours gratefully and sincerely lucy dodd dec th sundayat st annes in the morning tried hard to apply the sermon he spoke of griefs but so coldly surely he never felt one he was not there mem always pray against wandering thoughts on entering church dec tha diary is a dreadful thing everything must go down now and amongst the rest that the poor are selfish i could not interest one of mine in mammas sorrows no they must run back to their own little sordid troubles about money and things i was so provoked with mrs jackson she owes mamma so much that i left her hastily and that was impatience i had a mind to go back to her but would not and that was pride where is my christianity a kind letter from jane hardie but no word of him dec thtoday edward told me plump i must not go on taking things out of the house for the poor mamma gave me the reason we are poor ourselves thanks to and then she stopped does she suspect how can she she did hear not those two dreadful words of papas they are like two arrows in my heart and so we are poor she says we have scarcely anything to live upon after paying the two hundred and fifty pounds a year for papa dec tha comforting letter from jane she sends me hebrews xii and says let us take a part of the bible and read two chapters prayerfully at the same hour of the day will ten oclock in the morning suit you and if so will you choose where to begin i will sweet friend i will and then though some cruel mystery keeps us apart our souls will be together over the sacred page as i hope they will one day be together in heaven yours will at any rate wrote back yes and a thousand thanks and should like to begin with the psalms they are sorrowful and so are we and i must pray not to think too much of him if everything is to be put down one does i cried long and bitterly to find i had written that i must pray to god against him dec thit is plain he never means to come again mamma says nothing but that is out of pity for me i have not read her dear face all these years for nothing she is beginning to think him unworthy when she thinks of him at all there is a mystery a dreadful mystery may he not be as mystified too and perhaps tortured like me with doubts and suspicions they say he is pale and dejected poor thing but then oh why not come to me and say so shall i write to him no i will cut my hand off sooner dec tha blessed letter from jane she says letter writing on ordinary subjects is a sad waste of time and very unpardonable among his people and so it is and my weak hope daily disappointed that there may be something in her letter only shows how inferior i am to my beloved friend she says i should like to fix another hour for us two to meet at the throne together will five oclock suit you we dine at six but i am never more than half an hour dressing the friendship of this saint and her bright example is what heaven sends me in infinite mercy and goodness to sooth my aching heart a little for him i shall never see again i have seen him this very evening it was a beautiful night i went to look atthe world to come i call itfor i believe the redeemed are to inhabit those very stars hereafter and visit them all in turnand this world i now find is a world of sorrow and disappointmentso i went on the balcony to look at a better one and oh it seemed so holy so calm so pure that heavenly world i gazed and stretched my hands towards it for ever so little of its holiness and purity and that moment i heard a sigh i looked and there stood a gentleman just outside our gate and it was him i nearly screamed and my heart beat so he did not see me for i had come out softly and his poor head was down down upon his breast and he used to carry it so high a little little while agotoo high some said but not i i looked and my misgivings melted away it flashed on me as if one of those stars had written it with its own light in my heartthere stands grief not guilt and before i knew what i was about i had whispered alfred the poor boy started and ran towards me but stopped short and sighed again my heart yearned but it was not for me to make advances to him after his unkindness so i spoke to him as coldly as ever i could and i said you are unhappy he looked up to me and then i saw even by that light that he is enduring a bitter bitter struggle so pale so worn so draggednow how many times have i cried this last month more than in all the rest of my life a great dealunhappy he said i must be a contemptible thing if i was not unhappy and then he asked me should not i despise him if he was happy i did not answer that but i asked him why he was unhappy and when i had i was half frightened for he never evades a question the least bit he held his head higher still and said i am unhappy because i cannot see the path of honour then i babbled something i forget what then he went on like thisah i never forget what he sayshe said cicero says aequitas ipsa lucet per se something significat something else and he repeated it slowly for mehe knows i know a little latin and told me that was as much as to say justice is so clear a thing that whoever hesitates must be on the road of wrong and yet he said bitterly i hesitate and doubt in a matter of right and wrong like an academic philosopher weighing and balancing mere speculative straws those were his very words and so said he i am miserable deserving to be miserable dubitatio cogitationem significat injuriae then i ventured to remind him that he and i and all christian souls had a resource not known to heathen philosophers however able and i said dear alfred when i am in doubt and difficulty i go and pray to him to guide me aright have you done so no that had never occurred to him but he would if i made a point of it and at any rate he could not go on in this way i should soon see him again and once his mind was made up no shrinking from mere consequences he promised me then we bade one another good night and he went off holding his head as proudly as he used and poor silly me fluttered and nearly hysterical as soon as i quite lost sight of him dec that church in the morning a good sermon notes and analysis in the evening janes clergyman preached she came going out i asked her a question about what we had heard but she did not answer me at parting she told me she made it a rule not to speak coming from church not even about the sermon this seemed austere to poor me but of course she is right oh that i was like her dec thedward is coming out this boy that one has taught all the french all the dancing and nearly all the latin he knows turns out to be ones superior infinitely i mean in practical good sense mamma had taken her pearls to the jeweller and borrowed two hundred pounds he found this out and objected she told him a part of it was required to keep him at oxford oh indeed said he and we thought of course there was an end but next morning he was off before breakfast and the day after he returned from oxford with his caution money forty pounds and gave it mamma she had forgotten all about it and he had taken his name off the college books and left the university for ever the poor gentle tears of mortification ran down his mothers cheeks and i hung round her neck and scolded him like a vixenas i am we might have spared tears and fury both for he is neither to be melted nor irritated by poor little us he kissed us and coaxed us like a superior being and set to work in his quiet sober ponderous way and proved us a couple of fools to our entire satisfaction and that without an unkind word for he is as gentle as a lamb and as strong as ten thousand elephants he took the money back and brought the pearls home again and he has written soyez de votre siecle in great large letters and has pasted it on all our three bedroom doors inside and he has been all these years quietly cutting up the morning advertiser and arranging the slips with wonderful skill and method he calls it digesting the tiser and you cant ask for any modern information great or small but hell find you something about it in this digest such a folio it takes a man to open and shut it and he means to be a sort of little papa in this house and mamma means to let him and indeed it is so sweet to be commanded besides it saves thinking for oneself and that is such a worry dec thyes they have settled it we are to leave here and live in lodgings to save servants how we are to exist even so mamma cannot see but edward can he says we two have got popular talents and he knows the markets what does that mean i wonder and the world in general i asked him wherever he picked it up his knowledge he said in the tiser i asked him would he leave the place where she lives he looked sad but said yes for the good of us all so he is better than i am but who is not i wasted an imploring look on him but not on mamma she looked back to me and then said sadly wait a few days edward formy sake that meant for poor credulous julias who still believes in him my sweet mother dec sttold mamma today i would go for a governess to help her since we are all ruined she kissed me and trembled but she did not say no so it will come to that he will be sorry when i do go i think i shall find courage to send him a line just to say i am sure he is not to blame for withdrawing indeed how could i ever marry a man whose father i have heard my father call the pen was drawn through the rest dec nda miserable day low spirited and hysterical we are really going away edward has begun to make packingcases i stood over him and sighed and asked him questions he said he was going to take unfurnished rooms in london send up what furniture is absolutely necessary and sell the rest by auction with the lease of our dear dear house where we were all so happy once so what with his knowledge of the markets and the world and his sense and his strong will we have only to submit and then he is so kind too dont cry little girl he said not but what i could turn on the waters myself if there was anything to be gained by it shall i cry ju said he or shall i whistle i think ill whistle and he whistled a tune right through while he worked with a heart as sick as my own perhaps poor edward dec rdmy christian friend has her griefs too but then she puts them to profit she says today we are both tasting the same fleshcrucifying but soulprofiting experience her every word is a rebuke to me torn at this solemn season of the year with earthly passions went down after reading her letter and played and sang the gloria in excelsis of pergolesi with all my soul so then i repeated it and burst out crying in the middle oh shame shame dec thedward started for london at five in the morning to take a place for us the servants were next told and received warning the one we had the poorest opinion of she is such a flirt cried and begged mamma to let her share our fallen fortunes and said she could cook a little and would do her best i kissed her violently and quite forgot i was a young lady till she herself reminded me and she looked frightened at mamma but mamma only smiled through her tears and said think of it quietly sarah before you commit yourself i am now sitting in my old room cold as a stone for i have packed up some things so the first step is actually taken oh if i but knew that he was happy then i could endure anything but how can i think so well i will go and never tell a soul what i suspect and he cannot tell even if he knows for it is his father jane too avoids all mention of her own father and brother more than is natural oh if i could only be a child again regrets are vain i will cease even to record them these diaries feed ones selfishness and the unfortunate passion that will make me a bad daughter and an ungrateful soldier of him who was born as tomorrow to your knees false christian to your knees i am calmer now and feel resigned to the will of heaven or benumbed or something i will pack this box and then go down and comfort my mother and visit my poor people perhaps for the last time ah me a knock at the street door his knock i know every echo of his hand and his foot where is my composure now i flutter like a bird i will not go down he will think i love him so at least i will wait till he has nearly gone elizabeth has come to say i am wanted in the drawingroom so i must go down whether i like or no bedtime oh that i had the pen of a writer to record the scene i have witnessed worthily when i came in i found mamma and him both seated in dead silence he rose and looked at me and i at him and years seemed to have rolled over his face since last i saw it i was obliged to turn my head away i curtseyed to him distantly and may heaven forgive me for that and we sat down and presently turned round and all looked at one another like the ghosts of the happy creatures we once were altogether then alfred began not in his old imperative voice but scarce above a whisper and oh the words such as none but himself in the wide world would have spokeni love him better than ever i pity him i adore him he is a scholar he is a chevalier he is the soul of honour he is the most unfortunate and proudest gentleman beneath the sun oh my darling my darling he said mrs dodd and you miss dodd whom i loved before i lost the right to ask you to be mine and whom i shall love to the last hour of my miserable existence i am come to explain my own conduct to you and to do you an act of simple justice too long delayed to begin with myself you must know that my understanding is of the academic school i incline to weigh proofs before i make up my mind but then i differ from that school in this that i cannot think myself to an eternal standstill such an expression but what does that matter it was his i am a man of action in hamlets place i should have either turned my ghost into ridicule or my uncle into a ghost so i kept away from you while in doubt but now i doubt no longer i take my line ladies you have been swindled out of a large sum of money my blood ran cold at these words surely nothing on earth but a man could say this right out like that mamma and i looked at one another and what did i see in her face for the first time why that she had her suspicions too and had been keeping them from me pitying angel he went on captain dodd brought home several thousand pounds mamma said yes and i think she was going to say how much but he stopped her and made her write the amount in an envelope while he took another and wrote in it with his pencil he took both envelopes to me and asked me to read them out in turn i did and mammas said fourteen thousand pounds and his said fourteen thousand pounds mamma looked such a look at me then he turned to me miss dodd do you remember that night you and i met at richard hardies door well scarce five minutes before that your father was standing on our lawn and called to the man who was my father in a loud voiceit rings in my ears nowhardie villain give me back my money my fourteen thousand pounds give me my childrens money or may your children die before your eyes ah you wince to hear me whisper these dreadful words what if you had been where i was and heard them spoken and in a terrible voice the voice of despair the voice of truth soon a window opened cautiously and a voice whispered hush ill bring it you down and this voice was the voice of fear of dishonesty and of richard hardie he turned deadly white when he said this and i cried to mamma oh stop him stop him and she said alfred think what you are saying why do you tell us what we had better never know he answered directly because it is the truth and because i loathe injustice some time afterwards i taxed mr richard hardie with this fourteen thousand pounds and his face betrayed him i taxed his clerk skinner and skinners face betrayed him and he fled the town that very night my mother looked much distressed and said to what end do you raise this pitiable subject your father is a bankrupt and we but suffer with the rest no no said he i have looked through the bankrupts books and there is no mention of the sum and then who brought captain dodd here skinner and skinner is his detected confederate it is clear to me poor captain dodd trusted that sum to us before he had the fit beyond this all is conjecture mamma looked at me again and said what am i to do or say i screamed do nothing say nothing oh pray pray make him hold his tongue and let the vile money go it is not his fault do said the obstinate creature why tell edward and let him employ a sharp attorney you have a supple antagonist and a daring one need i say i have tried persuasion and even bribes but he defies me set an attorney on him or the police fiat justitia ruat coelum i put both hands out to him and burst out oh alfred why did you tell a son expose his own father for shame for shame i have suspected it all long ago but i would never have told he started a little but said miss dodd you were very generous to me but that is not exactly a reason why i should be a cur to you and an accomplice in a theft by which you suffer i have no pretensions to religion like my sister so i cant afford to tamper with plain right and wrong what look calmly on and see one man defraud another i cant do it see you defrauded you mrs dodd for whom i profess affection and friendship you miss dodd for whom i profess love and constancy stand and see you swindled into poverty of what do you think i am made my stomach rises against it my blood boils against it my flesh creeps at it my soul loathes it then after this great burst he seemed to turn so feeble oh said he faltering i know what i have done i have signed the death warrant of our love dear to me as life but i cant help it oh julia julia my lost love you can never look on me again you must not love a man you cannot marry cheat hardies wretched son but what could i do fate offers me but the miserable choice of desolation or cowardly rascality i choose desolation and i mean to stand by my choice like a man so goodbye ladies the poor proud creature rose from his seat and bowed stiffly and haughtily to us both and was going away without another word and i do believe for ever but his soul had been too great for his body his poor lips turned pale and he staggered and would have fallen but mamma screamed to me and she he loves so dearly and abandons so cruelly woke from a stupor of despair and flew and caught him fainting in these arms chapter xxvii we laid the poor proud creature on the sofa and bathed his face with eau de cologne he spoke directly and said that was nice and his head his head and i dont think he was ever quite insensible but he did not know what was going on for presently he opened his eyes wide and stared at us so and then closed them with oh such a sigh it swelled my heart almost to bursting and to think i could say nothing but mamma soothed him and insisted on his keeping quiet for he wanted to run away from us she was never so good to him before she said my dear child you have my pity and my esteem alas that at your age you should be tried like this how few in this sorry world would have acted like you i should have sided with my own flesh and blood for one what right or wrong he asked yes said she right or wrong then she turned to me julia shall all the generosity be on his side i kissed her and clung to her but dared not speak but i was mad enough to hope i scarcely know what till she said in the same kind sorrowful voice i agree with you you can never be my son nor julias husband but as for that money it revolts me to proceed to extremes against one who after all is your father my poor poor chivalrous boy but she would decide nothing without edward he had taken his fathers place in this house so then i gave all up for edward is made of iron alfred was clearer sighted than i and never had a hope he put his arm round mamma and kissed her and she kissed him and he kissed my hand and crept away and i heard his step on the stair and on the road ever so far and life seemed ended for me when i heard it no more edward has come home mamma told him all he listened gravely i hung upon his hips and at last the oracle spoke and said this is a nice muddle more we could not get from him he must sleep on it o suspense you torture he had seen a place he thinks will suit us it is a bad omen his saying that so soon after as i went to bed i could not help whispering if he and i are parted so will you and jane the cruel boy answered me out loud thank you little girl that is a temptation and you have put me on my guard oh how hard it is to understand a man they are so impracticable with their justice and things i came away with my cheeks burning and my heart like a stone to bed but not to sleep my poor poor unhappy noble alfred dec thmamma and edward have discussed it they say nothing to me can they have written to him i go about my duties like a ghost and pray for submission to the divine will dec thtoday as i was reading by main force to mrs eagletons sick girl came sarah all in a hurry with i was wanted miss but i would finish my chapter and o how hard the devil tried to make me gabble it so i clenched my teeth at him and read it as if i was spelling it and then didnt i fly he was there and they all sat waiting for me i was hot and cold all at the same time and he rose and bowed to me and i curtseyed to him and sat down and took my work and didnt know one bit what i was doing and our new oracle edward laid down the law like anything look here hardie said he if anybody but you had told us about this fourteen thousand pounds i should have set the police on your governor before now but it seems to me a shabby thing to attack a father on the sons information especially when its out of love for one of us he has denounced his own flesh and blood no no said alfred eagerly out of love of justice ah you think so my fine fellow but you would not have done it for a stranger said edward then he went on of all blunders the worst is to fall between two stools look here mamma we decide for the sons sake not to attack the father after that it would be very inconsistent to turn the cold shoulder to the son another thing who suffers most by this fraud why the man that marries julia alfred burst out impetuously oh prove that to me and let me be that sufferer edward turned calmly to mamma if the fourteen thousand pounds was in our hands what should you do with it the dear thing said she should settle at least ten thousand of it on me and marry me to this poor motherless boy whom i have learned to love myself said she there said edward you see it is you who lose by your governorsi wont say whatif you marry my sister alfred took his hand and said god bless you for telling me this then edward turned to mamma and me and said this poor fellow has left his fathers house because he wronged us then this house ought to open its arms to him that is only justice but now to be just to our side i have been to mr crawford the lawyer and i find this hardie junior has ten thousand pounds of his own that ought to be settled on julia to make up for what she loses by hardie seniorsi wont say what if anybody settles any of their trash on me ill beat them and throw it in the fire said i and i hated money the oracle asked me directly did i hate clothes and food and charity to the poor and cleanliness and decency then i didnt hate money for none of these things can exist without money you little romantic humbug you shut up mamma rebuked him for his expressions but approved his sentiments but i did not care for his sentiments for he smiled on me and said we two are of one mind we shall transfer our fortune to captain dodd whom my father has robbed julia will consent to share my honest poverty well we will talk about that said edward pompously talk about it without me then i cried and got up and marched out indignant only it was partly my low cunning to hide my face that i could not keep the rapture out of and as soon as i had retired with cold dignity off i skipped into the garden to let my face loose and i think they sent him after me for i heard his quick step behind me so i ran away from him as hard as i could so of course he soon caught me in the shrubbery where he first asked me to be his and he kissed both my hands again and again like wildfire as he is and he said you are right dearest let them talk of their trash while i tell you how i adore you poverty with you will be the souls wealth even misfortune by your side would hardly be misfortune let all the world go and let you and i be one and live together and die together for now i see i could not have lived without you nor without your love and i whispered something on his shoulderno matter what what signifies the cackle of a goose and we mingled our happy tears and our hearts and our souls ah love is a sweet a dreadful passion what we two have gone through for one another in a few months he dined with us and edward and he sat a long long time talking i dare say it was only about their odious money still i envied edward having him so long but at last he came up and devoured me with his lovely grey eyes and i sang him aileen aroon and he whispered things in my ear oh such sweet sweet idiotic darling things i will not part with even the shadow of one of them by putting it on paper only i am the blessedest creature in all the world and i only hope to goodness it is not very wicked to be so happy as i am dec stit is all settled alfred returns to oxford to make up for lost time the time spent in construing me instead of greek and at the end of term he is to come of age and marrysomebody marriage what a word to put down it makes me tingle it thrills me it frightens me deliciously no not deliciously anything but for suppose being both of us fiery and they all say one of them ought to be cold blooded for a pair to be happy i should make him a downright bad wife why then i hope i shall die in a year or two out of my darlings way and let him have a good one instead id come back from the grave and tear her to pieces jan thfound a saint in a garret over a stable took her my luncheon clandestinely that is ladylike for under my apron and was detected and expostulated by ned he took me into his studioit is carpeted with shavingsand showed me the tiser digest an enormous book he has made of newspaper cuttings all in applepie order and out of this authority he proved vice and poverty abound most wherever there are most charities oh and the poor a set of intoxicated sneaks and me a demoralising influence it is all very fine but why are there saints in garrets and halfstarved that rouses all my evil passions and i cannot bear it it is no use jan thonce a gay day but now a sad one mamma gone to see poor papa where he is alfred found me sorrowful and rested my forehead on his shoulder that soothed me while it lasted i think i should like to grow there mem to burn this diary and never let a creature see a syllable as soon as he was gone prayed earnestly on my knees not to make an idol of him for it is our poor idols that are destroyed for our weakness which really i cannot quite see the justice of jan thjane does not approve my proposal that we should praise now and then at the same hour instead of always praying the dear girl sends me her unconverted diary to show me she is a brand i have read most of it but really it seems to me she was always goodish only she went to parties and read novels and enjoyed society there i have finished it oh dear how like her unconverted diary is to my converted one jan tha sorrowful day he and i parted after a fortnight of the tenderest affection and that mutual respect without which neither of us i think could love long i had resolved to be very brave but we were alone and his bright face looked so sad the change in it took me by surprise and my resolution failed i clung to him if gentlemen could interpret as we can he would never have left me it is better as it is he kissed my tears away as fast as they came it was the first time he had ever kissed more than my hand so i shall have that to think of and his dear promised letters but it made me cry more at the time of course some day when we have been married years and years i shall tell him not to go and pay a lady for every tear if he wants her to leave off the whole place so gloomy and vacant now jan thpoverty stares us in the face edward says we could make a modest living in london and nobody be the wiser but here we are known and must be ladies and gentlemen and fools he says he has now made me seriously promise not to give money and things out of the house to the poor it is robbing my mother and him ah now i see it is nonsense to despise money here i come home sad from my poor people and i used to return warm all over and the poor old souls do not enjoy my sermons half so much as when i gave them nice things to eat along with them the dear boy that i always loved dearly but admire and love now that he has turned an intolerable tyrant and he used to be wax has put down two maids out of our three and brings our dinner up himself in a jacket then puts on his coat and sits down with us and we sigh at him and he grins and derides us he does not care one straw for pomp and mamma and i have to dress one another now and i like it jan thhe says we may now by great economy subsist honestly till my weddingday but then mamma and he must absquatulate oh what stout hearts men have they can jest at sorrow even when in spite of their great thick skins they feel it ah the real poor are happy they marry and need not leave the parish where their mother lives feb tha kind and most delicate letter from jane she says papa and i are much grieved at captain dodds affliction and deeply concerned at your loss by the bank papa has asked uncle thomas for two hundred pounds and i entreat you to oblige me by receiving it at my hands and applying it according to the dictates of your own affectionate heart actually our viceroy will not let me take it he says he will not accept a crumb from the man who owes us a loaf feb thjane mortified and no wonder if she knew how very poor we are she would be surprised as well i have implored her not to take it to heart for that all will be explained one day and she will see we could not his dear letters i feed on them we have no secrets no two minds he is to be a first class and then a private tutor our money is to go to mamma it is he and i that are to work our fingers to the bone i am so happy and never let them be driven by injustice from their home but all this is a great secret the viceroy will be defeated

compositions me me me from one end to another for when it is not about myself it is about alfred and that it is my heme though not my sheone so now to turn over a new leaf from this day i shall record

motto for this diary ego et deus meus k in other words a good oldfashioned sober humble christian to whom the daring familiarities of your school seem blasphemies m here i recognise my sister somewhat spoiled by a detestable sect but lovable by nature which she is for ever abusing and therefore always amiable when off her guard march thmr crawford the attorney called and told papa his son had instructed him to examine the trustdeed and to draw his marriage settlement papa treated him with the greatest civility and brought him the deed he wanted to take it away to copy but papa said he had better send a clerk here poor papa hid his distress from this gentleman though not from me and gave him a glass of wine then mr crawford chatted and let out alfred had asked him to advance a hundred pounds for the wedding presents c papa said he might do so with perfect safety but the moment he was gone his whole manner changed he walked about in terrible anger and agitation and then sat down and wrote letters one was to uncle thomas and one to a mr wycherley i believe a brother of the doctors i never knew him so long writing two letters before heard a noise in the road and it was mr maxley and the boys after him hooting they have found out his infirmity what a savage animal is man till grace changes him the poor soul had a stick and now and then turned and struck at them but his tormentors were too nimble i drew papa to the window and showed him and reminded him of the poor mans request he answered impatiently what was that to him we have a worse case nearer hand charity begins at home i ventured to say yes but it did not begin and end at home march stmr osmond here today and over my work i heard papa tell him alfred is blackening his character in the town with some impossible story about fourteen thousand pounds mr osmond very kind and sympathising set it all down to illusion assured papa there was neither malice nor insincerity in it but what the better am i for that said poor papa if i am slandered i am slandered and they went out together papa seems to feel this engagement more than all his troubles and knowing by sad experience it is useless to expostulate with alfred i wrote a long and faithful letter to julia just before luncheon putting it to her as a christian whether she could reconcile it to her profession to set a son against his father and marry him in open defiance she replied p m that her mother approved the marriage and she owed no obedience nor affection either to my parent sent back a line rebuking her for this quibble at received a note from mrs dodd proposing that the correspondence between myself and her daughter should cease for the present retorted with an amendment that it should cease for ever no reply such are worldlings remonstrance only galls them and so in one afternoons correspondence ends one more of my christian friendships with persons of my own sex this is the eighth to which a carnal attachment has been speedily fatal in the evening alfred came in looking very red and asked me whether it was not selfreliant and uncharitable of me to condemn so many estimable persons all better acquainted with the circumstances than i am i replied with the fifth commandment he bit his lip and said we had better not meet again until you have found out which is worthiest of honour your father or your brother and with this he left abruptly and something tells me i shall not see him again my faithfulness has wounded him to the quick alas prayed for him and cried myself to sleep april th met him disguised as a common workman and carrying a sack full of things i was so shocked i could not maintain my resolution i said oh mr edward what are you doing he blushed a little but told me he was going to sell some candlesticks and things of his making and he should get a better price in that dress all traders looked on a gentleman as a thing made to be pillaged then he told me he was going to turn them into a bonnet and a wreath and his beautiful brown eyes sparkled with affection what egotistical creatures they must be i was quite overcome and said oh why did he refuse our offer did he hate me so very much that he would not even take his due from my hand no he said nobody in our house is so unjust to you as to hate you my sister honours you and is very sorry you think ill of her and as for me i love you you know how i love you i hid my face in my hands and sobbed out oh you must not you must not my poor father has one disobedient child already he said softly dont cry dear one have a little patience perhaps the clouds will clear and meantime why think so ill of us consider we are four in number of different dispositious yet all of one mind about julia marrying alfred may we not be right may we not know something we love you too well to tell you his words and his rich manly voice were so soothing i gave him just one hand while i still hid my burning face with the other he kissed the hand i yielded him and left me abruptly if alfred should be right i am staggered now he puts it so much more convincingly april th a letter from alfred announcing his wedding by special license for the th made no reply what could i say papa on my reading it out left his very breakfast half finished and packed up his bag and rushed up to london i caught a side view of his face and i am miserable such a new such a terrible expression a vile expression heaven forgive me it seemed the look of one who meditated a crime chapter xxix the spirit of dissension in musgrove cottage penetrated to the very kitchen old betty sided with alfred and combated in her place the creed of the parlour why according to miss the young sparrows are bound never to fly out of the nest or else have the bible flung at em she do go on about gods will seems to me tis his will the world should be peopled by body and beastwhich they are both his creaturesand by the same toaken if they dont marry they does wus certainly whilst a young man bides at home it behoves him to be dutiful but that aint to say he is to bide at home for ever master alfreds time is come to leave we and be master in a house of his own as his father done before him which he forgets that now he is grown to mans estate and got his mothers money and no more bound to our master than i be she said too that parting blights more quarrels than it breeds and she constantly invited peggy to speak up and gainsay her but peggy was a young woman with white eyelashes and given to looking down and not to speaking up she was always watching mr hardie in company like a cat cream and hovering about him when alone betty went so far as to accuse her of colloguing with him against alfred and of setting her cap at master which accusation elicited no direct reply but stinging innuendoes hours after now if one looks into the thing the elements of discord had attacked albion villa quite as powerfully as musgrove cottage but had hitherto failed signally the mutual affection of the dodds was so complete and no unprincipled person among them to split the good and now that the wedding drew near there was but one joyful heart within the walls though the others were too kind and unselfish to throw cold water mrs dodds own wedding had ended in a piteous separation and now to part with her darling child and launch her on the uncertain waves of matrimony she heaved many a sigh when alone but as there were no bounds to her maternal love so there were no exceptions to her politeness over her aching heart she forced on a wedding face subdued but hopeful for her daughter as she would for any other young lady about to be married beneath her roof it wanted but six days when one morning after breakfast the bereaved wife and mother about to be deserted addressed her son and viceroy thus edward we must borrow fifty pounds fifty pounds what for who wants that why i want it said mrs dodd stoutly oh if you want itwhat to do please why to buy her wedding clothes dear i thought what her i would come to said julia reproachfully edward shook his head and said he who goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing but she is not a he objected mrs dodd with the subtlety of a schoolman and who ever heard of a young lady being married without some things to be married in well ive heard nudity is not the cheese on public occasions but why not go dressed like a lady as she always does only with white gloves and be married without any bother and nonsense you talk like a boy said mrs dodd i could not bear it my poor child and she cast a look of tenderest pity on the proposed victim well suppose we make the poor child the judge suggested edward he then put it to julia whether under the circumstances she would wish them to run in debt buying her finery to wear for a day it was not fair to ask her said mrs dodd with a sigh julia blushed and hesitated and said she would be candid and then stopped ugh ejaculated edward this is a bad beginning girls candour now for a masterpiece of duplicity julia inquired how he dared and mrs dodd said warmly that julia was not like other people she could be candid had actually done it more than once within her recollection the young lady justified the exception as follows if i was going to be married to myself or to some gentleman i did not care for i would not spend a shilling but i am going to marry him and sooh edward think of them saying what has he married a dowdy why she hadnt new things on to go to church with him no bonnet no wreath no new white dress to mortify him the very first day of our the sentence remained unfinished but two lovely eyes filled to the very brim without running over and completed the sense and did the viceroys business though a brother why you dear little goose said he of course i dont mean that i have as good as got the things we must buy and those are a new bonnet ah a wreath of orange blossoms oh you good boy four pair of gloves two whiteone is safe to breaktwo dark very dark invisible green or visible black last the honeymoon all the rest you must find in the house what fit her out with a parcel of old things so cruel so unreasonable dear edward old things why where is all your gorgeous attire from oriental climes i see the splendiferous articles arrive and then they vanish for ever now shawls and indian muslins pray what use are they to a bride why what looks nicer than a white muslin dress married in muslin the very idea makes me shiver well clap her on another petticoat how can you be so childish muslin is not the the thing no more is running in debt he then suggested that a white shawl or two should be cut into a bridal dress at this both ladies fair throats opened on him with ridicule cut fifty guinea shawls into tenpound dresses that was male economy was it total a wedding was a wedding new things always had had to be bought for a wedding and always would in secula seculorum new things yes said the pertinacious wretch but they need not be newbought things you ladies go and confound the worlds eyes with your own in the drollest way if gorgeous attire has lain long in your drawers you fancy the world will detect on its glossy surface how long you had it and gloated over it and made it stale to your eye before you could bring your mind to wear it that is your delusion that and the itch for going out shopping oh im down on you mamma dear you open that gigantic wardrobe of yours and ill oil my hair whitewash my mug a little moan from mrs d and do the counterjumping business to the life hand the things down to you unrol em grin charge you per cent over value note them down in a penny memorandumbook sing out caesh caesh c c and so we shall get all julia wants and go through the ritual of shopping without the substantial disgrace of running in debt mrs dodd smiled admiringly as ladies generally do at the sauciness of a young male but proposed an amendment she would open her wardrobe and look out all the contents for edwards inspection and if the mere sight of them did not convince him they were inappropriate to a bride why then she would coincide with his views and resign her own all right said he that will take a jolly time i know so ill go to my governor first for the bonnet and wreath mrs dodd drew in at this last slang word she had heard young gentlemen apply it to their fathers edward she felt sure would not so sully that sacred relation still the word was obnoxious for its past offences and she froze at it i have not the honour to know who the personage is you so describe said she formally edward replied very carelessly that it was an upholsterer at the north end of the town ah a tradesman you patronise humph well yes that is the word mamma haw haw i have been making the bloke a lot of oak candlesticks and human heads with sparkling eyes for walkingsticks c and now ill go and draw myprotegesblunt the ladys hands were uplifted towards pitying heaven with one impulse the young workman grinned soyons de notre siecle said he and departed whistling in the tenor clef he had the mellowest whistle after a few minutes well spent in deploring the fall of her oxonian and gently denouncing his motto and his century its ways and above all its words mrs dodd took julia to her bedroom and unlocked drawers and doors in her wardrobe and straightway sarah who was hurriedly flogging the chairs with a duster relaxed and began to work on a chevalglass as slowly as if she was drawing nelsons lions at a thousand pounds the tail mrs dodd opened a drawer and took out three pieces of worked indian muslin a little discoloured by hoarding there that must be bleached and make you some wrappers for the honeymoon if the weather is at all fine and petticoats to match next an envelope consisting of two foolscap sheets tacked this carefully undone upon the bed revealed a brussels lace flounce and a veil it was my own said mrs dodd softly i saved it for you see here is your name written on it seventeen years ago i thought this dear little toddler will have wings some day and then she will leave me but now i am almost afraid to let you wear it it might bring you misfortune suppose after years of wedded love you should be bereaved of mrs dodd choked and julias arms were round her neck in a moment ill risk it cried she impetuously if it but makes me as beloved as you are ill wear it come weal come woe and then i shall feel it over me at the altar like my guardian angels wings my own sweet darling mamma oh what an idiot what a wretch i am to leave you at all this unfortunate unexpected burst interrupted business sadly mrs dodd sank down directly on the bed and wept julia cried over her and sarah plumped herself down in a chair and blubbered but wedding flowers are generally well watered in the private apartments patient mrs dodd soon recovered herself this is childish of me when i think that there are mothers who see their children go from the house corpses not brides i ought to be ashamed of myself come a loeuvre ah here is something and she produced a white china crape shawl oh how sweet said julia why have you never worn it dear me child what use would things be to those i love if i went and wore them the next article she laid her hand on was a roll of white poplin and drew an exclamation from mrs dodd herself if i had not forgotten this and it is the very thing your dear papa bought me this in london and i remonstrated with him well for buying me such a delicate thing only once wear i kissed it and put it away and forgot it they say if you keep a thing seven years it is just seven years since he gave it to me really the dear boy is a witch this is your wedding dress my precious precious she unrolled a few yards on the bed to show it and asked the gloating sarah with a great appearance of consideration whether they were not detaining her from her occupations oh no mum this glass have got so dull im just polishing of it a bit i shant be a minute now mum from silver tissue paper mrs dodd evolved a dress unmade of white crape embroidered in true loversknots of violet silk and ears of wheat in gold then there was a scream at the glass and sarah seen in it with ten claws in the air very wide apart she had slily turned the mirror and was devouring the reflexion of the finery and this last indian fabric overpowered her her exclamation was instantly followed by much polishing but mrs dodd replied to it after the manner of her sex well it is lovely said she to julia but where is the one with beetle wings oh here real beetles wings mamma inquired julia yes love so they are and how wicked and what a lovely green i will never wear them they are prismatic now if ever i am to be a christian i had better begin everything has a beginning oh vanity of women you stick at nothing a thousand innocent lives stolen to make one dress and she put one hand before her eyes and with the other ordered the dress back into the wardrobe with genuine agitation my dear what expressions and you need not wear it indeed neither of them is fit for that purpose but you must have a pretty thing or two about you i have hoarded these a good many years now it is your turn to have them by you and let me see you want a travelling cloak but the dear boy will not let us so choose a warm shawl a rich but modest one was soon found and julia tried it on arching her supple neck and looking down over her shoulder to see the effect behind in which attitude oh for an immortal brush to paint her or anything half as bright supple graceful and every inch a woman at this moment mrs dodd threw a lovely blue indian shawl on the bed galvanising sarah so that up went her hands again and the door opened softly and a handsome head in a paper cap peeped on the scene inquiring with mock timidity may the british workman come in he was invited warmly julia whipped his cap off and tore it in two reddening and mrs dodd intending to compliment his foresight showed him the bed laden with the treasures they had disinterred from vanitys mahogany tomb well mother said he you were right and i was wrong they are inappropriate enough the whole lot the ladies looked at one another and sarah permitted herself a species of snort do we want sarah he asked quietly she retired bridling inappropriate exclaimed mrs dodd there is nothing here unfit for a brides trousseau good heavens would you trick her out like a princess we must we are too poor to dress her like a lady cinderella at your service observed julia complacently and pirouetted before him in her new shawl ideas rejected peremptorily at the time often rankle and bear fruit byandbye mrs dodd took up the blue shawl and said she would make julia a peignoir of it and the border being narrowish would do for the bottom that was a good notion of yours darling said she bestowing a sweet smile on edward he grunted then she took out a bundle of lace oh for pitys sake no more cried the british workman now dearest you have interfered once in feminine affairs and we submitted but if you say another word i will trim her poplin with honiton two feet deep quarter quarter cried edward im dumb grant me but this have nothing made up for her out of the house you know there is no dressmaker in barkington can cut like you and then that will put some limit to our inconsistency mrs dodd agreed but she must have a woman in to sew edward grunted at this and said i wish i could turn you these gowns with my lathe what a deal of time and bother it would save however if you want any stuffing come to me ill lend you lots of shavings make the silk rustle oh here is my governors contribution and he produced l s now look there said julia sorrowfully it is money and i thought you were going to bring me the very bonnet yourself then i should have valued it oh yes replied the young gentleman ironically can i choose a bonnet to satisfy such swells as you and mamma ill tell you what ill do ill go with you and look as wise as solomon all the time you are choosing it a capital plan said julia edward then shook his fist at the finery and retired to work again for his governor flowers he observed are indispensable at a wedding breakfast i hear too it is considered the right cheese to add something in the shape of grub exit whistling in the tenor clef and keeping their hearts up like a man so now there were two workshops in albion villa neds study as he called it and the drawingroom in the former shavings flew and settled at their ease and the whirr of the lathe slept not the latter was all patterns tapes hooks and eyes whalebone cuttings of muslin poplin and paper clouds of liningmuslin snakes of piping skeins shreds and the floor literally sown with pins escaped from the fingers of the fair those taper fingers so typical of the minds of their owners or they have softness suppleness nimbleness adroitness and a plentiful lack of tenacity the days passed in hard work and the evenings in wooing never sweeter than when it has been so earned and at last came the wedding eve dr sampson who was to give the bride away arrived just before dinnertime the party including alfred sat down to a charming little dinner they ate beetles wings and drank indian muslin fifteen years in the wood for the lathe and the chisel proved insufficient and julia having really denied herself as an aspirant to christianity that assassins robe mrs dodd sold it under the rose to a fat old dowagerfor whom nothing was too fineand so kept up appearances julia and alfred were profoundly happy at bottom yet their union was attended with too many drawbacks for boisterous gaiety and alfred up to this time had shown a seriousness and sobriety of bliss that won mrs dodds gratitude it was the demeanour of a delicate mind it became his own position at odds with his own flesh and blood for julias sake it became him as the soninlaw of a poor woman so lately bereaved of her husband and reduced to poverty by one bearing the name of hardie but now dr sampson introduced a gayer element he had seen a great deal of life ie of death and trouble this had not hardened him but encountering a sturdy valiant selfprotecting nature had made him terribly tough and elastic it was now his way never to go forward or backward a single step after sorrow he seldom mentioned a dead friend or relation and if others forced the dreary topic on him they could never hold him to it he was away directly to something pleasant or useful like a grasshopper skipping off a grave into the green grass he had felt keenly about david while there was anything to be done but now his poor friend was in a madhouse thanks to the lancet and there was an end of him thinking about him would do him no good the present only is irresistible past and future ills the mind can bar out by a resolute effort the bride will very likely die of her first child well then forget that just now her father is in an asylum well then dont remember him at the wrong time there sit female beauty and virtue ready to wed manly wit and comeliness seated opposite see their sweet stolen glances a few hours only between them and wedded rapture and im here to give the lovely virgin away fill the bumper high dum vivimus vivamus in this glorious spirit he rattled on and soon drew the young people out and silvery peals of laughter rang round the genial board this jarred on mrs dodd she bore it in silence some time but with the grief it revived and sharpened by contrast and the polite effort to hide her distress found herself becoming hysterical then she made the usual signal to julia and beat an early retreat she left julia in the drawingroom and went and locked herself in her own room oh how can they be so cruel as to laugh and giggle in my davids house she wept sadly and for the first time felt herself quite lonely in the world for what companionship between the gay and the sad hearted poor thing she lived to reproach herself even with this the nearest approach she ever made to selfishness ere long she crept into julias room and humbly busied herself packing her trunks for the wedding tour the tears fell fast on her white hands she would not have been left alone a minute if julias mind had not been occupied just then with an affectionate and amiable anxiety she earnestly desired to reconcile her alfred and his sister before the wedding and she sat in the drawingroom thinking whether it could be done and how at last she sat down blushing and wrote a little note and rang the bell for sarah and sent it courageously into the diningroom sarah very prudently listened at the keyhole before entering for she said to herself if they are talking free i shant go in till its over the persons so generously suspected were discussing a parchment alfred had produced and wanted signed you are our trustee my boy said he to edward so just write your name here and mine comes here and the witnesss there the doctor and sarah will do send for a pen lets read it first please read it what for catch me signing a paper without reading it my boy what cant you trust me inquired alfred hurt oh yes and cant you trust me theres a question why i have appointed you my trusty in the deed he he well then trust me without my signing and ill trust you without reading sampson laughed at this retort and alfred reddened he did not want the deed read but while he hesitated sarah came in with julias note asking him to come to her for a minute this sweet summons made him indifferent to prosaic things well read away said he one comfort you will be no wiser what is it in latin asked edward with a wry face no such luck deeds used to be in latin but latin could not be made obscure enough so now dark deeds are written in an unknown tongue called lawyerish where the sense is as one grain of wheat in two bushels of chaff pick it out if you can whatever man has done man may do said dr sampson stoutly you have rid it and yet understood it so why maynt we ye monster o conceit read it said alfred i never read it would not read it for a great deal of money the moment i saw what a senseless rigmarole it was i flung it down and insisted on the battological author furnishing me with an english translation he complied the crib occupies just twenty lines the original three folio pages as you see that crib gentlemen added he severely is now in my waistcoat pocket and you shall never see itfor your impudence no seat yourself by that pool of parchment sedet eternumque sedebit c and fish for lawyer crawfords ideas rari nantes in gurgite vasto and with this he flew upstairs on the wings of love julia met him in the middle of the room all in a flutter it is to ask you a favour i am unhappyabout one thing she then leaned one hand softly on his shoulder and curving her lovely supple neck looked round into his face and watched it as she preferred her petition it is about jane and you i cannot bear to part you two in this way only think six days you have not spoken and i am the cause not the only cause love i dont know darling but it is very cruel i have got my dear mother and edward you have nobodybut me alfred said she with gentle impetuosity now is your time your papa is away oh is he said alfred carelessly yes sarah says betty says he is gone to uncle thomas so i know you wont refuse me my own alfred it is to go to your sister this minute and make it up what and leave you objected alfred ruefully no no you are with the gentlemen you know you are not here in reality till tea make them an excuse say the truth say it is me and come back to me with good news he consented on these terms then she armed him with advice you go to make peace it is our last chance now remember you must be very generous very sweettempered guard against your impetuosity do take warning by me see how impetuous i am and then you know after all she is only a lady and a great creature like you ought not to be ruffled by anything so small as a ladys tongue the idea and dearest dont go trusting to your logic but do descend to the arts of persuasion because they are far more convincing somehow please try them yes enumerate them why kissing and coaxing anddont ask me will you bestow a specimen of those arts on me if i succeed try me said she and looked him earnestly in the face but lowered her long lashes slowly and shyly as she realised to what her impetuosity was pledging itself alfred got his hat and ran to musgrove cottage a man stepped out of the shadow of a hedge opposite albion villa and followed him keeping in shadow as much as possible the door of musgrove cottage was opened to him by old betty with a joyful start mr alfred i declare come in theres only me and miss master is in yorkshire and that there crocodile peggy she is turned awayfor sauceand a good riddance of bad rubbish miss is in the parlour she ushered him triumphantly in jane was seated reading she dropped her book and ran and kissed him with a cry of joy so warm a reception surprised him agreeably and simplified his task he told her he was come to try and make it up with her before the wedding we lose your presence dear jenny said he and that is a great grief to us valuing you as we do dont refuse us your good wishes tomorrow dearest alfred said she can you think it i pray for you day and night and i have begun to blame myself for being so sure you were in the wrong and poor papa faultless what you sent me half in jest i take in earnest judge not that ye be not judged why jenny said alfred how red your eyes are at this observation the young saint laid her head on her brothers shoulder and had a good cry like any other girl when she recovered a little she told him yes she had been very unhappy that he had always been a dear good brother to her and the only one she had and that it cut her to the heart not to be at his wedding it seemed so unkind alfred set her on his kneeshe had more soul than bodyand kissed her and comforted her and in this happy revival of natural affection his heart opened he was off his guard and told her all gave her the several proofs their father had got the l jane arrested by the skill and logical clearness with which he marshalled the proofs listened in silence and presently a keen shudder ran through her frame and reminded him he was setting a daughter against her father there said he i always said i would never tell you and now ive done it well at least you will see with what consideration and unheardof leniency the dodds for our sake are treating mr richard hardie just compare their conduct to him with his to them and which is most to his advantage that i should marry julia and give mrs dodd the life interest in my ten thousand pounds to balance his dishonesty or for him to be indicted as a thief ned dodd told us plainly he would have set the police on him had any other but his son been the informant did he say that oh alfred this is a miserable world i cant see that it is the jolliest world in the world everything is bright and lovely and everybody is happy except a few sick people and a few peevish ones that run to meet trouble tomorrow i marry my sweet julia richard hardie will find we two dont molest him nor trouble our heads about him he will get used to us and one fine day we shall say to him now we know all about the l just leave it by will to dear jenny and let my friend dodd marry her and you can enjoy it unmolested for your lifetime he will consent and you will marry ned and then youll find the world has been wickedly slandered by dishonest men and dismal dogs in this strain he continued till he made her blush a good deal and smile a little a sad smile but at last she said if i was sure all this is true i think i should gowith a heavy heartto your wedding if i dont the best part of me will be there my prayers and my warm warm wishes for you both kiss her for me and tell her so and that i hope we shall meet round his throne soon if we cannot meet at his altar tomorrow brother and sister then kissed one another affectionately and alfred ran back like the wind to albion cottage julia was not in the drawingroom and some coolish tea was after waiting half an hour he got impatient and sent sarah to say he had a message for her sarah went upstairs to mrs dodds room and was instantly absorbed after waiting again for a long time alfred persuaded edward to try his luck edward went up to mrs dodds room and was absorbed the wedding dress was being solemnly tried on a clean linen sheet was on the floor and the bride stood on it receiving the last touches of the milliners art with this and her white poplin and lace veil she seemed framed in white and her cheeks bloomed so and her eyes beamed with excitement and innocent vanity that altogether she was supernaturally lovely once enter the room enchanted by this snowchad rose andvestigia nulla retrorsum however edward escaped at last and told alfred what was on foot and drew a picture of the bride with white above and white below oh let me see her implored the lover edward must ask mamma about that he did and mamma said certainly not the last person in the world that shall see her in her wedding dress but she should come down to him in half an hour it seemed a very long halfhour however by way of compensation he was alone when she did come good news she asked eagerly capital we are the best of friends why she is half inclined to come thenoh how good you are oh how i love you and she flung a tender arm round his neck like a young goddess making love and her sweet face came so near his he had only to stoop a little and their lips met in a long blissful kiss that kiss was an era in her life innocence itself she had put up her delicious lips to her lover in pure though earnest affection but the male fire with which his met them made her blush as well as thrill and she drew back a little ashamed and half scared and nestled on his shoulder hiding a face that grew redder and redder he bent his graceful head and murmured down to her are you afraid of me sweetest oh no no yes a little i dont know i was afraid i had made too free with my treasure you dont quite belong to me yet you know oh yes i do and what is more you belong to me dont you sweet rebel ah that i do heart and soul my own own own a few more soft delicious murmurs and then julia was summoned to more rites of vanity and the lovers parted with tender reluctance for those few hours alfred went home to his lodgings he had not been there above ten minutes when he came out hastily and walked quickly to the white lion the principal inn in barkington he went into the stableyard and said a few words to the ostler then returned to his lodgings the man followed him at a distance from albion terrace watched him home dogged him to the white lion and byandbye entered the yard and offered the ostler a glass of ale at the tap at albion villa they were working on julias dresses till past midnight and then mrs dodd insisted on her going to bed she obeyed but when the house was all quiet came stealing out to her mother and begged to sleep with her the sad mother strained her in a tearful embrace and so they passed the night clinging to one another more as the parting drew near edward arranged the wedding breakfast for after the ceremony and sent the ladies up a cup of coffee and a bit of toast apiece they could hardly find appetite even for this or indeed time there was so much still to do at ten oclock julia was still in the height of dressing delayed by contretemps upon contretemps sarah and her sister did her hair up too loose and being a glorious mass it threatened all to come down and meantime a hairpin quietly but persistently bored her creamwhite poll oh run for mamma she cried mamma came half dressed had the hair all down again and did it up with adroit and loving hand and put on the orange wreath kissed her admiringly and retired to her own toilet and the girls began to lace the brides body bump came edwards foot against the door making them all shriek now i dont want to hurry you but dr sampson is come the handmaids flustered tried to go faster and when the work was done julia took her little handglass and inspected her back oh she screamed i am crooked there go for mamma mamma soon came and the poor bride held out imploring hands im all awry im as crooked as a rams horn la miss said sarah its only behind nobody will notice it how can they help it mamma am i deformed mrs dodd smiled superior and bade her be calm it is the lacing dear no sarah it is no use your pulling it all the pulling in the world will not straighten it i thought so you have missed the second top hole julias little foot began to beat a tattoo on the floor there is not a soul in the house but you can do the simplest thing eyes and no eyes fingers and no fingers i never did hush love we all do our best oh i am sure of that poor things nobody can lace you if you fidget about love objected mrs dodd bump now i dont want to hurry any mans cattle but the bridesmaids are come oh dear i shall never be ready in time said julia and the tattoo recommenced plenty of time love said mrs dodd quietly lacing not halfpast ten yet sarah go and see if the bridegroom has arrived sarah returned with the reassuring tidings that the bridegroom had not yet arrived though the carriages had oh thank heaven he is not come said julia if i keep him waiting today he might sayoho under dread of a comment so significant she was ready at last and said majestically he might come now whenever he liked meantime down stairs an uneasiness of the opposite kind was growing ten minutes past the appointed time and the bridegroom not there so while julia now full dressed and easy in her mind was directing sarahs sister to lay out her plain travelling dress bonnet and gloves on the bed mrs dodd was summoned downstairs she came down with julias white gloves in her hand and a needle and thread the button sewed on by trades fair hand having flown at the first strain edward met her on the stairs what had we better do mother said he sotto voce there must be some mistake can you remember wasnt he to call for me on the way to the church i really do not know said mrs dodd is he at the church do you think no no either he was to call for me here or i for him ill go to the church though it is only a step he ran off and in a little more than five minutes came into the drawingroom no he is not there i must go to his lodgings confound him he has got reading aristotle i suppose this passed before the whole party julia excepted sampson looked at his watch and said he could conduct the ladies to the church while edward went for alfred division of labour said he gallantly and mine the delightful half mrs dodd demurred to the plan she was for waiting quietly in one place well but said edward we may overdo that here it is a quarterpast eleven and you know they cant be married after twelve no i really think you had better all go with the doctor i dare say we shall be there as soon as you will this was agreed on after some discussion edward however to provide against all contingencies begged sampson not to wait for him should alfred reach the church by some other road im only groomsman you know said he he ran off at a racing pace the bride was then summoned admired and handed into one carriage with her two bridesmaids miss bosanquet and miss darton sampson and mrs dodd went in the other and by halfpast eleven they were all safe in the church a good many people high and low were about the door and in the pews waiting to see the beautiful miss dodd married to the son of a personage once so popular as mr hardie it had even transpired that mr hardie disapproved the match they had been waiting a long time and were beginning to wonder what was the matter when at last the brides party walked up the aisle with a bright april sun shining on them through the broad old windows the brides rare beauty and staglike carriage of her head imperial in its loveliness and orange wreath drew a hum of admiration the party stood a minute or two at the east end of the church and then the clergyman came out and invited them into the vestry their reappearance was eagerly expected in silence at first but presently in loud and multitudinous whispers at this moment a young lady with almost perfect features and sylphlike figure modestly dressed in dovecoloured silk but with a new chip bonnet and white gloves entered a pew near the west door and said a little prayer then proceeded up the aisle and exchanged a word with the clerk then into the vestry cheep cheep cheep went fifty female tongues and the arrival of the bridegrooms sister became public news the bride welcomed her in the vestry with a sweet guttural of surprise and delight and they kissed one another like little tigers oh my darling jane how kind of you have i got you back to make my happiness complete now none of her own party had thought it wise to tell julia there was any hitch but miss hardie blurted out naturally enough but wheres alfred i dont know dear said julia innocently are not he and edward in another part of the church i thought we were waiting till twelve oclock perhaps mamma dear you know everything i suppose this is all right then looking round at her friends faces she saw in a moment that it was all wrong sampsons in particular was burning with manly indignation and even her mothers discomposed and trying to smile when the innocent saw this she suspected her beloved was treating her cavalierly and her poor little mouth began to work and she had much ado not to whimper mrs dodd to encourage her told her not to be put out it had been arranged all along that edward should go for him unfortunately we had an impression it was the other way but now edward is gone to his lodgings no mamma said julia alfred was to call for edward because our house was on the way are you sure my child asked mrs dodd very gravely oh yes mamma said julia beginning to tremble at a quarter before eleven i heard them settle it the matter was terribly serious now indeed it began to look hopeless weather overclouded raindrops falling and hard upon twelve oclock they all looked at one another in despair suddenly there was a loud long buzzing heard outside and the house of god turned into a gossiping fair talk of money changers said satan that day give me the exchangers of small talk thank heaven they are come said mrs dodd but having thus relieved her mind she drew herself up and prepared a freezing reception for the defaulter a whisper reached their excited ears it is young mr dodd and next moment edward came into the vestryalone the sight of him was enough his brow wet with perspiration his face black and white with bitter wrath come home my people he said sternly there will be no wedding here today the bridesmaids cackled questions at him he turned his back on them mrs dodd knew her sons face too well to waste inquiries give me my child she cried in such a burst of mothers anguish long restrained that even the insult to the bride was forgotten for one moment till she was seen tottering into her mothers arms and cringing and trying to hide bodily in her oh throw a shawl over me she moaned hide all this well they all did what they could jane hung round her neck and sobbed and said ive a sister now and no brother the bridesmaids cried the young curate ran and got the fly to the vestrydoor get into it he said and you will at least escape the curious crowd god bless you mr hurd said edward half choked he hurried the insulted bride and her mother in julia huddled and shrank into a corner under mrs dodds shawl mrs dodd had all the blinds down in a moment and they went home as from a funeral ay and a funeral it was for the sweetest girl in england buried her hopes her laugh her may of youth in that church that day when she got to albion villa she cast a wild look all around for fear she should be seen in her wedding clothes and darted moaning into the house sarah met her in the hall smirking and saying wish you j the poor bride screamed fearfully at the mocking words and cut the conventional phrase in two as with a razor then fled to her own room and tore off her wreath her veil her pearls and had already strewed the room when mrs dodd with a foot quickened by affection burst in and caught her half fainting and laid her weary as old age and cold as a stone upon her mothers bosom and rocked her as in the days of happy childhood never to return and bedewed the pale face with her own tears sampson took the bridesmaids each to her residence on purpose to leave edward free he came home washed his face and sick at heart but more master of himself knocked timidly at julias door come in my son said a broken voice he crept in and saw a sorry sight the travelling dress and bonnet were waiting still on the bed the bridal wreath and veil lay on the floor and so did half the necklace and the rest of the pearls all about the floor and julia with all her hair loose and hanging below her waist lay faintly quivering in her mothers arms edward stood and looked and groaned mrs dodd whispered to him over julia not a tear not a tear dead or false moaned the girl dead or false oh that i could believe he was false no no he is dead dead mrs dodd whispered again over her girl tell her something give us tearsthe world for one tear what shall i say gasped edward tell her the truth and trust to god whose child she is edward knelt on the floor and took her hand my poor little ju he said in a voice broken with pity and emotion would you rather have him dead or false to you why false a thousand times its edward bless your sweet face my own own brother tell me he is false and not come to deadly harm you shall judge for yourself he groaned i went to his lodgings he had left the town the woman told me a letter came for him last night a letter ina female hand the scoundrel came in from us got this letter packed up his things directly paid his lodging and went off in a twohorse fly at eight oclock in the morning chapter xxx at these plain proofs of alfreds infidelity julias sweet throat began to swell hysterically and then her bosom to heave and pant and after a piteous struggle came a passion of sobs and tears so wild so heartbroken that edward blamed himself bitterly for telling her but mrs dodd sobbed no no i would rather have her so only leave her with me now bless you darling leave us quickly she rocked and nursed her deserted child hours and hours and so the miserable day crawled to its close downstairs the house looked strange and gloomy she who had brightened it all was darkened herself the wedding breakfast and flowers remained in bitter mockery sarah cleared half the table and sampson and edward dined in moody silence presently sampsons eye fell upon the deed it lay on a small table with a pen beside it to sign on their return from church sampson got hold of it and dived in the verbiage he came up again with a discovery in spite of its feebleness verbosity obscurity and idiotic way of expressing itself the deed managed to convey to david and mrs dodd a life interest in nine thousand five hundred pounds with reversion to julia and the children of the projected marriage sampson and edward put their heads over this and it puzzled them why man said sampson if the puppy had signed this last night he would be a beggar now ay said edward but after all he did not sign it nay but that was your fault not his the lad was keen to sign that is true and perhaps if we had pinned him to this last night he would not have dared insult my sister today sampson changed the subject by inquiring suddenly which way he was gone curse him i dont know and dont care go where he will i shall meet him again some day and thenedward spoke almost in a whisper but a certain grind of his white teeth and flashing of his lion eyes made the incomplete sentence very expressive what ninnies you young men are said the doctor even you that i dub my fathom o good sense just finish your denner and come with me no doctor im off my feed for once if you had been upstairs and seen my poor sister hang the grub it turns my stomach and he shoved his plate away and leaned over the back of his chair sampson made him drink a glass of wine and then they got up from the halffinished meal and went hurriedly to alfreds lodgings the doctor though sixty rushing along with all the fire and buoyancy of early youth they found the landlady surrounded by gossips curious as themselves and longing to chatter but no materials the one new fact they elicited was that the vehicle was a white lion fly for she knew the young man by the cast in his eye come away shouted the doctor unceremoniously and in two minutes they were in the yard of the white lion sampson called the ostler out came a hardfeatured man with a strong squint sampson concluded this was his man and said roughly where did you drive young hardie this morning he seemed rather taken aback by this abrupt question but reflected and slapped his thigh why that is the party from mill street yes druv him to silverton station sir and wasnt long about it eithergent was in a hurry what train did he go by well i dont know sir i left him at the station well then where did he take his ticket for where did he tell the porter he was going think now and ill give y a sovereign the ostler scratched his head and seemed at first inclined to guess for the sovereign but at last said i should only be robbing you gents ye see he paid the fly then and there and gave me a crown and i druv away directly on this they gave him a shilling and left him but on leaving the yard edward said doctor i dont like that fellows looks let us try the landlord they went into the bar and made similar inquiries the landlord was out the mistress knew nothing about it but took a book out of a drawer and turned over the leaves she read out an entry to this effect pair horse fly to silverton take up in mill street at eight oclock is that it sir sampson assented but edward told her the ostler said it was silverton station no it is silverton in the book sir well you see it is all one to us the station is further than the town but we charge seven miles whichever tis bradshaw inspected then and there sought in vain to conceal that four trains reach silverton from different points between and a m the friends retired with this scanty information alfred could hardly have gone to london for there was a train up from barkington itself at but he might have gone to almost any other part of the island or out of it for that matter sampson fell into a brown study after a long silence which edward was too sad to break he said thoughtfully bring sceince to bear on this hotchpotch facks are never really opposed to facks they onnly seem to be and the true solution is the one which riconciles all the facks for instance the chronothairmal therey riconciles all th undisputed facks in midicine so now sairch for a solution to riconcile the deed with the puppy levanting edward searched but could find none and said so cant you said sampson then ill give you a couple say he is touched in the upper story for one what do you mean mad oh there are degrees of phrinzy here is th inconsistency of conduct that marks a disturbance of the reason and to tell the truth i once knew a young fellow that played this very prank at a wedding and the nixt thing we hard my lorrd was in bedlam edward shook his head it is the villains heart not his brain sampson then offered another solution in which he owned he had more confidence he has been courting some other wumman first she declined or made believe but when she found he had the spirit to go and marry an innocent girl then the jade wrote to him and yielded its a married one likely ive known women go further for hatred of a wumman than they would for love of a man and here was a temptation to snap a lover off th altar and insult a rival all at one blow he meant to marry he meant to sign that deed ay and at his age even if he had signed it he would have gone off at passions call and beggared himself what enrages me is that we didnt let him sign it and so nail the young rascals money curse his money said edward and him too wait till i can lay my hand on him ill break every bone in his skin and ill help you in the morning mrs dodd left julia for a few minutes expressly to ask sampsons advice after alfreds conduct she was free and fully determined to defend herself and family against spoliation by any means in her power so she now showed the doctor davids letter about the l and the empty pocketbook and put together the disjointed evidence of julia alfred and circumstances in one neat and luminous statement sampson was greatly struck with the revelation he jumped off his chair and marched about excited said truth was stranger than fiction and this was a manifest swindle then he surprised mrs dodd in her turn by assuming that old hardie was at the bottom of yesterdays business neither edward nor his mother could see that and said so his reply was characteristic of course you cant you are anglosaxins th anglosaxins are good at drawing distinctions but they cant gineralise im a celt and gineraliseas a duck swims i discovered th unity of all disease it would be odd if i could not trace the maniform iniquities you suffer to their one source but what is the connecting link asked mrs dodd still incredulous why richard hardies interest well but the letter objected edward there goes th anglosaxin again remonstrated sampson puzzling his head over petty details and they are perhaps mere blinds thrown out by the enemy put this and that together hardie senior always averse to this marriage hardie senior wanting to keep l of yours if his son who knows of the fraud became your mothers son the swinidle would be hourly in danger no connection y unhappy anglosaxins why the two things are interwoven and so young hardie is got out of the way old hardies doing or im a dutchman this reasoning still appeared forced and fanciful to edward but it began to make some little impression on mrs dodd and encouraged her to own that her poor daughter suspected foul play well that is possible too whativer tempted man has done tempted man will do but more likely he has bribed jezebel to write and catch the goose by the heart gintlennen im a bit of a physiognomist look at old hardies lines his cords i might say and deeper every time i see him sirs theres an awful weight on that mans mind looksee ill just send a small trifle of a detective down to watch his game and pump his people and as soon as it is safe well seize the old bird and once he is trapped the young one will reappear like magic th old one will disgorge well just compound the felonybeen an old friendand recover the cash a fine sketch but edward thought it desperately wild and mrs dodd preferred employing a respectable attorney to try and obtain justice in the regular way sampson laughed at her what was the use of attacking in the regular way an irregular genius like old hardie attorneys are too humdrum for such a job said he they start with a civil letter putting a rogue on his guard they proceed t a writ and then he digs a hole in another county and buries the booty or sails t australia with it nlistme im an old friend and an insane lover of justicei say insane because my passion is not returned or the jade wouldnt keep out of my way so all these yearsyou leave all this to me stop a minute said edward you must not go compromising us and we have no money to pay for luxuries like detectives i wont compromise any one of you and my detective shant cost y a penny ah my dear friend said mrs dodd the fact is you do not know all the difficulties that beset us tell him edward well then let me the poor boy is attached to this gentlemans daughter whom you propose to treat like a felon and he is too good a son and too good a friend for me towhat what shall i do edward coloured up to the eyes who told you that mother said he well yes i do love her and im not ashamed of it doctor said the poor fellow after a while i see now i am not quite the person to advise my mother in this matter i consent to leave it in your hands and in pursuance of this resolution he retired to his study theres a damnable combination said sampson drily truth is sairtainly more wonderful than feckshin heres my fathom o good sense in love with a wax doll and her brother jilting his sister and her father pillaging his mother it beats hotchpotch mrs dodd denied the wax doll but owned miss hardie was open to vast objections an inestimable young lady but so odd she is one of these uneasyminded christians that have sprung up a religious egotist and malade imaginaire eternally feeling her own spiritual pulse i know the disorrder cried sampson eagerly the pashints have a hot fit and then they are saints followed in due course by the cold fit and then they are the worst of sinners and so on in endless rotation and if they could only realise my great discovery the perriodicity of all disease and time their sintiments they would find the hot fit and the cold return chronometrically at intervals as rigular as the tides ebb and flow and the soul has nothing to do with either febrile symptom why religion apart from intermittent fever of the brain is just the caumest peaceablest sedatest thing in all the world ah you are too deep for me my good friend all i know is that she is one of this new school whom i take the liberty to call the fidgety christians they cannot let their poor souls alone a minute and they pester one day and night with the millennium as if we shall not all be dead long before that but the worst is they apply the language of earthly passion to the saviour of mankind and make ones flesh creep at their blasphemies so coarse so familiar like that rude multitude which thronged and pressed him when on earth but after all she came to the church and took my julias part so that shows she has principle and do pray spare me her feelings in any step you take against that dishonourable person her father i must go back to his victim my poor poor childi dare not leave her long oh doctor such a night and if she dozes for a minute it is to wake with a scream and tell me she sees him dead sometimes he is drowned sometimes stained with blood but always dead this evening mr hardie came along in a fly with his luggage on the box returning to musgrove cottage as from yorkshire in passing albion villa he cast it a look of vindictive triumph he got home and nodded by the fire in his character of a man wearied by a long journey jane made him some tea and told him how alfred had disappeared on his weddingday the young scamp said he he added coolly it is no business of mine i had no hand in making the match thank heaven in the conversation that ensued he said he had always been averse to the marriage but not so irreconcilably as to approve this open breach of faith with a respectable young lady this will recoil upon our name you know at this critical time said he then jane mustered courage to confess that she had gone to the wedding herself dear papa said she it was made clear to me that the dodds are acting in what they consider a most friendly way to you they thinki cannot tell you what they think but if mistaken they are sincere and so after prayer and you not being here for me to consult i did go to the church forgive me papa i have but one brother and she is my dear friend mr hardies countenance fell at this announcement and he looked almost diabolical but on second thoughts he cleared up wonderfully i will be frank with you jenny if the wedding had come off i should have been deeply hurt at your supporting that little monster of ingratitude he not only marries against his fathers will that is done every day but slanders and maligns him publicy in his hour of poverty and distress but now that he has broken faith and insulted miss dodd as well as me i declare i am glad you were there jenny it will separate us from his abominable conduct but what does he say for himself what reason does he give oh it is all mystery as yet well but he must have sent some explanation to the dodds he may have i dont know i have not ventured to intrude on my poor insulted friend papa i hear her distress is fearful they fear for her reason oh if harm comes to her god will assuredly punish him whose heartlessness and treachery has brought her to it mark my words she continued with great emotion this cruel act will not go unpunished even in this world there there change the subject said mr hardie peevishly what have i to do with his pranks he has disowned me for his father and i disown him for my son the next day peggy black called and asked to see master old betty after the first surprise looked at her from head to foot and foot to head as if measuring her for a suit of disdain and told her she might carry her own message then flounced into the kitchen and left her to shut the street door which she did she went and dropped her curtsey at the parlour door and in a miminy piminy voice said she was come to make her submission and would he forgive her and give her another trial her penitence after one or two convulsive efforts ended in a very fair flow of tears mr hardie shrugged his shoulders and asked jane if the girl had ever been saucy to her oh no papa indeed i have no fault to find with poor peggy well then go to your work and try and not offend betty remember she is older than you peggy went for her box and bandbox and reinstated herself quietly and all old bettys endeavours to irritate her only elicited a calm cunning smile with a depression of her downy eyelashes albion villa next morning edward dodd was woke out of a sound sleep at about four oclock by a hand upon his shoulder he looked up and rubbed his eyes it was julia standing by his bedside dressed and in her bonnet edward she said in a hurried whisper there is foul play i cannot sleep i cannot be idle he has been decoyed away and perhaps murdered oh pray get up and go to the police office or somewhere with me very well but wait till morning no now nownownow i shall never go out of doors in the daytime again wait im going crazy with wait wait wait wait waiting her hand was like fire on him and her eyes supernaturally bright there said edward with a groan go downstairs and i will be with you directly he came down they went out together her little burning hand pinched his tight and her swift foot seemed scarcely to touch the ground she kept him at his full stride till they got to the central police station there at the very thought of facing men the fiery innocent suddenly shrank together and covered her blushing face with her hot hands she sent him in alone he found an intelligent superintendent who entered into the case with all the coolness of an old official hand edward came out to his sister and as he hurried her home told her what had passed the superintendent asked to see the letter i told him he had taken it with him that was a pity he said then he made me describe alfred to a nicety and the description will go up to london this morning and all over barkington and the neighbourhood and the county she stopped to kiss him then went on again with her head down and neither spoke till they were nearly home then edward told her the superintendent felt quite sure that the villain was not dead nor in danger of it oh bless him bless him for saying so and that he will turn up in london before very long not in this neighbourhood he says he must have known the writer of the letter and his taking his luggage with him shows he has gone off deliberately my poor little ju now do try and look at it as he does and everybody else does try and see it as you would if you were a bystander she laid her soft hand on his shoulder as if to support herself floating in her sea of doubt i do see i am a poor credulous girl but how can my alfred be false to me am i to doubt the bible am i to doubt the sun is nothing true in heaven or earth oh if i could only have died as i was dressing for churchdied while he seemed true he is true the wicked creature has cast some spell on him he has gone in a moment of delirium he will regret what he has done perhaps regrets it now i am ungrateful to you edward and to the good policeman for saying he is not dead what more do i require he is dead to me edward let us leave this place we were going let us go today this very day oh take me and hide me where no one that knows me can ever see me again a flood of tears came to her relief and she went along sobbing and kissing her brothers hand every now and then but as they drew near the gate of albion villa twilight began to usher in the dawn julia shuddered at even that faint light and fled like a guilty thing and hid herself sobbing in her own bedroom mr richard hardie slept better now than he had done for some time past and therefore woke more refreshed and in better spirits he knew an honest family was miserable a few doors off but he did not care he got up and shaved with a mind at ease one morning when he had removed the lather from one half his face he happened to look out of window and saw on the wall oppositea placard a large placard to this effect one hundred guineas reward whereas on the th instant mr alfred hardie disappeared mysteriously from his lodgings in mill street under circumstances suggesting a suspicion of foul play know all men that the above reward will be paid to any person or persons who shall first inform the undersigned where the said alfred hardie is to be found and what person or persons if any have been concerned in his disappearance alexander sampson pope street napoleon square london chapter xxxi the note alfred hardie received on the th of april was from peggy black the letters were well formed for she had been educated at the national school but the style was not upon a par mr alfred sirmargaret black sends her respects and if you want to know the truth about the money i can tell you all and where it is at this present time sir i am now in situation at silverton grove house about a furlong from the station and if you will be so good to call there and ask for margaret i will tell you where it is which i mean the l for it is a sin the young lady should be beguiled of her own only you must please come this evening or else tomorrow before ten oclock by reason my mistress and me we are going up to london that day early and she talk of taking me abroad along with heri remain sir yours respectfully to command margaret black if you please sir not to show this letter on no account alfred read this twice over and felt a contemptuous repugnance towards the writer a cashiered servant who offered to tell the truth out of spite having easily resisted every worthy motive indeed i think he would have perhaps dismissed the subject into the fire but for a strange circumstance that had occurred to him this very afternoon but i had no opportunity to relate it till now well just as he was going to dress for dinner he received a visit from dr wycherley a gentleman he scarcely knew by name dr wycherley inquired after his kephalalgia alfred stared and told him it was much the same troubled him occasionally and your insomnia i dont know the word have you any authority for it dr wycherley smiled with a sort of benevolent superiority that galled his patient and proceeded to inquire after his nightly visions and voices but at this alfred looked grave as well as surprised and vexed he was on his guard now and asked himself seriously what was the meaning of all this and could his father have been so mad as to talk over his own shame with this stranger he made no reply whatever dr wycherleys curiosity was not of a very ardent kind for he was one of those who first form an opinion and then collect the materials of one and a very little fact goes a long way with such minds so when he got no answer about the nocturnal visions and voices he glided calmly on to another matter bythebye that l alfred started and then eyed him keenly what l the fabulous sum you labour under the impression of your father having been guilty of clandestinely appropriating this was too much for alfreds patience i dont know who you are sir said he i never exchanged but three words in my life with you and do you suppose i will talk to a stranger on family matters of so delicate a kind as this i begin to think you have intruded yourself on me simply to gratify an impertinent curiosity the hypothesis is at variance with my established character replied the oleaginous one do me the justice to believe in the necessity of this investigation and that it is one of a most friendly character then i decline the double nuisance your curiosity and your friendship take them both out of my room sir or i shall turn them both out by one pair of shoulders you shall smart for this said the doctor driven to plain english by anger that great solvent of circumlocution with which nature has mercifully supplied us he made to the door opened it and said in considerable excitement to some one outside excitedvery now dr pleonast had no sooner been converted to the vernacular and disappeared than another stranger entered the room he had evidently been lurking in the passage it was a man of smallish stature singularly gaunt angular and haggard but dressed in a spruce suit of black tight new and glossy in short he looked like romeos apothecary gone to stultz with the money he fluttered in with pale cheek and apprehensive body saying hurriedly now my dear sir be calm pray be calm i have come down all the way from london to see you and i am sure you wont make me lose my journey will you now and pray who asked you to come all the way from london sir a person to whom your health is very dear oh indeed so i have secret friends have i well you may tell my secret underhand friends i never was better in my life i am truly glad to hear it said the little man let me introduce myself as dr wycherley forgot to do it and he handed alfred a card on which his name and profession were written well mr speers said alfred i have only a moment to give you for i must dress for dinner what do you want i come sir in hopes of convincing your friends you are not so very ill not incurable why your eye is steady your complexion good a little high with the excitement of this conversation but if we can only get over this little delusion all will be well what little delusion about the l you know what l i have not mentioned l to you have i no sir you seem to shun it like poison that is the worst of it you talk about it to others fast enough but to dr wycherley and myself who could cure you of it you would hide all about it if you could at this alfred rose and put his hands in his pockets and looked down grimly on his inquisitor mr speers said he you had better go there is no credit to be gained by throwing so small an apothecary as you out of that window and you wont find it pleasant either for if you provoke me to it i shall not stand upon ceremony i shant open the window first as i should for dr whats his confounded name at these suggestive words spoken with suppressed ire and flashing eyes speers scuttled to the door crabwise holding the young lion in check conventionallyto wit with an eye as valiant as a sheeps and a joyful apothecary was he when he found himself safe outside the house and beside dr wycherley who was waiting for him alfred soon cooled and began to laugh at his own anger and the unbounded impudence of his visitors but on the other hand it struck him as a grave circumstance that so able a man as his father should stir muddy water should go and talk to these strangers about the money he had misappropriated he puzzled himself all the time he was dressing and not to trouble the reader with all the conjectures that passed through his mind he concluded at last that mr hardie must feel very strong very sure there was no evidence against him but his sons or he would not take the eighth commandment by the horns like this injustice carries it with a high hand thought alfred with a sigh he was not the youth to imitate his fathers shamelessness so he locked this last incident in his own breast did not even mention it to julia but now on reading peggys note his warlike instincts awoke and though he despised his correspondent and her motives he could not let such a chance pass of defeating brazen injustice it was unfortunate and awkward to have to go to silverton on his wedding morning but after all there was plenty of time he packed up his things at once for the wedding tour and in the morning took them with him in the fly to silverton his plan was to come back direct to albion villa so he went to silverton grove full dressed all ready for the wedding as it happened he overtook his friend peterson just outside the town called to him gaily and invited him to church and breakfast to his surprise the young gentleman replied sullenly that he should certainly not come not come old fellow said alfred hurt you have a good cheek to ask me retorted the other this led to an explanation petersons complaint was that he had told alfred he was in love with julia and alfred had gone directly and fallen in love with her just to cut him out what are you talking about said alfred so this is the reason you have kept away from me of late why i was engaged to her at the very time only my father was keeping us apart then why didnt you say so because my love is not of the prattling sort oh nonsense i dont believe a word of it you dont believe my word did you ever know me tell a lie at that rate think what you please sir drive on strabo and so ended that little friendship on the road our ardent youth arranged in his head a noble scheme he would bring peggy black home with him compensating her liberally for the place she would thereby lose would confront her privately with his father and convince him it was his interest to restore the dodds their money with a good grace take the l he had already offered and countenance the wedding by letting jane be present at it it was hard to do all this in the time but well worth trying for and not impossible a twohorse fly is not a slow conveyance and he offered the man a guinea to drive fast so that it was not nine oclock when they reached silverton grove house a place alfred had never heard of this however i may observe was no wonder for it had not borne that name a twelvemonth it was a large square mansion of red brick with stone facings and corners and with balustrades that hid the garret windows it stood in its own grounds and the entrance was through handsome iron gates one of which was wide open to admit people on foot or horseback the flyman got down and tried to open the other but could not manage it there dont waste time said alfred impatiently let me out he found a notice under the bell ring and enter he rang accordingly and at the clang the halldoor opened as if he had pulled a porter along with the bell and a greyhaired servant out of livery stood on the steps to receive him alfred hurried across the plat which was trimmed as neatly as a college green and asked the servant if he could see margaret black margaret black said the man doubtfully ill inquire sir please to follow me they entered a handsome hall with antlers and armour from this a double staircase led up to a landing with folding doors in the centre of it one of these doors was wide open like the iron gate outside the servant showed alfred up the lefthand staircase through the open door into a spacious drawingroom handsomely though not gaily furnished and decorated but a little darkened by venetian blinds the old servant walked gravely on and on till alfred began to think he would butt the wall but he put his hand out and opened a door that might very well escape a strangers notice for it was covered with lookingglass and matched another narrow mirror in shape and size this door led into a very long room as plain and even sordid as the drawingroom was inviting the unpapered walls were a cold drab and wanted washing there was a thick cobweb up in one corner and from the ceiling hung the tail of another which the housemaids broom had scotched not killed that side of the room they entered by was all books the servant said stay here a moment sir and ill send her to you with this he retired into the drawingroom closing the door softly after him once closed it became invisible it fitted like wax and left nothing to be seen but books not even a knob it shut to with that gentle but clean click which a spring bolt however polished and oiled and gently closed will emit altogether it was enough to give some people a turn but alfreds nerves were not to be affected by trifles he put his hands in his pockets and walked up and down the room quietly enough at first but byandbye uneasily confound her for wasting my time thought he why doesnt she come then as he had learned to pick up the fragments of time and hated dawdling he went to take a book from the shelves he found it was a piece of iron admirably painted it chilled his hand with its unexpected coldness and all the books on and about the door were iron and chilly well thought he this is the first dummy ever took me in what a fool the man must be why he could have bought books with ideas in them for the price of these impostors still peggy did not come so he went to a door opposite and at right angles to the farthest window meaning to open it and inquire after her lo and behold he found this was a knob without a door there had been a door but it was blocked up the only available door on that side had a keyhole but no latch nor handle alfred was a prisoner he no sooner found this out than he began to hammer on the door with his fists and call out this had a good effect for he heard a womans dress come rustling a key was inserted and the door opened but instead of peggy it was a tall wellformed woman of thirty with dark grey eyes and straightish eyebrows massive and black as jet she was dressed quietly but like a lady mrs archbold for that was her name cast on alfred one of those swift alldevouring glances with which her sex contrive to take in the features character and dress of a person from head to foot and smiled most graciously on him revealing a fine white set of teeth she begged him to take a seat and sat down herself she had left the door ajar i came to see margaret black said alfred margaret black there is no such person here was the quiet reply what has she gone away so early as this mrs archbold smiled and said soothingly are you sure she ever existed except in your imagination alfred laughed at this and showed her peggys letter she ran her eye over it and returned it him with a smile of a different kind half pitying half cynical but presently resuming her former manner i remember now said she in dulcet tones the anxiety you are labouring under is about a large sum of money is it not what can you give me any information about it said he surprised i think we can render you great service in the matter infinite service mr hardie was the reply in a voice of very honey alfred was amazed at this you say you dont know peggy and yet you seem to know me i never saw you in my life before madam what on earth is the meaning of all this calm yourself said mrs archbold laying a white and finely moulded hand upon his arm there is no wonder nor mystery in the matter you were expected the colour rushed into alfreds face and he started to his feet some vague instinct told him to be gone from this place the lady fixed her eyes on him put her hand to a gold chain that was round her neck and drew out of her white bosom not a locket nor a key but an ivory whistle keeping her eye steadily fixed on alfred she breathed softly into the whistle then two men stepped quietly in at the door one was a short stout snob with great red whiskers the other a wiry gentleman with irongrey hair the latter spoke to alfred and began to coax him if mrs archbold was honey this personage was treacle be calm my dear young gentleman dont agitate yourself you have been sent here for your good and that you may be cured and so restored to society and to your anxious and affectionate friends what are you talking about what do you mean cried alfred are you mad no we are not said the short snob with a coarse laugh have done with this fooling then said alfred sharply the person i came to see is not here good morning the short man instantly stepped to the door and put his back to it the other said calmly no mr hardie you cannot leave the house at present cant i why not pray said alfred drawing his breath hard and his eyes began to glitter dangerously we are responsible for your safety we have force at hand if necessary pray do not compel us to summon it why where am i said alfred panting now is this a prison no no said mrs archbold soothingly it is a place where you will be cured of your headaches and your delusions and subjected to no unnecessary pain nor restraint oh bother said the short snob brutally why make two bites of a cherry you are in my asylum young gentleman and a devilish lucky thing for you at this fatal word asylum alfred uttered a cry of horror and despair and his eyes roved wildly round the room in search of escape but the windows of the room though outside the house they seemed to come as low as those of the drawingroom were partly brickedup within and made just too high to be reached without a chair and his captors read that wild glance directly and the doctor whipped one chair away while mrs archbold with more tact sat quietly down on the other they all three blew their whistles shrilly alfred uttered an oath and rushed at the door but heard heavy feet running on stone passages towards the whistles and felt he had no chance out that way his dilating eye fell upon the handle of the old defunct door he made a high leap came down with his left foot on its knob of brass and though of course he could not stand on it contrived to spring from it slap at the windowmrs archbold screamedhe broke the glass with his shoulder and tore and kicked the woodwork and squeezed through on to a stone ledge outside and stood there bleeding and panting just as half a dozen keepers burst into the room at his back he was more than twenty feet from the ground to leap down was death or mutilation he saw the flyman driving away he yelled to him hy hy stop stop the flyman stopped and looked round but soon as he saw who it was he just grinned alfred could see his hideous grin and there was the rattle of chairs being brought to the window and men were mounting softly to secure him a coarse hand stole towards his ankle he took a swift step and sprang desperately on to the next ledgeit was an old manor house and these ledges were nearly a foot broadfrom this one he bounded to the next and then to a third the last but one on this side of the building the corner ledge was but half the size and offered no safe footing but close to it he saw the outside leaves of a tree that tree then must grow close to the corner could he but get round to it he might yet reach the ground whole urged by that terror of a madhouse which is natural to a sane man and in england is fed by occasional disclosures and the general suspicion they excite he leaped on to a piece of stone no bigger than ones hat and then whirled himself round into the tree all eyes to see and claws to grasp it was a weeping ash he could get hold of nothing but soft yielding slivers that went through his fingers and so down with him like a bulrush and souse he went with his hands full of green leaves over head and ears into the water of an enormous iron tank that fed the baths the heavy plunge the sudden cold water the instant darkness were appalling yet like the fox among the hounds the gallant young gentleman did not lose heart nor give tongue he came up gurgling and gasping and swimming for his life in manly silence he swam round and round the edge of the huge tank trying in vain to get a hold upon its cold rusty walls he heard whistles and voices about they came faint to him where he was but he knew they could not be very far off life is sweet it flashed across him how a few years before a university man of great promise had perished miserably in a tank on some swiss mountaina tank placed for the comfort of travellers he lifted his eyes to heaven in despair and gave one great sob then he turned upon his back and floated but he was obliged to paddle with his hands a little to keep up a window opened a few feet above him and a face peered out between the bars then he gave all up for lost and looked to hear a voice denounce him but no the livid face and staring eyes at the window took no notice of him it was a maniac whose eyes bereft of reason conveyed no images to the sentient brain only by some half vegetable instinct this darkened man was turning towards the morning sun and staring it full in the face alfred saw the rays strike and sparkle on those glassy orbs and fire them yet they never so much as winked he was appalled yet fascinated by this weird sight could not take his eyes off it and shuddered at it in the very water with such creatures as that he must be confined or die miserably like a mouse in a basin of water he hesitated between two horrors presently his foot struck something and he found it was a large pipe that entered the tank to the distance of about a foot this pipe was not more than three feet under water and alfred soon contrived to get upon it and rest his fingers upon the iron edge of the tank the position was painful yet so he determined to remain till night and then if possible steal away every faculty of mind and body was strung up to defend himself against the wretches who had entrapped him he had not been long in this position when voices approached and next the shadow of a ladder moved across the wall towards him the keepers were going to search his pitiable hidingplace they knew what he did not that there was no outlet from the premises so now having hunted every other corner and cranny they came by what is called the exhaustive process of reasoning to this tank and when they got near it something in the appearance of the tree caught the gardeners quick eye alfred quaking heard him say look here he is not far from this another voice said then the lord have mercy on him why theres seven foot of water i measured it last night at this alfred was conscious of a movement and a murmur that proved humanity was not extinct and the ladder was fixed close to the tank and feet came hastily up it alfred despaired but as usual with spirits so quickwitted and resolute it was but for a moment one man in his time plays many animals he caught at the words he had heard and played the game the jackal desperate plays in india the fox in england the elephant in ceylon he feigned death filled his mouth with water floated on his back paddling imperceptibly and half closed his eyes he was rewarded by a loud shout of dismay just above his head and very soon another ladder was placed on the other side and with ropes and hands he was drawn out and carried down the ladder he took this opportunity to discharge the water from his mouth on which a coarse voice said look there his troubles are at an end however they laid him on the grass and sent for the doctor then took off his coat and one of them began to feel his heart to see whether there was any pulsation left he found it thumping look out he cried in some alarm hes shamming abraham but before the words were well uttered alfred who was a practised gymnast bounded off the ground without touching it with his hands and fled like a deer towards the front of the house for he remembered the open iron gate the attendants followed shouting and whistle answered whistle all over the grounds alfred got safe to the iron gate alas it had been closed at the first whistle twenty minutes ago he turned in rage and desperation and the headkeeper a powerful man was rushing incautiously upon him alfred instantly steadied himself and with his long arm caught the man in full career a lefthanded blow like the kick of a pony that laid his cheek open and knocked him stupid and staggering he followed it up like lightning with his right and throwing his whole weight into this second blow sent the staggering man to grass slipped past another and skirting the south side of the house got to the tank again well in advance of his pursuers seized the ladder carried it to the garden wall and was actually half way up it and saw the open country and liberty when the ladder was dragged away and he fell heavily to the ground and a keeper threw himself bodily on him alfred half expected this and drawing up his foot in time dashed it furiously in the coming face actually knocking the man backwards another kneeled on his chest alfred caught him by the throat so felly that he lost all power and they rolled over and over together and alfred got clear and ran for it again and got on the middle of the lawn and hallooed to the househy hy are there any more sane men imprisoned there come out and fight for your lives instantly the open windows were filled with white faces some grinning some exulting all greatly excited and a hideous uproar shook the whole placefor the poor souls were all sane in their own opinionand the whole force of attendants two of them bleeding profusely from his blows made a cordon and approached him but he was too cunning to wait to be fairly surrounded he made his rush at an underkeeper feinted at his head caught him a heavy blow in the pit of the stomach doubled him up in a moment and off again leaving the man on his knees vomiting and groaning several mild maniacs ran out in vast agitation and to curry favour offered to help catch him vast was their zeal but when it came to the point they only danced wildly about and cried stop him for gods sake stop him hes ill dreadfully ill poor wretch knock out his brains and whenever he came near them away they ran whining like kicked curs mrs archbold looking out at a window advised them all to let him alone and she would come out and persuade him but they would not be advised they chased him about the lawn but so swift of foot was he and so long in the reach that no one of them could stop him nor indeed come near him without getting a facer that came like a flash of lightning at last however they got so well round him he saw his chance was gone he took off his hat to mrs archbold at the window and said quietly i surrender to you madam at these words they rushed on him rashly on this he planted two blows right and left swift as a cat attacked by dogs administered two fearful black eyes and instantly folded his arms saying haughtily it was to the lady i yielded not to you fellows they seized him shook their fists in his face cursed him and pinned him he was quite passive they handcuffed him and drove him before them shoving him every now and then roughly by the shoulders he made no resistance spoke no word they took him to the strongroom and manacled his ankles together with an iron hobble and then strapped them to the bedposts and fastened his body down by broad bands of ticking with leathern straps at the ends and so left him more helpless than a swaddled infant the hurry and excitement of defence were over and a cold stupor of misery came down and sat like lead on him he lay mute as death in his gloomy cell a tomb within a living tomb and as he lay deeper horror grew and grew in his dilating eyes gusts of rage swept over him shook him and passed then gusts of despairing tenderness all came and went but his bonds what would his julia think if he could only let her know at this thought he called he shouted he begged for a messenger there was no reply the cry of a dangerous lunatic from the strongroom was less heeded here than a bark from any dogkennel in christendom this is my fathers doing he said curse him curse him curse him and his brain seemed on fire his temples throbbed he vowed to god to be revenged on his father then he writhed at his own meanness in coming to visit a servant and his folly in being caught by so shallow an artifice he groaned aloud the clock in the hall struck ten there was just time to get back if they would lend him a conveyance he shouted he screamed he prayed he offered terms humbly piteously he would forgive his father forgive them all he would say no more about the money would do anything consent to anything if they would only let him keep faith with his julia they had better consent and not provoke his vengeance have mercy on me he cried dont make me insult her i love they will all be waiting for me it is my weddingday you cant have known it is my weddingday fiends monsters i tell you it is my weddingday oh pray send the lady to me she cant be all stone and my misery might melt a stone he listened for an answer he prayed for an answer there was none once in a madhouse the sanest man is mad however interested and barefaced the motive of the relative who has brought two of the most venal class upon the earth to sign away his wits behind his back and once hobbled and strapped he is a dangerous maniac for just so many days weeks or years as the hobbles handcuffs and jacket happen to be left upon him by inhumanity economy or simple carelessness poor alfreds cries and prayers were heard but no more noticed than the night howl of a wolf on some distant mountain all was sullen silence but the grating tongue of the clock which told the victim of a legislatures shallowness and a fathers avaricethat time deaf to his woe as were the walls the men the women and the cutting bands was stealing away with iron finger his last chance of meeting his beloved at the altar he closed his eyes and saw her lovelier than ever dressed all in white waiting for him with sweet concern in that peerless face julia julia he cried with a loud heartbroken cry the halfhour struck at that he struggled he writhed he bounded he made the very room shake and lacerated his flesh but that was all no answer no motion no help no hope the perspiration rolled down his steaming body the tears burst from his young eyes and ran down his cheeks he sobbed and sobbing almost choked so tight were his linen bands upon his bursting bosom he lay still exhausted the clock ticked harshly on the rest was silence with this miserable exception ever and anon the victims jammed body shuddered so terribly it shook and rattled the iron bedstead and told of the storm within the agony of the racked and all foreboding soul for then rolled over that young head hours of mortal anguish that no tongue of man can utter nor pen can shadow chained sane amongst the mad on his weddingday expecting with tied hands the sinister acts of the soulmurderers who had the power to make their lie a truth we can paint the body writhing vainly against its unjust bonds but who can paint the loathing agonised soul in a mental situation so ghastly for my part i feel it in my heart of hearts but am impotent to convey it to others impotent impotent pray think of it for yourselves men and women if you have not sworn never to think over a novel think of it for your own sakes alfreds turn today it may be yours tomorrow chapter xxxii at two oclock an attendant stole on tiptoe to the strongroom unlocked the door and peeped cautiously in seeing the dangerous maniac quiet he entered with a plate of lukewarm beef and potatoes and told him bluntly to eat the crushed one said he could not eat you must said the man eat said alfred of what do you think i am made pray put it down and listen to me ill give you a hundred pounds to let me out of this place two hundred three a coarse laugh greeted this proposal you might as well have made it a thousand when you was about it so i will said alfred eagerly and thank you on my knees besides ah i see you dont believe i have money i give you my honour i have ten thousand pounds it was settled on me by my grandfather and i came of age last week oh thats like enough said the man carelessly well you are green do you think them as sent you here will let you spend your money no your money is theirs now and he sat down with the plate on his knee and began to cut the meat in small pieces while his careless words entered alfreds heart and gave him such a glimpse of sinister motives and dark acts to come as set him shuddering come none o that said the man suspecting this shudder he thought it was the prologue to some desperate act for all a chained madman does is read upon this plan his terror passes for rage his very sobs for snarls oh be honest with me said alfred imploringly do you think it is to steal my money the wretch has stolen my liberty what wretch my father i know nothing about it said the man sullenly in course theres mostly money behind when young gents like you come to be took care of but you musnt go thinking of that or youll excite yourself again come you eat your vittles like a christian and no more about it leave it that is a good fellow and then ill try and eat a little byandbye but my grief is greatoh julia julia what shall i do and i am not used to eat at this time will you my good fellow well i will now you behave like a gentleman said the man then alfred coaxed him to take off the handcuffs he refused but ended by doing it and so left him four more leaden hours rolled by and then this same attendant his name was brown brought him a cup of tea it was welcome to his parched throat he drank it and ate a mouthful of the meat to please the man and even asked for some more tea at eight four keepers came into his room undressed him compelled him to make his toilette c before them which put him to shamebeing a gentlemanalmost as much as it would a woman they then hobbled him and fastened his ankles to the bed and put his hands into muffles but did not confine his body because they had lost a lucrative lodger only a month ago throttled at night in a straitwaistcoat alfred lay in this plight and compared with anguish unspeakable his joyful anticipations of this night with the strange and cruel reality my wedding night my wedding night he cried aloud and burst into a passion of grief byandbye he consoled himself a little with the hope that he could not long be incarcerated as a madman being sane and his good wit told him his only chance was calmness he would go to sleep and recover composure to bear his wrongs with dignity and quietly baffle his enemies just as he was dropping off he felt something crawl over his face instinctively he made a violent motion to put his hands up both hands were confined he could not move them he bounded he flung he writhed his little persecutors were quiet a moment but the next they began again in vain he rolled and writhed and shuddered with loathing inexpressible they crawled they smelt they bit many a poor soul these little wretches had distracted with the very sleeplessness the madhouse professed to cure not create in conjunction with the opiates the confinement and the gloom of silverton house they had driven many a feeble mind across the line that divides the weak and nervous from the unsound when he found there was no help alfred clenched his teeth and bore itbite on ye little wretches he said bite on and divert my mind from deeper stings than yoursif you can and they did a little thus passed the night in mental agony and bodily irritation and disgust at daybreak the feasters on his flesh retired and utterly worn out and exhausted he sank into a deep sleep at halfpast seven the head keeper and three more came in and made him dress before them they handcuffed him and took him down to breakfast in the noisy ward set him down on a little bench by the wall like a naughty boy and ordered a dangerous maniac to feed him the dangerous maniac obeyed and went and sat beside alfred with a basin of thick gruel and a great wooden spoon he shovelled the gruel down his charges throat mighty superciliously from the very first and presently falling into some favourite and absorbing train of thought he fixed his eye on vacancy and handed the spoonfuls over his left shoulder with such rapidity and recklessness that it was more like sowing than feeding alfred cried out quarter i cant eat so fast as that old fellow something in his tone struck the maniac he looked at alfred full alfred looked at him in return and smiled kindly but sadly hallo cried the maniac whats up now said a keeper fiercely why this man is sane as sane as i am at this there was a horse laugh saner persisted the maniac for i am a little queer at times you know and no mistake jemmy now what makes you think he is sane looked me full in the face and smiled at me oh that is your test is it yes it is you try it on any of those mad beggars there and see if they can stand it who invented gunpowder said one of the insulted persons looking as sly and malicious as a magpie going to steal jemmy exploded directly i did ye rascal ye liar ye rogue ye baconian and going higher and higher in this strain was very soon handcuffed with alfreds handcuffs and seated on alfreds bench and tied to two rings in the wall on this his martial ardour went down to zero here is treatment sir said he piteously to alfred i see you are a gentleman now look at this all spite and jealousy because i invented that invaluable substance which has done so much to prolong human life and alleviate human misery alfred was now ordered to feed jemmy which he did so quickly were their parts inverted directly after breakfast alfred demanded to see the proprietor of the asylum answer doesnt live here the doctor then oh he has not come this monstrosity irritated alfred well then said he whoever it is that rules this den of thieves when those two are out of it i rule in mr bakers absence said the head keeper and ill teach you manners you young blackguard handcuff him in five minutes alfred was handcuffed and flung into a padded room stay there till you know how to speak to your betters said the head keeper alfred walked up and down grinding his teeth with rage for five long hours just before dinner brown came and took him into a parlour where mrs archbold was seated writing brown retired the lady finished what she was doing and kept alfred standing like a schoolboy going to be lectured at last she said i have sent for you to give you a piece of advice it is to try and make friends with the attendants me make friends with the scoundrels i thirst for their lives oh madam i fear i shall kill somebody here foolish boy they are too strong for you your worst enemies could wish nothing worse for you than that you should provoke them in saying these words she was so much more kind and womanly that alfred conceived hopes and burst out oh madam you are human then you seem to pity me pray give me pen and paper and let me write to my friends to get me out of this terrible place do not refuse me mrs archbold resumed her distant manner without apparent effort she said nothing but she placed writing materials before him she then left the room and locked him in he wrote a few hasty ardent words to julia telling her how he had been entrapped but not a word about his sufferingshe was too generous to give her needless painand a line to edward imploring him to come at once with a lawyer and an honest physician and liberate him mrs archbold returned soon after and he asked her if she would lend him sealingwax i dare not trust to an envelope in such a place as this said he she lent him sealingwax but how am i to post it said he easily there is a box in the house i will show you she took him and showed him the box he put his letters into it and in the ardour of his gratitude kissed her hand she winced a little and said mind this is not by my advice i would never tell my friends i had been in a madhouse oh never i would be calm make friends with the servantsthey are the real mastersand never let a creature know where i had been oh you dont know my julia said alfred she will never desert me never think the worse of me because i have been entrapped illegally into a madhouse illegally mr hardie you deceive yourself mr baker told me the order was signed by a relation and the certificates by firstrate lunacy doctors what on earth has that to do with it madam when i am as sane as you are it has everything to do with it mr baker could be punished for confining a madman in this house without an order and two certificates but he couldnt for confining a sane person under an order and two certificates alfred could not believe this but she convinced him that it was so then he began to fear he should be imprisoned for years he turned pale and looked at her so piteously that to soothe him she told him sane people were never kept in asylums now they only used to be how can they said she the london asylums are visited four times a year by the commissioners and the country asylums six times twice by the commissioners and four times by the justices we shall be inspected this week or next and then you can speak to the justices mind and be calm say it is a mistake offer testimony and ask either to be discharged at once or to have a commission of lunacy sit on you ten to one your friends will not face public proceedings but you must begin at the foundation by making the servants friendlyand bybeing calm she then fixed her large grey eyes on him and said now if i let you dine with me and the firstclass patients will you pledge me your honour to be calm and not attempt to escape alfred hesitated at that her eye dissected his character all the time i promise said he at last with a deep sigh may i sit by you there is something so repugnant in the very idea of mad people try and remember it is their misfortune not their crime said mrs archbold just like a matronly sister admonishing a brother from school she then whistled in a whisper for brown who was lurking about unseen all the time he emerged and walked about with alfred and byandbye looking down from a corridor they saw mrs archbold driving the secondclass women before her to dinner like a flock of animals whenever one stopped to look at anything or try and gossip the philanthropic archbold went at her just like a shepherds dog at a refractory sheep caught her by the shoulders and drove her squeaking headlong at dinner alfred was so fortunate as to sit opposite a gentleman who nodded and grinned at him all dinner with a horrible leer he could not however enjoy this to the full for a little distraction at his elbow his right hand neighbour kept forking pieces out of his plate and substituting others from his own there was even a tendency to gristle in the latter alfred remonstrated gently at first the gentleman forbore a minute then recommenced alfred laid a hand very quietly on his wrist and put it back mrs archbolds quick eye surprised this gesture what is the matter there said she oh nothing serious madam replied alfred only this gentleman does me the honour to prefer the contents of my plate to his own mr cooper said the archbold sternly cooper the head keeper pounced on the offender seized him roughly by the collar dragged him from the table knocking his chair down and bundled him out of the room with ignominy and fracas in spite of a remonstrance from alfred oh dont be so rough with the poor man then the novice laid down his knife and fork and ate no more i am grieved at my own illnature in complaining of such a trifle said he when all was quiet the company stared considerably at this remark it seemed to them a most morbid perversion of sensibility for the deranged thinskinned beyond conception in their own persons and alive to the shadow of the shade of a wrong are stoically indifferent to the woes of others though alfred was quiet as a lamb all day the attendants returned him to the padded room at night because he had been there last night but they only fastened one ankle to the bedpost so he encountered his lilliputians on tolerably fair termsnumbers excepted they swarmed unable to sleep he put out his hand and groped for his clothes but they were outside the door according to rule day broke at last and he took his breakfast quietly with the firstclass patients it consisted of cool tea in small basins instead of cups and tablespoons instead of teaspoons and thick slices of stale bread thinly buttered a few patients had gruel or porridge instead of tea after breakfast alfred sat in the firstclass patients room and counted the minutes and the hours till edward should come after dinner he counted the hours till teatime nobody came and he went to bed in such grief and disappointment as some men live to eighty without ever knowing but when two oclock came next day and no edward and no reply then the distress of his soul deepened he implored mrs archbold to tell him what was the cause she shook her head and said gravely it was but too common a mans nearest and dearest were very apt to hold aloof from him the moment he was put into an asylum here an old lady put in her word ah sir you must not hope to hear from anybody in this place why i have been two years writing and writing and cant get a line from my own daughter to be sure she is a fine lady now but it was her poor neglected mother that pinched and pinched to give her a good education and that is how she caught a good husband but its my belief the post in our hall isnt a real post but only a box and i think it is contrived so as the letters fall down a pipe into that bakers hands and so then when the postman comes the archbold bent her bushy brows on this chatty personage be quiet mrs dent you are talking nonsense and exciting yourself you know you are not to speak on that topic take care the poor old woman was shut up like a knife for the archbold had a way of addressing her own sex that crushed them the change was almost comically sudden to the mellow tones in which she addressed alfred the very next moment on the very same subject mr baker i believe sees the letters and where our poor patients with a glance at dent write in such a way as to wound and perhaps terrify those who are in reality their best friends they are not always sent but i conclude your letters have gone if you feel you can be calm why not ask mr baker he is in the house now for a wonder alfred promised to be calm and she got him an interview with mr baker he was a fullblown pawnbroker of silverton town whom the legislature with that keen knowledge of human nature which marks the british senate permitted and still permits to speculate in insanity stipulating however that the upper servant of all in his asylum should be a doctor but omitting to provide against the instant dismissal of the said doctor should he go and rob his employer of a lodgerby curing a patient as you are not the british legislature i need not tell you that to this pawnbroker insanity mattered nothing nor sanity his trade lay in catching and keeping and stinting as many lodgers sane or insane as he could hold there are certain formulae in these quiet retreats which naturally impose upon greenhorns such as alfred certainly was and some visiting justices and lunacy commissioners would seem to be baker had been a lodginghouse keeper for certified people many years and knew all the formulae some call them dodges but these must surely be vulgar minds baker worked the seesaw formula letters young gentleman said he they are not in my department they go into the surgery and are passed by the doctor except those he examines and orders to be detained alfred demanded the doctor he is gone was the reply formula alfred found it as hard to be calm as some people find it easy to say that word over the wrongs of others the next day but not till the afternoon he caught the doctor my letters surely sir you have not been so cruel as to intercept them i intercept no letters said the doctor as if scandalised at the very idea i see who writes them and hand them to mr baker with now and then a remark if any are detained the responsibility rests with him he says it rests with you you must have misunderstood him not at all sir one thing is clear my letters have been stolen either by him or you and i will know which the doctor parried with a formula you are excited mr hardie be calm sir be calm or you will be here all the longer all alfred obtained by this interview was a powerful opiate the headkeeper brought it him in bed he declined to take it the man whistled and the room filled with keepers now said cooper down with it or youll have to be drenched with this cowhorn you had better take it sir said brown the doctor has ordered it you the doctor well let me see the doctor about it he is gone he never ordered it me said alfred then fixing his eyes sternly on cooper you miscreants you want to poison me no i will not take it murder murder then ensued a struggle on which i draw a veil but numbers won the day with the help of handcuffs and a cowhorn brown went and told mrs archbold and what alfred had said dont be alarmed said that strongminded lady it is only one of the old fools composing draughts it will spoil the poor boys sleep for one night that is all go to him the first thing in the morning about midnight alfred was seized with a violent headache and fever towards morning he was lightheaded and brown found him loud and incoherent only he returned often to an expression mr brown had never heard before justifiable parricide justifiable parricide justifiable patricide most people dislike new phrases brown ran to consult mrs archbold about this one after the delay inseparable from her sex she came in a morning wrapper and they found alfred leaning over the bed and bleeding violently at the nose they were a good deal alarmed and tried to stop it but alfred was quite sensible now and told them it was doing him good i can manage to see now he said a little while ago i was blind with the poison they unstrapped his ankle and made him comfortable and mrs archbold sent brown for a cup of strong coffee and a glass of brandy he tossed them off and soon after fell into a deep sleep that lasted till teatime this sleep the poor doctor ascribed to the sedative effect of his opiate it was the natural exhaustion consequent on the morbid excitement caused by his cursed opiate brown said mrs archbold if dr bailey prescribes again let me know he shant square this patient with his certificates whilst i am here this was a shrewd but uncharitable speech of hers dr bailey was not such a villain as that he was a less depraved and more dangerous animal he was a fool the farrago he had administered would have done an excited maniac no good of course but no great harm it was dangerous to a sane man and alfred to the naked eye was a sane man but then bailey had no naked eye left he had been twenty years an m d the certificates of wycherley and speers were the green spectacles he worevery green oneswhenever he looked at alfred hardie perhaps in time he will forget those certificates and on his spectacles dropping off he will see alfred is sane if he does he will publish him as one of his most remarkable cures meanwhile the whole treatment of this illstarred young gentleman gravitated towards insanity the inner mind was exasperated by barefaced injustice and oppression above all by his letters being stopped for that convinced him both baker and bailey with their seesaw evasions knew he was sane and dreaded a visit from honest understanding men and the minds external organ the brain which an asylum professes to soothe was steadily undermined by artificial sleeplessness a man cant sleep in irons till he is used to them and when alfred was relieved of these his sleep was still driven away by biting insects and barking dogs two opiates provided in many of these placid retreats with a view to the permanence rather than the comfort of the lodgers on the eighth day alfred succeeded at last in an object he had steadily pursued for some time he caught the two seesaw humbugs together now said he you say he intercepts my letters and he says it is you who do it which is the truth they were staggered and he followed up his advantage look me in the face gentlemen said he can you pretend you do not know i am sane ah you turn your heads away you can only tell this barefaced lie behind my back do you believe in god and in a judgment to come then if you cannot release me at least dont be such scoundrels as to stop my letters and so swindle me out of a fair trial an open public trial the doctor parried with a formula publicity would be the greatest misfortune could befall you pray be calm now an asylum is a place not entirely exempt from prejudices and one of them is that any sort of appeal to god almighty is a sign or else forerunner of maniacal excitement these philosophers forget that by stopping letters evading public trials and in a word cutting off all appeals to human justice they compel the patient to turn his despairing eyes and lift his despairing voice to him whose eye alone can ever really penetrate these dark abodes however the patient who appealed to god above a whisper in silverton grove house used to get soothed directly and the tranquillising influences employed were morphia croton oil or a blister the keeper came to alfred in his room doctor has ordered a blister what for send for him directly he is gone this way of ordering torture and then coolly going irritated alfred beyond endurance though he knew he should soon be powerless he showed fight made his mark as usual on a couple of his zealous attendants but not having room to work in was soon overpowered hobbled and handcuffed then they cut off his hair and put a large blister on the top of his head the obstinate brute declined to go mad they began to respect him for this tenacity of purpose a decent bedroom was allotted him his portmanteau and bag were brought him and he was let walk every day on the lawn with a keeper only there were no ladders left about and the trapdoor was locked ie the iron gate on one of these occasions he heard the gatekeeper whistle three times consecutively his attendant followed suit and hurried alfred into the house which soon rang with treble signals what is it inquired alfred the visiting justices are in sight go into your room please yes ill go said alfred affecting cheerful compliance and the man ran off the whole house was in a furious bustle all the hobbles and chains and instruments of restraint were hastily collected and bundled out of sight and clean sheets were being put on many a filthy bed whose occupant had never slept in sheets since he came there when two justices arrived and were shown into the drawingroom during the few minutes they were detained there by mrs archbold who was mistress of her whole business quite a new face was put on everything and everybody ancient cobwebs fell soap and water explored unwonted territories the harshest attendants began practising pleasant looks and kind words on the patients to get into the way of it so that it might not come too abrupt and startle the patients visibly under the visitors eyes something like actors working up a factitious sentiment at the wing for the public display or like a racehorses preliminary canter alfreds heart beat with joy inexpressible he had only to keep calm and this was his last day at silverton grove the first thing he did was to make a careful toilet the stinginess of relations and the greed of madhouse proprietors make many a patient look ten times madder than he is by means of dress clothes wear out in an asylum and are not always taken off though agriculture has long and justly claimed them for her own and when it is no longer possible to refuse the reverend mad tom or mrs crazy jane some new raiment then consanguineous munificence does not go to pool or elise but oftener to paternal or maternal wardrobes and even to the ancestral chest the old oak one singing poor things they are out of the world what need for them to be in the fashion formula this arrangement keeps the bump of selfesteem down especially in women and so cooperates with many other little arrangements to perpetuate the lodger silverton grove in particular was supplied with the grotesque in dress from an inexhaustible source whenever money was sent baker to buy a patient a suit he went from his lunacy shop to his pawnbrokers dived headlong into unredeemed pledges dressed his patient as gentlemen are dressed to reside in cherrytrees and pocketed five hundred per cent on the double transaction now alfred had already observed that many of the patients looked madder than they werethanks to short trousers and petticoats holey gloves earcutting shirtcollars frilled bosoms shoes made for and declined by the very infantry coats short in the waist and long in the sleeves coalscuttle bonnets and grandmaternal caps so he made his toilet with care and put his best hat on to hide his shaven crown he then kept his door ajar and waited for a chance of speaking to the justices one soon came a portly old gentleman with a rubicund face and honest eye walked slowly along the corridor looking as wise as he could cringed on by cooper and dr bailey the latter had arrived post haste and baker had been sent for alfred came out touched his hat respectfully and begged a private interview with the magistrate the old gentleman bowed politely for alfreds dress address and countenance left no suspicion of insanity possible in an unprejudiced mind but the doctor whispered in his ear take care sir dangerous now this is one of the most effective of the formulae in a private asylum how can an inexperienced stranger know for certain that such a statement is a falsehood and even the just do not love justiceto othersquite so well as they love their own skins so squire tollett very naturally declined a private interview with alfred and even drew back a step and felt uneasy at being so near him alfred implored him not to be imposed upon an honest man does not whisper said he do not let him poison your mind against me on my honour i am as sane as you are and he knows it pray pray use your own eyes and ears sir and give yourself a chance of discovering the truth in this stronghold of lies dont excite yourself mr hardie put in the doctor parentally formula dont you interrupt me doctor i am as calm as you are calmer for see you are pale at this moment that is with fear that your wickedness in detaining a sane man here is going to be exposed oh sir said he turning to the justice fear no violence from me not even angry words my misery is too deep for irritation or excitement i am an oxford man sir a prize man an ireland scholar but unfortunately for me my mother left me ten thousand pounds and a heart i love a lady whose name i will not pollute by mentioning it in this den of thieves my father is the wellknown banker bankrupt and cheat of barkington he has wasted his own money and now covets his neighbours and his sons he had me entrapped here on my weddingday to get hold of my money and rob me of her i love i appeal to you sir to discharge me or if you have not so much confidence in your own judgment as to do that then i demand a commission of lunacy and a public inquiry dr bailey said that would be a most undesirable exposure both to yourself and your friends formula it is only the guilty who fear the light sir was the prompt reply mr tollett said he thought the patient had a legal right to a commission of lunacy if there was property and he took note of the application he then asked alfred if he had any complaint to make of the food the beds or the attendants sir said alfred i leave those complaints to the insane ones with me the gigantic wrong drives out the petty worries i cannot feel my stings for my deep wound oh then you admit you are not treated unkindly here i admit nothing of the kind sir i merely decline to encumber your memory with petty injuries when you are good enough to inquire into a monstrous one now that is very sensible and considerate said mr tollett i will see you sir again before we leave with this promise alfred was obliged to be content he retired respectfully and the justice said he seems as sane as i am the doctor smiled the justice observed it and not aware that this smile was a formula as much so as a prizefighters or a balletdancers began to doubt a little he reflected a moment then asked who had signed the certificates dr wycherley for one dr wycherley that is a great authority one of the greatest in the country sir oh then one would think he must be more or less deranged dangerously so at times but in his lucid intervals you never saw a more quiet gentlemanly creature formula how sad very he is my most interesting patient formula though terribly violent at times would you like to see the medical journal about him yes byandbye the inspection then continued the inspector admired the clean sheets that covered the beds all of them dirty some filthy and asked the more reasonable patients to speak freely and say if they had any complaint to make this question being with the usual sagacity of public inspectors put in the presence of cooper and the doctor who stuck to tollett like wax the mad people all declared they were very kindly treated the reason they were so unanimous was this they knew by experience that if they told the truth the justices could not at once remedy their discomforts whereas the keepers the very moment the justices left the house would knock them down beat them shake them straitjacket them and starve them and the doctor less merciful would doctor them so they shook in their shoes and vowed they were very comfortable in silverton grove thus in later days certain commissioners of lunacy inspecting accomb house extracted nothing from mrs turner but that she was happy and comfortable under the benignant sway of metcalf the mildthere present it was only by a miracle the public learned the truth and miracles are rare meantime alfred had a misgiving the plausible doctor had now squire tolletts ear and tollett was old and something about him reminded the oxonian of a trait his friend horace had detected in old age vel quod res omnes timide gelide que ministrat dilator spe longus iners c he knew there was another justice in the house but he knew also he should not be allowed to get speech with him if by cunning or force it could be prevented he kept his door ajar presently nurse hannah came bustling along with an apronful of things and let herself into a vacant room hard by this hannah was a young woman with a pretty and rather babyish face diversified by a thick biceps muscle in her arm that a blacksmith need not have blushed for and i suspect it was this masculine charm and not her feminine features that had won her the confidence of baker and co and the respect of his female patients big or little excited or not excited there was not one of them this bicipital babyface could not pin by the wrists and twist her helpless into a strongroom or handcuff her unaided in a moment and she did it too on slight provocation nurse hannah seldom came into alfreds part of the house but when she did meet him she generally gave him a kind look in passing and he had resolved to speak to her and try if he could touch her conscience or move her pity he saw what she was at but was too politic to detect her openly and irritate her he drew back a step and said softly nurse hannah are you there yes i am here said she sharply and came out of the room hastily and shut it what do you want sir alfred clasped his hands together if you are a woman have pity on me she was taken by surprise what can i do said she in some agitation i am only a servant at least tell me where i can find the visiting justice before the keepers stop me hush speak lower said hannah you have complained to one havent you yes but he seems a feeble old fogy where is the other oh pray tell me i mustnt i mustnt in the noisy ward there run and run he did alfred was lucky enough to get safe into the noisy ward without being intercepted and then he encountered a sunburnt gentleman under thirty in a ridingcoat with a huntingwhip in his hand it was mr vane a tory squire and large landholder in the county now as alfred entered at one door baker himself came in at the other and they nearly met at vane but alfred saluted him first and begged respectfully for an interview certainly sir said mr vane take care sir he is dangerous whispered baker instantly mr vanes countenance changed but this time alfred overheard the formula and said quietly dont believe him sir i am not dangerous i am as sane as any man in england pray examine me and judge for yourself ah that is his delusion said baker come mr hardie i allow you great liberties but you abuse them you really must not monopolise his worship with your fancies consider sir you are not the only patient he has to examine alfreds heart sank he turned a look of silent agony on mr vane mr vane either touched by that look or irritated by bakers pragmatical interference or perhaps both looked that person coolly in the face and said sternly be silent sir and let the gentleman speak to me chapter xxxiii alfred thus encouraged told his story with forced calmness and without a word too much indeed so clear and telling was the narrative and the logic so close that incoherent patients one or two stole up and listened with wonder and a certain dreamy complacency the bulk however held aloof apathetic inextricably wrapped in fictitious autobiography his story told alfred offered the dodds in evidence that the fourteen thousand pounds was no illusion and referred to his sister and several friends as witnesses to his sanity and said the letters he wrote were all stopped in the asylum and why that no honest man or woman might know where he was he ended by convincing mr vane he was a sane and injured man and his father a dark designing person mr vane asked him whether he had any other revelations to make alfred replied not on my own account but for the sake of those afflicted persons who are here for life well the beds want repaving the vermin thinning the instruments of torture want abolishing instead of hiding for an hour or two when you happen to come what do the patients gain by that the madmen dare not complain to you sir because the last time one did complain to the justices it was mr petworth they had no sooner passed through the iron gate than cooper made an example of him felled him with his fist and walked up and down him on his knees crying ill teach you to complain to the justices but one or two gentlemanly madmen who soon found out that i am not one of them have complained to me that the attendants wash them too much like hansom cabs strip them naked and mop them on the flagstones then fling on their clothes without drying them they say too that the meat is tough and often putrid the bread stale the butter rancid the vegetables stinted since they cant be adulterated and as for sleep it is hardly known for the beds are so short your feet stick out insects without a name to ears polite but highly odoriferous and profoundly carnivorous bite you all night and dogs howl eternally outside and when exhausted nature defies even these enemies of rest then the doctor who seems to be in the pay of insanity claps you on a blister by brute force and so drives away sleep insanitys cure or hocuses you by brute force as he did me and so steals your sleep and tries to steal your reason with his opium henbane morphia and other tremendous brainstealers with such a potion sir administered by violence he gave me in one night a bursting fever headache loss of sight and bleeding at the nose as mrs archbold will tell you oh look into these things sir in pity to those whom heaven has afflicted to me they are but strokes with a feather i am a sane man torn from love and happiness and confined among the mad discomfort is nothing to me comfort is nothing you can do nothing for me but restore me to my dignity as a man my liberty as a briton and the rights as a citizen i have been swindled out of by a fraudulent bankrupt and his tools two venal doctors who never saw me but for one five minutes but came to me ready bribed at a guinea apiece and so signed away my wits behind my back now mr baker said vane what do you say to all this baker smiled with admirable composure and replied with crafty moderation he is a gentleman and believes every word he says but it is all his delusions why to begin sir his father has nothing to do with putting him in here nothing on earth alfred started then smiled incredulous and in the next place there are no instruments of restraint here but two pair of handcuffs and two strait jackets and these never hardly used we trust to the padded rooms you know and sir said he getting warm which instantly affected his pronunciations if theres a hinsect in the ouse ill heat im delusion is a big word especially in a madhouse it overpowers a visitors understanding mr vane was staggered alfred whose eager eyes were never off his face saw this with dismay and feeling that if he failed in the simpler matter he should be sure to fail in establishing his sanity he said with inward anxiety though with outward calmness suppose we test these delusions with all my heart said vane bakers countenance fell begin with the instruments of restraint find me them bakers countenance brightened up he had no fear of their being found i will said alfred please to follow me baker grinned with anticipated triumph alfred led the way to a bedroom near his own and asked mr baker to unlock it baker had not the key no more had cooper the latter was sent for it he returned saying the key was mislaid that i expected said alfred send for the kitchen poker sir ill soon unlock it fetch the kitchen poker said vane good gracious sir said cooper he only wants that to knock all our brains out you have no idea of his strength and ferocity well lied cooper said alfred ironically fetch me the poker said vane cooper went for it and came back with the key instead the door was opened and they all entered alfred looked under the bed the rest stood round it there was nothing to be seen but a years dust alfred was dumbfoundered and a cold perspiration began to gather on his brow he saw at once a false move would be fatal to him well sir said vane grimly where are they alfred caught sight of a small cupboard he searched it it was empty baker and cooper grinned at his delusion quietly but so that vane might see that formula alfred returned to the bed and shook it cooper and baker left off grinning alfreds quick eye caught this and he shook the bed violently furiously ah said mr vane i hear a chink it is an iron bedstead and old suggested baker alfred tore off the bedclothes and then the mattress below the latter was a framework and below the framework a receptacle about six inches deep five feet long and three broad filled with chains iron belts wristlocks muffles and screwlocked hobbles c a regular inquisition if baker had descended from the kemble family instead of rising from nothing he could not have acted better good heavens cried he where do these come from they must have been left here by the last proprietor vane replied only by a look of contempt and ordered cooper to go and ask mr tollett to come to him alfred improved the interval sir said he all my delusions fairly tested will turn out like this they shall be tested sir i give you my word mr tollett came and the two justices commenced a genuine scrutinytheir first they went now upon the true method in which all these dark places ought to be inspected they did not believe a word they suspected everything they examined patients apart detected cruelty filth and vermin under philanthropic phrases and clean linen and the upshot was they reprimanded baker and the attendants severely and told him his licence should never be renewed unless at their next visit the whole asylum was reformed they ordered all the iron bodybelts chains leglocks wristlocks and muffs to be put into mr tolletts carriage and concluded a long inspection by inquiring into alfreds sanity at this inquiry they did not allow baker to be even present but only dr bailey first they read the order and found it really was not alfreds father who had put him into the asylum then they read the certificates especially wycherleys it accused alfred of headache insomnia nightly visions a rooted delusion pecuniary a sudden aversion to an affectionate father and at the doctors last visit a wild look formula great excitement and threats of violence without any provocation to justify them this overpowered the worthy squires understandings to begin but they proceeded to examine the three books an asylum has to keep by law the visitors book the case book and the medical journal all these were kept with the utmost looseness in silverton house as indeed they are in the very best of these places however by combining the scanty notices in the several books they arrived at this total admitted april had a very wild look and was much excited attempted suicide by throwing himself into a tank attacked the keepers for rescuing him with prodigious strength and violence refused food and some days after came an entry with his initials instead of his name which was contrary to law a h much excited threats ordered composing draught and a day or two after a h excited blasphemous ordered blister the first entry however was enough the doctor had but seen real facts through his green spectacles and lo suicide homicide and refusal of food three cardinal points of true mania mr vane asked dr bailey whether he was better since he came oh infinitely better said dr bailey we hope to cure him in a month or two they then sent for mrs archbold and had a long talk with her recommending alfred to her especial care and having acted on his judgment and information in the teeth of those who called him insane turned tail at a doctors certificate distrusted their eyesight at an unsworn affidavit alfred was packing up his things to go away bright as a lark mrs archbold came to him and told him she had orders to give him every comfort and the justices hoped to liberate him at their next visit the poor wretch turned pale at their next visit he cried what not today when is their next visit mrs archbold hesitated but at last she said why you know i told you they come four times every year the disappointment was too bitter the contemptible result of all his patience selfcommand and success was too heartbreaking he groaned aloud and you can come with a smile and tell me that you cruel woman then he broke down altogether and burst out crying you were born without a heart he sobbed mrs archbold quivered at that i wish i had been said she in a strange soft moving voice then casting an eloquent look of reproach on him she went away in visible agitation and left him sobbing once out of his sight she rushed into another room and there taking no more notice of a gentle madwoman its occupant than of the bed or the table she sank into a chair and throwing her head back with womanly abandon hid her hand upon her bosom that heaved tempestuously and soon the tears trickled out of her imperious eyes and ran unrestrained the mind of edith archbold corresponded with her powerful frame and bushy brows inside this woman all was vigour strong passions strong good sense to check or hide them strong will to carry them out and between these mental forces a powerful struggle was raging she was almost impenetrable to mere personal beauty and inclined to despise early youth in the other sex and six months spent with alfred in a quiet country house would probably have left her reasonably indifferent to him but the first day she saw him in silverton house he broke through her guard and pierced at once to her depths first he terrified her by darting through the window to escape and terror is a passion so is pity and never in her life had she overflowed with it as when she saw him drawn out of the tank and laid on the grass if after all he was as sane as he looked that brave highspirited young creature who preferred death to the touch of coarse confining hands no sooner had he filled her with dismay and pity than he bounded from the ground before her eyes and fled she screamed and hoped he would escape she could not help it next she saw him fighting alone against seven or eight and with unheardof prowess almost beating them she sat at the window panting with clenched teeth and hands and wished him to beat and admired him wondered at him he yielded but not to them to her all the compliments she had ever received were tame compared with this one it thrilled her vanity he was like the men she had read of and never seen the young knights of chivalry she glowed all over at him and detecting herself in time was frightened her strong good sense warned her to beware of this youth who was nine years her junior yet had stirred her to all her depths in an hour and not to see him nor think of him too much accordingly she kept clear of him altogether at first pity soon put an end to that and she protected and advised him but with a cold and lofty demeanour put on express what with her kind acts and her cold manner he did not know what to make of her and often turned puzzled earnest eyes upon her as much as to say are you really my friend or not once she forgot herself and smiled so tenderly in answer to these imploring eyes that his hopes rose very high indeed he flattered himself she would let him out of the asylum before long that was all julias true lover thought of a feeling hidden and not suppressed often grows fast in a vigorous nature mrs archbolds fancy for alfred was subjected to this dangerous treatment and it smouldered and smouldered till from a penchant it warmed to a fancy from a fancy to a passion but penchant fancy or passion she hid it with such cunning and resolution that neither alfred nor even those of her own sex saw it nor did a creature even suspect it except nurse hannah but her eyes were sharpened by jealousy for that muscular young virgin was beginning to sigh for him herself with a gentle timidity that contrasted prettily with her biceps muscle and prowess against her own sex mrs archbold had more passion than tenderness but what woman is not to be surprised and softened when her young favourite the greatest fighter she had ever seen broke down at the end of his gallant effort and began to cry like a girl her bowels of compassion yearned within her and she longed to cry with him she only saved herself from some imprudence by flight and had her cry alone after a flow of tears such a woman is invincible she treated alfred at teatime with remarkable coldness and reserve this piece of acting led to unlookedfor consequences it emboldened cooper who was raging against alfred for telling the justices but had forborne from violence for fear of getting the house into a fresh scrape he now went to the doctor and asked for a powerful drastic bailey gave him two pills or rather boluses containing croton oilinter alia for bailey was one of the farraginous fools of the unscientific science armed with this weapon of destruction cooper entered alfreds bedroom at night and ordered him to take them he refused cooper whistled and four attendants came alfred knew he should soon be powerless he lost no time sprang at cooper and with his long arm landed a blow that knocked him against the wall and in this position where his body could not give struck him again with his whole soul and cut his cheek right open the next minute he was pinned handcuffed and in a straitjacket after crippling one assailant with a kick on the knee cooper half stunned and bleeding like a pig recovered himself now and burned for revenge he uttered a frightful oath and jumped on alfred as he lay bound and powerless and gave him a lesson he never forgot every art has its secrets the attendants in such madhouses as this have been for years possessed of one they are too modest to reveal to justices commissioners or the public the art of breaking a mans ribs or breastbone or both without bruising him externally the convicts at toulon arrive at a similar result by another branch of the art they stuff the skin of a conger eel with powdered stone then give the obnoxious person a sly crack with it and a rib backbone is broken with no contusion to mark the external violence used but mr cooper and his fellows do their work with the kneejoint it is round and leaves no bruise they subdue the patient by walking up and down him on their knees if they dont jump on him as well as promenade him the mans spirit is often the only thing broken if they do the man is apt to be broken bodily as well as mentally thus died mr sizer in and two others quite recently and how many more god only knows we cant count the stones at the bottom of a dark well cooper then sprang furiously on alfred and went kneeling up and down him cooper was a heavy man and his weight crushed and hurt the victims legs but that was a trifle as often as he kneeled on alfreds chest the crushed ones whole framework seemed giving way and he could scarcely breathe but brown drew cooper back by the collar saying dye want to kill him and at this moment mrs archbold who was on the watch came in with hannah and another nurse and the three women at a word from their leader pinned cooper simultaneously and taking him at a disadvantage handcuffed him in a moment with a strength sharpness skill and determination not to be found in women out of a madhouseluckily for the newspaper husbands the other keepers looked astounded at this masterstroke but as no servant had ever affronted mrs archbold without being dismissed directly they took their cue and said we advised him maam but he would not listen to us cooper said mrs archbold as soon as she recovered her breath you are not fit for your place tomorrow you go or i go cooper cowed in a moment by the handcuffs began to whine and say that it was all alfreds fault but mrs archbold was now carried away by two passions instead of one and they were together too much for prudence she took a handful of glossy locks out of her bosom and shook them in coopers face you monster said she you should go for that if you were my own brother the two young nurses assented loudly and turned and cackled at cooper for cutting off such lovely hair he shrugged his shoulders at them and said sulkily to mrs archbold oh i didnt know of course if you have fallen in love with him my cake is burnt tisnt the first lunatic you have taken a fancy to at this brutal speech all the more intolerable for not being quite false mrs archbold turned ashy pale and looked round for a weapon to strike him dead but found none so handy and so deadly as her tongue its not the first you have tried to murder said she i know all about that death in calton retreat you kept it dark before the coroner but it is not too late ill open the worlds eyes i was only going to dismiss you sir but you have insulted me ill hang you in reply cooper turned very pale and was silent his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth but a feeble unexpected voice issued from the bed and murmured cheerfully though with some difficulty a single word justice at an expression so out of place they all started with surprise alfred went on you are putting the saddle on the wrong horse the fault lies with those villains baker and bailey cooper is only a servant you know and obeys orders what business had the wretch to cut your hair off said mrs archbold turning on alfred with flashing eyes her blood once up she was ready to quarrel even with him for taking part against himself because he was ordered to put on a blister and hair must come off before a blister can go on replied alfred soberly that is no excuse for him beating you and trying to break your front teeth she didnt mind so much about his side ribs no replied alfred but i hit him first look at the blokes face dear mrs archbold you are my best friend in this horrid place and you have beautiful eyes and talk of teeth look at yours but you havent much sense of justice forgive me for saying so put the proposition into signs there is nothing like that for clearing away prejudice b and c have a scrimmage b begins it c gets the worst of it in comes a and turns awayc is that justice it is me you ought to turn away and i wish to heaven you would dear mrs archbold do pray turn me away and keep the other blackguard at this extraordinary and if i may be allowed the expression alfredian speech the men first stared and then laughed the women smiled and then were nearer crying than laughing and so it was that justice handcuffed straitjacketed blistered and impartial sent from its bed of torture a beam through coopers tough hide to his inner heart he hung his head and stepped towards alfred youre what i call a man he said i dont care a curse whether i stay or go after what she has said to me but come what may youre a gentleman and one as can put hisself in a poor mans place why sir i wasnt always so rough but i have been twenty years at it and mad folk theyd wear the patience out of jove and the milk of human kindness out of saints and opossums however if i was to stay here all my life instead of going tomorrow id never lift hand to trouble you again for you taking my part again yourself like that ill put that to the test said mrs archbold sharply stayon your probation hannah and babyface biceps at a look took off his handcuffs which she had been prominent in putting on this extraordinary scene ended in the men being dismissed and the women remaining and going to work after their kind the bed is too short for one thing said hannah look at his poor feet sticking out and cold as a stone just feel of them jane no no murder cried alfred that tickles hannah ran for a chair jane for another pillow mrs archbold took off his handcuffs and passing her hand softly and caressingly over his head lamented the loss of his poor hair amongst them they relieved him of his straitjacket set up his head covered his feet and he slept like a top for want of drastics and opiates and in spite of some brilliant charges by the lilliputian cavalry after this the attendants never molested alfred again nor did the doctor for mrs archbold got his boluses and sent them up to a famous analysing chemist in london and told him she had and said ill thank you not to prescribe at random for that patient any more he took the ladys prescription coming as it did in a voice quietly grim and with a momentary but wicked glance shot from under her black brows alfred was all the more miserable at his confinement his melancholy deepened now there was no fighting to excite him a handsome bright young face clouded with sadness is very pitiable and i need not say that both the women who had fallen in love with him had their eyes or at least the tails of their eyes for ever on his face the result varied with the characters of the watchers that young face ever sad made mrs archbold sigh and long to make him happy under her wing how it wrought on the purer and more womanly hannah will be revealed by the incident i have to relate alfred was sitting on a bench in the corridor bowed down by grief and the archbold lurking in a room hard by feasting her eyes on him through an aperture in the door caused by the inspection plate being under repairwhen an erotic maniac was driven past she had obtained accesswith marvellous cunningto the mens side but was now coming back with a flea in her ear and faster than she went being handcuffed and propelled by babyface biceps on passing the disconsolate alfred the latter eyed him coyly gave her stray sheep a coarse pushas one pushes a thingand laid a timid hand gentle as falling down upon the rougher sex contrast sudden and funny dont be so sad sir she murmured cooing like the gentlest of doves i cant bear to see you look like that alfred looked up and met her full with his mournful honest eyes ah hannah how can i be anything but sad imprisoned here sane amongst the mad well and so am i sir so is mrs archbold herself ay but you have not been entrapped imprisoned on your weddingday i cannot even get a word sent to my julia my wife that ought to be only think of the affront they have made me put on her i love better ten times better than myself why she must have been waiting for me humiliated perhaps by my absence what will she think of me the rogues will tell her a thousand lies she is very high spirited hannah impetuous like myself only so gentle and so good oh my angel my angel i shall lose you for ever hannah clasped her hands with tears in her eyes no no she cried it is a burning shame to part true lovers like you and her hush speak low brown told me you are as well as he is god bless him for it then you have got money they say try it on with brown i will oh you darling what is the matter for babyface was beginning to whimper oh nothing sir only you are so glad to go and we shall be sorry to part with you but you wont care for thatoh oh oh what do you think i shall forget you and your kindness never ill square accounts with friends and foes not one shall be forgotten dont offer me any of your money sobbed hannah for i wouldnt touch it goodbye said she i shant have as much as a kiss for it ill be bound goodbye said she again and never moved oh wont you though cried alfred gaily what is that and that and that now what on earth are you crying about dry your tears you dear goodhearted girl no ill dry them for you he took out a white handkerchief and dried her cheeks gently for her and gave her a parting kiss but the archbolds patience was exhausted a door opened nearly opposite and there she stood yellow with jealousy and sombre as night with her ebon brows at sight of this lowering figure hannah uttered a squawk and fled with cheeks red as fire alfred not aware of mrs archbolds smouldering passion and little dreaming that jealous anguish and rage stood incarnate before him burst out laughing like a mischievous boy on this she swept upon him and took him by both shoulders and awed him with her lowering brows close to his you ungrateful wretch she said violently and panted his colour rose ungrateful that i am not madam why do you call me so you areyou are what have i done to you that you run from me to the very servants however she shall be packed off this very night and you to thank for it this was the way to wound the generous youth now it is you that are ungenerous he said what harm has the poor girl done she had a virtuous movement and pitied me for the heartless fraud i suffer by that is all pray do you never pity me was it this virtuous movement set her kissing you said the archbold clenching her teeth as if the word stung her like the sight she didnt now said alfred it was i kissed her and yet you pretend to love your julia so truly this is no place for that sacred name madam but be sure i have no secrets from her and kiss nobody she would not kiss herself she must be a very accommodating young lady at this insult alfred rose pale with anger and was about to defy his monitor mortally but the quickwitted woman saw and disarmed him in one moment before ever he could speak she was a transformed creature a penitent she put her hands together supplicatingly and murmured i didnt mean it i respect her and your love for her forgive me alfred i am so unhappy oh forgive me and behold she held his hand between her soft burning palms and her proud head sank languidly on his shoulder and the inevitable tears ran gently morals apart it was glorious lovemaking bother the woman thought alfred promise me not to do it again she murmured and the girl shall stay oh lord yes i promise though i cant see what it matters to you not much cruel boy alas but it matters to her for she kissed alfreds hand gently and rose to her feet and moved away but at the second step turned her head sudden as a bird and finished her sentenceif you kiss her before me i shall kill her before you here was a fresh complication the men had left off blistering torturing and bullying him but his guardian angels the women were turning up their sleeves to pull caps over him and plenty of the random scratches would fall on him if anything could have made him pine more to be out of the horrid place this voluptuous prospect would he hunted everywhere for brown but he was away the day with a patient at night he lay awake for a long time thinking how he should open the negotiation he shrank from it he felt a delicacy about bribing beelzebubs servant to betray him as hannah had originated the idea he thought he might very well ask her to do the dirty work of bribing brown and he would pay her for it only in money not kisses with this resolution he sank to sleep and his spirit broke prison he stood with julia before the altar and the priest made them one then the church and the company and daylight disappeared and her own sweet low moving voice came thrilling my own own own she murmured i love you ten times more for all you have endured for me and with this her sweet lips settled on his like the dew impartial sleep flies at the steps of the scaffold and the gate of elysium so alfred awoke at the above but doubted whether he was quite awake for two velvet lips seemed to be still touching his he stirred and somebody was gone like the wind with a rustle of flying petticoats and his door shut in a moment it closed with a catchlock this dastardly vision had opened it with her key and left it open to make good her retreat if he should awake alfred sat up in bed indignant and somewhat fluttered confound her impudence said he but there was no help for it he grinned and bore it as he had the blisters and boluses c rolled the clothes round his shoulders and off to the sleep of the just again not so the passionate hypocrite who maddened by a paroxysm of jealousy had taken this cowardly advantage of a prisoner she had sucked fresh poison from those honest lips and filled her veins with molten fire she tossed and turned the livelong night in a high fever of passion nor were the cold chills wanting of shame and fear at what she had done in the morning alfred remembered this substantial vision and determined to find out which of those two it was i shall know by her looks said he she wont be able to meet my eye well the first he saw was mrs archbold she met his eye full with a mild and pensive dignity come it is not you thought alfred presently he fell in with hannah she wore a serene infantine face the picture of unobtrusive modesty alfred was dumbfoundered its not this one either said he but then it must confound her impudence for looking so modest however he did not speak to her he was looking out for a face that interested him far more the weatherbeaten countenance of giles brown he saw him once or twice but could not get him alone till the afternoon he invited him into his room and when he got him there lost no time just look me in the face brown said he quietly brown looked him in the face now sir am i mad or sane brown turned his head away alfred laughed no no none of your tricks old fellow look me in the face while you answer the man coloured i cant look a gentleman like you in the face and tell him he is mad i should think not well now what shall i give you to help me escape hush dont mention that sir its as much as my place is worth even to listen to you well then i must give you as much as your place is worth please to calculate that and name the figure my place i wouldnt lose it for a hundred pounds exactly then ill give you a hundred guineas and how am i to get my money sir the first time you are out come to albion villa in barkington and ill have it all ready for you and suppose you were to say no you didnt ought ever to have been confined i must trouble you to look in my face again mr brown now do you see treason bad faith avarice ingratitude rascality in it not a grain of em said brown with an accent of conviction well now ill tell you the truth i can read a gent by this time and im no more afeared for the money than if i had it in my hand but ye see my stomach wont let me do it this was a sad disappointment so sudden too your stomach said alfred ruefully what do you mean ay my stomach wouldnt your stomach rise against serving a man that had done you the worst turn one man can do anotherbeen and robbed you of your sweetheart alfred stared with amazement brown continued and now with some emotion hannah blake and i were very good friends till you came and i was thinking of asking her to name the day but now she wont look at me dont come teasing me says she i am meat for your master its you that have turned the girls head sir bother the women said alfred cordially oh what plagues they are and how unjust you are to spite me for the fault of another can i help the fools from spooning upon me he reflected a moment then burst out brown you are a duffer a regular duffer what dont you see your game is to get me out of the place if you do in fortyeight hours i shall be married to my julia and that dumplingfaced girl will be cured but if you keep me here by gee sir ill make hot love to your hannah boiling hot hotter than ever wasout of the isles of greece oh do help me out and ill give you the hundred pounds and ill give hannah another hundred pounds on condition she marries you and if she wont marry you she shant have a farthing only a good hiding brown was overpowered by his maniacs logic you have a head said he theres my hand ill go in if i die for it they now put their heads together over the means browns plan was to wait and wait for an opportunity alfreds was to make one this very night but how can i said brown i shant have the key of your room i am not on watch in your part tonight borrow hannahs hannahs she has got no key of the male patients rooms oh yes she has of mine at all events what makes you think that sir said brown suspiciously alfred didnt know what to say he could not tell him why he felt sure she had a key just go quietly and ask her for it said he dont tell her i sent you now brown obeyed and returned in halfanhour with the key of the vacant bedroom where the hobbles and chains were hidden on the arrival of the justices she tells me this is the only key she has of any room in this corridor but dear heart said brown how quicksighted the women are she said says she if it is to bring sorrowful true lovers together again giles or the like of that ill try and get the key you want off mrs archbolds bunch though i get the sack for it says she i know she heaves them in the parlour at night says hannah she is a trump you must allow alfred coloured up he suspected he had been unjust she is a good kind singlehearted girl said he and neither of you shall find me ungrateful it was evident by the alacrity brown now showed that he had got his orders from hannah it was agreed that alfred should be down at night in his clothes ready to seize the right moment that hannah should get the key and watch the coast clear and let him out into the corridor and brown get him down by a back stairs and out on the lawn there he would find a ladder close by the wall and his own arms and legs must do the rest and now alfred was a changed creature his eye sparkled he walked on air and already sniffed the air of liberty after tea brown brought in some newspapers and made alfred a signal previously agreed on that the ladder was under the east wall he went to bed early put on his tweed shootingjacket and trousers and lay listening to the clock with beating heart at first feet passed to and fro from time to time these became less frequent as the night wore on presently a light foot passed stopped at the door and made a sharp scratch on it with some metal instrument it was the key the time was not ripe to use it but good hannah had taken this way to let him know she had got it this little scratch outside his door oh it made his heart leap and thrill one great difficulty was overcome he waited and waited but with glowing hopeful heart and at last a foot came swiftly the key turned and hannah opened the door she had a bullseye lantern take your shoes in your hand she whispered and follow me he followed her she led him in and out to the door of the public room belonging to the secondclass patients then she drew her whistle and breathed very softly brown answered as softly from the other end he was waiting at the opposite door all right said she the dangerous part is over she put a key into the door and said very softly goodbye god bless you hannah said alfred with deep emotion god in heaven bless you for this he will he does said the singlehearted girl and put her other hand to her breast with a great gulp she opened the door slowly goodbye dear i shall never see you again and so these two parted for hannah could not bear the sight of giles at that moment he was welcome to alfred though most welcome and conducted him by devious ways to the kitchen lantern in hand he opened the kitchen door softly and saw two burly strangers seated at the table eating with all their souls and mrs archbold standing before the fire but looking towards him for she had heard his footsteps ever so far off the men looked up and saw alfred they rose to their feet and said this will be the gentleman madam yes said mrs archbold your servant sir said the man very civilly if you are ready we are chapter xxxiv sampsons placard was on barkington walls and inside the asylum alfred was softening hearts and buying consciences as related so in fact he had two strings to his bow but mark how strangely things turn these two strings got entangled his father alarmed by the placard had called at the pawnbrokers shop and told him he must move alfred directly to a london asylum baker raised objections mr hardie crushed them with his purse ie with his sons and victims sweethearts fathers money so then as baker after all could not resist the project but only postpone it for a day or two he preferred to take a handsome present and cooperate he even connived at mr hardies signing the requisite name to the new order this the giddy world calls forgery but in these calm retreats far from the publics inquisitive eye it goes for nothing why mrs archbold had signed bakers name and dr baileys more than a hundred several times to orders statements and certificates depriving englishmen of their liberty and their property with a gesture of her taper fingers and venting the conventional terms aberration exaltation depression debility paralysis excitable abnormal as boldly and blindly as any male starling in the flock on the very night then of alfreds projected escape two keepers came down from dr wycherleys asylum to silverton station baker met them and drove them to silverton house in his dogcart they were to take alfred up by the night train and when he came into the kitchen with brown they suspected nothing nor did baker or cooper who presently emerged from the back kitchen brown saw and recovered his wits partially shall i go for his portmanteau sir stammered he making a shrewd and fortunate guess at what was up baker assented and soon after went out to get the horse harnessed on this mrs archbold pale sorrowful and silent hitherto beckoned alfred into the back kitchen and there gave him his watch and his loose money i took care of them for you said she for the like have often been stolen in this place put the money in your shoes it may be useful to you he thanked her somewhat sullenly for his disappointment was so deep and bitter that small kindnesses almost irritated him she sighed it is cruel to be angry with me she said i am not the cause of this it is a heavier blow to me than to you sooner or later you will be freeand then you will not waste a thought on me i fearbut i must remain in this odious prison without your eyes and your smile to lighten me yet unable to forget you oh alfred for mercys sake whisper me one kind word at parting give me one kind look to remember and dote upon she put out both hands as eloquently as she spoke and overpowered his prudence so far that he took her offered handsthey were as cold now as they were burning hot the last timeand pressed them and said i shall be grateful to you while i live the passionate woman snatched her hands away gratitude is too cold for me she cried i scorn even yours love me or hate me he made no reply and so they parted will you pledge your honour to make no attempt at escape on the road asked the pawnbroker on his return ill see you dd first replied the prisoner on this he was handcuffed and helped into the dogcart they went up to town by the midnight train but to alfreds astonishment and delight did not take a carriage to themselves however station after station was passed and nobody came into their carriage at last they stopped at a larger station and a good many people were on the platform alfred took this opportunity and appealed in gentle but moving terms to the first good and intelligent face he saw sir said he i implore your assistance the gentleman turned courteously to him the keepers to alfreds surprise did not interrupt i am the victim of a conspiracy sir they pretend i am mad and are taking me by force to a madhouse a living tomb you certainly dont appear to be mad said the gentleman the head keeper instantly showed him the order and a copy of the certificates dont look at them sir cried alfred they are signed by men who were bribed to sign them for pitys sake sir judge for yourself test my memory my judgment by any question you please use your own good sense dont let those venal rogues judge for you the gentleman turned cold directly i could not take on me to interfere said he the unsworn affidavits had overpowered his senses he retired with a frigid inclination alfred wrung his handcuffed hands and the connecting chain rattled the men never complained his conduct was natural and they knew their strength at the next station he tested a snobs humanity instead of a gentlemans he had heard they were more tenderhearted the answer was a broad grin repeated at intervals being called mad was pretty much the same thing as being mad to a mind of this class and alfred had admitted he was called mad at the next station he implored a silveryhaired old gentleman old age he had heard has known griefs and learned pity the keeper showed the certificates ah said senex poor young man now dont agitate yourself it is all for your good pray go quietly very painful very painful and he hobbled away as fast as he could it is by shirking the painful some live to be silvery old next he tried a policeman bobby listened to him erect as a dart the certificates were shown him he eyed them and said sharply all right nor could alfreds entreaties and appeals to common sense attract a word or even a look from him alfred cried help murder if you are englishmen if you are christians help me this soon drew a crowd round him listening to his fiery tale of wrong and crying shame shame let him go the keepers touched their heads winked and got out and showed the certificates the crowd melted away like wax before those two suns of evidence unsworn the train moved on it was appalling how could he ever get free between his mind and that of his fellows there lay a spiritual barrier more impassible than the walls of fortified cities yet at the very next station with characteristic tenacity of purpose he tried again for he saw a woman standing near a buxom country woman of forty then he remembered that the naked eye was not yet an extinct institution among her sex he told her his tale and implored her to use her own eyes she seemed struck and did eye him far more closely than the men had and told the keepers they ought to be ashamed of themselves he was no madman for she had seen madmen they showed her the certificates oh i am no scholar said she contemptuously ye cant write my two eyes out of my head the keeper whipped off alfreds cap and showed his shaven crown la so he is said she lowering her tone dear heart what a pity and such a pretty young gentleman and after that all he could say only drew the dew of patient pity to her eyes the train went on and left her standing there a statue of negative clemency alfred lost heart he felt how impotent he was i shall die in a madhouse he said he shivered in a corner hating man and doubting god they reached dr wycherleys early in the morning alfred was shown into a nice clean bedroom and asked whether he would like to bathe or sleep oh a bath he said and was allowed to bathe himself he had not been long in the water when dr wycherleys medical assistant tapped at the door and then entered without further ceremonya young gentleman with a longish down on his chin which initiated early in the secrets of physiology he was too knowing to shave off and so go to meet his trouble he came in looking like a machine with a notebook in his hand and stood by the bath side dictating notes to himself and jotting them down six contusions two on the thorax one on the abdomen two on the thighs one near the patella turn please alfred turned in the water a slight dorsal abrasion also of the wrists a severe excoriation of the ankle leglock eh yes iron leglock head shaved large blister good any other injuries external or internal under old system yes sir confined as a madman though sane as you i am sure have the sense to see oh never mind that we are all sane hereexcept the governor and i he whipped out and entered the condition of the new patients body with jealous minuteness in the casebook as for his mind he made no inquiry into that indeed he was little qualified for researches of the kind at breakfast alfred sat with a number of mad ladies and gentlemen who by firmness kindness and routine had been led into excellent habits the linen was clean and the food good he made an excellent meal and set about escaping with this view he explored the place nobody interfered with him but plenty of eyes watched him the house was on the nonrestraint system he soon found this system was as bad for him as it was good for the insane nonrestraint implied a great many attendants and constant vigilance moreover the doors were strong the windows opened only eight inches and that from the top their framework was iron painted like wood c it was next to impossible to get into the yard at night and then it looked quite impossible to get any further for the house was encompassed by high walls he resigned all hope of escape without connivance he sounded a keeper the man fired at the first word come none of that sir you should know better than tempt a poor man alfred coloured to the eyes and sighed deeply to have honour thrown in his face and made the reason for not aiding him to baffle a dishonourable conspiracy but he took the reproof so sweetly the man was touched and byandbye seeing him deeply dejected said goodnaturedly dont be down on your luck sir if you are really better which you dont look to have much the matter now why not write to the commissioners and ask to be let out because my letters will be intercepted ay to your friends but not to the commissioners of lunacy not in this house any way god bless you cried alfred impetuously you are my benefactor you are an honest fellow give me your hand well why not only you mustnt excite yourself take it easy formula oh no cant among friends said alfred wouldnt you be excited at the hope of getting out of prison well i dont know but i might bound i am as sick of it as you are alfred got paper and sketched the letter on which so much depended it took him six hours he tore up two he cooled down the third and condensed it severely by this means after much thought he produced a close and telling composition he also weeded it of every trait and every term he had observed in mad peoples talk or the letters they had shown him so there was no incoherency no heat no prolixity no spies no conspiracy no italics a simple honest earnest story with bitter truth stamped on every line a sober strong appeal from a sore heart but hard head to the arbiters of his fate to the best of my belief no madman however slightly touched or however cunning ever wrote a letter so gentle yet strong so earnest yet calm so short yet full and withal so lucid and cleanly jointed as this was and i am no contemptible judge for i have accumulated during the last few years a large collection of letters from persons deranged in various degrees and studied them minutely more minutely than most psychologicals study anything but pounds shillings and verbiage the letter went and he hoped but scarcely expected an answer by return of post it did not come he said to his heart be still and waited another day went by and another he gnawed his heart and waited he pined and waited on the secret tribunal which was all a shallow legislature had left him took it easy secret tribunals always do but while the victimsuitor longed and pined and languished for one sound from the voice of justice and humanity and while the secret tribunal not being in prison itself all this time took it easy events occurred at barkington that bade fair to throw open the prison doors and bring father and son bride and bridegroom together again under one roof but at what a price chapter xxxv at sight of sampsons placard mr hardie was seized with a tremor that suspended the razor in mid air he opened the window and glared at the doctors notice at this moment he himself was a picture not unlike those half cleaned portraits the picture restorers hang out as specimens of their art insolent interfering fool he muttered and began to walk the room in agitation after a while he made a strong effort shaved the other half and dressed slowly thinking hard all the time the result was he went out before breakfast which he had not done for years and visited mr bakerfor what purpose has been already shown on his return jane was waiting breakfast the first word to him was papa have you seen what the reward said he indifferently yes i noticed it at our door as i came home jane said it was a very improper and most indelicate interference in their affairs and went on to say with heightened colour i have just told peggy to take it down not for the world cried mr hardie losing all his calmness real or feigned and he rang the bell hastily on peggys appearing he said anxiously i do not wish that notice interfered with i shouldnt think of touching it without your order sir said she quietly and shot him a feline glance from under her pale lashes jane coloured and looked a little mortified but on peggys retiring mr hardie explained that whether judicious or not it was a friendly act of dr sampsons and to pull down his notice would look like siding with the boy against those he had injured besides said he why should you and i burk inquiry ill as he has used me i am his father and not altogether without anxiety suppose those doctors should be right about him you know jane had for some time been longing to call at albion villa and sympathise with her friend and now curiosity was superadded she burned to know whether the dodds knew of or approved this placard she asked her father whether he thought she could go there with propriety why not said he cheerfully and with assumed carelessness in reality it was essential to him that jane should visit the dodds surrounded by pitfalls threatened with a new and mysterious assailant in the eccentric but keen and resolute sampson this artful man who had now become a very machiavelconstant danger and deceit had so sharpened and deepened his great natural abilitieswas preparing amongst other defences a shield and that shield was a sieve and that sieve was his daughter in fact ever since his return he had acted and spoken at the dodds through jane but with a masterly appearance of simplicity and mere confidential intercourse at least i think this is the true clue to all his recent remarks jane a truthful unsuspicious girl was all the fitter instrument of the cunning monster she went and called at albion villa and was received by edward mrs dodd being upstairs with julia and in five minutes she had told him what her father she owned had said to her in confidence but said she the reason i repeat these things is to make peace and that you may not fancy there is any one in our house so cruel so unchristian as to approve alfreds perfidy oh and papa said candidly he disliked the match but then he disliked this way of ending it far more mrs dodd came down in due course and kissed her but told her julia could not see even her at present i think dear said she in a day or two she will see you but no one else and for her sake we shall now hurry our departure from this place where she was once so happy mrs dodd did not like to begin about alfred but jane had no such scruples she inveighed warmly against his conduct and ere she left the house had quite done away with the faint suspicion sampson had engendered and brought both mrs dodd and edward back to their original opinion that the elder hardie had nothing on earth to do with the perfidy of the younger just before dinner a gentleman called on edward and proved to be a policeman in plain clothes he had been sent from the office to sound the ostler at the white lion and if necessary to threaten him the police knew though nobody else in barkington did that this ostler had been in what rogues call trouble twice and as the police can starve a man of the kind by blowing on him and can reward him by keeping dark he knows better than withhold information from them however on looking for this ostler he had left his place that very morning had decamped with mysterious suddenness here was a puzzle had the man gone without noticing the reward had somebody outbid the reward or was it a strange coincidence and did he after all know nothing the police thought it was no coincidence and he did know something so they had telegraphed to the london office to mark him down edward thanked his visitor but on his retiring told his mother he could make neither head nor tail of it and she only said we seem surrounded by mystery meantime unknown to these bewildered ones greek was meeting greek only a few yards off mr hardie was being undermined by a man of his own calibre one too cautious to communicate with the dodds or any one else till his work looked ripe the game began thus a decent mechanic who lodged hard by lounging with his pipe near the gate of musgrove cottage offered to converse with old betty she gave him a rough answer but with a touch of ineradicable vanity must ask peggy if she wanted a sweetheart because there was a hungry one at the gate why he wanted to begin on an old woman like me peggy inquired what he had said to her oh he begun where most of them endsif they get so far at all axed me was i comfortable here if not he knew a young man wanted a nice tidy body to keep house for him peggy pricked up her ears and in less than a quarter of an hour went for a box of lucifers in a new bonnet and clean collar she tripped past the able mechanic very accidentally and he bestowed an admiring smile on her but said nothingonly smoked however on her return he contrived to detain her and paid her a good many compliments which she took laughingly and with no great appearance of believing them however there is no going by that compliments sink and within fortyeight hours the able mechanic had become a hot wooer of peggy black always on the lookout for her day and night and telling her all about the lump of money he had saved and how he could double his income if he had but a counter and tidy wife behind it peggy gossiped in turn and let out amongst the rest that she had been turned off once just for answering a little sharply and now it was the other way her master was a trifle too civil at times who could help it said the able mechanic rapturously and offered a pressing civility which peggy fought off not so free young man said she kissing is the prologue to sin how do you know that inquired the able mechanic with the sly humour of his class it is a saying replied peggy demurely at last one night mr green the detective for he it was put his arm round his new sweethearts waist and approached the subject nearest his heart he told her he had just found out there was money enough to be made in one day to set them up for life in a nice little shop and she could help in it after this inviting preamble he crept towards the l by artful questions and soon elicited that there had been high words between master and mr alfred about that very sum she had listened at the door and heard taking care to combine close courtship with cunning interrogatories he was soon enabled to write to dr sampson and say that a servant of mr hardies was down on him and reported that he carried a large pocketbook in his breastpocket by day and she had found the dent of it under his pillow at nighta stroke of observation very creditable in an unprofessional female on this he had made it his business to meet mr hardie in broad day and sure enough the pocketbook was always there he added that the said hardies face wore an expression which he had seen more than once when respectable parties went in for felony and altogether thought they might now take out a warrant and proceed in the regular way sampson received this news with great satisfaction but was crippled by the interwoven relations of the parties to arrest mr hardie on a warrant would entail a prosecution for felony and separate jane and edward for ever he telegraphed green to meet him at the station and reached barkington at eight that very evening green and he proceeded to albion villa and there they held a long and earnest consultation with edward and at last on certain conditions mr green and edward consented to act on sampsons plan green by this time knew all mr hardies outofdoor habits and assured them that at ten oclock he would walk up and down the road for at least half an hour the night being dry it wanted about a quarter to ten when mrs dodd came down and proposed supper to the travellers sampson declined it for the present and said they had work to do at eleven then making the others a signal not to disclose anything at present he drew her aside and asked after julia mrs dodd sighedshe goes from one thing to another but always returns to one idea that he is a victim not a traitor well tell her in one hour the money shall be in the house the money what does she care well say we shall know all about alfred by eleven oclock my dear friend be prudent said mrs dodd i feel alarmed you were speaking almost in a whisper when i came in y are very obsairvant but dawnt be uneasy we are three to one just go and comfort miss julee with my message ah that i will she said she was no sooner gone than they all stole out into the night and a pitch dark night it was but green had a powerful dark lantern to use if necessary they waited green at the gate of musgrove cottage the other two a little way up the road ten oclock struck some minutes passed without the expected signal from green and edward and sampson began to shiver for it was very cold and dark and in the next place they were honest men going to take the law into their own hands and the law sometimes calls that breaking the law confound him muttered sampson if he does not soon come i shall run away it is bitterly cold presently footsteps were heard approaching but no signal it proved to be only a fellow in a smockfrock rolling home from the publichouse just as his footsteps died away a low hoot like a plaintive owl was heard and they knew their game was afoot presently tramp tramp came the slow and stately march of him they had hunted down he came very slowly like one lost in meditation and these amateur policemens hearts beat louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer at last in the blackness of the night a shadowy outline was visible another tramp or two it was upon them now the cautious mr green had stipulated that the pocketbook should first be felt for and if not there the matter should go no farther so edward made a stumble and fell against mr hardie and felt his left breast the pocketbook was thereyes he whispered and mr hardie in the act of remonstrating at his clumsiness was pinned behind and his arms strapped with wonderful rapidity and dexterity then first he seemed to awake to his hunger and uttered a stentorian cry of terror that rang through the night and made two of his three captors tremble cut that said green sternly or youll get into trouble mr hardie lowered his voice directly do not kill me do not hurt me he murmured i am but a poor man now take my little money it is in my waistcoat pocket but spare my life you see i dont resist come stash your gab my lad said green contemptuously addressing him just as he would any other of the birds he was accustomed to capture its not your stiff that is wanted but captain dodds captain dodds cried the prisoner with a wonderful assumption of innocence ay the pocketbook said green here this this he tapped on the pocketbook and instantly the prisoner uttered a cry of agony and sprang into the road with an agility no one would have thought possible but edward and green soon caught him and the doctor joining they held him and green tore his coat open the pocketbook was not there he tore open his waistcoat it was not in the waistcoat but it was sewed to his very shirt on the outside green wrenched it away and bidding the other two go behind the prisoner and look over his shoulder unseen themselves slipped the shade of his lantern mr hardie had now ceased to struggle and to exclaim he stood sullen mute desperate while an agitated face peered eagerly over each of his shoulders at the open pocketbook in greens hands on which the lantern now poured a narrow but vivid stream of light chapter xxxvi there was not a moment to lose so green emptied the pocketbook into his hat and sifted the contents in a turn of the hand announcing each discovery in a whisper to his excited and peering associates a lot of receipts of no use to any one but me said the prisoner earnestly two miniatures gold rims pinchbeck backs they are portraits of my children when young heaven forgive me i could not give them up to my creditors surely surely you will not rob me of them stash your gab said mr green roughly heres a guinea queen annes reign it belonged to my greatgrandfather take it but you will let me redeem it i will give l for it poor as i am you can leave it on my doorstep and ill leave the l stow your gab letters papers covered with figures stay what is this a lot of memoranda they are of the most private and delicate character pray do not expose my family misfortunes and mr hardie who of late had been gathering composure showed some signs of agitation the two figures glaring over his shoulder shared it and his remonstrance only made green examine the papers keenly they might contain some clue to the missing money it proved a miscellaneous record the price of stocks at various days notes of the official assignees remarks in going over the books c at last however greens quick eye fell upon a fainter entry in pencil figures yes actually l all right he said and took the paper close to the lantern and began to spell it out this day alfred told me to my face i had l of captain dodds we had an angry discussion what can he mean drs wycherley and osmond this same day afflicted me with hints that he is deranged or partly i saw no signs of it before wrote to my brother entreating him to give me l to replace the sum which i really have wronged this respectable and now most afflicted family of i had better withdraw here mr hardie interrupted him with sorrowful dignity these are mere family matters if you are a man respect them green went reading on like fate better withdraw my opposition to the marriage or else it seems my own flesh and blood will go about the place blackening my reputation mr hardie stamped on the ground i tell you on my honour as a gentleman theres no money there but my grandfathers guinea my money is all in my waistcoat pocket where you will not look a flutter of uneasiness seemed to come over the detective he darkened his lantern and replaced the pocketbook hurriedly in the prisoners breast felt him all over in a minute and to keep up the farce robbed him only eight yellow boys said he contemptuously to his mates he then shipped the money back into hardies coatpocket and conducted him to his own gate tied him to it by the waist and ordered him not to give the alarm for ten minutes on pain of death i consent said mr hardie and thank you for abstaining from violence all right my tulip said mr green cheerfully and drew his companions quietly away but the next moment he began to run and making a sudden turn dived into a street then into a passage and so winded and doubled till he got to a small publichouse he used some flash word and they were shown a private room wait here an hour for me he whispered i must see who liberates him and whether he is really as innocent as he reads or we have been countermined by the devils own tutor the unexpected turn the evidence had takenevidence of their own choosing toocleared mr hardie with the unprofessionals edward embraced this conclusion as a matter of course and urged the character of that gentlemans solitary traducer alfred was a traitor and therefore why not a slanderer even sampson on the whole inclined to a similar conclusion at this crisis of the discussion a redhaired pedlar with very large whiskers and the remains of a black eye put his head in and asked whether tom green was there no said the doctor stoutly not desiring company of this stamp dont know the lad the pedlar laughed there is not many that do know him at all hours however he is here sir and he whipped off the red hair and wiped off the black eye and ho green ipse he received their compliments on his protean powers and told them he had been just a minute too late mr hardie was gone and so he had lost the chance of seeing who came to help him and of hearing the first words that passed between the two this he said was a very great pity for it would have shown him in one moment whether certain suspicions of his were correct pressed as to what these suspicions were he begged to be excused saying any more for the present the doctor however would not let him off so but insisted on his candid opinion well sir said green i never was more puzzled in my life owing to not being near hand when he was untied it looks all square however theres one little thing that dont fit somehow they both asked in a breath what that was the sovs were all marked they asked how he knew and had he got them in his pocket to show green uttered a low chuckling laugh what me fake the beans now i live on this side of the hedge never knew a cove mix his liquors that way but it hurt his health soon or late no i took them out of one pocket and felt of them as i slipped them into the other ye see gents to do any good on my lay a man must train his senses as well as his mind he must have a hares ear and a hawks eye a bloodhounds nose and a ladys hand with steel fingers and a silk skin now look at that bunch of fives continued the master and laid a hand white and soft as a duchesss on the table it can put the bracelets on a giant or find a sharpers nailmark on the back of the knave of clubs the beans were marked which it is a small thing but it dont fit the rest heres an unsuspicious gent took by surprise in moonlight meditation fancy free and all his little private family matters found in his innocent bosom quite promiscuous but his beans marked that dont dovetail nohow gents did ever you hear of the man that went to the bottom of the bottomless pit to ease his mind well he was the head of my family i must go to the bottom whether theres one or not and just now i see but one way and what is that inquired both his companions in some alarm oh i mustnt threaten it said green or i shall never have the stomach to do it but dear me this boozing ken is a very unfit place for youyou are champagnegents not dogs nose ones now you part and make tracks for home one on foot and one in a fly you wont see me nor hear of me again till ive something fresh and so the confederates parted and sampson and edward met at albion villa and edward told his mother what they had done and his conviction that mr hardie was innocent and alfred a slanderer as well as a traitor and indeed said he if we had but stopped to reflect we should have seen how unlikely the money was not to be lost in the agra why the tiser says she went to pieces almost directly she struck what we ought to have done was not to listen to alfred hardie like fools but write to lloyds like people in their senses ill do it this minute and find out the surviving officers of the ship they will be able to give us information on that head mrs dodd approved and said she would write to her kind correspondent mrs beresford and she did sit down to her desk at once as for sampson he returned to town next morning not quite convinced but thoroughly staggered and determined for once to resign his own judgment and abide the result of mrs dodds correspondence and mr greens sagacity all he insisted on was that his placard about alfred should be continued he left money for this and edward against the grain consented to see it done but placards are no monopoly in the afternoon only a section of sampsons was visible in most parts of the town by reason of a poster to this effect pasted half over it fifty guineas reward whereas yesterday evening at ten oclock richard hardie esq of musgrove cottage barkington was assaulted at his own door by three ruffians who rifled his pockets and read his private memoranda and committed other acts of violence the shock of which has laid him on a bed of sickness the above reward shall be paid to any person or persons who will give such information as shall lead to the detection of all or any one of the miscreants concerned in this outrage the above reward will be paid by mr thomas hardie of clare court yorkshire on this the impartial police came to mr hardies and made inquiries he received them in bed and told them particulars and they gathered from peggy that she had heard a cry of distress and opened the kitchen door and that betty and she had ventured out together and found poor master tied to the gate with an old cord this she produced and the police inspected and took it away with them at sight of that notice edward felt cold and then hot and realised the false and perilous position into which he had been betrayed so much for being wiser than the law he said what are we now but three footpads this and the insult his sister had received made the place poison to him and hastened their departure by a day or two the very next day thursday an affiche on the walls of albion villa announced that mr chippenham auctioneer would sell next wednesday on the premises the greater part of the furniture plate china glass oriental inlaid boxes and screens with several superb india shawls scarfs and dresses also a twentyone years lease of the villa seventeen to run edward took unfurnished apartments in london near russell square a locality in which as he learned from the tiser the rooms were large and cheap he packed just so much furniture as was essential no knickknacks it was to go by rail on monday mrs dodd and julia were to follow on tuesday edward to stay at barkington and look after the sale meantime their secret ally mr green was preparing his threatened coup the more he reflected the more he suspected that he had been outwitted by peggy black she had led him on and the pocketbook had been planted for him if so why peggy was a genius and in his own line and he would marry her and so kill two birds with one stone make a detective of her there was a sad lack of female detectives and once his wife she would split on her master and he should defeat that old soldier at last and get a handsome slice of the l he manoeuvred thus first he went back to london for a day or two to do other jobs and to let this matter cool then he returned and wrote from a town near barkington to peggy black telling her he had been sent away suddenly on a job but his heart had remained behind with his peggy would she meet him at the gate at nine that evening he had something very particular to say to her as to the nature of the business the enclosed would give her a hint she might name her own day and the sooner the better the enclosed was a weddingring at nine this extraordinary pair of lovers met at the gate but peggy seemed hardly at her ease said her master would be coming out and catching her perhaps they had better walk up the road a bit with all my heart said green but he could not help a little sneer your master said he why he is your servant as i am what is he jealous i dont know what you mean young man said peggy ill tell you when we are married la that is a long time to wait for my answer why we aint asked in church yet theres no need of that i can afford a special licence lawk a daisy why you be a gentleman then no but i can keep my wife like a lady you sounds very tempting murmured peggy throwing her skirt over her headfor a drizzle was beginningand walking slower and slower then he made hot love to her and pressed her hard to name the day she coquetted with the question till they came near the mouth of a dark lane called lovers walk then as he insisted on an answer she hung her head bashfully and coughed a little cough at which preconcerted signal a huge policeman sprang out of the lane and collared mr green on this peggy who was all lie from head to heel uttered a little scream of dismay and surprise mr green laughed well you are a downy one said he ill marry you all the more for thus the detective put his hands suddenly inside the policemans caught him by the bosom with his right hand by way of fulcrum and with his left by the chin which he forced violently back and gave him a slight cornish trip at the same moment down went the policeman on the back of his head a fearful crack green then caught the astonished peggy round the neck kissed her lips violently and fled like the wind removed all traces of his personal identity and up to london by the train in the character of a young swell with a selffitting eyeglass and a long moustache the colour of his tender mistresss eyebrow tow from town he wrote to her made her a formal offer of marriage and gave her an address to write to should she at any time think more kindly of him and of his sincere affection i suppose he specified sincere because it was no longer sincere he hurled the offer into musgrove cottage by way of an apple of discordat least so i infer from the memorandum with which he retired at present from the cash hunt mr hardie has the stiff i think but if so it is planted somewheredoesnt carry it about him my peggy is his mistress nothing to be done till they split victorious so far mr hardie had still one pressing anxiety dr sampsons placard this had been renewed and stared him everywhere in the face every copy of it he encountered made him shiver if he had been a man of impulse he would have torn it down wherever he saw it but he knew that would not do however learning from jane who had it from old betty who had it from sarah that mrs and miss dodd would leave for london the day before the sale and edward the day after it he thought he might venture in the busy intermediate time to take some liberties with it this he did with excellent tact and judgment peggy and a billsticker were seen in conference and soon after the huge bills of a travelling circus were pasted right over both the rival advertisements in which the name of hardie figured the consequence was edward raised no objection he was full of the sale for one thing but i suspect he was content to see his own false move pasted over on such easy terms one morning peggy brought in the letters and jane saw one in alfreds handwriting she snatched it up and cried papa from alfred and she left off making the tea while her father opened it with comparative composure this coolness however did not outlast the perusal the young ruffian said he would you believe it jenny he accuses me of being the cause of his last business let me see papa he held her out the letter but hesitated and drew it back my dear it would give you pain to see your poor father treated so heres a specimen what could they expect but that the son of a sharper would prove a traitor you stole her money i her affections of which i am unworthy now what do you think of that unhappy alfred said jane no papa i would not read it if you are insulted in it but where is he the letter is dated paris see and he showed her the date but he says here he is coming back to london directly and he orders me in the most peremptory way to be ready with my accounts and pay him over his fortune well he is alive at all events really my good kind interfering pragmatical friend sampson with his placards made me feel uneasy more uneasy than i would own to you jenny unhappy alfred cried jane with the tears in her eyes and poor papa oh never mind me said mr hardie now that i know no harm has come to him i really dont care a straw i have got one child that loves me and that i love ah yes dear dear papa and that will always love you and never never disobey you in small things or great she rose from the table and sealed this with a pious kiss and when she sat down with a pink flush on her delicate cheek his hard eye melted and dwelt on her with beaming tenderness his heart yearned over her and a pang went through it to think that he must deceive even her the one sweet soul that loved him it was a passing remorse the successful plotter soon predominated and it was with unmixed satisfaction he saw her put on her bonnet directly after breakfast and hurry off to albion villa to play the part of his unconscious sieve he himself strolled in the opposite direction not to seem to be watching her he was in good spirits felt like a general who after repulsing many desperate attacks successfully orders an advance and sees the tide of battle roll away from his bayonets his very body seemed elastic indomitable he walked lustily out into the country sniffed the perfumed hedges and relished life to be sure he could not walk away from all traces of his misdeeds he fell in with objects that to an ordinary sinner might have spoiled the walk and even marred the springtime he found his creditor maxley with grizzly beard and bloodshot eyes belabouring a milestone and two small boys quizzing him and pelting him with mud and soon after he met his creditor old dr phillips in a cart coming back to barkington to end his days there at the almshouse but to our triumphant bankrupt and machiavel these things were literally nothing he paced complacently on and cared no more for either of those his wrecks than the smiling sea itself seems to care for the dead ships and men it washed ashore a week ago he came home before luncheon for his gossip with jane but she had not returned all the better her budget would be the larger to while the time he got his file of the times and amused himself noting down the fluctuations in peruvian bonds while thus employed he heard a loud knock at his door and soon after peggys voice and a mans in swift collision hasty feet came along the passage the parlour door opened and a young man rushed in pale as ashes and stared at him he was breathless and his lips moved but no sound came it was edward dodd mr hardie rose like a tower and manned himself to repulse this fresh assault the strange visitor gasped out you are wanted at our house chapter xxxvii jane hardie had found albion villa in the miserable state that precedes an auction the house raw its contents higgledypiggledy the stair carpets and drawingroom carpets were up and in rolls in the diningroom the bulk of the furniture was there too the auction was to be in that room the hall was clogged with great packages and littered with small all awaiting the railway carts and edward dusty and deliquescent was cording strapping and nailing them at the gallop in his shirt sleeves janes heart sank at the visible signs of his departure she sighed and then partly to divert his attention told him hastily there was a letter from alfred on this he ran upstairs and told mrs dodd and she came downstairs and after a conversation took jane up softly to her friends room they opened the door gently and jane saw the grief she was come to consoleor to embitter such a change instead of the bright elastic impetuous young beauty there sat a pale languid girl with weary of the world written on every part of her eloquent body her right hand dangled by her side and on the ground beneath it lay a piece of work she had been attempting but it had escaped from those listless fingers her left arm was stretched at full length on the table with an unspeakable abandon and her brow laid wearily on it above the elbow so lies the wounded bird so droops the broken lily she did not move for janes light foot she often sat thus a drooping statue and let the people come and go unheeded janes heart yearned for her she came softly and laid a little hand lightly on her shoulder and true to her creed that we must look upward for consolation said in her ear and in solemn silvery tones our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory julia turned at this and flung her arms round janes neck and panted heavily jane kissed her and with tears in her eyes proceeded to pour out from a memory richly stored with scripture those blessed words it is full of words that in our hours of ease or biblical criticism pass over the mind like some drowsy chime but in the bitter day of anguish and bereavement when the body is racked the soul darkened shine out like stars to the mariner seem then first to swell to their real size and meaning and come to writhing mortals like pitying seraphim divinity on their faces and healing on their wings julia sighed heavily ah she said these are sweet words but i am not ripe for them you show me the true path of happiness but i dont want to be happy its him i want to be happy if the angels came for me and took me to heaven this moment i should be miserable there if i thought he was in eternal torment ay i should be as miserable there as i am here oh jane when god means to comfort me he will show me he is alive till then words are wasted on me even bible words tell her your news my dear said mrs dodd quietly she was one of those who take human nature as it is and make the best of it julia dear said jane your fears are extravagant indeed alfred is alive we know julia trembled but said nothing he has written today ah to you no to papa i dont believe it why to him but i saw the letter dear i had it my hand did you read it asked julia trembling now like an aspen and fluttering like a bird no but i read the address and the date inside and i saw the handwriting and i was offered the letter but papa told me it was full of abuse of him so i declined to read it however i will get it for you this was one of those involuntary inaccuracies which creep into mortal statements mrs dodd thanked her warmly but asked her if she could not in the meantime give some idea of the contents oh yes mrs dodd papa read me out a great deal of it he was in paris but just starting for london and he demanded his money and his accounts you know papa is one of his trustees well but said mrs dodd there was nothingnothing about oh yes there was said jane only iwell then for dear julias sakethe letter said what wonder the son of a sharper should prove a traitor you have stolen her money and i her affections andoh i cant i cant and jane hardie began to cry mrs dodd embraced her like a mother and entered into her filial feelings mrs dodd had never seen her so weak and therefore never thought her so amiable thus occupied they did not at first observe how these tidings were changing julia but presently looking up they saw her standing at her full height on fire with wrath and insulted pride ah you have brought me comfort she cried mamma i shall hate and scorn this man some day as much as i hate and scorn myself now for every tear i have shed for him they tried to calm her but in vain a new gust of passion possessed the ardent young creature and would have vent she reddened from bosom to brow and the scalding tears ran down her flaming cheeks and she repeated between her clenched teeth my veins are not filled with skimmilk i can tell you you have seen how i can love you shall see how i can hate and with this she went haughtily out of the room not to expose the passion which overpowered her mrs dodd took advantage of her absence to thank jane for her kindness and told her she had also received some letters by this mornings post and thought it would be neither kind on her part nor just to conceal their purport from her she then read her a letter from mrs beresford and another from mr grey in answer to queries about the l sharpe i may as well observe was at sea bayliss drowned mrs beresford knew nothing about the matter mr grey was positive captain dodd when in command had several thousand pounds in his cabin mrs beresfords indian servant had been detected trying to steal it and put in irons believed the lady had not been told the causeout of delicacy and captain roberts had liberated him as to whether the money had escaped the wreckif on captain dodds person it might have been saved but if not it was certainly lost for captain dodd to his knowledge had run on deck from the passengers cabin the moment the ship struck and had remained there till she went to pieces and everything was washed out of her our own opinion said mrs dodd i mean edwards and mine is now that the money was lost in the ship and you can tell your papa so if you like jane thanked her and said she thought so too and what a sad thing it was soon after this julia returned pale and calm as a statue and sat down humbly beside jane oh pray with me she said pray that i may not hate for to hate is to be wicked and pray that i may not love for to love is to be miserable mrs dodd retired with her usual tact and selfdenial then jane hardie being alone with her friend and full of sorrow sympathy and faith found words of eloquence almost divine to raise her with these pious consolations julias pride and selfrespect now cooperated relieved of her great terror she felt her insult to her fingers ends ill never degrade myself so far as to pine for another ladys lover she said ill resume my duties in another sphere and try to face the world by degrees i am not quite alone in it i have my mother stilland my redeemer some tears forced their way at these brave gentle words jane gave her time then she said begin by putting on your bonnet and visiting with me come with one who is herself thwarted in the carnal affections come with her and see how sick some are and we two in health how racked with pain some are and we two at ease how hungry some and we have abundance and above all in what spiritual deserts some lie while we walk in the gospel light oh that i had the strength said julia ill try she put on her bonnet and went down with her friend but at the street door the strange feeling of shame overpowered her she blushed and trembled and begged to substitute the garden for the road jane consented and said everything must have a beginning the fresh air the bursting buds and all the face of nature did julia good and she felt it you little angel said she with something of her old impetuosity you have saved me i was making myself worse by shutting myself up in that one miserable room they walked hand in hand for a good half hour and then jane said she must go papa would miss her julia was sorry to part with her and almost without thinking accompanied her through the house to the front gate and that was another point gained i never was so sorry to part with you love said she when will you come again we leave tomorrow i am selfish to detain you but it seems as if my guardian angel was leaving me jane smiled i must go said she but ill leave better angels than i am behind me i leave you this humble yourself under the mighty hand of god when it seems most harsh then it is most loving pray for faith to say with me lead us by a way that we know not they kissed one another and julia stood at the gate and looked lovingly after her with the tears standing thick in her own violet eyes now maxley was coming down the road all grizzly and bloodshot baited by the boys who had gradually swelled in number as he drew nearer the town jane was shocked at their heathenish cruelty and went off the path to remonstrate with them on this maxley fell upon her and began beating her about the head and shoulders with his heavy stick the miserable boys uttered yells of dismay but did nothing julia uttered a violent scream but flew to her friends aid and crying oh you wretch you wretch actually caught the man by the throat and shook him violently he took his hand off jane hardie who instantly sank moaning on the ground and he cowered like a cur at the voice and the purple gleaming eyes of the excited girl the air filled with cries and edward ran out of the house to see what was the matter but on the spot nobody was game enough to come between the furious man and the fiery girl the consequence was her impetuous courage began to flag and her eye to waver the demented man found this out by some half animal instinct and instantly caught her by the shoulder and whirled her down on her knees then raised his staff high to destroy her she screamed and was just putting up her hands womanlike not to see her death as well as feel it when something dark came past her like a rushing winda blow that sounded exactly like that of a paving ram caught maxley on the jaw and there was edward dodd blowing like a grampus with rage and maxley on his back in the road but men under cerebral excitement are not easily stunned and know no pain he bounded off the ground and came at edward like a spanish bull edward slipped aside and caught him another ponderous blow that sent him staggering and his bludgeon flew out of his hand and edward caught it lo the maniac flew at him again more fiercely than ever but the young hercules had seen jane bleeding on the ground he dealt her assailant in full career such a murderous stroke with the bludgeon that the people who were running from all quarters shrieked with dismaynot for jane but for maxley and well they might that awful stroke laid him senseless motionless and mute in a pool of his own blood dont kill him sir dont kill the man was the cry why not said edward sternly he then kneeled over his sweetheart and lifted her in his arms like a child her bonnet was all broken her eyes were turned upwards and set and a little blood trickled down her cheek and that cheek seemed streaked white and red he was terrified agonised yet he gasped out you are safe dear dont be frightened she knew the voice oh edward she said piteously and tenderly and then moaned a little on his broad bosom he carried her into the house out of the crowd poor old doctor phillips coming in to end his days in the almshouse had seen it all he got out of his cart and hobbled up he had been in the army and had both experience and skill he got her bonnet off and at sight of her head looked very grave in a minute a bed was laid in the drawingroom and all the windows and doors open and edward trembling now in every limb ran to musgrove cottage while mrs dodd and julia loosened the poor girls dress and bathed her wounds with tepid water the doctor would not allow cold and put wine carefully to her lips with a teaspoon wanted at your house pray what for said mr hardie superciliously oh sir said edward such a calamity pray come directly a ruffian has struck her has hurt her terribly terribly her who asked mr hardie beginning to be uneasy who why jane your daughter man and there you sit chattering instead of coming at once mr hardie rose hurriedly and put on his hat and accompanied him half confused soon edwards mute agitation communicated itself to him and he went striding and trembling by his side the crowd had gone with insensible maxley to the hospital but the traces of the terrible combat were there where maxley fell the last time a bullock seemed to have been slaughtered at the least the miserable father came on this and gave a great scream like a woman and staggered back white as a sheet edward laid his hand on him for he seemed scarce able to stand no no no he cried comprehending the mistake at last that is not hersheaven forbid that is the madmans who did it i knocked him down with his own cudgel god bless you youve killed him i hope oh sir be more merciful and then perhaps he will be merciful to us and not take this angel from us no no you are right good young man i little thought i had such a friend in your house dont deceive yourself sir said edward its not you i care for then with a great cry of anguish i love her at this blunt declaration so new and so offensive to him mr hardie winced and stopped bewildered but they were at the gate and edward hurried him on at the house door he drew back once more for he felt a shiver of repugnance at entering this hateful house of whose happiness he was the destroyer but enter it he must it was his fate the wife of the poor captain he had driven mad met him in the passage her motherly eyes full of tears for him and both hands held out to him like a pitying angel oh mr hardie she said in a broken voice and took him and led him wonderstruck stupefied shivering with dark fears to the room where his crushed daughter lay chapter xxxviii mr hardie found his daughter lying ashy pale on a little bed in the drawingroom of albion villa she was now scarce conscious the old doctor sat at her head looking very grave and julia kneeled over her beloved friend pale as herself with hands clasped convulsively and great eyes of terror and grief that vivid young face full of foreboding and woe struck mr hardie the moment he entered and froze his very heart the strong man quivered and sank slowly like a felled tree by the bedside and his face and the poor girls whose earthly happiness he had coldly destroyed nearly met over his crushed daughter jane my child he gasped my poor little jane oh let me sleep she moaned feebly darling its your own papa said julia softly poor papa said she turning rather to julia than to him let me sleep she was in a half lethargic state mr hardie asked the doctor in an agitated whisper if he might move her home the doctor shook his head not by my advice her pulse is scarce perceptible we must not move her nor excite her nor yet let her sink into lethargy she is in great danger very great at these terrible words mr hardie groaned and they all began to speak below the breath edward murmured mrs dodd hurriedly run and put off the auction put it off altogether then go to the railway nothing must come here to make a noise and get straw put down directly do that first dear you are kinder to me than i deserve muttered mr hardie humbly quite cowed by the blow that had fallen on him the words agitated mrs dodd with many thoughts but she whispered as calmly as she could let us think of nothing now but this precious life mr hardie begged to see the extent of the injury mrs dodd dissuaded him but he persisted then the doctor showed her poor head at that the father uttered a scream and sat quivering julia buried her face in the bedclothes directly and sobbed vehemently it passed faintly across the benumbed and shuddering father how she loves my child they all love her but the thought made little impression at the time the mind was too full of terror and woe the doctor now asked for brandy in a whisper mrs dodd left the room with stealthy foot and brought it he asked for a quill julia went with swift stealthy foot and brought it with adroit and tender hands they aided the doctor and trickled stimulants down her throat then sat like statues of grief about the bed only every now and then eye sought eye and endeavoured to read what the other thought was there hope was there none and byandbye so roving is the mind especially when the body is still these statues began to thrill with thoughts of the past as well as the absorbing present ay here were met a strange party a stranger for its size methinks never yet met on earth to mingle their hearts together in one grief just think of him who sat there with his face hidden in his hands and his frame shuddering all the others were the victims yet the lady whose husband he had robbed and driven mad pitied and sympathised with him and he saw it the lady whom he had insulted at the altar and blighted her young heart and life pitied and sympathised with him the poor old doctor pitied and sympathised and was more like an anxious father than a physician even jane was one of his victims for she fell by the hand of a man he had dishonestly ruined and driven out of his senses thinking of all he had done and this the end of it he was at once crushed and melted he saw with awe that a mightier hand than mans was upon him it had tossed him and his daughter into the house and the arms of the injured dodds in defiance of all human calculation and he felt himself a straw in that hand so he was and the great globe itself oh if jane should die the one creature he loved the one creature bereaved of whom he could get no joy even from riches what would he not give to recall the past since all his schemes had but ended in this thus stricken by terror of the divine wrath and touched by the goodness and kindness of those he had cruelly wronged all the man was broken with remorse then he vowed to undo his own work as far as possible he would do anything everything if heaven would spare him his child now it did so happen that these resolves earnest and sincere but somewhat vague were soon put to the test and as often occurs what he was called on to do first was that which he would rather have done last thus it was about five oclock in the afternoon jane hardie opened her eyes and looked about her it was a moment of intense anxiety they all made signals but held their breath she smiled at sight of mr hardie and said papa dear papa there was great joy silent on the part of mrs dodd and julia but mr hardie who saw in this a good omen heaven recognising his penitence burst out she knows me she speaks she will live how good god is yes my darling child it is your own father you will be brave and get well for my sake jane did not seem to pay much heed to these words she looked straight before her like one occupied with her own thought and said distinctly and solemnly papasend for alfred it fell on all three like a clap of thunder those gentle but decided tones those simple natural words julias eyes flashed into her mothers and then sought the ground directly there was a dead silence mr hardie was the one to speak why for him dear those who love you best are all here for heavens sake dont thwart her sir said the doctor in alarm this is no time to refuse her anything in your power sometimes the very expectation of a beloved person coming keeps them alive stimulates the powers mr hardie was sore perplexed he recoiled from the sudden exposure that might take place if alfred without any preparation or previous conciliatory measures were allowed to burst in upon them and while his mind was whirling within him in doubt and perplexity jane spoke again but no longer calmly and connectedly she was beginning to wander presently in her wandering she spoke of edward called him dear edward mrs dodd rose hastily and her first impulse was to ask both gentlemen to retire so instinctively does a good woman protect her own sex against the other but reflecting that this was the father she made an excuse and retired herself instead followed by julia the doctor divined and went to the window the father sat by the bed and soon gathered his daughter loved edward dodd the time was gone by when this would have greatly pained him he sighed like one overmatched by fate but said you shall have him my darling he is a good young man he shall be your husband you shall be happy only live for my sake for all our sakes she paid no attention and wandered on a little but her mind gradually cleared and byandbye she asked quietly for a glass of water mr hardie gave it her she sipped and he took it from her she looked at him close and said distinctly have you sent for alfred no love not yet not yet there is no time to lose she said gravely mr hardie trembled then being alone with her the miserable man unable to say no unwilling to say yes tried to persuade her not to ask for alfred my dear he whispered i will not refuse you but i have a secret to confide to you will you keep it yes papa faithfully poor alfred is not himself he has delusions he is partly insane my brother thomas has thought it best for us all to put him under gentle restraint for a time it would retard his cure to have him down here and subject him to excitement papa said jane are you deceiving me or are you imposed upon alfred insane it is a falsehood he came to me the night before the wedding that was to be oh my brother my darling brother how dare they say you are insane that letter you showed me then was a falsehood oh papa i feared to frighten you said mr hardie and hung his head i see it all she cried those wicked men with their dark words have imposed on you bring him to me that i may reconcile you all and end all this misery ere i go hence and be no more seen oh my child dont talk so cried mr hardie trembling think of your poor father i do she cried i do oh papa i lie here between two worlds and see them both so clear trust to me and if you love me if i love you jane better than all the world twice told then dont refuse me this one favour the last perhaps i shall ever ask you i want my brother here before it is too late tell him he must come to his little sister who loves him dearly andis dying oh no no no cried the agonised father casting everything to the winds i will he shall be here in twelve hours only promise me to bear up have a strong will have courage you shall have alfred you shall have anything you like on earth anything that money can get you what am i saying i have no money it is all gone but i have a fathers heart madam mrs dodd she came directly can you give me paper no i wont trust to a letter ill send off a special messenger this moment it is for my son madam he will be here tomorrow morning god knows how it will all end but how can i refuse my dying child oh madam you are good kind forgiving keep my poor girl alive for me keep telling her alfred is coming she cares more for him than for her poor heartbroken father and the miserable man rushed out leaving mrs dodd in tears for him he was no sooner gone than julia came in and clasped her mother and trembled on her bosom then mrs dodd knew she had overheard mr hardies last words jane hardie too though much exhausted by the scene with her father put out her hand to julia and took hers and said feebly but with a sweet smile he is coming love all shall be well then to herself as it were and looking up with a gentle rapture in her pale face blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god on this thought she seemed to feed with innocent joy but for a long time was too weak to speak again mr hardie rushing from the house found edward at work outside he was crying undisguisedly and with his coat off working harder at spreading the straw than both the two men together he had got to help him mr hardie took his hand and wrung it but could not speak in half an hour a trusty agent he had often employed was at the station waiting for the up train nearly due he came back to albion villa julia met him on the stairs with her fingers to her lips she is sleeping the doctor has hopes oh sir let us all pray for her day and night mr hardie blessed her it seemed the face of an angel so earnest so lovely so pious he went home and at the door of his own house peggy met him with anxious looks he told her what he had done good heavens said she have you forgotten he says he will kill you the first day he gets out you told me so yourself yes baker said so i cant help it i dont care what becomes of me i care only for my child leave me peggy there go go he was no sooner alone than he fell upon his knees and offered the great author of life and deatha bargain o god he cried i own my sins and i repent them spare but my child who never sinned against thee and i will undo all i have done amiss in thy sight i will refund that money on which thy curse lies i will throw myself on their mercy i will set my son free i will live on a pittance i will part with peggy i will serve mammon no more i will attend thine ordinances i will live soberly honestly and godly all the remainder of my days only do thou spare my child she is thy servant and does thy work on earth and there is nothing on earth i love but her and now the whistle sounded the train moved and his messenger was flying fast to london with a note to dr wycherley dear sirmy poor daughter lies dangerously wounded and perhaps at the point of death she cries for her brother he must come down to us instantly with the bearer of this send one of your people with him if you like but it is not necessary i enclose a blank cheque signed which please fill at your discretioni am with thanks yours in deep distress richard hardie chapter xxxix dr short arrived approved dr phillipss treatment and said the case was severe but not hopeless and he would call again a bed was prepared in the house for mr hardie but neither he nor any of the dodds closed an eye that sorrowful night about midnight after a short slumber the sufferer became uneasy and begged to be left with julia julia was sent for and found her a good deal excited she inquired more than once if they were quite alone and then asked for paper and a pencil she wrote a few lines and made julia put them in a cover and seal them now dear friend she said promise me not to open this nor even to let your mother it is not for your happiness that what i have written should be seen by her or you no no much better not come dear friend pledge me your honour julia pledged her honour then jane wrote on the cover from a dying sister julia saw that and wept sore jane comforted her do not weep for me love i am content to go or stay this is not my doing so i know it must be for the best he is leading me by a way that i know not oh my beloved friend how sweet it is to lie in his hands and know no will but his ay i thank him for crossing my will and leading me to himself by his own good way and not by poor blind foolish mine in this spirit of full resignation she abode constant and consoled her weeping friends from time to time whenever she was quite herself about daybreak being alone with her father she shed a few tears at his lonely condition i fear you will miss me said she take my advice dear be reconciled with alfred at once and let julia be your daughter since i am leaving you she is all humility and heart dying i prize her and her affection more highly i seem to see characters clearer all things clearer than i did before my summons came the miserable father tried to be playful and scold her you must not talk nor think of death he said your bridalday is to come first i know all edward dodd has told me he loves you he is a fine noble fellow you shall marry him i wish it now for his sake summon all your resolution and make up your mind to live why at your age it needs but to say i will live i will i will and when all the prospect is so smiling when love awaits you at the altar and on every side if you could leave your poor doting father do not leave your lover and here he is with his mother crying for you let me comfort him let me tell him you will live for his sake and mine even this could not disturb the dying christian dear edward she said it is sweet to know he loves me ah well he is young he must live without me till i become but a tender memory of his youth and oh i pray for him that he may cherish the words i have spoken to him for his souls good far longer than he can remember these features that are hastening to decay at ten in the morning mr hardies messenger returned without alfred and with a note from dr wycherley to this effect that the order for alfreds admission into his asylum being signed by mr thomas hardie he could not send him out even for a day except on thomas hardies authority it would be a violation of the law under the circumstances however he thought he might venture to receive that order by telegraph if then mr hardie would telegraph thomas hardie in yorkshire to telegraph him wycherley alfred should be sent with two keepers wherever mr t hardie should so direct now mr hardie had already repented of sending for alfred at all so instead of telegraphing yorkshire he remained passive and said sullenly to mrs dodd alfred cant come it seems thus routine kept the brother from his dying sister they told jane with aching hearts there was reason to fear alfred could not arrive that day she only gave a meaning look at julia about the paper and then she said with a little sigh gods will be done this was the last disappointment heaven allowed earth to inflict on her and the shield of faith turned its edge one hour of pain another of delirium and now the clouds that darken this mortal life seemed to part and pass and heaven to open full upon her she spoke of her coming change no longer with resignation it was with rapture oh she cried to think that from this very day i shall never sin again shall never again offend him by unholy temper by unchristlike behaviour the strong and healthy wept and groaned aloud but she they sorrowed for was all celestial bliss in her lifetime she had her ups and downs of religious fervour was not without feverish heats and cold misgivings and depression but all these fled at that dread hour when the wicked are a prey to dark misgivings or escape into apathy this timid girl that would have screamed at a scratch met the king of terrors with smiles and triumph for her the grave was jordan and death was but the iron gate of life everlasting mors janua vitae yet once or twice she took herself to task but only to show she knew what the allpure had forgiven her i often was wanting in humility she said i almost think that if i were to be sent back again into this world of sin and sorrow i am leaving behind i should grow a little in humility for i know the ripe christian is like the ripe corn holds his head lower than when he was green and the grave it seems to be ripening me but what does it matter since he who died for me is content to take me as i am come quickly lord jesus oh come quickly relieve thy servant from the burden of the flesh and of the sins and foibles that cling to it and keep her these many years from thee this prayer was granted the body failed more and more she could not swallow even a drop of wine she could not even praise her redeemer that is to say she could not speak yet she lay and triumphed with hands put together in prayer and eyes full of praise and joy unspeakable she climbed fast to god while she so mounted in the spirit her breath came at intervals unusually long and all were sent for to see death conquer the body and be conquered by the soul at last after an unnaturally long interval she drew a breath like a sigh they waited for another waited waited in vain she had calmly ceased to live the old doctor laid down her hand reverently and said she is with us no more then with many tears oh may we all meet where she is now and may i go to her the first richard hardie was led from the room in a stupor immediately after death all the disfiguring effect of pain retired and the happy soul seemed to have stamped its own celestial rapture on the countenance at the moment of leaving it a rapture so wonderful so divine so more than mortal calm irradiated the dead face the good christians she left behind her looked on and feared to weep lest they should offend him who had taken her to himself and set a visible seal upon the house of clay that had held her oh mamma cried julia with fervour look look can we dare we wish that angel back to this world of misery and sin and it was some hours before she cooled and began to hang on edwards neck and weep his loss and hers as weep we mortals must though the angels of heaven are rejoicing thus died in the flower of her youth and by what we call a violent death the one child richard hardie loved member of a religious party whose diction now and then offends one to the soul but the root of the matter is in them allowance made for those passions foibles and infirmities of the flesh even you and i are not entirely free from they live fearing god and die loving him there was an inquest next day followed in due course by a public trial of james maxley but these are matters which though rather curious and interesting must be omitted or touched hereafter and briefly the effect of janes death on richard hardie was deplorable he saw the hand of heaven but did not bow to it so it filled him with rage rebellion and despair he got his daughter away and hid himself in the room with her scarce stirring out by night or day he spoke to no one he shunned the dodds he hated them he said it was through visiting their house she had met her death and at their door he would not let himself see it was he who had sent her there with his lie he loathed alfred calling him the cause of all he asked nobody to the funeral and when edward begged permission to come he gave a snarl like a wild beast and went raging from him but edward would go and at the graveside pitying heaven relieved the young fellows choking heart with tears but no such dew came to that parched old man who stood on its other side like the withered archangel his eyes gloomy and wild his white cheek ploughed deep with care and crime and anguish his lofty figure bowed by his long warfare his soul burning and sickening by turns with hatred and rebellion with desolation and despair he went home and made his will for he felt life hang on him like lead and that any moment he might kill himself to be rid of it strange to say he left a sum of money to edward dodd a moment before he didnt know he was going to do it a moment after he was half surprised he had done it and minded to undo it but would not take the trouble he went up to london and dashed into speculation as some in their despair take to drink for this man had but two passions avarice and his love for his daughter bereaved of her he must either die or live for gain he sought the very cave of mammon he plunged into the stock exchange when mr hardie said alfred cant come it seems mrs dodd misunderstood him naturally enough she thought the heartless young man had sent some excuse had chosen to let his sister die neglected rather than face julia as if she would leave her own room while he was in my house said mrs dodd with sovereign contempt from this moment she conceived a horror of the young man edward shared it fully and the pair always spoke of him under the title of the wretch this was when julia was not by in her presence he was never mentioned by this means she would in time forget him or else see him as they saw him and as after all they knew little to mr hardies disadvantage except what had come out of the wretchs mouth and as moreover their hearts were softened towards the father by his bereavement and their sight of his misery and also by his grateful words they quite acquitted him of having robbed them and felt sure the fourteen thousand pounds was at the bottom of the sea they were a little surprised that mr hardie never spoke nor wrote to them again but being highminded and sweet tempered they set it down to allabsorbing grief and would not feel sore about it and now they must leave the little villa where they had been so happy and so unhappy the scanty furniture went first mrs dodd followed and arranged it in their apartments julia would stay behind to comfort edward inconsolable herself the auction came off most of the things went for cruelly little money compared to their value and with the balance the sad young pair came up to london and were clasped in their mothers arms the tears were in her tender eyes it is a poor place to receive my treasures she said edward looked round astonished it was a poor place said he but you have made a little palace of it somehow or another my childrens love can alone do that replied mrs dodd kissing them both again next day they consulted together how they were to live edward wished to try and get his father into a public asylum then his mother would have a balance to live upon out of her income but mrs dodd rejected this proposal with astonishment in vain edward cited the tiser that public asylums are patterns of comfort and cure twice as many patients as the private ones do she was deaf alike to the tiser and to statistics do not argue me out of my common sense said she my husband your father in a public asylum where anybody can go and stare at my darling she then informed them she had written to her aunt bazalgette and her uncle fountain and invited them to contribute something towards davids maintenance edward was almost angry at this fancy asking favours of them said he oh i must not sacrifice my family to false pride said mrs dodd besides they are entitled to know while waiting for their answers a word about the parties and their niece our mrs dodd born lucy fountain was left at nineteen to the care of two guardians her uncle fountain an old bachelor who loved comfort pedigree and his own way her aunt bazalgette who loved flirting dressing and her own way both charming people when they got their own way verjuice when they didnt and to conclude egotists deep as ocean from guardians they grew matchmakers and rivals by proxy uncle schemed to graft lucy on to a stick called talboys that came in with the revocation of the edict of nantes known in pedigrees as the norman conquest aunt wife of a merchant of no descent except from a high stool devoted her to richard hardie an unlookedfor obstacle encountered both lucy was not amorous she loved these two egotists and their quadrupeds but there she stopped dead short they persisted and while they pulled her to and fro and ruffled her native calm david dodd first mate of the something or other east indiamanbrown cheek honest speech heart of goldfell deep in love and worshipped her at a distance his timidity and social insignificance made him harmless so egotist fountain had him in to dessert to spin yarns egotist bazalgette invited him to her house to flirt with at this latter place he found hardie and talboys both courting lucy this drove him mad and in his fury he popped lucy declined him secundum artem he went away blessing her with a manly sob or two lucy cried a little and took a feminine spite against his rivals who remained to pester her now talboys spurred by uncle had often all but popped only some let hindrance or just impediment had still interposed once her pony kept prancing at each effort he made towards hymen they do say the subtle virgin kept probing the brute with a hair pin and made him caracole and spill the treacle as fast as it came her way however now talboys elected to pop by sea it was the element his ancestors had invaded fair england by and on its tranquil bosom a lover is safe from prancing steeds and the myriad antipops of terra firma miss lucy consented to the water excursion demurely designing to bring her sickly wooer to the point and so get rid of him for ever and ever plot and counterplot were baffled by the elements there came an antipop out of the southwest called a gale talboys boated so skilfully that he and his intended would have been united without ceremony by father nep at the bottom of the british channel but for david dodd who was hovering near in jealous anguish and a cutter he saved them both but in the doing of it missed his ship and professional ruin faced him then goodhearted lucy was miserable and appealed to mr bazalgette and he managed somehow to get david made captain of the rajah the poor girl thought she had squared the account with david but he refused the ship unless she would go halves and while her egotists bullied and vexed her he wrought so upon her pity and teased her so that to get rid of his importunity she married him in time she learned to love him ten times better than if she had begun all flames uncle and aunt cut her tolerably dead for some years uncle came round the first some antiquarian showed him that dodd was a much more ancient family than talboys why sir they were lords of sixteen manors under the heptarchy and hold some of them to this day mrs bazalgette too had long corresponded with her periodically and on friendly terms the answers came on the same day curiously enough uncle fountain ruined by railway speculation was living on an allowance from creditors but his house was at their service if they liked to live with himand board themselves mrs bazalgettes was the letter of a smooth woman who has hoarded imperishable spite she reminded her niece after all these years that her marriage with david was an act of disobedience and ingratitude she then enumerated her own heavy expenses all but the l a year she spent in bedizening her carcass and finally amidst a multitude of petty insults she offered to relieve mrs dodd ofjulia now poetry has reconciled us to an asp in a basket of figs but here was a scorpion in a bundle of nettles poor mrs dodd could not speak after reading it she handed it to edward and laid her white forehead wearily in her hand edward put the letter in an envelope and sent it back with a line in his own hand declining all further correspondence with the writer now then ladies said he dont you be cast down let this be a warning to us never to ask favours of anybody let us look the thing in the face we must work or starve and all the better for us hard work suits heavy hearts come have you any plan to be sure we have said julia eagerly i mean to go for a governess and then i shall cost mamma nothing and besides i can send her the money the people give me a pretty plan said edward sadly what we three part company dont you feel lonely enough without that i do then how can we bear our burdens at all if we are not to be all together to cheer one another along the weary road what are we to break up is it not enough to be bereaved he could say no more for the emotion his own words caused him thinking of jane he broke down altogether and ran out of the room however he came back in an hour with his eyes red but his heart indomitable determined to play a mans part for all their sakes you ladies said he with something of his old genial way that sounded so strange to one looking at his red eyes and inspired a desire to hug him are full of talent but empty of invention the moment you are ruined or that sort of thing it is go for a governess go for a companion go here go there in search of what independence no dependence besides all this going is bosh families are strong if they stick together and if they go to pieces they are weak i learned one bit of sense out of that mass of folly they call antiquity and that was the story of the old bloke with his twelve sons and fagot to match break em apart he said and each son broke his stick as easy as shelling peas now break the twelve all tied together devil a bit could the duffers break it then now we are not twelve we are but three easy to break one or two of us apart but not the lot together no nothing but death shall break this fagot for nothing less shall part us three he stood like a colossus and held out his hand to them they clung round his neck in a moment as if to illustrate his words clung tight and blessed him for standing so firm and forbidding them to part mrs dodd sighed after the first burst of enthusiastic affection and said if he would only go a step further and tell us what to do in company ay there it is said julia begin with me what can i do why paint what to sell oh dear my daubs are not good enough for that stuff nothing is too bad to sell i really think you might said mrs dodd and i will help you no no mamma i want you for something better than the fine arts you must go in one of the great grooves female vanity you must be a dressmaker you are a genius at it my mamma a dressmaker cried julia oh edward how can you how dare you poor poor mamma do not be so impetuous dear i think he is right yes it is all i am fit for if ever there was a heavenborn dressmaker its me as for myself said edward i shall look out for some business in which physical strength goes further than intellectual attainments luckily there are plenty such breaking stones is one but i shall try a few others first it is easy to settle on a business hard to get a footing in one edward convinced that the dressmaking was their best card searched that mine of various knowledge the tiser for an opening but none came at last one of those great miscellaneous houses in the city advertised for a lady to cut cloaks he proposed to his mother to go with him she shrank from encountering strangers no she would go to a fashionable dressmaker she had employed some years and ask her advice perhaps madame blanch would find her something to do i have more faith in the tiser said edward clinging to his idol mrs dodd found madame blanch occupied in trying to suit one of those heartbreaking idiots to whom dress is the one great thing and all things else sin included the little ones she had tried on a scarf three times and it discontented her when on and spoilt all else when off mrs dodd saw and said obligingly perhaps were i to put it on you could better judge mrs dodd you must know had an admirable art of putting on a shawl or scarf with apparent nonchalance she settled the scarf on her shapely shoulders so happily that the fish bit and the scarf went into its carriage forty guineas or so madame cast a rapid but ardent glance of gratitude doddwards the customer began to go and after fidgeting to the door and back for twenty minutes actually went somehow then madame turned round and said im sure maam i am much obliged to you you sold me the scarf and it is a pity we couldnt put her on your bust and shoulders maam then perhaps a scarf might please her what can i do for you maam mrs dodd blushed and with subdued agitation told madame blanch that this time she was come not to purchase but to ask a favour misfortune was heavy on her and though not penniless she was so reduced by her husbands illness and the loss of l by shipwreck that she must employ what little talents she had to support her family the woman explored her from head to foot to find the change of fortune in some corner of her raiment but her customer was as well though plainly dressed as ever and still looked an easygoing duchess could madame blanch find her employment in her own line what talent i have said mrs dodd humbly lies in that way i could not cut as well as yourself of course but i think i can as well as some of your people that ill be bound you can said madame blanch drily but dear dear to think of your having come down so have a glass of wine to cheer you a bit do now that is a good soul oh no madam i thank you but wine cannot cheer me a little bit of good news to take back to my anxious children that would cheer me madam will you be so good the dressmaker coloured and hesitated she felt the fascination of dignity donning humility and speaking music but she resisted it wont do at least here i shouldnt be mistress in my own place i couldnt drive you like i am forced to do the rest and then i should be sure to favour you being a real lady which is my taste and you always will be rich or poor and then all my ladies would be on the bile with jealousy ah madam sighed mrs dodd you treat me like a child you give me sweetmeats and refuse me food for my family no no said the woman hastily i dont say i mightnt send you out some work to do at home oh thank you madam nb the dressmaker had dropped the madam so the lady used it now at every word now stop a bit said madame blanch i know a firm thats in want theirs is easy work by mine and they cut up a piece of stuff every two or three days she then wrote on one of her own cards messrs cross fitchett copland and tylee and primrose lane city say i recommend you to tell the truth an old hand of my own was to come here this very morning about it but she hasnt kept her time so this will learn her business doesnt stand still for lieabeds to catch it mrs dodd put the card in her bosom and pressed the hand extended to her by madame zaire blanch whose name was sally white spinster she went back to her children and showed them the card and sank gracefully into a chair exhausted as much by the agitation of asking favours as by the walk cross fitchett copland why they were in the tiser yesterday said edward look at this a day lost by being wiser than the tiser ill waste no more then said mrs dodd rising quietly from the chair they begged her to rest herself first no she would not i saw this lost by half an hour said she succeed or fail i will have no remissness to reproach myself with and she glided off in her quiet way to encounter cross fitchett copland and tylee in the lane where a primrose was caught growingsix hundred years ago she declined edwards company rather peremptorily stay and comfort your sister said she but that was a blind the truth was she could not bear her children to mingle in what she was doing no her ambition was to ply the scissors and thimble vigorously and so enable them to be ladies and gentlemen at large she being gone julia made a parcel of watercolour drawings and sallied forth all on fire to sell them but while she was dressing edward started on a cruise in search of employment he failed entirely they met in the evening mrs dodd resigned edward dogged julia rather excited now let us tell our adventures she said as for me shop after shop declined my poor sketches they all wanted something about as good only a little different nobody complained of the grand fault and that is their utter badness at last one old gentleman examined them and oh he was so fat there round and he twisted his mouth so imitating him and squinted into them so then i was full of hope and said to myself dear mamma and edward and so when he ended by saying no like all the rest i burst out crying like a goose my poor girl cried mrs dodd with tears in her own eyes why expose yourself to these cruel rebuffs oh dont waste your pity mamma those great babyish tears were a happy thought of mine he bought two directly to pacify me and theres the money thirty shillings and she laid it proudly on the table the old cheat said edward they were worth two guineas apiece i know not they or why would not anybody else give twopence for them because pictures are a drug he added that even talent was not saleable unless it got into the great grooves and then looked at mrs dodd she replied that unfortunately those grooves were not always accessible the city firm had received her stiffly and inquired for whom she had worked children my heart fell at that question i was obliged to own myself an amateur and beg a trial however i gave madame blanchs card but mri dont know which partner it wassaid he was not acquainted with her then he looked a little embarrassed i thought and said the firm did not care to send its stuff to ladies not in the business i might cut it to waste orhe said no more but i do really think he meant i might purloin it why wasnt i there to look him into the earth oh mamma that you should be subjected to all this be quiet child i had only to put on my armour and do you know what my armour is thinking of my children so i put on my armour and said quietly we were not so poor but we could pay for a piece of cloth should i be so unfortunate as to spoil it and i offered in plain terms to deposit the price as security but he turned as stiff at that as his yard measure that was not cross and cos way of doing business he said but it is unreasonable to be dejected at a repulse or two and i am not out of spirits not much with this her gentle mouth smiled and her patient eyes were moist the next day just after breakfast was announced a gentleman from the city he made his bow and produced a parcel which proved to be a pattern cloak order ladies said he briskly from cross fitchett and co primrose lane porter outside with the piece you can come in sir porter entered with a bale please sign this maam mrs dodd signed a receipt for the stuff with an undertaking to deliver it in cloaks at primrose lane in such a time porter retreated the other said our mr fitchett wishes you to observe this fall in the pattern it is new i will sir am i to trouble you with any moneyby way of deposit sir no orders about it maam ladies your most obedient good morning sir and he was away all this seemed like a click or two of city clockwork followed by rural silence yet in that minute commerce had walked in upon genteel poverty and left honest labour and modest income behind her great was the thankfulness strange and new the excitement edward was employed to set up a very long deal table for his mother to work on julia to go and buy tailors scissors calculations were made how to cut the stuff to advantage and in due course the heavy scissors were heard snick snick snicking all day long julia painted zealously and edward without saying a word to them walked twenty miles a day hunting for a guinea a week and finding it not not but what employment was often bobbed before his eyes but there was no grasping it at last he heard of a place peculiarly suited to him a packing foremans in a warehouse at southwark he went there and was referred to mr as private house mr a was in the country for a day try mr b mr b was dining with the lord mayor returning belated he fell in with a fire and sad to say life was in jeopardy a little old man had run out at the first alarm when there was no danger and as soon as the fire was hot had run in again for his stockings or some such treasure fire does put out some peoples reason clean while he was rummaging madly the staircase caught and the smoke cut off his second exit and drove him up to a little staircase window at the side of the house here he stood hose in hand scorching behind and screeching in front a ladder had been brought but it was a yard short and the poor old man danced on the windowledge and dare not come down to a gallant fireman who stood ready to receive him at great personal peril in the midst of shrieks and cries and shouts of encouragement edward a practised gymnast saw a chance he ran up the ladder like a cat begged the fireman to clasp it tight then got on his shoulders and managed to grasp the windowsill he could always draw his own weight up by his hands so he soon had his knee on the sill and presently stood erect he then put his left arm inside the window collared the old fellow with his right and half persuasion half force actually lowered him to the ladder with one herculean arm amidst a roar that made the borough ring such a strain could not long be endured but the fireman speedily relieved him by seizing the old fellows feet and directing them on to the ladder and so propping him by the waist went down before him and landed him safe edward waited till they were down then begged them to hold the ladder tight below he hung from the ledge got his eye well on the ladder below him let himself quietly drop and caught hold of it with hands of iron and twisting round came down the ladder on the inside hand over head without using his feet a favourite gymnastic exercise of his learnt at the modern athens he was warmly received by the crowd and by the firemen you should be one of us sir said a fine young fellow who had cheered him and advised him all through i wish to heaven i was said edward the other thought he was joking but laughed and said then you should talk to our head man after the business there is a vacancy you know edward saw the fire out and rode home on the engine there he applied to the head man for the vacancy you are a stranger to me sir said the head man and i am sure it is no place for you you are a gentleman well is there anything ungentlemanly in saving peoples lives and property hear hear said a comic fireman the compliment began to tell though others put in their word why mr baldwin if a gentleman aint ashamed of us why should we be ashamed of him where will ye get a better asked another and added he is no stranger weve seen him work stop a bit said the comic fireman what does the dog say just call him sir if you please his name is charlie edward called the firedog kindly he came and fawned on him then gravely snuffed him all round and retired wagging his tail gently as much as to say i was rather taken by surprise at first but on the whole i see no reason to recall my judgment it is all right said the firemen in chorus and one that had not yet spoken to edward now whispered him mysteriously ye see that there doghe knows more than we do after the dog a biped oracle at headquarters was communicated with and late that very night edward was actually enrolled a fireman and went home warmer at heart than he had been for some time they were all in bed and when he came down in the morning julia was reading out of the tiser a spirited and magniloquent description of a fire in southwark and of the heroism displayed by a young gentleman unknown but whose name the writer hoped at so much the line would never be allowed to pass into oblivion and be forgotten in short the tiser paid him in one column for years of devotion now edward of course was going to relate his adventure but the journal told it so gloriously he hesitated to say i did all that he just sat and stared and wondered and blushed and grinned like an imbecile unfortunately looks seldom escaped the doddesses what is that for inquired julia reproachfully is that sheepish face the thing to wear when a sister is reading out an heroic action ah these are the things that make one long to be a man to do them what are you thinking about dear well i am thinking the tiser is pitching it rather strong my love what an expression well then to be honest i agree with you that it is a jolly thing to fight with fire and save mens lives and i am glad you see it in that light for now you will approve the step i have taken ladies i have put myself in the way of doing this sort of thing every week of my life im a fireman you are jesting i trust said mrs dodd anxiously no mamma i got the place late last night and im to enter on my duties and put on the livery next monday hurrah instantly the admirers of fiery heroes at a distance overflowed with grief and mortification at the prospect of one in their own family they could not speak at all at first and when they did it was only cruel cruel from julia and our humiliation is now complete from mrs dodd they soon dashed edwards spirits and made him unhappy but they could not convince him he had done wrong however in the heat of remonstrance they let out at last that they had just begun to hope by dint of scissors and paintbrush to send him back to oxford he also detected under a cloud of tender loving soothing coaxing and equivocating expressions their idea of a man to wit a tall strong ornamental creature whom the women were to cocker up and pet and slave for and be rewarded by basking dead tired in an imperial smile or two let fall by their sovereign protege from his armchair and in fact good women have often demoralised their idols down to the dirt by this process to be sure their idols were sorryish clay to begin edward was anything but flowery so he paraded no manly sentiments in reply he just bluntly ridiculed the idea of his consenting to prey on them and he said humbly i know i cant contribute as much to our living as you two canthe petticoats carry the brains in our familybut be a burden to you not if i know it pride pride pride objected julia lifting her grand violet orbs like a pensive madonna and such pride the pride that falls into a firebucket suggested prosaic mamma that is cutting said edward but soyons de notre siecle flunkeyism is on the decline ill give you something to put in both your pipes honour and rank from no condition rise act well thy part in that the honour lies yes yes said mrs dodd only first choose your part and let your choice be reasonable mine was hobsons and he never chooses wrong come come said he and appealed calmly to their reason by which means he made no impression at all then he happened to say besides i must do something i own to you i am more cast down than i choose to show mother i feel like lead ever since she died now on this their faces filled with sympathy directly so encouraged he went on to say but when i got my hand on that old duffers collar and lowered him to the ladder and the fire shot roaring out of the window after him too late to eat him and the crowd cheered the fireman and me i did feel warm about the waistcoat and for the first time this ever so long life seemed not quite ended i felt there was a little bit of good left that even a poor dunce like me could do and she could approveif she can look down and see me as i hope she can there there said mrs dodd tearfully i am disarmed but my darling i do not know what you are talking about stay why edward surelyi hopeyou were not the young gentleman in the paper the one that risked his life so nobly so foolishlyif it was you why mother didnt i tell you it was me said edward colouring no that you did not said julia was it was it oh do be quick and tell one there it was well it was ah i remember now that splendiferous account shut me up oh i say didnt the tiser pitch it strong not at all cried julia i believe every word and ever so much more mamma we have got a hero and here he is at breakfast with us like an ordinary mortal she rose suddenly with a burst of her old fire and fell upon him and kissed him and said earnestly how proud she was of him and so is mamma she may say what she likes proud of him ah that i am very proud and very unhappy heroes are my horror how often and how earnestly have i prayed that my son might not be brave like his father but stay quietly at home out of harms way here remonstrance ended the members of this family happy by nature though unhappy by accident all knew when to yield to each other unfortunately in proportion as all these excitements great and small died and her life became quiet and uniform the depth of julias wound showed itself more and more she never sang nor hummed as she used to do going about the house she never laughed she did burst out with fervid sentiments now and then but very rarely on the whole a pensive languor took the place of her lovely impetuosity tears rushed in a moment to her eyes with no visible cause she often stole to the window and looked all up and down the street and when she was out of doors she looked down every side street she passed and sometimes when a quick light step came behind them or she saw a tall young gentleman at a great distance her hand twitched her mothers arm or trembled on it and always when they came home she lingered a moment at the doorstep and looked all round before she went in at all these signs one half of mrs dodds heart used to boil with indignation and the other half melt with pity for she saw her daughter was looking for the wretch indeed mrs dodd began to fear she had done unwisely in ignoring the wretch julias thoughts dwelt on him none the less indeed all the more as it seemed so the topic interdicted by tacit consent bade fair to become a barrier between her and mrs dodd hitherto her bosom friend as well as her mother this was intolerable to poor mrs dodd and at last she said one day my darling do not be afraid of me rob me of your happy thoughts if you will but oh not of your sad ones julia began to cry directly oh no mamma she sobbed do not you encourage me in my folly i know i have thrown away my affections on one whoi shall never see him again shall i mamma oh to think i can say those words and yet go living on mrs dodd sighed and if you saw him would that mend the chain he has chosen to break i dont know but if i could only see him to part friends it is cruel to hate him now he has lost his sister and then i have got her message to give him and i want to ask him why he was afraid of me why he could not tell me he had altered his mind did he think i wanted to have him against his will oh mamma said she imploringly he seemed to love me he seemed all truth i am a poor unfortunate girl mrs dodd had only caresses to soothe her with she could not hold out any hopes one day julia asked her timidly if she might be a district visitor my dear friend was and advised me to be one too but i was wilful in those days and chose to visit by fits and starts and be independent i am humbled now a little may i mamma since she died every word of hers seems a law to me mrs dodd assented cordially as she would to anything else her wounded one had proposed this project brought julia into communication with the new curate and who should it prove to be but mr hurd at sight of him she turned white and red and the whole scene in the church came back to her but mr hurd showed considerable tact for so young a man he spoke to her in accents of deep respect but confined his remarks strictly to the matter in hand she told her mother when she got home and expressed her gratitude to mr hurd but said she wished they did not live in the same parish with him this feeling however wore off by degrees as her selfimposed duties brought her more and more into contact with him and showed her his good qualities as for mr hurd he saw and understood her vivid emotion at sight of him saw and pitied not without wonder that so beautiful a creature should have been jilted and from the first he marked his sense of alfreds conduct by showing her a profound and chivalrous respect which he did not bestow on other young ladies in his parish on the contrary he rather received homage from them than bestowed it byandbye he saw julia suppress if not hide her own sorrow and go sorehearted day by day to comfort the poor and afflicted he admired and almost venerated her for this he called often on mrs dodd and was welcome she concealed her address for the present from all her friends except dr sampson but mr hurd had discovered her and ladies do not snub the clergy moreover mr hurd was a gentleman and inclined to high church this she liked he was very goodlooking too and quiet in his manners above all he seemed to be doing her daughter good for julia and mr hurd had one great sentiment in common when the intimacy had continued some time on these easy terms mrs dodd saw that mr hurd was falling in love with julia and that sort of love warm but respectful which soon leads to marriage especially when the lover is a clergyman this was more than mrs dodd bargained for she did not want to part with her daughter and under other circumstances would have drawn in her horns but mr hurds undisguised homage gratified her maternal heart coming so soon after that great insult to her daughter and then she said to herself at any rate he will help me cure her of the wretch she was not easy in her mind though could not tell what would come of it all so she watched her daughters pensive face as only mothers watch and saw a little of the old peach bloom creeping back that was irresistible she let things go their own way and hoped for the best chapter xl the tenacity of a private lunatic asylum is unique a little push behind your back and you slide into one but to get out again is to scale a precipice with crumbling sides alfred luckier than many had twice nearly escaped yet now he was tighter in than ever his father at first meant to give him but a year or two of it and let him out on terms his spirit broken and julia married but his sisters death was fatal to him by mrs hardies settlement the portion of any child of hers dying a minor or intestate and childless was to go to the other children so now the prisoner had inherited his sisters ten thousand pounds and a good slice of his bereaved enemys and fathers income but this doubled his fathers bitternessthat he the unloved one should be enriched by the death of the adored oneand also tempted his cupidity and unfortunately shallow legislation conspired with that temptation for when an englishman sane or insane is once pushed behind his back into a madhouse those relatives who have hidden him from the public eye ie from the eye of justice can grab hold of his money behind his back as they certified away his wits behind his back and can administer it in the dark and embezzle it chanting but for us the dear deranged would waste it nor do the monstrous enactments which confer this unconstitutional power on subjects and shield its exercise from the light and safeguard of publicity affix any penalty to the abuse of that power if by one chance in a thousand detected in lunacy law extremes of intellect meet the british senator plays at satan and tempts human frailty and cupidity beyond what they are able to bear so behold a son at twentyone years of age devoted by a father to imprisonment for life but stop a minute the mad statutes which by the threefold temptation of facility obscurity and impurity insure the occasional incarceration and frequent detention of sane but moneyed men do provide though feebly for their bare liberation if perchance they should not yield to the genius loci and the natural effect of confinement plus anguish by going mad or dying the commissioners of lunacy had power to liberate alfred in spite of his relations and that power you know he had soberly but earnestly implored them to exercise after a delay that seemed as strange to him as postponing a hand to a drowning man he received an official letter from whitehall with bounding heart he broke the seal and devoured the contents they ran thus sirby order of the commissioners of lunacy i am directed to inform you that they are in the receipt of your letter of the th ultimo which will be laid before the board at their next meetingi am c alfred was bitterly disappointed at the small advance he had made however it was a great point to learn that his letters were allowed to go to the commissioners at all and would be attended to by degrees he waited and waited and struggled hard to possess his soul in patience at times his brain throbbed and his blood boiled and he longed to kill the remorseless kinless monsters who robbed him of his liberty his rights as a man and his julia but he knew this would not do that what they wanted was to gnaw his reason away and then who could disprove that he had always been mad now he felt that brooding on his wrong would infuriate him so he clenched his teeth and vowed a solemn vow that nothing should drive him mad by advice of a patient he wrote again to the commissioners begging for a special commission to inquire into his case and this done with rare stoicism selfdefence and wisdom in one so young he actually sat down to read hard for his first class now to do this he wanted the ethics politics and rhetoric of aristotle certain dialogues of plato the comedies of aristophanes the firstclass historians demosthenes lucretius a greek testament wheelers analysis prideaux horne and several books of reference sacred and profane but he could not get these books without dr wycherley and unfortunately he had cut that worthy dead in his own asylum the scornful dog had to eat wormwood pudding and humble pie he gulped these delicacies as he might and dr wycherley showed excellent qualities he entered into his maniacs studies with singular alacrity supplied him with several classics from his own shelves and borrowed the rest at the london library nor did his zeal stop there he offered to read an hour a day with him and owned it would afford him the keenest gratification to turn out an oxford first classman from his asylum this remark puzzled alfred and set him thinking it bore a subtle family resemblance to the observations he heard every day from the patients it was so oneeyed soon alfred became the doctors pet maniac they were often closeted together in high discourse and indeed discussed psychology metaphysics and moral philosophy with indefatigable zest long after common sense would have packed them both off to bed the donkeys in fact they got so thick that alfred thought it only fair to say one day mind doctor all these pleasant fruitful hours we spend together so sweetly will not prevent my indicting you for a conspiracy as soon as i get out it will rob the retribution of half its relish though ah my dear young friend and fellowstudent said the doctor blandly let us not sacrifice the delights of our profitable occupation of imbibing the sweets of intellectual intercourse to vague speculations as to our future destiny during the course of a long and not i trust altogether unprofitable career it has not unfrequently been my lot to find myself on the verge of being indicted sued assassinated hung yet here i sit as yet unimmolated on the altar of phrenetic vengeance this is ascribable to the fact that my friends and pupils always adopt a more favourable opinion of me long before i part with them and ere many days and this i divine by infallible indicia your cure will commence in earnest and in proportion as you progress to perfect restoration of the powers of judgment you will grow in suspicion of the fact of being under a delusion or rather i should say a very slight perversion and perturbation of the forces of your admirable intellect and a proper subject for temporary seclusion indeed this consciousness of insanity is the one diagnostic of sanity that never deceives me and on the other hand an obstinate persistence in the hypothesis of perfect rationality demonstrates the fact that insanity yet lingers in the convolutions and recesses of the brain and that it would not be humane as yet to cast the patient on a world in which he would inevitably be taken some ungenerous advantage of alfred ventured to inquire whether this was not rather paradoxical certainly said the ready doctor and paradoxicality is an indicial characteristic of truth in all matters beyond the comprehension of the vulgar that sounds rational said the maniac very drily one afternoon grinding hard for his degree he was invited downstairs to see two visitors at that word he found out how prison tries the nerves he trembled with hope and fear it was but for a moment he bathed his face and hands to compose himself made his toilet carefully and went into the drawingroom all on his guard there he found dr wycherley and two gentlemen one was an exphysician the other an exbarrister who had consented to resign feelessness and brieflessness for a snug l a year at whitehall after a momentary greeting they continued the conversation with dr wycherley and scarcely noticed alfred they were there pro forma a plausible lunatic had pestered the board and extorted a visit of ceremony alfreds blood boiled but he knew it must not boil over he contrived to throw a short pertinent remark in every now and then this being done politely told and at last dr eskell commissioner of lunacy smiled and turned to him allow me to put a few questions to you the more the better sir said alfred dr eskell then asked him to describe minutely and in order all he had done since seven oclock that day and he did it examined him in the multiplication table and he did it and while he was applying these oldfashioned tests wycherleys face wore an expression of pity that was truly comical now this dr eskell had an itch for the classics so he went on to say you have been a scholar i hear i am not old enough to be a scholar sir said alfred but i am a student well well now can you tell me what follows this line jusque datum sceleri canimus populuinque potentem why not at the moment oh surely you can said dr eskell ironically it is in a tolerably wellknown passage come try well ill try said alfred sneering secretly let me see mummummumpopulumque potentem in sua victrici conversum viscera dextra quite right now go on if you can alfred who was playing with his examiner all this time pretended to cudgel his brains then went on and warmed involuntarily with the lines cognatasque acies et rupto foedere regni certatum totis concussi viribus orbis in commune nefas infestis que obvia signis signa pares aquilas et pila minantia pilis he seems to have a good memory said the examiner rather taken aback oh that is nothing for him observed wycherley he has horace all by heart youd wonder and mouths out homers greek like thunder the great faculty of memory thus tested dr eskell proceeded to a greater judgment spirited lines those sir yes sir but surely rather tumid the whole forces of the shaken globe but little poets love big words i see you agree with horace that so great a work as an epic poem should open modestly with an invocation no sir said alfred i think that rather an arbitrary and peevish canon of friend horace the aeneid you know begins just as he says an epic ought not to begin and the aeneid is the greatest latin epic in the next place the use of modesty is to keep a man from writing an epic poem at all but if he will have that impudence why then he had better have the courage to plunge into the castalian stream like virgil and lucan not crawl in funking and holding on by the muses apronstring butexcuse mequorsum haec tam putida tendunt what have the latin poets to do with this moderns sanity or insanity mr abbott snorted contemptuously in support of the query but dr eskell smiled and said continue to answer me as intelligently and you may find it has a great deal to do with it alfred took this hint and said artfully mine was a thoughtless remark of course a gentleman of your experience can test the mind on any subject however trivial he added piteously still if you would but leave the poets who are all half crazy themselves and examine me in the philosophers of antiquity surely it would be a higher criterion dr wycherley explained in a patronising whisper he labours under an abnormal contempt for poetry dating from his attack previously to that he actually obtained a prize poem himself well doctor and after that am i wrong to despise poetry they might have comprehended this on paper but spoken it was too keen for them all three the visitors stared dr wycherley came to their aid you might examine my young friend for hours and not detect the one crevice in the brilliancy of his intellectual armour the maniac made a face as one that drinketh verjuice suddenly for pitys sake doctor dont be so inaccurate say a spot on the brilliancy or a crevice in the armour but not a crevice in the brilliancy my good friend here gentlemen deals in conjectural certificates and broken metaphors he dislocates more tropes to my sorrow than even his friend shakespeare whom he thinks a greater philosopher than aristotle and who calls the murder of an individual sleeper the murder of sleep confounding the concrete with the abstract and then talks of taking arms against a sea of troubles query a cork jacket and a flask of brandy well mr hardie said dr eskell rather feebly let me tell you those passages which so shock your peculiar notions are among the most applauded very likely sir retorted the maniac whose logic was up but applauded only in a nation where the floods clap their hands every sunday morning and we all pray for peace giving as our exquisite reason that we have got the god of hosts on our side in war mr abbott the other commissioner had endured all this chat with an air of weary indifference he now said to dr wycherley i wish to put to you a question or two in private alfred was horribly frightened this was the very dodge that had ruined him at silverton house oh no gentlemen he cried imploringly let me have fair play you have given me no secret audience then why give my accuser one i am charged with a single delusion for mercys sake go to the point at once and examine me on that head now you talk sense said mr abbott as if the previous topics had been chosen by alfred but that will excite him objected dr eskell it always does excite them it excites the insane but not the sane said alfred so there is another test you will observe whether it excites me then before they could interrupt him he glided on the supposed hallucination is this i strongly suspect my father a bankruptand therefore dishonestbanker of having somehow misappropriated a sum of fourteen thousand pounds which sum is known to have been brought from india by one captain dodd and has disappeared stop a minute said mr abbott who knows it besides you the whole family of the dodds they will show you his letter from india announcing his return with the money where do they live albion villa barkington mr abbott noted the address in his book and alfred mightily cheered and encouraged by this sensible act went on to describe the various indications which insufficient singly had by their united force driven him to his conclusion when he described davids appearance and words on his fathers lawn at night wycherley interrupted him quietly are you quite sure this was not a vision a phantom of the mind heated by your agitation and your suspicions dr eskell nodded assent knowing nothing about the matter pray doctor was i the only person who saw this vision inquired alfred slily i conclude so said wycherley with an admirable smile but why do you conclude so because you are one of those who reason in a circle of assumptions now it happens that captain dodd was seen and felt on that occasion by three persons besides myself name them said mr abbott sharply a policeman called reynolds another policeman whose name i dont know and miss julia dodd the policemen helped me lift captain dodd off the grass sir julia met us chose by and we four carried dr wycherheys phantom home together to albion villa mr abbott noted down all the names and then turned to dr wycherley what do you say to that i say it is a very important statement said the doctor blandly and that i am sure my young friend would not advance it unless he was firmly persuaded of its reality much obliged doctor and you would not contradict me so rashly in a matter i know all about and you know nothing about if it was not your fixed habit to found facts on theories instead of theories on facts there that is enough said mr abbott i have brought you both to an issue at last i shall send to barkington and examine the policemen and the dodds oh thank you sir cried alfred with emotion if you once apply genuine tests like that to my case i shall not be long in prison prison said wycherley reproachfully have you any complaint then to make of your treatment here inquired dr eskell no no sir said alfred warmly dr wycherley is the very soul of humanity here are no tortures no handcuffs nor leglocks no brutality no insects that murder sleepwithout offence to logic in my last asylum the attendants inflicted violence here they are only allowed to endure it and gentlemen i must tell you a noble trait in my enemy there nothing can make him angry with madmen their lies their groundless and narrow suspicions of him their deplorable ingratitude to him of which i see examples every day that rile me on his account all these things seem to glide off him baffled by the infinite kindness of his heart and the incomparable sweetness of his temper and he returns the duffers good for evil with scarcely an effort at this unexpected tribute the water stood in the doctors eyes it was no more than the truth but this was the first maniac he had met intelligent enough to see his good qualities clearly and express them eloquently in short continued alfred to be happy in his house all a man wants is to be insane but as i am not insane i am miserable no convict no galley slave is so wretched as i am gentlemen and what is my crime well well said dr eskell kindly i think it likely you will not be very long in confinement they then civilly dismissed him and on his departure asked dr wycherley his candid opinion dr wycherley said he was now nearly cured his ability to discuss his delusion without excitement was of itself a proof of that but in another month he would be better still the doctor concluded his remarks thus however gentlemen you have heard him now judge for yourselves whether anybody can be as clever as he is without the presence of more or less abnormal excitement of the organs of intelligence it was a bright day for alfred he saw he had made an excellent impression on the commissioners and as luck does not always come single after many vain attempts to get a letter posted to julia he found this very afternoon a nurse was going away next day he offered her a guinea and she agreed to post a letter oh the hapiness it was to the poor prisoner to write it and unburden his heart and tell his wrongs he kept his manhood for his enemies his tears fell on the paper he sent to his forlorn bride he had no misgivings of her truth he judged her by himself gave her credit for anxiety but not for doubt he concluded a long ardent tender letter by begging her to come and see him and if refused admission to publish his case in the newspapers and employ a lawyer to proceed against all the parties concerned in his detention day after day he waited for an answer to his letter none came then he began to be sore perplexed and torn with agonising doubts what if her mind was poisoned too what if she thought him mad what if some misfortune had befallen her what if she had believed him dead and her heart had broken hitherto he had seen his own trouble chiefly but now he began to think day and night on hers and though he ground on for his degree not to waste time and not to be driven mad yet it was almost superhuman labour sighs issued from his labouring breast while his hard indomitable brain laboured away all uphill at aristotles divisions and definitions on the seventh day the earliest the mad statute allowed the two commissioners returned and this time mr abbott took the lead and told him that the policeman reynolds had left the force and the dodds had left the town and were in london but their address not known at this alfred was much agitated she was alive and perhaps near him i have heard a good deal of your story said mr abbott and coupling it with what we have seen of you we think your relatives have treated you and a young lady of whom everybody speaks with respect god bless you for saying that god bless you treated you both i say with needless severity dr eskell then told him the result of the special commission now closed i believe you to be cured said he and mr abbott has some doubts whether you were ever positively insane we shall lay your case before the board at once and the board will write to the party who signed the order and propose to him to discharge you at once at this magnificent project alfreds countenance fell and he stared with astonishment what have you not the power to do me justice without soliciting injustice to help you the board has the power said dr eskell but for many reasons they exercise it with prudence and reserve besides it is only fair to those who have signed the order to give them the graceful office of liberating the patient it paves the way to reconciliation alfred sighed the commissioners to keep up his heart promised to send him copies of their correspondence with the person who had signed the order then said mr abbott kindly you will see your case is not being neglected the following precis though imperfect will give some idea of the correspondence the board wrote to thomas hardie letting him know the result of the special commission and requesting him to discharge his nephew thomas quaked richard smiled and advised thomas to take no notice by this a week was gained to injustice and lost to justice the board pointed out thomas hardies inadvertence in not answering no enclosed copy of it and pressed for a reply thomas quaked richard smiled thomas hardie to the board from what he had heard it would be premature to discharge alfred should prefer to wait a month or two board to alfred conveying this in other terms alfred to board warning them against this proposal to postpone justice was to refuse justice certainly for a time probably for ever the board to thomas hardie suggesting that if not released immediately alfred ought to have a trialie be allowed to go into the world with a keeper alfred to the board begging that dr sampson an honest independent physician might be allowed to visit him and report to them the board to alfred declining this for the present as unadvisable they being in correspondence with the person who had signed the orderwith a view to his liberation t hardie to the board shuffling and requesting time to make further inquiries the board suggesting there should be some reasonable limit to delay t hardie asking for a month to see about it the board suggesting a week alfred hardie asking permission to be visited by a solicitor with a view to protection of his liberty and property the board declining this pending their correspondence with other parties but asking him for the names and addresses of all his trustees thomas hardie informing the board he had now learned alfred had threatened to kill his father as soon as ever he should get out and leaving the board to discharge him on their own responsibility if they chose after this warning but declining peremptorily to do so himself the board by advice of mr abbott to alfreds trustees warning them against any alienation of alfreds money under the notion that he was legally a lunatic and saying that a public inquiry appeared inevitable owing to mr t hardies unwillingness to enter into their views to alfred inquiring whether he wished to encounter the expense of chancery proceedings to establish his sanity alfred to the board imploring them to use their powers and discharge him without further delay and assuring them he meditated no violence on his liberation but should proceed against all parties under legal advice the board to t hardie warning him that he must in future pay alfreds maintenance in asylum out of his own pocket and pressing him either to discharge the young man or else to apply to the lord chancellor for a commission de lunatico inquirendo and enclosing copy of a letter from wycherley saying the patient was harmless t hardie respectfully declining to do either but reminding the commissioners that the matter could be thrown into chancery without his consent only the expense which would be tremendous would fall on the lunatics estate which might hereafter be regretted by the party himself he concluded by promising to come to town and visit alfred with his family physician and write further in a week having thus thrown dust in the eyes of the board thomas hardie and richard consulted with a notoriously unscrupulous madhouse keeper in the suburbs of london and effected a masterstroke whereof anon the correspondence had already occupied three months and kept alfred in a fever of the mind of all the maddening things with which he had been harassed by the pretended curers of insanity this tried him hardest to see a dozen honest gentlemen wishing to do justice able to do justice by one manly stroke of the pen yet forego their vantageground and descend to coax an able rogue to do their duty and undo his own interest and rascality to see a strong cause turned into a weak one by the timidity of champions clad by law in complete steel and a rotten cause against which law and power as well as truth justice and common sense had now declared turned into a strong one by the pluck and cunning of his one unarmed enemy the ancients feigned that the ingenious gods tortured tantalus in hell by everpresent thirst and water flowing to just the outside of his lips a briton can thirst for liberty as hard as tantalus or hunted deer can thirst for cooling springs and this soulgnawing correspondence brought liberty and citizenhood and love and happiness to the lips of alfreds burning pining aching heart again and again and again then carried them away from him in mockery oh the sickening anguish of hope deferred and deferred the hell it is in suing long to bide but indeed his hopes began to sicken for good when he found that the board would not allow any honest independent physician to visit him or any solicitor to see him at first indeed they refused it because mr thomas hardie was going to let him out but when t hardie would not move at their request then on a fresh application they refused it giving as their reason that they had already refused it yet in so keen a battle he would not throw away a chance so he determined to win dr wycherley altogether by hook or by crook and get a certificate of sanity from him now a single white lie he knew would do the trick he had only to say that hamlet was mad and hamlet was mad is easily said dr wycherley was a collector of mad people and collectors are always amateurs and very seldom connoisseurs his turn of mind cooperating with his interests led him to put down any man a lunatic whose intellect was manifestly superior to his own alfred hardie and one or two more contemporaries had suffered by this humour of the good doctors nor did the dead escape him entirely pascal according to wycherley was a madman with an illusion about a precipice john howard a moral lunatic in whom the affections were reversed saul a moping maniac with homicidal paroxysms and nocturnal visions paul an incoherent lunatic who in his writings flies off at a tangent and who admits having once been the victim of a photopsic illusion in broad daylight nebuchadnezzar a lycanthropical lunatic joan of arc a theomaniac bobby burton and oliver cromwell melancholy maniacs napoleon an ambitious maniac in whom the sense of impossibility became gradually extinguished by visceral and cerebral derangement porson an oinomaniac luther a phrenetic patient of the old demoniac breed alluded to by shakespeare one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman but without intending any disrespect to any of these gentlemen he assigned the golden crown of insanity to hamlet to be sure this character tells his friends in the play he shall feign insanity and swears them not to reveal the reason and after this hint to his friends and the pit it is notorious he was not written for readers he keeps his word and does it as cleverly as if his name was david or brutus instead of hamlet indeed like edgar he rather overdoes it and so puzzles his enemies in the play and certain german criticasters and english mad doctors in the closet and does not puzzle his bosom friend in the play one bit nor the pit for whom he was created add to this his sensibility and his kindness to others and his eloquent grief at the heartrending situation which his fathers and mothers son was placed in and had brains to realise though his psychological critics it seems have not and add to all that the prodigious extent of his mind his keen observation his deep reflection his brilliant fancy united for once in a way with the great academic or judicial intellect that looks down and sees all the sides of everythingand what can this rare intellectual compound be wycherley decided the question hamlet was too much greater in the world of mind than s t coleridge and his german criticasters too much higher deeper and broader than esquirol pinel sauze haslam munro pagan wigan prichard romberg wycherley and such small deer to be anything less than a madman now in their midnight discussions dr wycherley more than once alluded to the insanity of hamlet and offered proofs but alfred declined the subject as too puerile a man must exist before he can be insane said the oxonian philosopher severe in youthful gravity but when he found that dr wycherley had he lived in denmark at the time would have conferred cannily with hamlets uncle removed that worthy relatives disbelief in hamlets insanity and signed the young gentleman away behind his back into a lunatic asylum alfred began to sympathise with this posthumous victim of psychological science i believe the bloke was no madder than i am said he he got the play studied it afresh compared the fiction with the legend compared hamlet humbugging his enemies and their tool ophelia with hamlet opening his real mind to himself or his horatio the very next moment contrasted the real madness the author has portrayed in the plays of hamlet and lear by the side of these extravagant imitations to save if possible even dunces and dreamers and criticasters from being taken in by the latter and at their next seance pitched into the doctors pet chimera and what with logic fact ridicule and the authors lines knocked it to atoms now in their midnight discussions dr wycherley had always handled the question of alfred hardies sanity or insanity with a philosophical coolness the young man admired and found it hard to emulate but this philosophic calmness deserted him the moment hamlets insanity was disputed and the harder he was pressed the angrier the louder the more confused the psychological physician became and presently he got furious burst out of the antispasmodic or roundabout style and called alfred a dd ungrateful insolent puppy and went stamping about the room and finally to the young mans horror fell down in a fit of an epileptic character grinding his teeth and foaming at the mouth alfred was filled with regret and though alarmed had the presence of mind not to call for assistance the fit was a very mild one in reality though horrible to look at the doctor came to and asked feebly for wine alfred got it him and the doctor with a mixture of cunning and alarm in his eye said he had fainted away or nearly alfred assented coaxingly and looked sheepish after this he took care never to libel hamlets intellect again by denying his insanity for he was now convinced of what he had long half suspected that the doctor had a bee in his own bonnet and alfred had studied true insanity all this time and knew how inhumane it is to oppose a monomaniacs foible it only infuriates and worries him no power can convince him but now he resolved to play on the doctors foible it went against his conscience but the temptation was so strong he came to him with a hangdog air doctor said he i have been thinking over your arguments and i capitulate if hamlet ever existed he was as mad as a march hare and he blushed at this his first quibble dr wycherley beamed with satisfaction my young friend this gives me sincere pleasure not on my account but on your own there goes one of your illusions then now tell methe l have you calmly reconsidered that too alfred hung his head and looked guiltier and guiltier why said he that never amounted to anything more than a strong suspicion it has long ceased to occupy my mind in excess however should i ever be so fortunate as to recover my liberty i have no objection to collect the evidence about it pro and con and then make you the judge instead of myself this he delivered with an admirable appearance of indifference very well sir said the doctor drily then now i have a piece of good news for you oh doctor what is that your cure is complete that is all you are now a sane man as sane as i am alfred was a little disappointed at this piece of news but recovering himself asked him to certify that and let him send the certificate to the board dr wycherley said he would with pleasure ill bring it to you when i make my round said he alfred retired triumphant and went in at plato with a good heart in about an hour dr wycherley paid him the promised visit but what may not an hour bring forth he came with mortification and regret in his face to tell alfred that an order of transfer had been signed by the proper parties and countersigned by two commissioners and he was to go to dr wolfs asylum that day alfred groaned i knew my father would outwit my feeble friends somehow or other said he what is his game do you know i suppose to obtain a delay and meantime get you into an asylum where they will tell the commissioners you are worse again and perhaps do something to make their words good dr wolf between ourselves will say or do almost anything for money and his asylum is conducted on the old system though he pretends not my dear friend said alfred will you do me a favour how could i deny you anything at this sorrowful moment here is an advertisement i want inserted in the morning advertiser oh i cant do that i fear look at it before you break my heart by refusing me dr wycherley looked at it and said it was innocent being unintelligible and he would insert it himself three insertions dear doctor said alfred here is the money the doctor then told him sorrowfully he must pack up his thingsdr wolfs keepers were waiting for him the moment of parting came then alfred solemnly forgave dr wycherley for signing away his wits and thanked him for all his kindness and humanity we shall never meet again i fear said he i feel a weight of foreboding here about my heart i never felt before yet my trials have been many and great i think the end is at hand dr wolfs keepers received him and their first act was to handcuff him the cold steel struck into him deeper than his wrist and reminded him of silverton grove he could not suppress a shudder the carriage rolled all through london with him he saw the parks with autumns brown and golden tints he saw the people some rich some poor but none of them prisoners he saw a little girl all rags oh if i could be as ragged as you are he said and free at last they reached drayton housea huge old mansion fortified into a jail his handcuffs were whipped off in the yard he was ushered into a large gloomy drawingroom dr wolf soon came to him and they measured each other by the eye like two prizefighters dr wolfs eye fell under alfreds and the latter felt he was capable of much foul play he was one of the old bullnecked breed and contained the bulldog and the spaniel in his single nature i hope you will be comfortable here sir said he doggedly i will try sir the firstclass patients dine in half an hour i will be ready sir full dress in the evening there are several ladies alfred assented by a bow dr wolf rang a bell and told a servant to show mr hardie his room he had just time to make his toilet when the bell rang for dinner as he went down a nurse met him held up something white to him as she came lowered it quickly and dropped it at his feet in passing it was a billetdoux it was twisted into a pretty shape scented and addressed to mr hardie in a delicate italian hand and in that pale ink which seems to reflect the charming timidity of the fair who use it he wondered carried it into a recess then opened it and read it it contained but this one line drink nothing but water at dinner these words in that delicate italian hand sent a chill through alfred what on earth was all this was he to be poisoned was his life aimed at now instead of his reason what was this mysterious drama prepared for him the very moment he set his foot in the place perhaps before a poisoner and a friend both strangers he went down to dinner and contrived to examine every lady and gentleman at the table but they were all strangers presently a servant filled his glass with beer he looked and saw it was poured from a small jug holding only his portion alfred took his ring off his finger and holding the glass up dropped his ring in what is that for inquired one or two oh my ring has a peculiar virtue it tells me what is good for me ah what do i see my ruby changes colour fetch me a clean glass and he filled it with water from a caraffe no sir leave the beer ill analyse it in my room after dinner im a chemist dr wolf changed colour and was ill at ease here was a bold and ugly customer however he said nothing and felt sure his morphia could not be detected in beer by any decomposer but the stomach still he was rather mystified in the evening alfred came dressed into the drawingroom and found several gentlemen and ladies there one of the ladies seemed to attract the lions share of male homage her back was turned to alfred but it was a beautiful back with great magnificent neck and shoulders and a skin like satin she was tall but rounded and symmetrical had a massive but long and shapely white arm and perfect hand and masses of thick black hair sat on her grand white poll like a raven on a marble pillar it was not easy to get near her for the mad gentlemen were fawning on her all round like queen elizabeths courtiers however dr wolf seeing alfred standing alone said let me introduce you and took him round to her the courtiers fell back a little the lady turned her stately head and her dark eyes ran lightly all over alfred in a moment he bowed and blushed like a girl she curtseyed composedly and without a symptom of recognitiondeep water runs stilland dr wolf introduced them ceremoniously mr hardiemrs archbold chapter xli on alfreds leaving silverton mrs archbold was prostrated it was a stunning blow to her young passion and left her weary desolate but she was too strong to lie helpless under disappointed longings two days she sat stupefied with the heartache after that she bustled about her work in a fervour of halfcrazy restlessness and ungovernable irritability quenched at times by fits of weeping as she wept apart but raged and tyrannised in public she soon made silverton house silverton oven especially to those who had the luck to be of her sex then baker timidly remonstrated at the first word she snapped him up and said a change would be good for both of them he apologised in vain that very day she closed by letter with dr wolf who had often invited her to be his matron her motive half hidden from herself was to be anywhere near her favourite installed at drayton house she waited some days and coquetted womanlike with her own desires then dressed neatly but soberly and called at dr wycherleys sent in a note explaining who she was with a bit of soft sawder and asked to see alfred she was politely but peremptorily refused she felt this rebuff bitterly she went home stung and tingling to the core but bitters wholesome be offended pride now allied with strong good sense to wither a wild affection and as it was no longer fed by the presence of its object her wound healed all but the occasional dull throbbing that precedes a perfect cure at this stage of her convalescence dr wolf told her in an offhand way that mr hardie a patient of doubtful insanity was coming to his asylum to be kept there by hook or by crook she was entirely in wolfs confidence and he talked of these things to her in english the impenetrable creature assented outwardly with no sign of emotion whatever but one flash of the eye and one heave of the bosom swiftly suppressed she waited calmly and patiently till she was alone then yielded to joy and triumph they seemed to leap inside her but this very thing alarmed her better for me never to see him again she thought his power over me is too terrible ah goodbye to the peace and comfort i have been building up he will scatter them to the winds he has she tried not to think of him too much and while she was so struggling wolf let out that alfred was to have morphia at dinner the first daymorphia the accursed drug with which these dark men in these dark places coax the reason away out of the head by degrees or with a potent dose stupefy the victim then act surprise alarm and make his stupor the ground for applying medical treatment to the doomed wretch edith archbold knew the game and at the word morphia pity and passion rose in her bosom irresistible she smiled in dr wolfs face and hated him and secretly girt herself up to baffle him and protect alfreds reason and win his heart through his gratitude she received him as i have related to throw dust in dr wolfs eyes but she acted so admirably that some went into alfreds ah thought he she is angry with herself for her amorous folly and with the justice of her sex she means to spite poor me for it he sighed for he felt her hostility would be fatal to him to give her no fresh offence he fell into her manner and treated her with a world of distant respect then again who else but she could have warned him against poison then again if so why look so cold and stern at him he cast one or two wistful glances at her but the artful woman of thirty was impenetrable in public to the candid man of twentyone even her passion could not put them on an equality that night he could not sleep he lay wondering what would be the next foul practice and how he should parry it he wrote next morning to the commissioners that two of their number unacquainted with the previous proceedings of the board had been surprised into endorsing an order of transfer to an asylum bearing a very inferior character to dr wycherleys the object of this was clearly foul play accordingly dr wolf had already tried to poison his reason by drugging his beer at dinner he added that dr wycherley had now signed a certificate of his sanity and implored the board to inspect it and discharge him at once or else let a solicitor visit him at once and take the requisite steps towards a public inquiry while waiting anxiously for the answer it cost him all his philosophy to keep his heart from eating itself but he fought the good fight of reason he invited the confidences of the quieter mad people and established a little court and heard their grievances and by impartial decisions and good humour won the regard of the moderate patients and of the attendants all but three rooke the head keeper a morose burly ruffian hayes a bilious subordinate rookes shadow and vulcan a huge mastiff that would let nobody but rooke touch him he was as big as a large calf and formidable as a small lion though nearly toothless with age he was let loose in the yard at night and was an element in the restraint system many a patient would have tried to escape but for vulcan he was also an invaluable howler at night and so cooperated with dr wolfs bugs and fleas to avert sleep that vile foe to insanity and all our diseases private asylums included alfred treated mrs archbold with a distant respect that tried her hard but that able woman wore sweetness and unobtrusive kindness and bided her time in drayton house the keeperesses eclipsed the keepers in cruelty to the poorer patients no men except dr wolf and his assistant had a passkey into their department so there was nobody they could deceive nobody they held worth the trouble in the absence of male critics they showed their real selves and how wise it is to trust that gentle sex in the dark with irresponsible power over females with unflagging patience they applied the hourly torture of petty insolence needless humiliation unreasonable refusals to the poor madwomen bored them with the poisoned gimlet and made their hearts bleeding pincushions but minute cruelty and wild caprice were not enough for them though these never tired nor rested they must vilify them too with degrading and savage names billingsgate might have gone to school to drayton house inter alia they seemed in love with a term that othello hit upon only they used it not once but fifty times a day and struck decent women with it on the face like a scorpion whip and then the scalding tears were sure to run in torrents down their silly honest burning cheeks but this was not all they had got a large tank in a flagged room nominally for cleanliness and cure but really for bane and torture for the least offence or out of mere wantonness they would drag a patient stark naked across the yard and thrust her bodily under water again and again keeping her down till almost gone with suffocation and dismissing her more dead than alive with obscene and insulting comments ringing in her ears to get warm again in the cold this my ladies called tanking in the ordinary morning ablutions they tanked without suffocating but the immersion of the whole body in cold water was of itself a severe trial to those numerous patients in whom the circulation was weak and as medical treatment hurtful and even dangerous finally these keeperesses with diabolical insolence and cruelty would bathe twenty patients in this tank and then make them drink that foul water for their meals the dark places of the land are full of horrible cruelty one day they tanked so savagely that nurse eliza after months of sickly disapproval came to the new redresser of grievances and told what was he to do he seized the only chance of redress he ran panting with indignation to mrs archbold and blushing high said imploringly mrs archbold you used to be kindhearted and could say no more for something rising in his throat mrs archbold smiled encouragingly on him and said softly i am the same i always wasto you alfred oh thank you then pray send for nurse eliza and hear the cruelties that are being done to the patients within a yard of us you had better tell me yourself if you want me to pay any attention i cant i dont know how to speak to a lady of such things as are done here the brutes the cowardly shedevils oh how i should like to kill them mrs archbold laughed a little at his enthusiasm fancy caring so what was done to a pack of women and sent for nurse eliza she came and being questioned told mrs archbold more than she had alfred and maam said she whimpering they have just been tanking one they had no business to touch it is mrs dale her that is so close on her confinement they tanked her cruel they did and kept her under water till she was nigh gone i came away i couldnt stand it alfred was walking about in a fury and nurse eliza in making this last revolting communication lowered her voice for him not to hear but his senses were quick i think he heard for he turned and came quickly to them mrs archbold you are strong and bravefor a woman oh do go in to them and take them by the throat and shake the life out of them the merciless cowardly beasts oh that i could be a woman for an hour or they could be men id soon have my foot on some of the wretches mrs archbold acted ignition come with me both of you she said and they were soon in the female department up came keeperesses directly smirking and curtseying to her and pretending not to look at adonis which of you nurses tanked mrs dale said she sternly twasnt i maam twasnt i oh fie said eliza to one you know you were at the head of it she pointed out two as the leaders the archbold instantly had them seized by the otherswho with treachery equal to their cowardice turned eagerly against their fellowculprits to make friends with powerand inviting all the sensible maniacs who had been tanked to assist or inspect she bared her own statuesque arms and ably aided soon plunged the offenders screaming crying and whining like spaniel bitches whipped under the dirty water they swallowed some and appreciated their own acts then she forced them to walk twice round the yard with their wet clothes clinging to them hooted by the late victims there said alfred let that teach you men will not own hyaenas in petticoats for women poor alfred took all the credit of this performance but in fact when the archbold invited him to bear a hand he showed the white feather i wont touch the blackguardesses said he haughtily turning it off on the score of contempt you give it them again again brava mosaic retribution completed mrs archbold told the nurses if ever tanking recurred she would bundle the whole female staff into the street and then have them indicted by the commissioners these virtuous acts did edith archbold for love for a young man whether mad women or sane women pregnant or the reverse were tanked or not she cared at heart no more than whether sheep were washed or no in ettricks distant dale she was retiring with a tender look at alfred and her pulse secretly unaccelerated by sheepwashing of shewolves when her grateful favourite appealed to her again dear mrs archbold shall we punish and not comfort this poor mrs dale the archbold could have boxed his ears dear boy she murmured tenderly you teach us all our duty she visited the tanked one found her in a cold room after it shivering like ague and her teeth chattering mrs archbold had her to the fire and got her warm clothes and a pint of wine and probably saved her life and her childsfor love of a young man why i think mrs dale would otherwise have left this shifting scene mrs carey the last woman in her condition they tanked and then turned into a flagged cell that only wanted one frog of a grotto was found soon after moribund on which they bundled her out of the asylum to die she did die next day at home but murdered by the asylum and they told the commissioners she died through her friends taking her away from the asylum too soon the commissioners had nothing to do but believe this and did believe it inspectors who visit a temple of darkness lies cunning and hypocrisy four times a year know mighty little of what goes on there the odd three hundred and sixtyone days five hours fortyeight minutes and fiftyseven seconds arithmetic of my boyhood i hear the world revolves some minutes quicker now now alfred said mrs archbold i cant be everywhere or know everything so you come to me when anything grieves you and let me be the agent of your humanity she said this so charmingly he was surprised into kissing her fair hand then blushed and thanked her warmly thus she established a chain between them when he let too long elapse without appealing to her she would ask his advice about the welfare of this or that patient and so she cajoled him by the two foibles she had discerned in himhis vanity and his humanity besides alfred there were two patients in drayton house who had never been insane a young man and an old woman of whom anon there were also three ladies and one gentleman who had been deranged but had recovered years ago this little incident recovery is followed in a public asylum by instant discharge but in a private one money not sanity is apt to settle the question of egress the gentlemans case was scarce credible in the nineteenth century years ago being undeniably cracked he had done what dr wycherley told alfred was a sure sign of sanity ie he had declared himself insane and had even been so reasonable as to sign his own order and certificates and so imprison himself illegally but with perfect ease no remonstrance against that illegality from the guardians of the law when he got what plain men call sane he naturally wanted to be free and happening to remember he alone had signed the order of imprisonment and the imaginary doctors certificates he claimed his discharge from illegal confinement answer first obtain a legal order for your discharge on this he signed an order for his discharge that is not a legal orderit is as legal as the order on which i am here granted but legally or not the asylum has got you the open air has not got you possession is ninetynine points of lunacy law die your own illegal prisoner and let your kinsfolk eat your land and drink your consols and bury you in a paupers shroud all that alfred could do for these victims was to promise to try and get them out some day dv but there was a weakminded youth francis beverley who had the honour to be under the protection of the lord chancellor now a lunatic or a softy protected by that functionary is literally a lamb protected by a wolf and that wolf ex officio the cruellest cunningest old mangler and fleecer of innocents in christendom chancery lunatics are the richest class yet numbers of them are flung among pauper and even criminal lunatics at a few pounds a year while their committees bag fourfifths of the money that has been assigned to keep the patient in comfort unfortunately the protection of the chancellor extends to life and reason as well as fleece with the following result in public asylums about forty per cent are said to be cured in private ones twentyfive per cent at least most of them poorish of chancery lunatics not five per cent finally onethird of all the chancery lunatics do every six years exchange the living tombs they are fleeced and bullied in for dead tombs where they rest and go from the sham protection of the lord chancellor of england to the real protection of their creator and their judge these statistics have been long before the world and are dead figures to the skimmer of things but tell a dark tale to the reader of things so dark that i pray heaven to protect me and all other weak inoffensive persons from the protection of my lord chancellor in this kind beverley was so unfortunate as to exist before the date of the above petition and suffered the consequences he was an aristocrat by birth noble on both sides of his house and unluckily had money but for that he would have been a labouring man and free my lord protector committed him with six hundred pounds a year maintenance money to the care of his committee the honourable fynes beverley now this corporate yet honourable individual to whom something was committed and so chancery lane called him in its own sweet french the thing committed was a gentleman of birth breeding and intelligence he undertook to take care of his simple cousin and what he did take care of was himself the subletting swindle i the honourable fynes beverley anglofrench committee or crown tenant sublet soft francis for l a year pocketed l and washed his hands of frank mr heselden the subtenant sublet the softy of high degree for l pocketed the surplus and washed his hands of him the l man sublet him to dr wolf at l a year pouched the surplus and washed his hands of him and now what on earth was left for poor dr wolf to do could he subembezzle a highlanders breeks could he subtract more than her skin from off the singed cat could he peel the core of a rotten apple could he pare a grated cheese rind could he flay a skinned flint could he fleece a hog after satan had shaved it as clean as a bantams egg let no man dare to limit genius least of all the genius of extortion dr wolf screwed comparatively more out of young frank than did any of the preceding screws he turned him into a servant of all work and half starved him money profit l out of the l or threefourths whereas the others had only bagged onehalf but by this means he got a good servant without wages and on half a servants food clearing l and l in these two items victim of our great national vice and foible vicariousness this scion of a noble house protected in theory by the crown vicariously subprotected by the chancellor subvicariously subsham protected by his kin was really flung unprotected into the fleece market and might be seenat the end of the long chain of subs pros vices locos shams shuffles swindles and liesshaking the carpets making the beds carrying the water sweeping the rooms and scouring the sordid vessels of thirty patients in drayton house not one of whom was his equal either in birth or wealth and of four menials who were all his masters and hard ones his work was always doing never done he was not the least mad nor bad but merely of feeble intellect all round fifty thousand gentlemens families would have been glad of him at l a year and made a son and a brother of him but he was under the vicarious protection of the lord chancellor thin halfstarved threadbare out at elbows the universal butt scoffed at by the very lunatics and especially ill treated by the attendants whose work he did gratis he was sworn at jeered insulted cuffed and even kicked every day of his hard hard life and yet he was a gentleman though a soft one his hands his features his carriage his address had all an indefinable stamp of race how had it outlived such crushing degrading usage i dont know how does a daisy survive the iron roller alfred soon found him out and to everybodys amazement especially franks remonstrated gently but resolutely and eloquently and soon convinced the majority sane and insane that a creature so meek and useful merited special kindness not cruelty one keeper the robin alias tom wales an exprize fighter was a warm convert to this view among the maniacs only one held out and said contemptuously he couldnt see it well said alfred lay a finger on him after this and ill lay a hand on you and aid your intellectual vision rooke and hayes treated remonstrance with open and galling contempt yet the tide of opinion changed so they did not care to defy it openly but they bullied poor beverley now and then on the sly and he never told he was too inoffensive for this world but one day as alfred was sitting with his door ajar writing a letter of earnest expostulation to the commissioners who had left his first unanswered he heard hayes at the head of the stairs call roughly frank frank sir replied the soft little voice of young beverley come be quick young shaver im coming sir and up ran beverley here take this tray downstairs yes sir stop theres a bit of bread for you and hayes chucked him a crust as one throws it to another mans dog thank you sir said mr beverley stooping down for it and being habitually as hungry as a ratcatchers tyke took an eager bite in that position how dare you eat it there said hayes brutally take it to your own crib come mizzle and with that lent him a contemptuous kick behind which owing to his position sent him off his balance flat on the tray a glass broke under him poor young mr beverley uttered a cry of dismay for he knew hayes would not own himself the cause hayes cursed him for an awkward idiot and the oath went off into a howl for alfred ran out at him brimful of moses and with a savage kick in the back and blow on the neck administered simultaneously hurled him head foremost down the stairs alighting on the seventh step he turned a somersault and bounded like a ball on to the landing below and there lay stupefied he picked himself up by slow degrees and glared round with speechless awe and amazement up at the human thunderbolt that had shot out on him and sent him flying like a feather he shook his fist and limped silently away all bruises and curses to tell rooke and concert vengeance alfred trembling still with ire took beverley to his room the boy was as white as a sheet and encouraged him and made him wash properly brushed his hair dressed him in a decent tweed suit he had outgrown and taking him under his arm and walking with his own nose haughtily in the air paraded him up and down the asylum to show them all the best man in the house respected the poor soft gentleman ah what a grand thing it is to be young beverley clung to his protector too much like a girl but walked gracefully and kept step and every now and then looked up at alfred with a loving adoration that was sweet yet sad to see alfred marched him to mrs archbold and told his tale for he knew hayes would misrepresent it and get him into trouble she smiled on the pair gently deplored her favourites impetuosity entreated him not to go fighting with that great monster rooke and charmed him by saying well and frank is a gentleman when he is dressed like one isnt he said alfred eagerly and whose fault is it he is not always dressed like one whose fault that heres an earls nephew boots in hell not yours alfred nor mine was the honeyed reply in vain did mr hayes prefer his complaint to dr wolf the archbold had been before him and the answer was served you right these and many other good deeds did alfred hardie in drayton house but as the days rolled on and no answer came from the commissioners his own anxiety grief and dismay left him less and less able to sympathise with the material but smaller wrongs around him he became silent dejected at last he came to mrs archbold and said sternly his letters to the commissioners were intercepted i cant believe that said she it is against the law so it was but law and custom are two i am sure of it said he and may the eternal curse of heaven light on the cowardly traitor and miscreant who has done it and he stalked gloomily away when he left her she sighed at this imprecation from his lips but did not repent i cant part with him she said despairingly and if i did not stop his poor dear letters wolf would and the amorous crocodile shed a tear and persisted in her doublefaced course byandby when she saw him getting thinner and paler and his bright face downcast and inexpressibly sad she shared his misery ay shed scalding tears for him yet could not give him up for her will was as strong as the rest of her was supple and hers was hot love but not true love like julias perhaps a very subtle observer seeing this man and woman wax pale and spiritless together in one house might have divined her secret dr wolf then was no such observer for she made him believe she had a rising penchant for him he really had a strong one for her while alfreds visible misery pulled at her heartstrings and sometimes irritated sometimes melted her came curious complications one of which requires preface mrs dodd then was not the wife to trust blindly where her poor husband was concerned she bribed so well that a keeperess in davids first asylum told her david had been harshly used by an attendant she instantly got eve dodd to take him away and transfer him to a small asylum nearer london and kept by a mrs ellis women are not cruel to men said the sagacious lucy dodd but alas if women are not cruel where sex comes in and mimics that wider sentiment humanity women are deadly economical largely gifted with that household virtue mrs ellis kept too few servants and sure consequence in a madhouse too many straitjackets hobbles muffs leglocks bodybelts c c hence half her patients were frequently kept out of harms way by cruel restraints administered not out of hearty cruelty but female parsimony mrs and miss dodd invaded the house one day when the fair economist was out and found seven patients out of the twelve kept out of mischief thus one in a restraint chair two hobbled like asses two chained like dogs and two in straightwaistcoats and fastened to beds by webbing and straps amongst the latter david though quiet as a lamb mrs dodd cried over him as if her heart would break and made miss dodd shift him to a large asylum where i believe he was very well used but here those dreadful newspapers interfered a prying into sweet secluded spots they diversified mrs dodds breakfast by informing her that the doctor of this asylum had just killed a patient the mode of execution bloodless and sure as became fair science it was a man between sixty and seventy an age at which the heart can seldom stand very much shocking or lowering especially where the brain is diseased so they placed him in a showerbath narrow enough to impede respiration without the falling water which of necessity drives out air in short a vertical box with holes all round the top here the doctor ordered him a cold showerbath of unparalleled duration half an hour to be followed by an unprecedented dose of tartar emetic this doublebarrelled order given the doctor went away formula the water was down to fortyfive degrees fahrenheit half an hours showerbath at that temperature in a roomy bath would kill the youngest and strongest man in her majestys dominions for eightandtwenty mortal minutes the poor old man stood in this vertical coffin under this cold cascade six hundred gallons of icy water were in that his last hour his last halfhour discharged upon his devoted head and doomed body he had to be helped away from this deathtorrent he had walked into in high spirits poor soul even this change awakened no misgivings no remorse though you or i or any man or woman picked at hazard out of the streets would at once have seen that he was dying he was duly dozed by the fire with four spoonfuls of antimonial tinctureto mak sicker but even the destructive art of healing cannot slay the slain the old man cheated the emetic for before it could hurt him he died of the bath and his body told its own sad tale to use the words of a medical eyewitness it was a piece of alabaster the deathtorrent had driven the whole circulation from the surface this mode of execution is well known in the united states they settle refractory prisoners with it periodically but half an hour is not needed twenty minutes will do the trick harpers weekly a year or two ago contained an admirable woodcut of a negros execution by water in this remarkable picture you see the poor darkie seated powerless howling and panting his life away under the deadly cascade and there stands the stolid turnkey erect formal stiff as a ramrod pulling the deadly string with a sort of drill exercise air and no more compunction nor reflection than if he himself was a machine constructed to pull strings or triggers on his own string being pulled by butcher or fool a picture well studied and so worth study mrs dodd was terrified and in spite of sampsons assurance that this was the asylum of all others they would not settle another patient in until the matter should have blown over got eve dodd to write to dr wolf and offer l a year if he would take david at once and treat him with especial consideration he showed this letter triumphantly to mrs archbold and she blinded for a moment by feeling dissuaded him from receiving captain dodd he stared at her what turn away a couple of thousand pounds but they will come to visit him and perhaps see him oh that can be managed you must be on your guard and ill warn rooke i cant turn away money on a chance one day alfred found himself locked into his room this was unusual for though they called him a lunatic in words they called him sane by all their acts he half suspected that the commissioners were in the house had he known who really was in the house he would have beaten himself to pieces against the door at dinner there was a new patient very mild and silent with a beautiful large brown eye like some gentle animals alfred was very much struck with this eye and contrived to say a kind word to him after dinner finding himself addressed by a gentleman the new comer handled his forelock and made a sea scrape and announced himself as william thompson he added with simple pride able seaman then touching his forelock again just come aboard your honour after this which came off glibly he was anything but communicative however alfred contrived to extract from him that he was rather glad to leave his last ship on account of having been constantly impeded there in his duties by a set of lubbers that clung round him and kept him on deck whenever the first lieutenant ordered him into the top the very next day pacing sadly the dull gravel of his prison yard alfred heard a row and there was the able seaman struggling with the robin and two other keepers he wanted to go to his duties in the foretop to wit the fork of a high elmtree in the courtyard alfred had half a mind not to interfere who cares for my misery he said but his better nature prevailed and he told the robin he was sure going up imaginary rigging would do thompson more good than harm on this the men reluctantly gave him a trial and he went up the tree with wonderful strength and agility but evident caution still alfred quaked when he crossed his thighs tight over a limb of the tree forty feet from earth and went carefully and minutely through the whole process of furling imaginary sails however he came down manifestly soothed by the performance and singular phenomenon he was quite cool and it was the spectators on deck who perspired and what a pleasant voice he has said alfred it quite charms my ear it is not like a mad voice it is likeim mad myself and he has got a fiddle and plays it like a hangel by all accounts said the robin only he wont touch it but when he has a mind at night alfred dreamed he heard julias sweet mellow voice speaking to him and he looked and lo it was the able seaman he could sleep no more but lay sighing ere the able seaman had been there three days mrs dodd came unexpectedly to see him and it was with the utmost difficulty alfred was smuggled out of the way mrs archbold saw by her loving anxiety these visits would be frequent and unless alfred was kept constantly locked up which was repugnant to her they would meet some day she knew there are men who ply the trade of spies and where to find them she set one of them to watch mrs dodds house and learn her habits in hopes of getting some clue as to when she might be expected now it so happened that looking for one thing she found another which gave her great hopes and courage and then the sight of alfreds misery tried her patience and then he was beginning half to suspect her of stopping his letters passion impatience pity and calculation all drove her the same road and led to an extraordinary scene so impregnated with the genius of the madhousea place where the passions run out to the very end of their tetherthat i feel little able to describe it i will try and indicate it one fine sunday afternoon then she asked alfred languidly would he like to walk in the country would i like ah dont trifle with a prisoner said he sorrowfully she shook her head no no it will not be a happy walk rooke who hates you is to follow us with that terrible mastiff to pull you down if you try to escape i could not get dr wolf to consent on any other terms alfred let us give up the idea i fear your rashness no no i wont try to escapefrom you i have not seen a blade of grass this six months the accomplished dissembler hesitated yielded they passed through the yard and out at the back door which alfred had so often looked wistfully at and byandby reached a delicious pasture a light golden haze streamed across it nature never seemed so sweet so divine to alfred before the sun as bright as midsummer though not the least hot the air fresh yet genial and perfumed with liberty and the smaller flowers of earth beauty glided rustling by his side and dark eyes subdued their native fire into softness whenever they turned on him and scarce fifty yards in the rear hung a bully and a mastiff ready to tear him down if he should break away from beautys light hand that rested so timidly on his he was young and stouthearted and relished his peep of liberty and nature though blotted by vulcan and rooke he chatted to mrs archbold in good spirits she answered briefly and listlessly at last she stopped under a young chestnuttree as if overcome with a sudden reflection and turning half away from him leaned her head and hand upon a bough and sighed the attitude was pensive and womanly he asked her with innocent concern what was the matter then faintly should he take her home all her answer was to press his hand with hers that was disengaged and instead of sighing to cry the novice in womans wiles set himself to comfort herin vain to question herin vain at first but by degrees she allowed him to learn that it was for him she mourned and so they proceeded on the old old plan the man extorting from the woman bit by bit just so much as she wanted all along to say and would have poured in a stream if let quite alone he drew from his distressed friend that dr wolf for reasons of his own had made special inquiries about the dodds that she had fortunately or unfortunately heard of this and had questioned the person employed hoping to hear something that might comfort alfred instead of that said she i find miss dodd is like most girls out of sight is out of mind with her what do you mean said alfred trembling suddenly do not ask me what a weak fool i was to let you see i was unhappy for you the truth is the truth gasped alfred tell me at once must i i am afraid you will hate me for i should hate any one who told me your faults well thenif i mustmiss dodd has a beau it is a lie cried alfred furiously i wish it was but she has two in fact both of them clergymen however one seems the favourite at least they are engaged to be married it is mr hurd the curate of the parish she lives in by what i hear she is one of the religious ones so perhaps that has brought the pair to an understanding at these words a cold sickness rushed all over alfred beginning at his heart he stood white and stupefied a moment then in the anguish of his heart broke out into a great and terrible cry it was like a young lion wounded with a poisoned shaft then he was silent and stood stock still like petrified despair mrs archbold was prepared for an outburst but not of this kind his anguish was so unlike a womans that it staggered her her good and bad angels to use an expressive though somewhat too poetical phrase battled for her she had an impulse to earn his gratitude for life to let him out of the asylum ere julia should be mrs hurd and even liberty come too late for true love she looked again at the statue of grief by her side and burst out crying in earnest this was unfortunate shallow pity exuding in salt water leaves not enough behind to gush forth in good deeds she only tried to undo her own work in part to comfort him a little with commonplaces she told him in a soothing whisper there were other women in the world besides this inconstant girl others who could love him as he deserved he made no answer to all she could say but just waved his hand once impatiently petty consolation seemed to sting him she drew back discouraged but only for a while he was silent with one grand serpentine movement she came suddenly close to him and standing half behind him laid her hand softly on his shoulder and poured burning love in his ear alfred she murmured we are both unhappy let us comfort one another i had pity on you at silverton house i pity you now pity me a little in turn take me out of this dreadful house out of this revolting life and let me be with you let me be your housekeeper your servant your slave this news that has shocked you so has torn the veil from my eyes i thought i had cooled my love down to friendship and tender esteem but no now i see you as unhappy as myself now i can speak and wrong no one i own ioh alfred my heart burns for you bleeds for you yearns for you sickens for you dies for you oh hush hush mrs archbold you are saying things you will blush for the next moment i blush now but cannot hush i have gone too far and your happiness as well as mine is at stake no young girl can understand or value such a man as you are but i like you have suffered i like you am constant i like you am warm and tender at my age a womans love is bliss to him who can gain it and i love you with all my soul alfred i worship the ground you walk on my sweet sweet boy say you the word dearest and i will bribe the servants and get the keys and sacrifice my profession for ever to give you liberty see how sweet the open face of nature is sweeter than anything on earth but love and all i ask is a little little of your heart in return give me a chance to make you mine for ever and if i fail treat me as i shall deserve desert me at once and then ill never reproach you ill only die for you as i have lived for you ever since i first saw your heavenly face the passionate woman paused at last but her hot cheek and heaving bosom and tender convulsive hand prolonged the pleading i am afraid few men of her own age would have resisted her for voice and speech and all burning melting and winning and then so reasonable lads she did not stipulate for constancy but alfred turned round to her blushing and sorrowful for shame he said this is not love you abuse that sacred word indeed if you had ever really loved you would have pitied me and julia long ago and respected our love and saved us by giving me my freedom long ago i am not a fool do you think i dont know that you are my jailer and the cunningest and most dangerous of them all you cruel ungrateful she sobbed no i am not ungrateful either said he more gently you have always come between me and that kind of torture which most terrifies vulgar souls and i thank you for it only if you had also pitied the deeper anguish of my heart i should thank you more still as it is i forgive you for the share you have had in blasting my happiness for life and nobody shall ever know what you have been mad enough in an unguarded moment to say but for pitys sake talk no more of love to mock my misery mrs archbold was white with ire long before he had done this sentence you insolent creature said she you spurn my love you shall feel my hate so i conclude said he coldly such love as yours is hard by hate it is said she and i know how ill combine the two today i loved you and you spurned me ere long you shall love me and ill despise you and not spurn you i dont understand you said alfred feeling rather uneasy what said she dont you see how the superior mind can fascinate the inferior look at frank beverleyhow he follows you about and fawns on you like a little dog i prefer his sort of affection to yours a gentleman and a man would have kept that to himself but you are neither one nor the other or you would have taken my offer and then run away from me the next day you fool a man betrays a woman he doesnt insult her ah you admire franks affection well you shall imitate it you couldnt love me like a man you shall love me like a dog how will you manage that pray he inquired with a sneer ill drive you mad she hissed this fiendish threat out between her white teeth ay sir she said hitherto your reason has only encountered men you shall see now what an insulted woman can do a lunatic you shall be ere long and then ill make you love me dote on me follow me about for a smile and then ill leave off hating you and love you once more but not the way i did five minutes ago at this furious threat alfred ground his teeth and said then i give you my honour that the moment i see my reason the least shaken ill kill you and so save myself from the degradation of being your lover on any terms threaten your own sex with that said the archbold contemptuously you may kill me whenever you like and the sooner the better only if you dont do it very quickly you shall be my property my brainsick lovesick slave chapter xli after a defiance so bitter and deadly alfred naturally drew away from his inamorata but she boiling with love and hate said bitterly we need not take mr rooke into our secrets come sir your arm he stuck it out ungraciously and averted his head she took it suppressed with difficulty a petty desire to pinch and so walked by his side he was as much at his ease as if promenading jungles with a panther she felt him quiver with repugnance under her soft hand and prolonged the irritating contact she walked very slowly and told him with much meaning she was waiting for a signal till then said she we will keep one another company biting the word with her teeth as it went out byandby a window was opened in the asylum and a tablecloth hung out mrs archbold pointed it out to alfred he stared at it and after that she walked him rapidly home in silence but as soon as the door was doublelocked on him she whispered triumphantly in his ear your motherinlaw was expected today that signal was to let me know she was gone my motherinlaw cried the young man and tried in vain to conceal his surprise and agitation ay your motherinlaw that shall never be mrs dodd mrs dodd here said alfred clasping his hands then he reflected and said coolly it is false what should she come here for to see your fatherinlaw my fatherinlaw what is he here too said alfred with an incredulous sneer yes the raving maniac that calls himself thompson and that you took to from the first he is your precious fatherinlawthat shall never be alfred was now utterly amazed and bewildered mrs archbold eyed him in silent scorn poor man said he at last and hung his head sorrowfully no wonder then his voice went so to my heart how strange it all is and how will it all end in your being a madman instead of an insolent fool hissed the viper at this moment beverley appeared at the end of the yard mrs archbold whistled him to her like a dog he came running zealously who was that called while i was out she inquired a polite lady madam she said sir to me and thanked me that sounds like mrs dodd said the archbold quietly ah but continued frank there was another with her a beautiful young lady oh so beautiful miss julia dodd said the archbold grimly alfred panted and his eyes roved wildly in search of a way to escape and follow her she could not be far off anybody else frank inquired mrs archbold no more ladies madam but there was a young gentleman all in black i think he was a clergymanor a butler ah that was her husband that is to be that was mr hurd she can go nowhere without him not even to see her old beau at these words every one of them an adder alfred turned on her furiously and his long arm shot out of its own accord and the fingers opened like an eagles claw she saw and understood but never blenched her vindictive eye met his dilating flashing orbs unflinchingly you pass for a woman he said and i am too wretched for anger he turned from her with a deep convulsive sob and almost staggering leaned his brow against the wall of the house she had done what no man had as yet succeeded in she had broken his spirit and here a man would have left him alone but the rejected beauty put her lips to his ear and whispered into them this is only the beginning then she left him and went to his room and stole all his paper and pens and ink and his very aristotle he was to have no occupation now except to brood and brood and brood as for alfred he sat down upon a bench in the yard a broken man up to this moment he had hoped his julia was as constant as himself but no either she had heard he was mad and with the universal credulity had believed it or perhaps not hearing from him at all believed herself forsaken and was consoling herself with a clergyman jealousy did not as yet infuriate alfred its first effect resembled that of a heavy blow little beverley found him actually sick and ran to the robin the exprizefighter brought him a thimbleful of brandy but he would not take it ah no my friends he said that cannot cure me it is not my stomach it is my heart broken broken the robin retired muttering little beverley kneeled down beside him and kissed his hand with a devotion that savoured of the canine yet it was tender and the sinking heart clung to it oh frank he cried my julia believes me mad or thinks me false or something and she will marry another before i can get out to tell her all i have endured was for loving her what shall i do god protect my reason what will become of me he moaned and young frank sorrowed over him till the harsh voice of rooke summoned him to some menial duty this discharged he came running back and sat on the bench beside his crushed benefactor without saying a word at last he delivered this sapient speech i see you want to get out of this place alfred only sighed hopelessly then i must try and get you out said frank alfred shook his head just let me think said frank solemnly and he sat silent looking like a young owl for thinking soon puzzled him and elicited his intellectual weakness whereas in a groove of duties he could go as smoothly as half the world and but for his official officious protector might just as well have been boots at the swan as boots and chambermaid at the wolf so now force and cunning had declared war on alfred and feebleness in person enlisted in his defence his adversary lost no time that afternoon rooke told him he was henceforth to occupy a double bedded room with another patient if he should be violent in the middle of the night sing out and we will comeif we hear you said the keeper with a malicious smile the patient turned out to be the able seaman here mrs archbold aimed a double stroke to shake alfreds nerves and show him how very mad his proposed fatherinlaw was she thought that if he could once be forced to realise this it might reconcile him to not marrying the daughter the first night david did get up and paraded an imaginary deck for four mortal hours alfreds sleep was broken but he said nothing and david turned in again his watch completed not a day passed now but a blow was struck nor was the victim passive debarred writing materials he cut the rims off several copies of the times and secreted them then catching sight of some inkblots on the back of franks clothesbrush scraped them carefully off melted them in a very little water and with a toothpick scrawled his wrongs to the commissioners he rolled the slips round a halfcrown and wrote outside good christian keep this halfcrown and take the writing to the lunacy commissioners at whitehall for pitys sake this done he watched and when nobody was looking flung his letter so weighted over the gates he heard it fall on the public road another day he secreted a spoonful of black currant preserve diluted it with a little water and wrote a letter and threw it into the road as before another day hearing the robin express disgust at the usage to which he was now subjected he drew him apart and offered him a hundred pounds to get him out now the exprizefighter was rather a tenderhearted fellow and a great detester of foul play what he saw made him now side heartily with alfred and all he wanted was to be indemnified for his risk he looked down and said you see sir i have a wife and child to think of alfred offered him two hundred pounds that is more than enough sir said the robin but you see i cant do it alone i must have a pal in it could you afford as much to garrett he is the likeliest ive heard him say as much as that he was sick of the business alfred jumped at the proposal he would give them two hundred apiece ill sound him said the robin dont you speak to him whatever he might blow the gaff i must begin by making him drunk then hell tell me his real mind one fine morning the house was made much cleaner than usual the rotatory chair in which they used to spin a maniac like a teetotum the restraint chairs and all the paraphernalia were sent into the stable and so disposed that even if found they would look like things scorned and dismissed from service for wolf mind you professed the nonrestraint system alfred asked what was up and found all this was in preparation for the quarterly visit of the commissioners a visit intended to be a surprise but drayton house always knew when they were coming and the very names of the two thunderbolts that thought to surprise them mrs archbold communicated her knowledge in offhand terms it is only two old women bartlett and terry the gentlemen thus flatteringly heralded arrived next day one an aged infirm man with a grand benevolent head bald front and silver hair and the goldheaded cane of his youth now a dignified crutch the other an ordinary looking little chap enough with this merithe was what he looked they had a long interview with mrs archbold first for fear they should carry a naked eye into the asylum mr bartlett acting on instructions very soon inquired about alfred mrs archbolds face put on friendly concern directly i am sorry to say he is not so well as he was a fortnight agonot nearly so well we have given him walks in the country too but i regret to say they did him no real good he came back much excited and now he shuns the other patients which he used not to do in short she gave them the impression that alfred was a moping melancholiac well i had better see him said mr bartlett just to satisfy the board alfred was accordingly sent for and asked with an indifferent air how he was he said he was very well in health but in sore distress of mind at his letters to the commissioners being intercepted by mrs archbold or dr wolf mrs archbold smiled pityingly mr bartlett caught her glance and concluded this was one of the patients delusions formula alfred surprised the glances and said you can hardly believe this because the act is illegal but a great many illegal acts that you never detect are done in asylums however it is not a question of surmise i sent four letters in the regular way since i came here are their several dates pray make a note to inquire whether they have reached whitehall or not oh certainly to oblige you said mr bartlett and made the note mrs archbold looked rather discomposed at that and now gentlemen said alfred since mrs archbold has had a private interview which i see she has abused to poison your mind against me i claim as simple justice a private interview to disabuse you you are the first patient ever told me to walk out of my own drawingroom said mrs archbold rising white with ire and apprehension and sweeping out of the room by this piece of female petulance she gave the enemy a point in the game for if she had insisted on staying mr bartlett was far too weak to have dismissed her as it was he felt shocked at alfreds rudeness and so small a thing as justice did not in his idea counterbalance so great a thing as discourtesy so he listened to alfreds tale with the deadly apathy of an unwilling hearer pour on i will endure as poor lear says as for dr terry he was pictorial but null effete emptied of brains by allscoopingtime if he had been detained that day at drayton house and frank beverley sent back in his place to whitehall it would have mattered little to him less to the nation and nothing to mankind at last mr bartlett gave alfred some hopes he was taking in the truth for he tore a leaf out of his memorandumbook wrote on it and passed it to dr terry the ancient took it with a smile and seemed to make an effort to master it but failed it dropped simultaneously from his finger and his mind not a question was put to alfred so he was fain to come to an end he withdrew suddenly and caught mrs archbold at the keyhole noble adversary said he and stalked away and hid himself hard by and no sooner did the inspectors come out and leave the coast clear than he darted in and looked for the paper mr bartlett had passed to dr terry he found it on the floor and took it eagerly up and full of hope and expectation read these words what is the name of the stuff the matrons gown is made of i should like to buy mrs bartlett one like it alfred stood and read this again and again he searched for some hidden symbolical meaning in the words highminded and deeply impressed with his own wrongs he could not conceive a respectable man paid fifteen hundred a year to spy out wrongs being so heartless hard as to write this single comment during the earnest recital of a wrong so gigantic as his poor alfred learned this to his cost that to put small men into great places is to create monsters when he had realised the bitter truth he put the stonyhearted paper in his pocket crept into the yard and sat down and for all he could do scalding tears ran down his cheeks homunculi quanti sunt he sobbed homunculi quanti sunt presently he saw dr terry come wandering towards him alone the archbold had not deigned to make him safe senectitude had done that alfred all heartsick as he was went to the old gentleman out of veneration for the outside of his headwhich was shakespearianand pity for his bodily infirmity and offered him an arm the doctor thanked him sweetly and said pray young man have you anything to communicate then alfred saw that the ancient man had already forgotten his face and so looking at him with that rare instrument of official inspection the naked eye had seen he was sane and consequently taken him for a keeper how swiftly the mind can roam and from what a distance gather the materials of a thought flashed like lightning through alfreds mind this line from one of his pets the greek philosophers greek text and this is the greatest stroke of art to turn an evil into a good now the feebleness of this aged inspector was an evil the thing then was to turn it into a good shade of plato behold how thy disciple worked thee sir said he sinking his voice mysteriously i have but i am a poor man you wont say i told you its as much as my place is worth confidence strict confidence replied nestor going over beaten tracks for he had kept many a queer secret with the loyalty which does his profession so much honour then sir theres a young gentleman confined here who is no more mad than you and i and never was mad you dont say so that i do sir and they know they are doing wrong sir for they stop all his letters to the commissioners and that is unlawful you know would you like to take a note of it all sir the old fogie said he thought he should and groped vaguely for his notebook he extracted it at last like a loose tooth fumbled with it and dropped it alfred picked it up fuming inwardly the ancient went to write but his fingers were weak and hesitating and by this time he had half forgotten what he was going to say alfreds voice quavered with impatience but he fought it down and offered as coolly as he could to write it for him the offer was accepted and he wrote down in a feigned hand very clear drayton house oct a sane patient alfred hardie confined here from interested motives has written four letters to the commissioners all believed to be intercepted communicated to me in confidence by an attendant in the house refer to the party himself and his correspondence with the commissioners from dr wycherleys also to thomas wales another attendant and to dr wycherley also to dr eskell and mr abbott commissioners of lunacy after this stroke of address alfred took the first opportunity of leaving him and sent frank beverley to him thus alfred alarmed by the hatred of mrs archbold and racked with jealousy exerted all his intelligence and played many cards for liberty one he kept in reserve and a trump card too having now no ink nor colouring matter he did not hesitate but out penknife up sleeve and drew blood from his arm and with it wrote once more to the commissioners but kept this letter hidden for an ingenious purpose what that purpose was my reader shall divine chapter xlii we left julia dodd a district visitor working in a dense parish she learned the depths of human misery bodily and mental she visited an honest widow so poor that she could not afford a farthing dip but sat in the dark when friends came to see her they sometimes brought a candle to talk by she visited a cripple who often thanked god sincerely for leaving her the use of one thumb she visited a poor creature who for sixteen years had been afflicted with a tumour in the neck and had lain all those years on her back with her head in a plate the heat of a pillow being intolerable julia found her longing to go and yet content to stay and praising god in all the lulls of that pain which was her companion day and night but were i to enumerate the ghastly sights the stifling loathsome odours the vulgar horrors upon horrors this refined young lady faced few of my readers would endure on paper for love of truth what she endured in reality for love of suffering humanity and of him whose servant she aspired to be probably such sacrifices of selfish ease and comfort are never quite in vain they tend in many ways to heal our own wounds i wont say that bodily suffering is worse than mental but it is realised far more vividly by a spectator the grim heartbreaking sights she saw arrayed julias conscience against her own grief the more so when she found some of her most afflicted ones resigned and even grateful what said she can they all rags disease and suffering bow so cheerfully to the will of heaven and have i the wickedness the impudence to repine and then happier than most district visitors she was not always obliged to look on helpless or to confine her consolations to good words mrs dodd was getting on famously in her groove she was high in the confidence of cross and co and was inspecting eighty ladies as well as working her salary and profits together were not less than five hundred pounds a year and her one luxury was charity and julia its minister she carried a good honest basket and there you might see her bible wedged in with wine and meat and tea and sugar and still as these melted in her round a little spark of something warm would sometimes come in her own sick heart thus by degrees she was attaining not earthly happiness but a grave and pensive composure yet across it gusts of earthly grief came sweeping often but these she hid till she was herself again to her mother and brother she was kinder sweeter and dearer if possible than ever they looked on her as a saint but she knew better and used to blush with honest shame when they called her so oh dont pray dont she would say with unaffected pain love me as if i was an angel but do not praise me that turns my eyes inward and makes me see myself i am not a christian yet nor anything like one returning one day from her duties very tired she sat down to take off her bonnet in her own room and presently heard snatches of an argument that made her prick those wonderful little ears of hers which could almost hear through a wall the two concluding sentences were a key to the whole dialogue why disturb her said mrs dodd she is getting better of the wretch and my advice is say nothing what harm can that do but then it is so unfair so ungenerous to keep anything from the poor girl that may concern her at this moment julia came softly into the room with her curiosity hidden under an air of angelic composure her mother asked after mrs beecher to draw her into conversation she replied quietly that mrs beecher was no better but very thankful for the wine mrs dodd had sent her this answer given she went without any apparent hurry and sat by edward and fixed two loving imploring eyes on him in silence oh subtle sex this feather was to turn the scale and make him talk unquestioned it told she was close to him too and mamma at the end of the room look here ju said he putting his hands in his pockets we two have always been friends as well as brother and sister and somehow it does not seem like a friend to keep things dark then to mrs dodd she is not a child mother after all and how can it be wrong to tell her the truth or right to suppress the truth well then ju theres an advertisement in the tiser and its a regular riddle now mind i dont really think there is anything in it but it is a droll coincidence very droll if it wasnt there are ladies present and one of them a district visitor i would say dd droll so droll continued he getting warm that i should like to punch the advertisers head let me see it dear said julia i dare say it is nothing worth punching about there said edward ive marked it julia took the paper and her eye fell on this short advertisement aileen aroondistrust appearances looking at her with some anxiety they saw the paper give one sharp rustle in her hands and then quiver a little she bowed her head over it and everything seemed to swim but she never moved they could neither of them see her face she defended herself with the paper the letters cleared again and still hiding her face she studied and studied the advertisement come tell us what you think of it said edward is it anything or a mere coincidence it is a pure coincidence said mrs dodd with an admirable imitation of cool confidence julia said nothing but she now rose and put both arms round edwards neck and kissed him fervidly again and again holding the newspaper tight all the time there said mrs dodd see what you have done oh it is all right said edward cheerfully the british fireman is getting hugged no end why what is the matter have you got the hiccough ju no no you are a true brother i knew all along that he would explain all if he was alive and he is alive so saying she kissed the tiser violently more than once then fluttered away with it to her own room ashamed to show her joy and yet not able to hide it mrs dodd shook her head sorrowfully and edward began to look rueful and doubt whether he had done wisely i omit the discussion that followed but the next time his duties permitted him to visit them mrs dodd showed him the tiser in her turn and with her pretty white taper finger and such a look pointed to the following advertisement aileen arooni do distrust appearances but if you ever loved me explain them at once i have something for you from your dear sister poor simple girl said mrs dodd not to see that if he could explain at all he would explain not go advertising an enigma after acting a mystification and to think of my innocent dove putting in that she had something for him from his sister a mighty temptation for such a wretch it was wonderfully silly said edward and such a clever girl too but you ladies cant stick to one thing at a time begging your pardon mamma mrs dodd took no notice of this remark to see her lower herself so she said oh my son i am mortified and mrs dodd leaned her cheek against edwards and sighed now dont you cry mammy said he sorrowfully ill break every bone in his skin for your comfort heaven forbid cried mrs dodd anxiously what are you not aware she would hate you hate me her brother she would hate us all if we laid a finger on that wretch pray interfere no more love foolish child talking to me about women and it is plain you know nothing of their hearts and a good thing for you she then put on maternal authority nobody could do it more easily and solemnly forbade all violence he did not venture to contradict her now but cherished his resolution all the more and longed for the hour when he might take the wretch by the throat and chastise him the more publicly the better now the above incident that revealed julias real heart which she had been hiding more or less all this time from those who could not sympathise with her took eventually a turn unfavourable to the wretch so he might well be called her great and settled fear had always been that alfred was dead under the immediate influence of his fathers cunning she had for a moment believed he was false but so true and loving a heart could not rest in that opinion in true love so long as there is one grain of uncertainty there is a world of faith and credulous ingenuity so as alfred had never been seen since as nobody could say he was married to another there was a grain of uncertainty as to his unfaithfulness and this her true heart magnified to a mountain but now matters wore another face she was sure he had written the advertisement who but he out of the few that take the words of any song to heart admired aileen aroon who but he out of the three or four people who might possibly care for that old song had appearances to explain away and who but he knew they took in the morning advertiser she waited then for the explanation she had invited she read the advertising column every day over and over not a word more then her womanly pride was deeply wounded what had she courted an explanation where most ladies would have listened to none and courted it in vain her high spirit revolted her heart swelled against the repeated insults she had received this last one filled the bitter cup too high and then her mother came in and assured her he had only inserted that advertisement to keep her in his power he has heard you are recovering and are admired by others more worthy of your esteem julia cried bitterly at these arguments for she could no longer combat them and mr hurd was very attentive and kind and when he spoke to julia and julia turned away her eye was sure to meet mrs dodds eye imploring her secretly not to discourage the young man too much and so she was gently pulled by one and gently thrust by another away from her first lover and towards his successor it is an old old story fate seems to exhaust its malice on our first love for the second the road is smoother matters went on so some weeks and it was perfectly true that mr hurd escorted both ladies one day to drayton house at julias request and not mrs dodds indeed the latter lady was secretly hurt at his being allowed to come with them one saturday afternoon mrs dodd went alone to drayton house by appointment david was like a lamb but as usual had no knowledge of her mrs archbold told her a quiet intelligent patient had taken a great fancy to him and she thought this was adding much to his happiness may i see him to thank him asked mrs dodd oh certainly said mrs archbold ill inquire for him she went out but soon returned saying he is gone out for a walk with the head keeper we give him as much air and amusement as we can we hope soon to send him out altogether cured truly kind and thoughtful said mrs dodd soon after she kissed mrs archbold and pressed a valuable brooch upon her and then took leave however at the gate she remembered her parasol mrs archbold said she would go back for it mrs dodd would not hear of that mrs archbold insisted and settled the question by going she was no sooner in the house than young frank beverley came running to mrs dodd and put the missing parasol officiously into her hand oh thank you sir said she will you be so kind as to tell mrs archbold i have it and with this they parted and the porter opened the gate to her and she got into her hired cab she leaned her head back and as usual was lost in the sorrowful thoughts of what had been and what now was poor wife each visit to drayton house opened her wound afresh on reaching the stones there was a turnpike this roused her up she took out her purse and paid it as she drew back to her seat she saw out of the tail of her feminine eye the edge of something white under her parasol she took up the parasol and found a written paper pinned on to it she detached this paper and examined it all over with considerable curiosity it consisted of a long slip about an inch and a quarter broad rolled like tape and tied with packthread she could not see the inside of course but she read the superscription it was firmly but clearly written in red ink apparently of the words i shall only say at present that they were strong and simple and that their effect on the swift intelligence and tender heart of mrs dodd was overpowering they knocked at her heart they drew from her an audible cry of pity more eloquent than a thousand speeches and the next moment she felt a little faint for she knew now the appeal was not in red ink but in something very fit to pass between the heart of woe and the heart of pity she smelt at her salts and soon recovered that weakness and next her womanly bosom swelled so with the milk of human kindness that her breath came short after a little struggle she gushed out aloud ah that i will poor soul this very moment now by this time she was close to her own house she stopped the cab at her door and asked the driver if his horse was fresh enough to carry her to the board of lunacy it is at whitehall sir said she lord bless you maam said the cabman whitehall why my mare would take you to whitechapel and back in an hour let alone whitehall reassured on that point mrs dodd went in just to give the servant an order but as she stood in the passage she heard her childrens voices and also a friends the genial angry tones of alexander sampson m d she thought oh i must just show them all the paper before i go with it and so after a little buzz about dinner and things with sarah mounted the stairs and arrived among them singularly apropos as it happened men like sampson who make many foes do also make stauncher friends than ever the hare does and are faithful friends themselves the boisterous doctor had stuck to the dodds in all their distresses and if they were ever short of money it certainly was not his fault for almost his first word when he found them in a lodging was now yell be wanting a chick gimme pen and ink and ill just draw ye one for a hundre this being declined politely by mrs dodd he expostulated maidearmadam how on airth can ye go on in such a place as london without a chick he returned to the charge at his next visit and scolded her well for her pride who iver hard of refusing a chick a small inoffensive chick from an old friend like me come now behave just a wee chick ill let y off for fifty give us your company and your friendship said mrs dodd we value them above gold we will not rob your dear children while we have as many fingers on our hands as other people on the present occasion dr sampson whose affectionate respect for the leading london physicians has already displayed itself was inveighing specially against certain specialists whom in the rapidity of his lusty eloquence he called the mad ox he favoured julia and edward with a full account of the maniform enormities he had detected them in during thirty years practice and so descended to his present grievance a lady an old friend of his was being kept in a certain asylum month after month because she had got money and relations and had once been delirious and why was she delirious because she had a brain fever she got well in a fortnight this lady had thrown a letter over the wall addressed to him somebody had posted it he had asked the commissioners to let him visit her they had declined for the present yon board always sides with the strong against the weak said he so now he had bribed the gardener and made a midnight assignation with the patient and was going to it with six stout fellows to carry her off by force that is my recipe for alleged insanity said he the business will be more like a mejaeval knight carrying off a namorous nun out of a convint than a good physician saving a pashint from the mad ox however mrs saampsons in the secret i daunt say sh approves it for she doesnt she says go quietly to the board o commissioners sis i my dear boards are a sort of cattle that go too slow for saampson and no match at all for the mad ox at this conjuncture or soon after mrs dodd came in with her paper in her hand a little flurried for once and after a hasty curtsey said oh doctor sampson oh my dears what wickedness there is in the world im going to whitehall this moment only look at what was pinned on my parasol at drayton house the writing passed from hand to hand and left the readers looking very gravely at one another julia was quite pale and horrorstricken all were too deeply moved and even shocked to make any commonplace comment for it looked and read like a cry from heart to hearts if you are a christian if you are human pity a sane man here confined in fraud and take this to the board of lunacy at whitehall torn by treachery from her i love my letters all intercepted pens and paper kept from me i write this with a toothpick and my blood on a rim of the times oh god direct it to some one who has suf fered and can feel for an others agony dr sampson was the first to speak there said he under his breath didnt i tell you this man is sane theres sanity in every line well but said edward do you mean to say that in the present day maidearrsirr mankind niver changes whativer the muscles of man can do in the light the mind and conscience of man will consent to do in the dark julia said never a word mrs dodd too was for action not for talk she bade them all a hasty adieu and went on her good work ere she got to the street door she heard a swift rustle behind her and it was julia flying down to her all glowing and sparkling with her old impetuosity that had seemed dead for ever no no she cried panting with generous emotion it is to me it was sent i am torn from him i love and by some treachery i dare say and i have sufferedoh you shall never know what i have suffered give it me oh pray pray pray give it me ill take it to whitehall chapter xliii if we could always know at the time what we are doing two ladies carried a paper to whitehall out of charity to a stranger therein the elder was a benefactress to a man she had never spoken of but as the wretch the younger held her truant bridegrooms heart i may say in her hand all the road and was his protectress neither recognised the handwriting for no man can write his own hand with a toothpick they reached whitehall and were conducted upstairs to a gentleman of pleasant aspect but powerful brow seated in a wilderness of letters he waved his hand and a clerk set them chairs he soon after laid down his pen and leaned gravely forward to hear their business they saw they must waste no time julia looked at her mother rose and took alfreds missive to his desk and handed it him with one of her eloquent looks grave and pitiful he seemed struck by her beauty and her manner it was pinned on my parasol sir by a poor prisoner at drayton house said mrs dodd oh indeed said the gentleman and began to read the superscription with a cold and wary look but thawed visibly as he read he opened the missive and ran his eye over it the perusal moved him not a little a generous flush mounted to his brow he rang the bell sharply a clerk answered it the gentleman wrote on a slip of paper and said earnestly bring me every letter that is signed with that name and all our correspondence about him he then turned to mrs dodd and put to her a few questions which drew out the main facts i have just related the papers were now brought in excuse me a moment said he and ran over them i believe the man is sane said he and that you will have enabled us to baffle a conspiracy a heartless conspiracy we do hope he will be set free sir said mrs dodd piteously he shall madam if it is as i suspect i will stay here all night but i will master this case and lay it before the board myself without delay julia looked at her mother and then asked if it would be wrong to inquire the poor gentlemans name humph said the official i ought not to reveal that without his consent but stay he will owe you much and it really seems a pity he should not have an opportunity of expressing his gratitude perhaps you will favour me with your address and trust to my discretion of course if he does not turn out as sane as he seems i shall never let him know it mrs dodd then gave her address and she and julia went home with a glow about the heart selfish people thank heaven never know unconsciously these two had dealt their enemy and alfreds a heavy blow had set the train to a mine their friend at the office was a man of another stamp than alfred had fallen in with meantime alfred was subjected to hourly mortifications and irritations he guessed the motive and tried to baffle it by calm selfpossession but this was far more difficult than heretofore because his temper was now exacerbated and his fibre irritated by broken sleep of this poor david was a great cause and his heart inflamed and poisoned by that cruel that corroding passion jealousy to think that while he was in prison a rival was ever at his julias ear making more and more progress in her heart this corroder was his bitter companion day and night and perhaps of all the maddeners human cunning could have invented this was the worst it made his temples beat and his blood run boiling poison indeed there were times when he was so distempered by passion that homicide seemed but an act of justice and suicide a legitimate relief for who could go on for ever carrying hell in his bosom up and down a prison yard he began to go alone to turn impatiently from the petty troubles and fathomless egotism of those afflicted persons he had hitherto forced his sore heart to pity pale thin and wobegone he walked the weary gravel like the lost ones in that hall of eblis whose hearts were a devouring fire even an inspector with a naked eye would no longer have distinguished him at first sight from a lunatic of the unhappiest class the melancholiac ipse suum cor edens hominum vestigia vitans mrs archbold looked on and saw this sad sight not with the pity it would once have caused but with a sort of bitter triumph lightened by no pleasure and darkened by the shadow of coming remorse yet up to this time she had shown none of that inconstancy of purpose which marks her sex while she did go far to justify the poets charge nor hell a fury like a woman scorned rooke had a hint to provoke alfred to violence such as would justify them in subjecting so popular a patient to bodily restraint composing draughts and other quick maddeners rooke entered into the game zealously from two motives he was devoted to mrs archbold and he hated alfred who had openly defied him and mortified his vanity about frank beverley one saturday alfred was ordered out to walk with rooke and hayes and vulcan he raised no objection suspected felt homicidal suppressed the impulse and by this selfcommand he got time to give that letter to beverley with instructions but all the walk he was saying to himself that julia was in the house and he was kept away from her and a rival with her this made him sicken and rage by turns he came back in a state verging on fury on entering the yard poor beverley who had done his bit of cunning and by reaction now relapsed into extra simplicity came running and said ive done it she has got it what have you done who has got what cried rooke dont tell frank if you dont ill shake your life out ye young blackguard cried rooke seizing him and throttling him till he was black in the face alfreds longpent fury broke out he gnashed his teeth and dashed his fist in rookes face rooke staggered back and bellowed with pain and anger then rushing at him incautiously received a stinger that staggered him and nearly closed his right eye he took the hint and put himself in a posture that showed he was skilled in the art of selfdefence he stopped two blows neatly and returned a heavy one upon the ribs alfred staggered back some steps but steadied himself and as rooke rushed in too hastily to improve his advantage caught him heavily on the other eye but lost his own balance a little which enabled rooke to close then came a sharp short rally of reechoing blows and rooke not to be denied got hold of his man and a wrestling bout ensued in which alfred being somewhat weakened by misery and broken rest rookes great weight and strength enabled him after a severe struggle to fall with his antagonist under him and knock the breath out of his body for the moment then hayes who had stood prudently aloof came in and helped handcuff him they could not walk up and down him for the robin who stood by with a professional air to see fair play ah cold iron is your best chance he said satirically never you mind sir you hit quick and well id back you at long odds in the ring both his peepers are in deep mourning he added a cow can beat a man wrestling when alfred was handcuffed they turned him loose it soon transpired however that he was now a dangerous maniac formula and to be confined in the noisy ward on hearing this he saw the trap he had fallen into saw and trembled he asked himself what on earth he should do and presently the saying came back to him and this is the highest stroke of art to turn evil into good he argued thus wolfs love of money is my great evil he will destroy me for money do anything for money then suppose i offer him money to be honest he begged an interview with dr wolf on business this was accorded at once he asked the doctor plump whether he received a large sum to detain him under pretence of insanity not very considering the trouble you sometimes give mr hardie was the dry reply well then justice shall outbid rascality for once i am a sane man and you know it a man of my word and you know it ill give you a thousand pounds to let me out of this place dr wolfs eyes sparkled you shall have any bond or security you like and the money within a week of my deliverance dr wolf said he should be delighted to do it if he could conscientiously at this piece of hypocrisy alfreds cheek reddened and he could not speak well well i do see a great change in you for the better said dr wolf if as i suspect you are convalescent i will part with you without a thousand pounds or a thousand pence alfred stared had he mistaken his man ill tell you what though said the smooth doctor i have got two pictures one by raphael one by correggio i know them said the quickwitted alfred they are worth more than a thousand pounds of course they are but i would take a thousand pounds from you throw me in my liberty and ill make it guineas we will see about that and with this understanding the men of business parted dr wolf consulted mrs archbold then and there impossible said she the law would dissolve such a bargain and you would be exposed and ruined but a thousand pounds said the poor doctor oh he offered me more than that said mrs archbold you dont mean to say so when was that do you remember one sunday that i walked him out to keep clear of mrs dodd have you not observed that i have not repeated the experiment yes but i really dont know why will you promise me faithfully not to take any notice if i tell you the doctor promised then she owned to him with manifest reluctance that alfred had taken advantage of her kindness her indiscretion in walking alone with him and made passionate love to her he offered me not a thousand pounds said she but his whole fortune and his heart if i would fly with him from these odious walls that was his expression then seeing out of a corner of her eye that the doctor was turning almost green with jealousy this artist proceeded to describe the love scene between her and alfred with feigned hesitation yet minute detail only she inverted the parts alfred in her glowing page made the hot love she listened abashed confused and tried all she could think of to bring him to better sentiments she concluded this chapter of history inverted with a sigh and said so now he hates me i believe poor fellow do you regret your refusal asked dr wolf uneasily oh no my dear friend of course my judgment says that few women at my age and in my position would have refused but we poor women seldom go by our judgments and she cast a tender look down at the doctors feet in short she worked on him so that he left alfred at her disposition and was no sooner gone to his other asylum six miles off than the calumniated was conducted by hayes and rooke through passage after passage and door after door to a wing of the building connected with the main part only by a covered way as they neared it strange noises became audible faint at first they got louder and louder singing roaring howling like wolves alfreds flesh began to creep he stopped at the covered way he would have fought to his last gasp sooner than go further but he was handcuffed he appealed to the keepers but he had used them both too roughly they snarled and forced him on and shut him into a common flagged cell with a filthy trucklebed in it and all the vessels of guttapercha here he was surrounded by the desperate order of maniacs he at present scarcely knew but by report throughout that awful night he could never close his eyes for the horrible unearthly sounds that assailed him singing swearing howling like wild beasts his righthand neighbour reasoned high of faith and works ending each pious argument with a sudden rhapsody of oaths and never slept a wink his lefthand neighbour alternately sang and shouted cain was a murderer cain was a murderer and howled like a wolf making night hideous his opposite neighbour had an audience and every now and then delivered in a high nasal key let us curse and pray varying it sometimes thus brethren let us work double tides and then he would deliver a long fervent prayer and follow it up immediately with a torrent of blasphemies so terrific that coming in such a contrast they made alfreds body wet with perspiration to hear a poor creature so defy his creator no rest no peace when it was still the place was like the grave and ever and anon loud sharp tremendous burst a thunderclap of curses and set those poor demented creatures all yelling again for halfanhour making the tombs ring and at clocklike intervals a harmless but dirty idiot who was allowed to roam the ward came and chanted through the keyhole everything is nothing and nothing is everything this was the only observation he had made for many years his ears assailed with horrors of which you have literally no conception or shadow of a conception his nose poisoned with ammoniacal vapours and the peculiar wildbeast smell that marks the true maniac alfred ran wildly about his cell trying to stop his ears and trembling for his own reason when the fearful night rolled away and morning broke and he could stand on his trucklebed and see the sweet hoarfrost on a square yard of grass level with his prison bars it refreshed his very soul and affected him almost to tears he was then to his surprise taken out and allowed to have a warm bath and to breakfast with david and the rest but i suspect it was done to watch the effect of the trial he had been submitted to after breakfast having now no place to go he lay on a bench and there exhausted nature overpowered him and he fell fast asleep mrs archbold came by on purpose and saw him he looked very pale and peaceful there was a cut on his forehead due to rookes knuckles mrs archbold looked down and the young figure and haughty face seemed so unresisting and peaceful sad she half relented and shed some bitter tears that did not however prevent her setting her female spies to watch him more closely than ever he awoke cold but refreshed and found little beverley standing by him with wet eyes alfred smiled and held out his hand like a captive monarch to his faithful vassal they shant put you in the noisy ward again sobbed frank this is your last night here hy frank you rascal my boots roared rooke from an open window coming sircoming alfreds next visitor was the robin he came whispering it is all right with garrett sir and he has got a key of the back gate but you must get back to your old room or we cant work would to heaven i could robin another night or two in the noisy ward will drive me mad i think well sir ill tell you what you do which we all have to do it at odd times hold a candle to the devil here she comes i think she is everywhere all at one time the robin then sauntered away affecting nonchalance and alfred proceeded to hold the candle as directed mrs archbold said he timidly rising from his seat at her approach sir said she haughtily and affecting surprise i have a favour to ask you madam would you be so kind as to let me go back to my room what you have found i am not so powerless as you thought i find myself so weak and you so powerful thatyou can afford to be generous i have no more power over you than you have over me i wish it was so ill prove it said she who has got the key of your room hayes she whistled and sent for him and gave him the requisite order before alfred alfred thanked her warmly she smiled and went away disposed to change her tactics and having shown him how she could torment try soothing means and open his heart by gratitude but presently looking out of her window she saw the robin and him together and somehow they seemed to her subtle observant eyes to be plotting the very suspicion was fatal to that officer his discharge was determined on meantime she set her spies to watch him and tell her if they saw or heard anything now mrs archbold was going out to tea that evening and as soon as ever this transpired the keepers secretly invited the keeperesses to a party in the firstclass patients drawingroom this was a rare opportunity and the robin and garrett put their heads together accordingly in the dusk of the evening the robin took an opportunity and slipped a new key of the back gate into alfreds hand and told him the trick was to be done that very night he was to get thompson to go to bed early and instead of taking off his clothes was to wait in readiness we have been plying hayes already said the robin and as soon as she is off we shall hocuss him and get the key and while they are all larking in the drawingroom off you go to merrimashee oh you dear robin you have taken my breath away but how about vulcan oh we know how to make him amiable a dogfancier a friend of mine has provided the ondeniable where dogs is concerned whereby garrett draws the varmint into the scullery and shuts him in while i get the key from the other its all right ah robin said alfred it sounds too good to be true what this my last day here the minutes seemed to creep very slowly till eight oclock came then he easily persuaded david to go to bed hayes went up and unlocked the door for them it closed with a catchlock hayes was drunk but full of discipline and insisted on the patients putting out their clothes so alfred made up a bundle from his portmanteau and threw it out hayes eyed it suspiciously but was afraid to stoop and inspect it closer for his drunken instinct told him he would pitch on his head that moment so he retired grumbling and dangling his key at the end of the corridor he met mrs archbold full dressed and with a candle in her hand she held the candle up and inspected him and a little conversation followed that sobered mr hayes for a minute or two mrs archbold was no sooner gone to her little teaparty than all the firstclass ladies and gentlemen were sent to bed to get a good sleep for the good of their health and the keepers and keeperesses took their place and romped and made such a row sleep was not easy within hearing of them they sat on the piano they sang songs to a drum accompaniment played on the table they danced drank flirted and enjoyed themselves like schoolboys hayes alone was gloomy and morose so the robin and garrett consoled him drank with him and soothed him with the balm of insensibility in which condition they removed him under charitable pretences and searched his pockets in the passage for the key of alfreds room to their infinite surprise and disappointment it was not upon him the fact is mrs archbold had snatched it from him in her wrath and put it in her own pocket how far her suspicions went how much her spies had discovered i really dont know but somehow or other she was uneasy in her mind and seeing hayes in such a state she would not trust him during her absence but took the key away with her the robin and garrett knew nothing of this and were all abroad but they thought rooke must have the key so they proceeded to drink with him and were just about to administer a really effective soporific in his grog when they and all the merry party were suddenly startled by violent ringing at the bell and thundering and halloaing at the hall door the men jumped to their feet and balanced themselves and looked half wild half stupid the women sat and began to scream for they had heard a word that has terrors for us all peculiar terrors for them this alarm was due to a personage hitherto undervalued in the establishment mr francis beverley had been thinking so now finding all the patients boxed up and their attendants romping in the drawingroom he lighted seven fires skilfully on the whole for practice makes perfect but singular oversight he omitted one essential ingredient in the fire and that was the grate to be plain mr francis made seven bonfires of bedcurtains chairs and other combustibles in the servants garrets lighted them contemporaneously and retired to the basement convinced he had taken the surest means to deliver his friend out of drayton house and with a certain want of candour that characterises the weak proceeded to black his other bad masters shoes with singular assiduity there was no wind to blow the flame but it was a clear frost and soon fiery tongues shot out of three garretwindows into the night and lurid gleams burnished four more and the old house was burning merrily overhead and ringing with hilarity on the first floor but the neighbours saw pointed wondered comprehended shouted rang knocked and surged round the iron gate fire fire fire and fire went down the road and men on horseback galloped for engines and the terrorstricken porter opened and the people rushed in and hammered at the hall doors and when rooke ran down and opened fire was the word that met him from a score of eager throats and glittering eyes fire where he cried where why you are on fire blazing he ran out and looked up at the tongues of flame and volleys of smoke shut the gate he roared call the police fire fire and he dashed back and calling to the other keepers to unlock all the doors they had keys of ran up to the garrets to see what could be done he came out awestricken at what he saw he descended hastily to the third floor now the third floor of that wing was occupied principally by servants in fact the only patients at that time were dodd and alfred rooke called to the men below to send hayes up to no with his key directly he then ran down to the next floorof which he had keysand opened all the doors and said to the inmates with a ghastly attempt at cheerfulness belied by his shaking voice get up gentlemen there is a ball and supper going on below he was afraid to utter the word fire to them the other keepers were as rapid each on his beat and soon the more rational patients took the alarm and were persuaded or driven out halfdressed into the yard where they cowered together in extremity of fear for the fire began to roar overhead like a lion and lighted up the whole interior red and bright all was screaming and confusion and then came a struggle to get the incurable out from the basement story there was no time to handcuff them the keepers trusted to the terror of the scene to cow them and so opened the doors and got them out anyhow wild weird forms with glaring eyes and matted hair leaped out and ran into the hall and laughed and danced and cursed in the lurid reflection of the fires above hell seemed discharging demons men recoiled from them and well they did for now the skylight exploded and the pieces fell tinkling on the marble hall fast as hail the crowd recoiled and ran but those awful figures continued their gambols one picked up the burning glass and ground it in his hands that bled directly but he felt neither burn nor cut the keepers rushed in to withdraw them from so dangerous a place all but one obeyed with sudden tameness that one struggled and yelled like a demon in the midst of which fearful contest came a sudden thundering at a door on the third floor what is that cried rooke it is mr hardie screamed the robin you have left him locked in i told hayes to let him out long ago but hayes hasnt got the key youve got it no no i tell you hayes has got it no no murder murder they are dead men run for mrs archbold somebody run here hammers hammers for gods sake come and help me break the door oh rooke rooke as im a man hayes has got the key cried rooke stamping on the ground and white with terror by this time garrett had got a hammer and he and wales rushed wildly up the stairs to batter in the strong door if they could they got to the third floor but with difficulty the smoke began to blind them and choke them and fiery showers fell on them and drove them back smarting and choking garrett sank down gasping at the stairfoot wales ran into the yard uttering pitiful cries and pointing wildly upwards but before he got there a hand had broken through the glass of a window up in the third floor the poor white hand of a perishing prisoner and clutched the framework and tore at it at this hand a thousand white faces were now upturned amid groans of pity and terror such as only multitudes can utter suddenly those anxious faces and glistening eyes turned like one for an attempt wild and unintelligible but still an attempt was about to be made to save that hand and its owner out of the very jaws of death now amongst the spectators was one whose life and reason were at stake on that attempt mrs dodd was hurrying homeward from this very neighbourhood when the fire broke out her son edward was coming at nine oclock to tea and better still to sleep he was leaving the fire brigade it had disappointed him he found the fireescape men saved the lives the firemen only the property he had gone into the business earnestly too he had invented a thing like a treble pouch hook which could be fastened in a moment to the end of a rope and thrown into the window and would cling to the bare wall if there was nothing better and enable him to go up and bring life down but he had never got a chance to try it and per contra he was on the engine when they went tearing over a woman and broke her arm and collarbone in the blackfriars road and also when they went tearing over their own firedog and crippled him all this seemed out of character and shocked edward and then his mother could not get over the jacket in a quarter of an hour he was to take off the obnoxious jacket for ever and was now lounging at the station smoking a short pipe when a man galloped up crying fire all right said edward giving a whiff where lunatic asylum drayton house guess how long before the horses were to and the engine tearing at a gallop down the road and the firemen shouting fire fire to clear the way and edwards voice the loudest when the report of fire swept townward past mrs dodd she turned and saw the glow oh dear said she that must be somewhere near drayton house and full of the tender fears that fill such bosoms as hers for those they love she could not go home till she had ascertained that it was not drayton house moreover edwards was the nearest station she had little hope now of seeing him to tea she sighed and retraced her steps and made timid inquiries but could gain no clear information presently she heard galloping behind her and the firemans wild sharp cry of fire an engine drawn by two powerful brown horses came furiously all on fire itself with red paint and polished steel gleaming in the lights helmeted men clustered on it and out of one of these helmets looked a face like a fighting lions the eyes so dilated the countenance in such towering excitement the figure half rising from his seat as though galloping was too slow and he wanted to fly it was edward mother and son caught sight of one another as the engine thundered by and he gave her a solemn ardent look and pointed towards the fire by that burning look and eloquent gesture she knew it was something more than a common fire she trembled and could not move but this temporary weakness was followed by an influx of wild vigour she forgot her fortytwo years and flew to hover round the fire as the hen round water unfortunately she was too late to get any nearer than the road outside the gates the crowd was so dense and while her pale face and anxious eyes the eyes of a wife and a mother were bent on that awful fire the human tide flowed swiftly up behind her and there she was wedged in she was allowed her foot of ground to stand and look like the restno more mere unit in that mass of panting humanity hers was one of the thousands of upturned faces lurid in the light of the now blazing roof she saw with thousands the hand break the window and clutch the frame she gasped with the crowd at that terrible and piteous sight and her bosom panted for her fellowcreature in sore peril but what is this the mob inside utter a great roar of hope the crowd outside strain every eye a gleaming helmet overtops the outer wall it is a fireman mounting the great elmtree in the madhouse yard the crowd inside burst in a cheer he had a rope round his loins his face was to the tree he mounted and mounted like a cat higher and higher and higher till he reached a branch about twelve feet above the window and as many distant from it laterally the crowd cheered him lustily but mrs dodd half distracted with terror implored them not to encourage him it is my child she cried despairingly my poor reckless darling come down edward for your poor mothers sake come down dear heart said a woman it is the ladys son poor thing stand on my knee maam said a coalheaver oh no sir no i could not look at him for the world i can only pray for him good people pray for us and she covered her face and prayed and trembled and sobbed hysterically a few yards behind was another woman who had arrived later yet like her was wedged immovable this woman was more terrorstricken than mrs dodd and well she might for she knew who was behind that fatal window the womans name was edith archbold the flames were now leaping through the roof and surging up towards heaven in waves of fire six feet high edward scorched and half blinded managed to fasten his rope to the bough and calculating the distances vertical and lateral he had to deal with took up rope accordingly and launched himself into the air the crowd drew their breath so hard it sounded like a murmur to their horror he missed the window and went swinging back there was a cry of dismay but edward had never hoped to leap into the window he went swinging by the rope back to the main stem of the tree gave it a fierce spang with his feet and by this means and a powerful gesture of his herculean loins got an inch nearer the window back again and then the same game and so he went swinging to and fro over a wider and wider space and by letting out an inch of cord each swing his flying feet came above the windowledge then a little higher then higher still and now oh sight strange and gloriousas this helmeted hero with lips clenched and great eyes that stared unflinchingly at the surging flames and gleamed supernaturally with inward and outward fire swang to and fro on his frail support still making for the windowthe heads of all the hoping fearing admiring panting crowd went surging and waving to and fro beneath so did not their hearts only but their agitated bodies follow the course of his body as it rushed to and fro faster and faster through the hot air starred with snowflakes and hail of fire and those his fellowmen for whom the brave fireman made this supernatural effort did they know their desperate condition were they still alive one little hour ago alfred sat on the bed full of hope every minute he expected to hear the robin put a key into the door he was all ready and his money in his pocket alas his liberator came not some screw loose again presently he was conscious of a great commotion in the house feet ran up and down then came a smell of burning the elmtree outside was illuminated he was glad at first he had a spite against the place but soon he became alarmed and hammered at the door and tried to force it impossible fire rang from mens voices fire crackled above his head he ran about the room like a wild creature he sprang up at the window and dashed his hand through but fell back he sprang again and got his hand on some of the lighter woodwork he drew himself up nearly to the window and then the wood gave way and he fell to the ground and striking the back of his head nearly stunned himself the flames roared fearfully now and at this david who had hitherto sat unconcerned started up and in a stentorian voice issued order upon order to furl every rag of sail and bring the ship to the wind he thought it was a tempest oh hush hush cried alfred in vain a beam fell from the roof to the floor precursor of the rest on this david thought the ship was ashore and shouted a fresh set of orders proper to the occasion so terribly alike are the angry voices of the sisterelements but alfred implored him and got him to kneel down with him and held his hand and prayed and even while they kneeled and alfred prayed death and life met and fought for them under the door tight as it was and through the keyhole struggled a hot stifling smoke merciful destroyer running before fire and the shadow of a gigantic figure began to flicker in from the outside and to come and go upon the wall alfred did not know what that was but it gave him a vague hope he prayed aloud as men pray only for their bodies the crowd heard him and hushed itself breathless the smoke penetrated faster blinding and stifling the giant shadow came and went but now the greater part of the roof fell in with an awful report the blazing timbers thundered down to the basement with endless clatter of redhot tiles the walls quivered and the building belched skyward a thousand jets of fire like a bouquet of rockets and then a cloud of smoke alfred gave up all hope and prepared to die crash as if discharged from a cannon came bursting through the window with the roar of an applauding multitude and a mothers unheeded scream a helmeted figure rope in hand and alighted erect and commanding on the floor amidst a shower of splinters and tinkling glass up men for your lives roared this firewarrior clutching them hard and dragged them both up to their feet by one prodigious gesture all three faces came together and shone in the lurid light and he knew his father and the wretch and the wretch knew him oh ah passed like pistol shots but not a word even this strange meeting went for little so awful was the moment so great are death and fire edward clawed his rope to the bed up to the window by it dropped his line to fireman jackson planted express below and in another moment was hauling up a rope ladder this he attached and getting on it and holding his own rope by way of banister cried now men quick for your lives but poor david called that deserting the ship and demurred till alfred assured him the captain had ordered it he then submitted directly touched his forelock to edward whom he took for that officer and went down the ladder alfred followed now the moment those two figures emerged from the burning pile mrs dodd already half dead with terror for her son saw and knew her husband for all about him it was as light as day what terror what joy what gratitude what pride what a tempest of emotions but her fears were not ended edward not to overweight the ladder went dangling by his hands along the rope towards the tree and his mothers eyes stared fearfully from him to the other and her heart hung trembling on her husband descending cautiously and then on his preserver her son who was dangling along by the hands on that frail support the mob cheered him royally but she screamed and hid her face again at last both her darlings were safe and then the lusty cheers made her thrill with pride and joy till all of a sudden they seemed to die away and the terrible fire to go out and the soretried wife and mother drooped her head and swooned away wedged in and kept from falling by the crowd inside the mob parted and made two rushes one at the rescued men one at the gallant fireman alfred and david were overpowered with curiosity and sympathy they had to shake a hundred honest hands and others still pressing on hurried them nearly off their feet gently good friends dont part us said alfred he is the keeper said one of the crowd yes im his keeper and i want to get him quietly away this excitement will do him harm else good friends help me out by that door all right was the cry and they rushed with him to the back door rooke who was about twenty yards off saw and suspected this movement he fought his way and struggled after alfred in silence presently to his surprise alfred unlocked the door and whipped out with david leaving the door open rooke shouted and halloaed stop him he is escaping and struggled madly to the door now another crowd had been waiting in the meadows seeing the door open they rushed in and the doorway was jammed directly in the confusion alfred drew david along the side of the wall told him to stay quiet bolted behind an outhouse and then ran across country for the bare life to his horror david followed him and with a madmans agility soon caught him he snorted like a spirited horse and shouted cheerily go ahead messmate i smell blue water come on then cried alfred half mad himself with excitement and the pair ran furiously and dashed through hedges and ditches torn bleeding splashed triumphant behind them the burning madhouse above them the spangled sky the fresh free air of liberty blowing in their nostrils and rushing past their ears alfreds chest expanded he laughed for joy he sang for joy he leaped as he went nor did he care where he went david took the command and kept snuffing the air and shaping his course for blue water and so they rushed along the livelong night free chapter xliv a report came round that the asylum was open in the rear a rush was made thither from the front and this thinned the crowd considerably so then mrs dodd was got out by the help of some humane persons and carried into the nearest house more dead than alive there she found mrs archbold in a pitiable state that lady had been looking on the fire with the key in her pocket by taking which she was like to be a murderess her terror and remorse were distracting and the revulsion had thrown her into violent hysterics mrs dodd plucked up a little strength and characteristically enough tottered to her assistance and called for the best remedies and then took her hand and pressed it and whispered soothingly that both were now safe meaning david and edward mrs archbold thought she meant alfred and david this new shock was as good for her as cold water she became quieter and presently gulped out you saw them you knew them ump all that way off knew them said mrs dodd why one was my husband and the other my son mrs archbold gave a sigh of relief yes madam continued mrs dodd the young fireman who went and saved my husband was my own son my edward my hero oh i am a happy wife a proud mother she could say no more for tears of joy and while she wept deliciously mrs archbold cried too and so invigorated and refreshed her cunning and presently she perked up and told mrs dodd boldly that edward had been seeking her and was gone home she had better follow him or he would be anxious but my poor husband objected mrs dodd he is safe said the other i saw him ump with an attendant ah said mrs dodd with meaning that other my son rescued was an attendant was he yes ump she then promised to take david under her especial care and mrs dodd consented though reluctantly to go home to her surprise edward had not yet arrived and julia was sitting up very anxious and flew at her with a gurgle and kissed her eagerly and then drawing back her head searched the maternal eyes for what was the matter ah you may well look said mrs dodd oh my child what a night this has been and she sank into a chair and held up her arms julia settled down in them directly and in that position mrs dodd told all the nights work told it under a running accompaniment of sighs and kisses and ejaculations and dear mammas and poor mammas and bursts of sympathy astonishment pity and wonder thus embellished and interrupted the strange tale was hardly ended when a manly step came up the stairs and both ladies pinched each other and were still as mice and in walked a fireman with a wet livery and a face smirched with smoke julia flew at him with a gurgle of the first degree and threw her arms round his neck and kissed both his blackened cheeks again and again crying oh my own my precious my sweet brave darling kiss me kiss me kiss me you are a hero a christian hero that saves life not takes it mrs dodd checked her impetuous career by asking piteously if his mother was not to have him on this julia drew him along by the hand and sank with him at mrs dodds knees and she held him at arms length and gazed at him and then drew him close and enfolded him and thanked god for him and then they both embraced him at once and interwove him heaven knows how and poured the wealth of their womanly hearts out on him in a torrent and nearly made him snivel but presently something in his face struck mrs dodd accustomed to read her children is there anything the matter love she inquired anxiously he looked down and said i am dead sleepy mamma for one thing of course he is poor child said julia doing the submaternal wait till i see everything is comfortable and she flew off turned suddenly at the door with oh you darling and up to his bedroom and put more coals on his fire and took a swift housewifely look all round mrs dodd seized the opportunity edward there is something amiss and no mistake said he drily but i thought if i told you before her you might scold me scold you love never hush ill come to your room byandby soon after this they all bade each other good night and presently mrs dodd came and tapped softly at her sons door and found him with his vest and coat off and his helmet standing on the table reflecting a red coal he was seated by the fire in a brown study smoking he apologised and offered to throw the weed away no no said she suppressing a cough not if it does you good well mother when you are in a fix smoke is a soother you know and im in a regular fix a fix sighed mrs dodd resignedly and waited patiently all ears mamma said the firewarrior becoming speculative under the dreamy influence of the weed i wonder whether such a muddle ever was before when a man is fighting with fire what with the heat and what with the excitement his pulse is at a hundred and sixty and his brain all in a whirl and he scarce knows what he is doing till after it is done but ive been thinking of it all since puff there was my poor little mamma in the mob i double myself up for my spring and i go at the window and through it now on this side of it i hear my mother cry edward come down on the other side i fall on two men perishing in an oven one is my own father and the other is who do you think the wretch mrs dodd held up her hands in mute amazement i had promised to break every bone in his skin at our first meeting and i kept my promise by saving his skin and bones and life and all puff mrs dodd groaned aloud i thought it was he she said faintly that tall figure that haughty grace but mrs archbold told me positively it was an attendant then she told you a cracker it was not an attendant but a madman and that madman was alfred hardie upon my soul our julias missing bridegroom he smoked on in profound silence waiting for her to speak but she lay back in her chair mute and all relaxed as if the news had knocked her down come now said edward at last what is to be done may i tell julia that is the question not for the world said mrs dodd shocked into energy would you blight her young life for ever as mine is blighted she then assured him that if alfreds sad state came to julias ears all her love for him would revive and she would break with mr hurd and indeed never marry all her life i see no end to her misery continued mrs dodd with a deep sigh for she is full of courage she would not shrink from a madhouse why she visits lazarhouses every day she would be always going to see her alfred and so nurse her pity and her unhappy love no no let me be a widow with a living husband if it is gods will i have had my happy days but my child she shall not be so withered in the flower of her days for any man that ever breathed she shall not i say the mother could utter no more for emotion well said edward you know best i generally make a mess of it when i disobey you but concealments are bad things too we used to go with our bosoms open ah puff edward said mrs dodd after some consideration the best thing is to marry her to mr hurd at once he has spoken to me for her and i sounded her has he well and what did she say she said she would rather not marry at all but live and die with me then i pressed her a little you know then she did say she could never marry any but a clergyman now she had lost her poor alfred and then i told her i thought mr hurd could make her happy and she would make me happy if she could esteem him and marry him well mamma and what then why then my poor child gave me a look that haunts me stilla look of unutterable love and reproach and resignation and despair and burst out crying so piteously i could say no more oh oh oh oh dont you cry mammy dear said edward ah i remember when a tear was a wonder in our house and the firewarrior sucked at his cigar to stop a sigh and nnow not a dday without them sighed mrs dodd but you have cost me none my precious boy im waiting my time puff mamma take my advice dont you fidget so let things alone why hurry her into marrying mr hurd or anybody look here ill keep dark to please you if youll keep quiet to please me at breakfast time came a messenger with a line from mrs archbold to say that david had escaped from drayton house in company with another dangerous maniac mrs dodd received the blow with a kind of desperate resignation she rose quietly from the table without a word and went to put on her bonnet leaving her breakfast and the note for she did not at once see all that was implied in the communication she took edward with her to drayton house the firemen had saved one half of that building the rest was a black shell mrs archbold came to them looking haggard and told them two keepers were already scouring the country and an advertisement sent to all the journals oh madam said mrs dodd if the other should hurt him or lead him somewhere to his death mrs archbold said she might dismiss this fear the patient in question had but one illusion and though terribly dangerous when thwarted in that was most intelligent in a general way and much attached to mr dodd they were always together a strange expression shot into mrs dodds eye she pinched edwards arm to keep him quiet and said with feigned indifference then it was the one who was in such danger with my husband last night yes said mrs archbold off her guard it had not occurred to her that this handsome fashionablydressed young gentleman was the fireman of last night she saw her mistake though the moment he said bluntly why you told my mother it was an attendant did i madam asked mrs archbold mighty innocently i suppose i thought so well i was mistaken unfortunately mrs dodd was silent a moment then somewhat hastily bade mrs archbold goodbye she told the cabman to drive to an old acquaintance of ours mr green he had set up detective on his own account he was not at his office but expected she sat patiently down till he came in they put their heads together and green dashed down to the asylum with a myrmidon while mrs dodd went into the city to obtain leave of absence from cross and co this was politely declined at first but on mrs dodd showing symptoms of leaving them altogether it was conceded she returned home with edward and there was mr green he had actually traced the fugitives by broken fences and occasional footsteps in the side clay of ditches so far as to leave no doubt they had got upon the great southeastern road then mrs dodd had a female inspiration the dover road ah my husband will make for the sea i shouldnt wonder being a sailor said green it is a pleasure to work with a lady like you that puts in a good hint know anything about the other one maam mrs dodd almost started at this offhand question but it was a natural one for green to ask she said gravely i do to my cost greens eye sparkled and he took out his notebook now where is he like to make for mrs dodd seemed to wince at the question and then turned her eyes inward to divine the result was she gave a downright shudder and said evasively being with david i hope and pray he will go towards the coast no no said green it wont do to count on that altogether how do we know which of the two will lead the other you must please to put mr dodd out of the question maam for a moment now well say no had escaped alone where would he be like to run to mrs dodd thus pressed turned her eyes more and more inward and said at last in a very low voice and with a sort of concentrated horrorhe will come to my house mr green booked this eagerly the ladys emotion was nothing to him the hint was invaluable the combination interesting well maam said he ill plant a good man in sight of your door and ill take the dover road directly with my drag my teeth werent strong enough for the last nut you gave me to crack let us try this one tom green isnt often beat twice running i will go with you mr green honoured and proud maam but a lady like you in my dogcart along o me and my mate mrs dodd waived this objection almost contemptuously she was all wife now it was agreed that green should drive round for her in an hour he departed for the present and edward proposed to go in the dogcart too but she told him no she wanted him at home to guard his sister against the wretch then seeing him look puzzled consider edward said she he is not like your poor father he has not forgotten that advertisement aileen aroon it was from him you know and then why does he attach himself so to poor papa do you not see it is because he is julias father the wretch loves her still edward from puzzled looked very grave what a head you have got mamma he said i should never have seen all this yet its plain enough now as you put it yes it is plain our darling is betrothed to a maniac that maniac loves her and much i fear she loves him some new calamity is impending oh my son i feel it already heavy on my heart what is it to be is your father to be led to destruction or will that furious wretch burst in upon your sister and kill her or perhaps kill mr hard if he catches them together what may not happen now the very air seems to me swarming with calamities oh ill take care of all that said edward and he comforted her a little by promising faithfully not to let julia go out of his sight till her return she put on a plain travellingdress the dogcart came she slipped fifty sovereigns into mr greens hands for expenses and off they went at a slapping pace the horse was a great bony hunter of rare speed and endurance and his long stride and powerful action raised poor mrs dodds hopes and the rushing air did her good green to her surprise made few inquiries for some miles on the dover road but he explained to her that the parties they were after had probably walked all night they dont tire that sort said mr green at dartford they got a doubtful intimation on the strength of which he rattled on to rochester there he pulled up deposited mrs dodd at the principal inn till morning and scoured the town for intelligence he inquired of all the policemen described his men and shrewdly added out of his intelligence both splashed and dirty no the bobbies had not seen them then he walked out to the side of the town nearest london and examined all the dealers in food at last he found a baker who early that morning had sold a quartern loaf to two tall men without hats and splashed fearful he added thought they had broken prison but twas no business of mine they paid for the bread right enough on hearing they had entered rochester hatless the shrewd mr green made direct to the very nearest slopshop and his sagacity was rewarded the shopkeeper was a chatterbox and told him yes two gents out on a frolic had bought a couple of hats of him and a whole set of sailors clothes i think they were respectable too but nothing else would satisfy him so the young one he humoured him and bought them i took his old ones in exchange at that green offered a sovereign for the old clothes blindfold the trader instantly asked two pounds and took thirty shillings green now set the police to scour the town for a gentleman and a common sailor in company offered a handsome reward and went to bed in a small inn with davids clothes by the kitchen fire early in the morning he went to mrs dodds hotel with davids clothes nicely dried and told her his tale she knew the clothes directly kissed them and cried over them then gave him her hand with a world of dignity and grace what an able man sir you inspire me with great confidence and you me with zeal maam said the delighted green why id go through fire and water for a lady like you that pays well and doesnt grudge a fellow a bit of praise now you must eat a bit maam if its ever so little and then well take the road for the police think the parties have left the town and by their nights work they must be good travellers the dogcart took the road and the exhunter stepped out thirteen miles an hour now at this moment alfred and david were bowling along ahead with a perfect sense of security all that first night the grandest of his life alfred walked on air and drank the glorious exhilarating breath of freedom but when the sun dawned on them his intoxicating joy began to be dashed with apprehension hatless and bemired might they not be suspected and detained by some officious authority but the slopshop set that all right he took a doublebedded room in the bear locked the door put the key under his pillow and slept till eleven at noon they were on the road again and as they swung lustily along in the frosty but kindly air alfreds chest expanded his spirits rose and he felt a man all over exhilarated by freedom youth and motion and a little inflated by reviving vanity his heart buoyant as his foot now began to nurse aspiring projects he would indict his own father and the doctors and immolate them on the altar of justice and publicly wipe off the stigma they had cast on him and meantime he would cure david and restore him to his family he loved this harmless companion of his cell his danger and his flight loved him for julias sake loved him for his own youth and vanity whispered i know more about madness than the doctors i have seen it closer it struck him davids longing for blue water was one of those unerring instincts that sometimes guide the sick to their cure and then as the law permits the forcible recapture of a patientwithout a fresh order or certificateswithin fourteen days of his escape from an asylum he did not think it prudent to show himself in london till that time should have elapsed so all things considered why not hide a few days with david in some insignificant seaport and revel in liberty and blue water with him all day long and so by associations touch the spring of memory and begin the cure as for david he seemed driven seaward by some unseen spur he fidgeted at all delay even dinner fretted him he panted so for his natural element alfred humoured him and an hour after sunset they reached the town of canterbury here alfred took the same precautions as before and slept till nine oclock when he awoke he found david walking to and fro impatiently all right messmate said alfred we shall soon be in blue water he made all haste and they were on the road again by ten walking at a gallant pace but the dogcart was already rattling along about thirty miles behind them green inquired at all the turnpikes and vehicles the scent was cold at first but warmer by degrees and hot at canterbury green just baited his gallant horse and came foaming on and just as the pair entered the town of folkestone their pursuers came up to the crossroads not five miles behind them alfred went to a good inn in folkestone and ordered a steak then strolled with david by the beach and gloried in the water with him after dinner we will take a boat and have a sail said he see theres a nice boat riding at anchor there david snuffed the breeze and his eye sparkled and he said wind due east messmate and this remark slight as it was was practical and gave alfred great delight strengthened his growing conviction that not for nothing had this charge been thrown on him he should be the one to cure his own father for julias father was his he had no father now all right said he gaily well soon be on blue water but first well have our dinner old boy for i am starving david said nothing and went rather doggedly back to the inn with him the steak was on the table alfred told the waiter to uncover and david to fall to while he just ran upstairs to wash his hands he came down in less than two minutes but david was gone and the waiter standing there erect and apathetic like a wooden sentinel why where is he said alfred gents gone out was the reply and you stood there and let him you born idiot which way is he gone i dont know said the waiter angrily i aint a pliceman none but respectable gents comes here as dont want watching alfred darted out and scoured the town he asked everybody if they had seen a tall gentleman dressed like a common sailor nobody could tell him there were so many sailors about the port that which in an inland town would have betrayed the truant concealed him here a cold perspiration began to gather on alfreds brow as he ran wildly all over the place he could not find him nor any trace of him at last it struck him that he had originally proposed to go to dover and had spoken of that town to david though he had now glanced aside making for the smaller ports on the south coast he hired a horse directly and galloped furiously to dover he rode down to the pier gave his horse to a boy to hold and ran about inquiring far david he could not find him but at last he found a policeman who told him he thought there was another party on the same lay as himself no said the man correcting himself it was two they were after a gentleman and a sailor perhaps you are his mate alfreds blood ran cold pursued and so hotly no no he stammered i suspect i am on the same business then he said cunningly for asylums teach the frankest natures cunning come and have a glass of grog and tell me all about it bobby consented and under its influence described mrs dodd and her companions to him but not everybody can describe minutely in the bare outlines which were all this artist could furnish him alfred recognised at once whom do you think mrs archbold dr wolf and his arch enemy rooke the keeper doubtless his own mind seizing on so vague a description adapted it rather hastily to what seemed probable mrs dodd never occurred to him nor that david was the sole or even the main object of the pursuit he was thoroughly puzzled what to do however as his pursuers had clearly scoured dover and would have found david if there he made use of their labours and galloped back towards folkestone but he took the precaution to inquire at the first turnpike and there he learned a lady and two men had passed through about an hour before in a dogcart it was a wonder he had missed them alfred gnashed his teeth curse you he muttered well do my work in folkestone ill find him yet and baffle you he turned his horses head westward and rode after david convinced that his lost friend would not go inland he took care to keep near the cliffs and had ever an eye on the beach when the road came near enough about eight miles west of folkestone he saw a dogcart going down a hill before him but there was only a single person in it however he increased his pace and got close behind it as it mounted the succeeding hill which was a high one walking leisurely behind it his quick eye caught sight of a ladys veil wrapped round the iron of the seat that made him instantly suspect this might be the dogcart after all but if so how came a stranger in it he despised a single foe and resolved to pump this one and learn where the others were while he was thinking how he should begin the dogcart stopped at the top of the hill and the driver looked seaward at some object that appeared to interest him it was a glorious scene viewed from so great a height the sea expanded like ocean and its lightblue waters sparkled and laughed innumerable in the breeze a beautiful sight sir said the escaped prisoner you may well stop to look at it the man touched his hat and chuckled i dont think you know what i am looking at sir he said politely i thought it was the lovely sea view so bright so broad so free no sir not but what i can enjoy that a bit too but what im looking at is an unt do you see that little boat sailing right down the coast about eight miles off well sir what do you think there is in that boat but youll never guess a madman ah curious sir isnt it a respectable gentleman too he is and sails well only stark staring mad there was two of em in company but it seems they cant keep together long our one steals a fishermans boat and there he goes down channel and now look here sir see this steamtug smoking along right in front of us shes after him and see theres my governor aboard standing by the wheel with a bobby and a lady and if ever there was a lady shes one here he lowered his voice shes that mad gentlemans wife sir as i am a living sinner they both looked down on the strange chase in silence will they catch her asked alfred at last under his breath how can we be off it steam against sails and if he runs ashore i shall be there to nab him alfred looked and looked the water came into his eyes its the best thing that can befall him now he murmured he gave the man halfacrown and then turned his horses head and walked him down the hill towards folkestone on his arrival there he paid for his horse and his untasted dinner and took the first train to london a little dispirited and a good deal mortified for he hated to be beat but david was in good hands that was one comfort and he had glorious work on hand love and justice he went to an out of the way inn in the suburbs and when he had bought a carpetbag and some linen and other necessaries he had but one sovereign left his heart urged him vehemently to go at once and find his julia but alas he did not even know where she lived and he dared not at present make public inquiries that would draw attention to himself and be his destruction for wolf stood well with the police and nearly always recaptured his truant patients by their aid before the fourteen days had elapsed he determined to go first to a solicitor and launch him against his enemies while compelled to shirk them in his own person curious position now amongst his fathers creditors was mr compton a solicitor known for an eccentric but honourable man and for success in litigation mr compton used to do his own business in barkington and employ an agent in london but alfred remembered to have heard just before his incarceration that he had reversed the parts and now lived in london alfred found him out by the directory and called at his chambers in lincolns inn fields he had to wait some time in the outer office listening to a fluent earnest client preaching within but presently a sharp voice broke in upon the drone and after a few sentences mr compton ushered out a client with these remarkable words and as for your invention it has been invented four times before you invented it and never was worth inventing at all and you have borrowed two hundred pounds of me in ninety loans each of which cost me an hours invaluable time i hold ninety acknowledgments in your handwriting and ill put them all in force for my protection with this he turned to his head clerk mr colls take out a writ against this client what is your christian name sir i forget simon said the gaping client off his guard thank you sir said mr compton with sudden politeness then resuming hostilitiesa writ in the common pleas against simon macfarlane keep it in your drawer colls and if ever the said macfarlane does me the honour to call on me again serve him with it on the spot and if not not good morning sir and with this he bolted into his own room and slammed its door the clerks opened the outer door to mr macfarlane with significant grins and he went out bewildered sorely yea even like one that walketh abroad in his sleep now sir said mr colls cheerfully to alfred but the new client naturally hesitated now he put on his most fascinating smile and said well mr colls what do you advise is this a moment to beard the lion in his den at alfreds smile and address colls fell in love with him directly and assured him sotto voce and with friendly familiarity that now was his time why hell be as sweet as honey now he has got rid of a client with this he took alfreds name and ushered him into a room piled with japanned tin boxes where mr compton sat looking all complacency at a large desk table on which briefs and drafts and letters lay in seeming confusion he rose and with a benignant courtesy invited alfred to sit down and explain his business the reader is aware our oxonian could make a close and luminous statement he began at the beginning but soon disposed of preliminaries and came to his capture at silverton then mr compton quietly rang the bell and with a slight apology to alfred requested colls to search for the draft of mrs holloways will alfred continued mr compton listened keenly noted the salient points on a sheet of briefpaper and demanded the exact dates of every important event related the story finished the attorney turned to colls and said mighty coolly you may go the will is in my pocket but i made sure he was a madman they generally are these illused clients exit colls got a copy of the settlement sir under which you take this ten thousand pounds no sir any lawyer seen it oh yes mr crauford down at barkington good friend of mine ill write to him names and addresses of your trustees alfred gave them you have brought the order on which you were confined and the two certificates not i said alfred i have begged and prayed for a sight of them and never could get one that is one of the galling iniquities of the system i call it the double shuffle just bring your mind to bear on this sir the prisoner whose wits and liberty have been signed away behind his back is not allowed to see the order and certificate on which he is confineduntil after his release that release he is to obtain by combating the statements in the order and certificates so to get out he must first see and contradict the lies that put him in but to see the lies that put him in he must first get out so runs the circle of iniquity now is that the injustice of earth or the injustice of hell mr compton asked a moment to consider well i think is of the earth earthy theres a mixture of idiocy in it the devil might fairly repudiate young gentleman the english statutes of lunacy are famous monuments of legislatorial incapacity and indeed as a general rule if you want justice and wisdom dont you go to acts of parliament but to the common law of england alfred did not appreciate this observation he made no reply to it but inquired with some heat what he could do to punish the whole gang his father the certifying doctors and the madhouse keepers humph you might indict them all for a conspiracy said mr compton but you would be defeated as a rule avoid criminal proceedings where you have a civil remedy a jury will give a verdict and damages where they would not convict on the same evidence yours is just one of those cases where temper says indict but prudence says sue and law through john compton its oracle in this square says sue the defendant and no other now who is the true defendant here or party liable in law the keeper of the asylum for one no if i remember right all proceedings against him are expressly barred by a provision in the last statute let us see he took down the statutes of the realm and showed alfred the clause which raises the proprietor of a madhouse above the civic level of prince royal curse the law said alfred bitterly no dont curse the law curse the act if you like but we cant get on without the law neither of us try again the certifying doctor sir humph said mr compton knitting his brows a jury might give you a verdict but it would probably be set aside by the full court or else by a court of error for unless you could prove informality barefaced negligence or mala fides what does it come to a professional man bound to give medical opinions to all comers is consulted about you and says he thinks you are insane you turn out sane well then he was mistaken but not more than he is in most of his professional opinions we lawyers know what guesswork medicine is we see it in the witnessbox i hate suing opinions it is like firing bullets at snipes in a wind try again alfred groaned why there is nobody left but the rogue who signed the order and if you were a lawyer that alone would tell you he is the defendant where a legal wrong has been committed by a b and c and there is no remedy against a or b there must either be one against c or none at all but this law abhors as nature does a vacuum besides this defendant has done the wrong complained of in his person you sue an act not an opinion but of course you are not cool enough to see all this just at first cool sir said alfred despairingly i am frozen with your remorseless law what of all these villains may i only attack one and cant i imprison even him as he has me such narrow law encourages men to violence who burn under wrongs like mine mr compton looked keenly at his agitated mortified client but made no concession he gave him a minute to digest the laws first bitter pill and then said if i am to act for you you had better write a line to the commissioners of lunacy requesting them to hand me copies of the order and certificates alfred wrote it and now said mr compton thoughtfully i dont think they will venture to recapture you during the fourteen days but still they might and we attorneys are wary animals so please give me at once a full authority to act under advice of counsel for your protection alfred wrote as requested and mr compton put the paper in his drawer remarking with this i can proceed by law or equity even should you get into the asylum again he then dismissed alfred somewhat abruptly but with an invitation to call again after three clear days like most ardent suitors after their first interview with passionless law he went away sadly chilled and so home to his cheerless lodging to count the hours till he could see julia and learn his fate from her lips this very morning a hasty note came to edward from folkestone worded thus oh edward my worst misgivings the two have parted poor papa has taken a mans boat and is in sight we shall follow directly in a steamboat but the other you know my fears you must be father and mother to that poor child till i come homeyour sad mother lucy dodd julia held out her hand for the note edward put it in his pocket what is that for said the young lady why surely i may put my own property in my pocket oh certainly i only want to look at it first excuse me are you in earnest edward not let me see dear mammas letter and the vivid face looked piteously surprised oh ill tell you the contents papa had got to folkestone and taken a boat and gone to sea then mamma took a steamboat and after him so she will soon catch him and is not that a comfort oh yes cried julia and was for some time too interested and excited to think of anything else but presently she returned to the charge anything else dear humph well not of equal importance oh if it is of no importance there can be no reason for not telling me what was it edward coloured but said nothing he thought however and thus ran his thoughts shes my intellectual superior and ive got to deceive her and a nice mess i shall make of it it is of importance said julia eyeing him you have told a story and you dont love your sister this fulminated she drew herself up proudly and was silent a minute afterwards stealing a look at her he saw her eyes suddenly fill with tears apropos of nothing tangible now this is nice said he to himself at noon she put on her bonnet to visit her district he put on his hat directly and accompanied her great was her innocent pleasure at that it was the first time he had done her the honour she took him to her poor people and showed him off with innocent pride hannah this is my brother then in a whisper isnt he beautiful presently she saw him looking pale unheard of phenomenon there now you are ill said she come home directly and be nursed no no said he i only want a little fresh air what horrid places what horrid sights and smells i say you must have no end of pluck to face them no no no dearest i pray for strength that is how i manage and oh edward you used to think the poor were not to be pitied but now you see yes i see and smell and all you are a brave good girl got any salts about you yes of course there but fancy a young lion smelling salts a young duffer you mean that has passed for game through the thing not being looked into close oh you can he close enough where i want you to be open no answer the next day he accompanied her again but remained at the stairfoot while she went in to her patients and when she came down asked her could no good christian be found to knock that poor woman on the head who lived in a plate no good heathen you mean said julia why yes said he the savages manage these things better he also accompanied her shopping and smoked phlegmatically outside the shops nor could she exhaust his patience then the quick girl put this and that together when they were at home again and her bonnet off she looked him in the face and said sweetly i have got a watchdog he smiled and said nothing why dont you answer cried julia impetuously because least said is soonest mended besides im down upon you you decoy me into a friendly conversation and then you say biting things directly if i bite you you sting me such want of confidence oh how cruel how cruel why can you not trust me am i a child no one is young who has suffered what i have suffered secrets disunite a family and we were so united and then you are so stupid you keep a secret yes like a dog in a chain you cant hide it one bit you have undertaken a task you are not fit for sir to hide a secret you must be able to tell fibs and you cant not for want of badness but cleverness to tell them smoothly you know it you know it and so out of your abominable slyness you wont say a word there it is no use my trying to provoke him i wish you were not so goodtempered so apathetic i mean of course then with one of her old rapid transitions she began to caress him and fawn on him she seated him in an armchair and herself on a footstool and suddenly curling round his neck murmured dear dear brother have pity on a poor girl and tell her is there any news that i have a right to hear only mamma has given you your orders not to tell me tell me love this last in an exquisite whisper let me alone you little fascinating demon said he angrily ask mamma i wont tell you a word thank you she cried bounding to her feet you have told me he is alive he loves me still he was bewitched seduced deluded he has come to himself mamma has seen him he wants to come and beg my pardon but you are all afraid i shall forgive him but i will not for at the first word ill stop his mouth and say if you were happy away from me i suppose you would not have come back and instantly she burst out singing with inspired eloquence and defiance castles are sacked in war chieftains are scattered far truth is a fixed star aileen aroon but unable to sustain it the poor impetuosity dropped as quickly as she had mounted and out went her arm on the table and her forehead sank on her arm and the tears began to run silently down the sweet face so brave for a moment wwill yyou allow me to light a cigar said edward im wretched and miserable you tempest in petticoats you she made him a sign of assent with the hand that was dangling languidly but she did not speak nor did she appeal to him any more alienation was commencing but what was worse than speaking her mind she was for ever at the window now looking up and down the street and walking with her he felt her arm often tremble and sometimes jerk the secret was agitating her nerves and destroying her tranquillity as much or perhaps more than if she had known all mrs dodd wrote from portsmouth whereof anon mr peterson called and soon after him mr hurd edward was glad to see them especially the latter whose visits seemed always to do julia good moreover as peterson and hurd were rivals it afforded edward an innocent amusement to see their illconcealed aversion to one another and the admirable address and delicacy with which his sister conducted herself between them however this pastime was cut short by sarah coming in and saying theres a young man wants to see you sir julia looked up and changed colour i think he is a fireman said sarah she knew very well he was a fireman and also one of her followers edward went out and found one of his late brethren who told him a young gentleman had just been inquiring for him at the station what was he like why i was a good ways off but i saw he was a tall one six feet full that give you his name no i didnt speak to him it was andrew andrew says he asked if there was a fireman called dodd so andrew said you had left then the swell asked where you lived and andrew couldnt tell him any more than it was in pembroke street so i told him says i why couldnt you call me it is number sixtysix says i oh he is coming back says andrew however i thought id come and tell you and so get a word with sarah you sly dog edward thanked him and put on his hat directly for he could not disguise from himself that this visitor might be alfred hardie indeed what more likely messrs hurd and peterson always tried to stay one another out whenever they met at pembroke street however to make sure of not leaving julia alone edward went in and asked them both to luncheon at which time he said he should be back as he walked rapidly to the station he grew more and more convinced that it was alfred hardie and his reflections ran like this what a headpiece mamma has but it did not strike her he would come to me first yet how plain that looks now for of course im the duffers only clue to julia these madmen are no fools though and how quiet he was that night and he made papa go down the ladder first that was the old alfred hardie he was always generous vain overhearing saucy but noble with it all i liked him he was a man that showed you his worst and let you find his best out by degrees he hated to be beat but thats no crime he was a beautiful oar and handled his mawleys uncommon he sparred with all the prizefighters that came to oxford and took punishment better than you would think and a wonderful quick hitter alec reed owned that poor taff hardie and when i think that god has overthrown his powerful mind and left me mine such as it is but the worst is my having gone on calling him the wretch all this time and nothing too bad for him i ought to be ashamed of myself it grieves me very much when found make a note on never judge a fellow behind his back again arrived at the station he inquired whether his friend had called again and was answered in the negative he waited a few minutes and then with the superintendents permission wrote a note to alfred inviting him to dine at simpsons at six and left it with the fireman this done he was about to return home when another thought struck him he got a messenger and sent off a single line to dr wolf to tell him alfred hardie would be at simpsons at seven o clock but when the messenger was gone he regretted what he had done he had done it for alfreds good but still it was treason he felt unhappy and wended his way homeward disconsolately realising more and more that he had not brains for the difficulties imposed upon him on entering pembroke street he heard a buzz he looked up and saw a considerable crowd collected in a semicircle why that is near our house he said and quickened his steps when he got near he saw that all the peoples eyes were bent on no he dashed into the crowd what on earth is the matter he cried the matter plentys the matter young man cried one murders the matter said another at that he turned pale as death an intelligent man saw his violent agitation and asked him hurriedly if he belonged to the house yes for mercys sake what is it make way there shouted the man he belongs sir a madman has broke loose and got into your house and im sorry to say he has just killed two men with a pistol cried several voices speaking together chapter xlv alfred hardie spent three days writhing in his little lodging his situation had been sadder but never more irritating by right possessor of thousands yet in fact reduced to one suit two shirts and halfacrown rich in intellect yet hunted as a madman affianced to the loveliest girl in england yet afraid to go near her for fear of being torn from her again and for ever all this could last but one week more but a weeks positive torture was no trifle to contemplate with a rival at his julias ear all the time suppose she should have been faithful all these months but in this last week should be worn out and give herself to another such things had been known he went to lincolns inn with this irritating fear tearing him like a vulture mr compton received him cheerfully and told him he had begun operations in hardie versus hardie had written to thomas hardie two days ago and inquired his london solicitor and whether that gentleman would accept service of the writ in hardie versus hardie to thomas hardie why what has he to do with it asked alfred he is the defendant in the suit then seeing amazement and incredulity on alfreds face he explained that the commissioners of lunacy had treated him with great courtesy had at once furnished him with copies not only of the order and certificates but of other valuable documents and there said he lies the order signed by thomas hardie of clare court yorkshire curse his impudence cried alfred in a fury why sir he is next door to an idiot himself what does that matter ah now if i had gone in a passion and indicted him there would be a defence directly no malice defendant being non compos whereas by gently quietly suing him even if he was a lunatic we would make him or his estate pay a round sum for falsely imprisoning a sane briton bytheby here is counsels opinion on your case and he handed him a short opinion of a distinguished queens counsel the concluding words of which were these if the certificates and order are in legal form and were made and given bona fide no action lies for the capture or detention of mr hardie why it is dead against me said alfred there goes the one rotten reed you had left me singularly dead said the attorney coolly he does not even say i am of opinion he is in great practice and hardworked in his hurry he has taken up the lunacy acts and has forgotten that the rights of sane englishmen are not the creatures of these little trumpery statutes no thank you our rights are centuries older and prevail wherever by good luck the statutes of the realm are silent now they are all silent about incarcerating sane men besides he gives no cases what is an opinion without a precedent a lawyers guess i thought so little of his opinion that i sent the case to a clever junior who has got time to think before he writes colls entered soon after with the said juniors opinion mr compton opened it and saying now let us see what he says read it to alfred it ran thus there was clearly a right of action under the common law and it has been exercised anderdon v brothers paternoster v wynn c such a right can only be annulled by the express terms of a statute now the and victoria cap sect so annuls it as against the madhouse proprietor only that therefore is the statutory exception and tends to confirm the common right if the facts are as represented on which of course i can form no opinion mr hardie can safely sue the person who signed the order for his alleged false imprisonment i agree with you that the usual course by praying the court of chancery for a commission de lunatico inquirendo is timorous and rests on prejudice plt if successful is saddled with his own costs and sometimes with defts and obtains no compensation it seems clear that a jury sitting at nisi prius can deal as well with the main fact as can a jury sitting by the order of the chancellor and i need not say the costs will go with their verdict to say nothing of the damages which may be heavy on the other hand an indictment is hazardous and i think you can lose nothing by beginning with the suit by having a shorthand writer at the trial you may collect materials for an indictment and also feel the pulse of the court you can then confer upon the evidence with some counsel better versed in criminal law than myself my advice is to sue thomas hardie and declare in tort signed barrow nbi have been thus particular because hardie v hardie if carried to a verdict will probably be a leading case who shall decide when counsel disagree inquired alfred satirically that depends on where they do it if in court the judge if here the attorney you appear sanguine mr compton said alfred perhaps you would not mind advancing me a little money ive only halfacrown it is all ready for you in this drawer said compton cheerfully see thirty sovereigns then you need not go to a bank what you knew i should borrow dont all my clients begin by bleeding me it is the rule of this office then why dont you give up business because i bleed the opposite attorneys client a pound or two more than my own bleeds me he then made alfred sign a promissory note for the thirty pounds advised him to keep snug for one week more and promised to write to him in two days and send thomas hardies answer alfred left his address and went from mr compton a lighter man convinced of his courage and prudence he shifted one care off his own shoulders and thought of love alone but strange as it may appear two cares are sometimes better for a man than one alfred having now no worry to divert him from his deeper anxiety was all love and jealousy and quite overbalanced the desire of his heart grew so strong it overpowered alike his patience and his prudence he jumped into a cab and drove to all the firemens stations on the surrey side of the river inquiring for edward at last he hit upon the right one and learned that julia lived in pembroke street number unknown he drove home to his lodgings bought some readymade clothes and dressed like a gentleman then told the cabman to drive to pembroke street he knew he was acting imprudently but he could not help it and besides mr compton had now written to his uncle and begun the attack that would surely intimidate his enemies and turn their thoughts to defence not to fresh offence however catching sight of a gunsmiths shop on the way he suddenly resolved to arm himself on the bare chance of an attack he stopped the cab went in and bought a doublebarrelled pistol with powderflask bullets wads and caps complete this he loaded in the cab and felt quite prudent after it the prudence of youth he paid off the cab in pembroke street and set about the task of discovering julia he inquired at several houses but was unsuccessful then he walked slowly all down the street looking up at all the windows and i think if he had done this the day before he might have seen her or she him she was so often at the window now but just then she had company to keep her in order he was unlucky in another respect edward came out of no and went up the street when he himself was going down it not so very many yards off if alfreds face had only been turned the other way he would have seen edward and all would have gone differently the stoutest hearts have their moments of weakness and deep dejection few timings are more certain and less realised by ordinary men than this from palissy fighting with enamel to layard disinterring a city this thing is so unable to find julia in the very street she inhabited alfred felt weak against fate he said to himself if i find her i shall perhaps wish i had never sought her in his hour of dejection stern reason would be heard and asked him whether all mrs archbold had said could be pure invention and he was obliged to confess that was too unlikely then he felt so sick at heart he was half minded to turn and fly the street but there was a large yard close by him entered by a broad and lofty gateway cut through one of the houses the yard belonged to a dealer in hay two empty waggons were there but no men visible being their dinnertime alfred slipped in here and sat down on the shaft of a waggon and let his courage ooze he sighed and sighed and feared to know his fate and so he sat with his face in his hands unmanned presently a strain of music broke on his ear it seemed to come from the street he raised his head to listen he coloured his eyes sparkled he stole out on tiptoe with wondering inquiring face into the street once there he stood spellbound thrilling from his heart that seemed now on fire to his fingers ends for a heavenly voice was singing to the piano just above his head singing in earnest making the very street ring already listeners were gathering and a woman of the people said its a soul singing without a body amazing good things are said in the streets the voice was the voice of julia the song was aileen aroon the hymn of constancy so sudden and full was the bliss which poured into the long and soretried listener at this sudden answer to his fears that tears of joy trembled in his eyes wretch that i was to doubt her he said and unable to contain his longing unable to wait and listen even to that which had changed his griefs and doubts into rapture he was at the door in a moment a servant opened it miss dodd he said or rather panted you need not announce me i am an old acquaintance he could not bear any one should see the meeting between him and his beloved he went up the steep and narrow stair guided by the hymn of constancy he stopped at the door his heart was beating so violently then he turned the handle softly and stepped into the drawingroom it was a double room he took two steps and was in the opening and almost at julias back two young clergymen were bending devotedly one on each side of her it was to them she was singing the hymn of constancy alfred started back as if he had been stung and the music stopped dead short for she had heard his step and womanlike was looking into her companions eyes first to see if her ear had deceived her what she saw there brought her slowly round with a wild look her hands rose toward her face and she shrank away sideways from him as if he was a serpent and her dilated eyes looked over her cringing shoulder at him and she was pale and red and pale and red a dozen times in as many seconds he eyed her sorrowfully and sternly taking for shame that strange mixture of emotions which possessed her and so they met strange meeting for two true lovers who had parted last upon their wedding eve no doubt if they had been alone one or other would have spoken directly but the situation was complicated by the presence of two rivals and this tied their tongues they devoured one another with their eyes in silence and then julia rose slowly to her feet and began to tremble from head to foot as she looked at him is this intrusion agreeable to you miss dodd said mr hurd respectfully by way of courting her she made no reply but only looked wildly at alfred still and quivered visibly pray sir said alfred turning on mr hurd have you any right to interfere between us two none whatever said julia hastily mr hurd i need no one i will permit no one to say a word to him mr hardie knows he cannot enter a house where i amwithout an explanation what before a couple of curates do not be insolent to my friends sir said julia panting this wounded alfred deeply oh as you please said he only if you put me on my defence before strangers i shall perhaps put you to the blush before them why do you come here sir said julia not deigning to notice his threat to see my betrothed oh indeed said she bitterly in that case why have you postponed your visit so long i was in prison in prison in the worst of all prisons where i was put because i loved you where i was detained because i persisted in loving you you faithless inconstant girl he choked at these words she smileda faint uncertain smile it died away and she shook her head and said sadly defend yourself and then call me as many names as you like where was this prison it was an asylum a madhouse the girl stared at him bewildered he put his hand into his pocket and took peggys letter read that he said she held it in her hand and looked him in the face to divine the contents read it said he almost fiercely that was the decoy she held it shaking in her hands and stared at it i dont know whether she read it or not he went on the same villain who defrauded your father of his money robbed me of my wife and my liberty that silverton house was a lunatic asylum and ever since then oh julia the agony of that day i have been confined in one or other of those hells sane amongst the mad till drayton house took fire and i escaped for what to be put on my defence by you what have you suffered from our separations compared with the manifold anguish i have endured that you dare to receive the most injured and constant of mankind like this you who have had your liberty all this time and have consoled yourself for my absence with a couple of curates for shame said julia blushing to the forehead yet smiling in a way her companions could not understand miss dodd will you put up with these insults said mr hurd ay and a thousand more cried julia radiant and thank heaven for them they prove his sincerity you who have thought proper to stay and hear me insult my betrothed and put my superior on his defence look how i receive his just rebuke dear cruelly used alfred i never doubted you in my heart no not for a moment forgive me for taunting you to clear yourself you who were always the soul of truth and honour forgive me i too have suffered for i thought my alfred was dead forgive me and with this she was sinking slowly to her knees with the most touching grace all blushes tears penitence happiness and love but he caught her eagerly oh god forbid he cried and in a moment her head was on his shoulder and they mingled their tears together it was julia who recovered herself first and shrank from him a little and murmured we are not alone the misgiving came rather late and they were alone the other gentlemen had comprehended at last that it was indelicate to remain they had melted quietly away and peterson rushed down the street but hurd hung disconsolate about that very entry where alfred had just desponded before him sit by me my poor darling and tell me all said julia he began but ere he had told her about his first day at his first asylum she moaned and turned faint at the recital and her lovely head sank on his shoulder he kissed her and tried to comfort her and said he would not tell her any more but she said somewhat characteristically i insist on your telling me allall it will kill me which did not seem to alfred a cogent reason for continuing his narrative he varied it by telling her that through all his misery the thought of her had sustained him alas in the midst of their elysium a rough voice was heard in the passage inquiring for mr hardie alfred started up in dismay for it was rookes voice i am undone he cried they are coming to take me again and if they do they will drug me i am a dead man fly cried julia fly upstairs the leads he darted to the door and out on the landing it was too late rooke had just turned the corner of the stairs and saw him he whistled and rushed after alfred alfred bounded up the next flight of stairs but even as he went his fighting blood got up he remembered his pistol he drew it turned on the upper landing and levelled the weapon full at rookes forehead the man recoiled with a yell and got to a respectful distance on the second landing there he began to parley come mr hardie sir said he that is past a joke would you murder a man its no murder to kill an assassin in defence of life or liberty and ill kill you rooke as i would kill a wasp if you lay a finger on me do you hear that shouted rooke to some one below ay i hear replied the voice of hayes then loose the dog and run in after him there was a terrible silence then a scratching was heard below and above the deadly click of the pistolhammers brought to full cock and then there was a heavy pattering rush and vulcan came charging up the stairs like a lion he was halfmuzzled but that alfred did not know he stepped forward and fired at the tremendous brute somewhat unsteadily and missed him by an inch the bullet glanced off the stairs and entered the wall within a yard of rookes head ere alfred could fire again the huge brute leaped on him and knocked him down like a child and made a grab at his throat alfred with admirable presence of mind seized a banister and drawing himself up put the pistol to vulcans ear and fired the other barrel just as rooke rushed up the stairs to secure his prisoner the dog bounded into the air and fell over dead with shattered skull leaving alfred bespattered with blood and brains and half blinded but he struggled up and tore the banister out in doing so just as a heavy body fell forward at his feet it was rooke stumbling over vulcans carcass so unexpectedly thrown in his path alfred cleared his eyes with his hand and as rooke struggled up lifted the banister high above his head and with his long sinewy arm and elastic body discharged a blow frightful to look at for youth strength skill and hate all swelled and rose and struck together in that one furious gesture if the wood had held the skull must have gone as it was the banister broke over the mans head and one half went spinning up to the ceiling the mans head cracked under the banister like a glass bottle and rooke lay flat and mute within the blood running from his nose and ears alfred hurled the remnant of the banister down at hayes and the others and darted into a room it was julias bedroom and was heard to open the window and then drag furniture to the door and barricade it this done he went to load his pistol which he thought he had slipped into his pocket after felling rooke he found to his dismay it was not there the fact was it had slipped past his pocket and fallen down during the fight shriek upon shriek issued from the drawingroom but now all was still on the stairs lay vulcan dead rooke senseless below julia in a dead faint and all in little more than a minute dr wolf arrived with the police and two more keepers new ones in the place of wales and garrett discharged and urged them to break into the bedroom and capture the maniac but first he was cautious enough to set two of them to watch the back of the house there he said where that load of hay is going in that is the way to it now stand you in the yard and watch this last mandate was readily complied with for there was not much to be feared on the stones below from a maniac selfimmured on the second story but to break open that bedroom door was quite another thing the stairs were like a shambles alreadya chilling sight to the eyes of mercenary valour rooke was but just sensible the others hung back but presently the pistol was found sticking in a pool of gore this put a new face on the matter and dr wolf himself showed the qualities of a commander he sent down word to his sentinels in the yard to be prepared for any attempt on alfreds part however desperate and he sent a verbal message to a stately gentleman who was sitting anxious in lodgings over the way after bribing high ad low giving out money like water to secure the recapture and so escape what he called his unnatural sons vengeance for he knew him to be by nature bold and vindictive like himself after these preliminaries doctor wolf headed his remaining forcesto wit two keepers and two policemen and thundered at the bedroom door and summoned alfred to surrender now among the spectators who watched and listened with bated breath was one to whom this scene had an interest of its own mr hurd disconcerted by alfreds sudden reappearance and the lovers reconciliation had hung about the entry very miserable for he was sincerely attached to julia but while he was in this stupor came the posse to recapture alfred and he heard them say so then the shots were fired within then wolf and his men got in and mr hurd who was now at the door got in with them to protect julia and see this dangerous and inconvenient character disposed of he was looking demurely on at a safish distance when his late triumphant rival was summoned to surrender no reply dr wolf coaxed no reply dr wolf told him he had police as well as keepers and resistance would be idle no reply dr wolf ordered his men to break in the door after some little delay one of the keepers applied a chisel while a policeman held his truncheon ready to defend the operator the lock gave way but the door could not open for furniture after some further delay they took it off its hinges and the room stood revealed to their surprise no rush was made at them the maniac was not even in sight he is down upon his luck whispered one of the new keepers we shall find him crouched somewhere they looked under the bed he was not there they opened a cupboard three or four dresses hung from wooden pegs they searched the gowns most minutely but found no maniac hid in their ample folds presently some soot was observed lying in the grate and it was inferred he had gone up the chimney on inspection the opening appeared almost too narrow then dr wolf questioned his sentinels in the yard have you been there all the time yes sir seen nothing no sir and our eyes have never been off the window and the heads here was a mystery and not a clue to its solution the window was open but fiveandtwenty feet above the paved yard had he leaped down he must have been dashed to pieces many tongues began to go at once in the midst of which edward burst in and found the two dead men of contemporary history consisted of a dead dog and a stunned man who having a head like a bullet was now come to himself and vowing vengeance he found julia very pale supported and consoled by mr hurd he was congratulating her on her escape from a dangerous maniac she rose and tottered away from him to her brother and clung to him he said what he could to encourage her then deposited her in an armchair and went upstairs he soon satisfied himself alfred was not in the house on this he requested dr wolf and his men to leave the premises the doctor demurred edward insisted and challenged him to show a magistrates warrant for entering a private house the doctor was obliged to own he had none edward then told the policemen they were engaged in an illegal act the police had no authority to take part in these captures now the police knew that very well but being handsomely bribed they had presumed and not for the first time upon that ignorance of law which is deemed an essential part of a private citizens accomplishments in modern days in a word by temper and firmness and a smattering of law gathered from the omniscient tiser edward cleared his castle of the lawless crew but they paraded the street and watched the yard till dusk when its proprietor ran rusty and turned them out julia sat between edward and mr hurd with her head thrown back and her eyes closed and received in silence their congratulations on her escape she was thinking of his when they had quite done she opened her eyes and said send for dr sampson nobody else knows anything oh pray pray pray send for dr sampson mr hurd said he would go for dr sampson she thanked him warmly then she crept away to her bedroom and locked herself in and sat on the hearthrug and thought and thought and recalled every word and tone of her alfred comparing things old and new dr sampson was a few miles out of town visiting a patient it was nine oclock in the evening when he got julias note but he came on to pembroke street at once dr wolf and his men had retired leaving a sentinel in the street on the bare chance of alfred returning dr sampson found brother and sister sitting sadly but lovingly together julia rose upon his entrance oh doctor sampson now is hewhat they say he is how can i tell till i see m objected the doctor but you know they call people mad who are nothing of the kind for you said so sampson readily assented to this why it was but last year a surjin came to me with one jackson a tailor and said just sign a certificate for this man his wifes mad let me see her sid i what for sis he when her own husband applies excuse me sis i im not a bat im saampson i went to see her she was nairvous and excited oh i know what you come about said she but you are mistaken i questioned her kindly and she told me her husband was a great trile t her nairves i refused to sign on that disnt the tailor drown himself in the canal nixt day he was the madman and she knew it all the time but wouldnt tell us and thats a woman all over well then said julia hopefully ay but said sampson these cases are exceptions after all and the chances are nine to one hes mad daunt ye remember that was one of the solutions offered ye whem he levanted on his weddingday he added satirically and couldnt all that logic keep in a little reason this cynical speech struck julia to the heart she could not bear it and retired to her own room then dr sampson saw his mistake and said to edward with some concern maircy on us she is not in love with him still is she i thought that young parson was the man now edward shook his head but declined to go much into a topic so delicate as his sisters affections and just then an alarming letter was delivered from mrs dodd she wrote to the effect that david favoured by the wind had run into portsmouth harbour before their eyes and had disappeared hidden it was feared by one of those low publicans who provide bad ships with sailors receiving a commission on this an earnest conversation between sampson and edward it was interrupted in its turn julia burst suddenly into the room pale and violently excited clasping her hands and crying he is there his voice is like a childs oh help me he is hurt he is dying chapter xlvi julia as i have said went to her own room wounded unintentionally by a chance speech she sat down sick at heart and presently opened her window and looked out upon the starry night and wondered where alfred was now that alfred for whom nobody else had a human heart it seemed alfred my poor alfred she sighed and halfexpected to hear him reply then she said to herself they all called you false but me yet i was right and now they all call you mad but not i i believe nothing against you you are my own alfred still where have the wretches driven you to at this her feelings carried her away and she cried aloud on him despairingly and leaned upon the windowsill and the tears ran fast for him presently out of the silence of the night seemed to struggle a faint but clear voice julia she started and a muffled scream came from her then she listened all trembling again the voice sighed faintly but clear julia alfred said she quavering yes pray be cautious give no alarm the house is watched bring edward she flew downstairs and electrified edward and sampson with the news oh promise me not to betray him she cried hut said the doctor starting to his feet what should we betray him for ill cure him for you i can cure any lunatic that has lucid intervals where is he follow me gasped julia stay ill get rid of the servants first ill not play the fool and betray him to his enemies she sent sarah eastward and jane westward and then led the way through the kitchen door into the yard they all searched about and found nothing then julia begged them to be silent she whispered alfred and instantly a faint voice issued from the top of a waggon laden with hay and covered with a tarpaulin julia they all stood staring who are those with you asked alfred uneasily only friends dear edward and dr sampson ned old fellow groaned alfred you pulled me out of the fire wont you help me out of this i think my leg is broken at this julia wrung her hands and edward ran into the house for his rope and threw it over the waggon he told julia and sampson to hold on by one end and seizing the other was up on the waggon in a moment he felt about till he came to a protuberance and that was alfred under the tarpaulin in which he had cut breathingholes with his penknife edward sent julia in for a carvingknife and soon made an enormous slit through this a wellknown figure emerged into the moonlight and seemed wonderfully tall to have been so hidden his hands being uninjured he easily descended the rope and stood on one leg holding it then sampson and edward put each an arm under his and helped him into the house after the body the mind that is the rule throughout creation they examined not his reason but his leg julia stood by with clasped hands and a face beaming with pity and anxiety that repaid his pain sampson announced there were no bones broken but a bad sprain and the limb very red and swollen now inquired he briskly of the company what is the practice in sprains why leeches and cold water edward offered at once to run and get them are you mad was the reply daunt i tell ye that is the practice and isnt the practice sure to be th opposite of the remedy so get water as hot as he can bear it and no leeches julia remonstrated angrily is this a case for jesting deevil a jest in it replied the doctor well then if ye must know th operadancers apply hot water to sprains now what is their interest t expedite the cure and the faculty apply cold water and what is their interest to procrastinate the cure and make a long job of it so just hold your toungues and ring for hot water julia did not ring she beckoned edward and they flew out and soon brought a footpan of hot water edward them removed alfreds shoes and stockings and julia bared her lovely arms and blushed like a rose alfred divined her intention dear julia he said i wont let you that is too high an honour sarah can do that but julias blood was up sarah said she contemptuously she is too heavy handed andhold your tongue i dont take my orders from you then more humbly to the doctor i am a district visitor i nurse all manner of strangers and he says i must leave his poor suffering leg to the servants unnatural young monster said the doctor gim a good nip julia followed this advice by handling alfreds swollen ankle with a tenderness so exquisite and pressing it with the full sponge so softly that her divine touch soothed him as much or more than the water after nursing him into the skies a minute or two she looked up blushing in his face and said coaxingly are you mad dear alfred dont be afraid to tell us the truth the madder you are the more you need me to take care of you you know alfred smiled at this sapient discourse and said he was not the least mad and hoped to take care of her as soon as his ankle was well enough this closed that sweet mouth of hers exceeding tight and her face was seen no more for a while but hid by bending earnestly over her work only as her creamy poll turned pink the colour of that hidden face was not hard to divine then edward asked alfred how in the world he had escaped and got into that waggon the thing was incredible mirawculous said dr sampson in assent no said alfred it looks stranger to you than it is the moment i found my pistol was gone i determined to run i looked down and saw a spout with a great ornamental mouth almost big enough to sit on and while i was looking greedily at it three horses came into the yard drawing a load of hay the waggoner was busy clearing the pavement with his wheel and the waggon almost stopped a moment right under me there was a lot of loose hay on the top i let myself down and hung by the spout a moment and then leaped on to the loose hay unfortunately there were the hard trusses beneath it and so i got my sprain oh i say didnt it hurt however i crept under the hay and hid myself and saw wolfs men come into the yard byandby a few drops of rain fell and some fellows chucked down a tarpaulin from the loft and nearly smothered me so i cut a few airholes with my penknife and there i lay heaven knows how long it seemed two days at last i saw an angel at a window i called her by the name she bears on earth to my joy she answered and here i am as happy as a prince among you all and devilish hungry what a muff i was not to think of that said edward and made for the larder dear doctor said julia lifting a madonnalike face with swimming eyes i see no change in him he is very brave and daring and saucy but so he always was to be sure he says extravagant things and stares one out of countenance with his eyes well and so he always didever since i knew him maynt i even look my gratitude whined alfred yes but you need not stare it its your own fault miss julee said sampson with you fomenting his sprain the creatures fomenting his own insensate passion break every bone in a puppys body and its a puppy still and it doesnt do to spoil puppies as yere spoiling this one nlist me ye vagabin take yonr eyes off the lady and look me in the faceif ye can and tell me how you came to leave us all in the lurch on your wedding morn julia fired up it was not his fault poor thing he was decoyed away after that miserable money ah you may laugh at me for hating money but have i not good reason to hate it whist whist y impetuous cracter and let him tell his own tale alfred thus invited delivered one of his calm luminous statements which had hitherto been listened to so coldly by one official after another but the effect was mighty different falling now on folk not paid to pity as for dr sampson he bounced up very early in the narrative and went striding up and down the room he was pale with indignation and his voice trembled with emotion and every now and then he broke in on the wellgoverned narrative with oaths and curses and observations of this kindwhy dinnt ye kill um id have killed um id just have taken the first knife and killed um man our liberty is our life dith to whoever attacks it and so edward coming in with alfreds dinner on a tray found the soidisant maniac delivering his wrongs with the lofty serenity of an ancient philosopher discussing the wrongs of another julia crying furtively into the tub and the good physician trampling and raving about the room like what the stoical narrator was accused of being edward stopped and looked at them all over the tray well said he if theres a madman in the room it is not hardie ahem madman ye young ijjit roared the doctor hes no madder than i am heaven forbid said alfred drily no madder than you are ye young pump thats an ungenerous skit on edwards profession objected the maniac be quite now chattering said the excited doctor i tell ye ye niver were mad and niver will be its just the most heartless imposture the most rascally fraud ive ever caught the mad ox out in ill expose it gimme pninkpapr man theyll take y again if we dont mind but ill stop that these ineequities can only be done in the dark ill shed the light of day on em eat your dinner and hold your tongue a minuteif ye can the doctor had always a high sense of alfreds volubility he went to work and soon produced a letter headed private madhouses in this he related pithily alfreds incarceration and the present attempt to recapture him with the particulars of his escape that will interest th enemy said he drily he vouched for alfreds sanity at both dates and pledged himself to swear to it in a court of law he then inquired what it availed to have sent one tyrant to phalaris and another to versailles in defence of our liberty since after all that liberty lies grovelling at the mercy of dr pillbox and mr sawbones and a single designing relative then he drew a strong picture of this freeborn british citizen skulking and hiding at this moment from a gang of rogues and conspirators who in france and other civilised countries that brag less of liberty than we do would be themselves flying as criminals from the officers of justice and he wound up with a warm appeal to the press to cast its shield over the victim of bad laws and foul practices in england said he justice is the daughter of publicity throughout the world deeds of villainy are done every day in kid gloves but with us at all events they have to be done on the sly here lies our true moral eminence as a nation utter then your fiat lux cast the full light of publicity on this dark villainy and behold it will wither and your oppressed and injured fellowcitizen be safe from that very hour he signed it and read it out to them or rather roared it but he had written it so well he could not make it bad by delivery indeed he was a masterly writer of english you must know julia was delighted but alfred shook his head the editor will not put it in th editor dye think im so green as to trust t any one editor dye think ive lived all these years and not learned what poor cowardly things men are moral courage where can you find it except in the dickshinary few to the world their honest thoughts avow the groveller policy robs justice now and none but sampson dares to lift a hond against the curst corruption of the lond now lad im off to my printer with this they are working night and day just now there will be two hundred copies printed in half an hour and me doctor said julia am poor i to have no hand in it how cruel of you oh pray pray pray let me help a little put on your bonnet then directly said he in war never lose a minute but i am so afraid they may be lying in wait for him outside then well give them a good hiding there are three of us all good men and staunch said the indomitable doctor no no said the pugnacious alfred julia does not like fighting i heard her screaming all the time i was defending myself on the stairs let us be prudent let us throw dust in their eyes put me on a bonnet and cloak and a nice little woman youll make ye fathom oh i can stoopto conquer julia welcomed this plan almost with glee and she and edward very soon made a handsome brazenlooking trollop six feet high then it had to stoop and edward and julia helped it out to the carriage under the very noses of a policeman and a keeper who were watching for alfred seeing whichoh frailty of womanthe district visitor addressed it aloud as her aunt and begged it to take care which she afterwards observed was acting a falsehood and where was her christianity alfred was actually not recognised the carriage bowled away to the great printing house it was on that side the water the foreman entered into the thing with spirit and divided the copy small as it was among two or three compositors so a rough proof was ready in an incredibly short time the doctor corrected it and soon they began to work off the copies the foreman found them mitchells newspaper list and envelopes by the hundred and while the copies were pouring in all hands were folding and addressing them to the london and provincial editors the office lent the stamps the doctor drove alfred to his own lodgings and forbade him to reappear in pembroke street until the letter should come out in the london journals that night the letters were all posted and at daybreak were flying north south east and west in the afternoon the letter came out in four london evening papers and the next morning the metropolis and the whole kingdom were ringing with them and the full blaze of publicity burst upon this dark deed ay stout sampson well you knew mankind and well you knew the nation you lived in richard hardie in the very act of setting detectives to find alfreds lurkingplace ran his nose against this letter in the globe he collapsed at the sight of it and wrote directly to dr wolf enclosing it and saying that it would be unadvisable to make any fresh attempt his letter was crossed by one from dr wolf containing sampsons thunderbolt extracted from the sun and saying that no earthly consideration should induce him to meddle with alfred now richard hardie flung himself into the train and went down to his brother at clare court he was ill at ease he felt like some great general who has launched many attacks against the foe very successful at first then less successful then repulsed with difficulty then repulsed with ease till at last the foe stands before him impregnable then he feels that ere long that iron enemy will attack him in turn and that he exhausted by his own onslaughts must defend himself how he can yet there was a pause he passed a whole quiet peaceful day with his brother assuring him that the affair would go no further on either side but in his secret soul he felt this quiet day was but the ominous pause between two great battles one of the father against the son the other of the son against the father and he was right the very next day the late defender attacked and in earnest but for certain reasons i prefer to let another relate it hardie v hardie dear sirif you had been in my office when i received your favour of yesterday relating defts ruffianlike assault you would have seen the most ridiculous sight in naturevidelicet an attorney in a passion i threw professional courtesy to the winds and sent colls off to clare court to serve the writ personally next day he found the deft walking in his garden with mr richard hardie having learned from the servant which was his man he stepped up and served copy of the writ in the usual way deft turned pale and his knees knocked together and colls thinks he mistook himself for a felon and was going to ask for mercy but mr richard stopped him and said his attorneys were messrs heathfield in chancery lane and was this the way mr compton did business serving a writ personally on a gentleman in weak health so colls who can sneer in his quiet way told him no but the invalid had declined to answer my letter and the invalid had made a violent attack upon our clients person avoiding his attorney so as his proceedings are summary we meet him in kind says little colls oho says mr richard your are a wit are you come and have some luncheon this was to get him away from the weaker brother i take it he gave colls an excellent luncheon and some admirable conversation on policy and finance and when he was going says this agreeable host well mr you have had your bellyful of chicken and madeira and your client shall have his bellyful of law and this colls considers emphatic but coarsei am yours faithfully john compton pscolls elicited that no further attempt will be made to capture you it seems some injudicious friend of yours has been writing to the newspapers pray stop that on receiving this letter alfred bought another double pistol loaded it hired a bodyguard of two prizefighters and with these at his heels repaired to pembroke street no enemy was near the press had swept the street alike of keepers and police with one briarian gesture he found julia and edward in great anxiety about their father the immediate cause was a letter from mrs dodd which edward gave him to read but not till he had first congratulated him heartily on the aegis of the press being thrown over him the tiser has a leader on it said he mrs dodds letter ran thus my dear dear childreni am coming home to you heartbroken without your poor father i saw an east indian ship go to sea and some instinct whispered suppose he should be on board that ship but foolishly i did not utter my thoughts because they call these instincts womens fancies but now even mr green thinks he is gone to sea for the town has been ransacked and no trace of him can we find i met my cousin captain bazalgette here and he is promoted to the vulture frigate and sails today i have told him all our misfortunes and he has promised to overhaul that merchant ship if he comes up with her but i can see by the way his eye shuns mine he has no real hopes his ship is the swifter but he may pass her in the night and then he is bound for new zealand not india i told reginald my poor husbands expression of face is altered by his affliction and that he takes himself for a common sailor and has his medal still round his neck our cousin is very kind and will do all he can god can protect my darling at sea as he has ashore and in his power alone have i any trust any further stay here is vain my heart too yearns for my other treasures and dreads lest whilst i am here and because i am here some evil should befall you too expect me soon after this letter and let us try and comfort one another under this the heaviest of all our many troubleswith sad heart i am both my darlings loving mother and friend lucy dodd in the discussion of this letter alfred betrayed a slight defect of character he poohpoohed the calamity said david had now a chance and a good one of being cured whereas confinement was one of the common causes of insanity even in sane persons and he stoutly maintained that davids going to sea was a happy inspiration edward coloured but deigned no reply julia was less patient and though she was too loving and too womanly to tell alfred to his face he was deceiving himself and arguing thus indirectly to justify himself in taking her father out of the asylum at all yet she saw it and it imparted a certain coldness into her replies alfred noticed this and became less confident and louder and prodigiously logical he was still flowing on with high imperious voice which i suppose overpowered the sound of mrs dodds foot when she entered suddenly pale and weary in her travellingdress alfred stopped and they all started to their feet at sight of alfred she stood dumbfoundered a single moment then uttered a faint shriek and looked at him with unutterable terror he stood disconcerted julia ran and throwing her arms round mrs dodds neck entreated her not to be afraid of him he was not mad dr sampson said so edward confirmed her words and then julia poured out the story of his wrongs with great gushes of natural eloquence that might have melted a rock and as anticlimax is part of a true woman ended innocently by begging her mother not to look so unkindly at him and his ankle so sprained and him in such pain for the first time in her life mrs dodd was deaf to her daughters natural eloquence it was remarkable how little her countenance changed while julia appealed she stood looking askant with horror at alfred all through that gentle eloquent appeal but nevertheless her conduct showed she had heard every word as soon as ever her daughters voice stopped she seemed to dilate bodily and moved towards alfred pale and lowering yes for once this gentle quiet lady looked terrible she confronted alfred is this true sir said she in a low stern voice are you not insane have you never been bereft of your reason no mrs dodd i have not then what have you done with my husband sir chapter xlvii it was a thunderbolt alfred hung his head and said humbly i did but go upstairs for one moment to wash my hands for dinner and he was gone mrs dodd went on in her low stern voice almost as if he had not answered her at all by what right did you assume the charge of him did i authorise you to take him from the place where he was safe and under my eye alfred replied sullenly he was not very safe for he was almost burnt to death the fire liberated him not i after the fire i ran away from him he followed me and then what could i do i made the best of it and gave up my own desires to try and cure him he longed for the sea i tried to indulge him i hoped to bring him back to you sane but fate was against me i am the most unfortunate of men mr hardie said mrs dodd what you have done was the act of a madman and if i believed you to be anything but a madman the sight of you would be intolerable to me for you have made me a widow and my children orphans with this she gave a great shudder and retired in tears alfred rose pale and defiant that is her notion of justice said he bitterly pray is it yours you two well since you ask my opinion said edward i think it was rather presumptuous of you to undertake the care of my father and having undertaken it you ought not to have left him a moment out of your sight oh that is your opinion is it and you dear julia julia made no reply but hid her face in her hands and sighed deeply i see said alfred sorrowfully even you are against me at heart you judge by the event not the motive there is no justice in this world for me im sick of life i have no right to keep the mistress of the house out of her own room there ill go my heart is broken no it is not and never shall be by anything that breathes thank heaven i have got one friend left in this bitter world and ill make her the judge whether i have deserved this last injustice ill go to my sister he jumped up and hobbled slowly across the room while julia and edward sat chilled to the bone by those five little words so simple so natural yet so incredible and to the hearers so awful they started they shuddered they sat petrified staring at him while he hobbled across the room to go to his sister as he opened the door to go out he heard stout edward groan and julia utter a low wail he stood confounded a moment then he hobbled down a stair or two but ere he had gone far there was a hasty whispering in the drawingroom and edward came after him in great agitation and begged him to return julia must speak with him he turned and his face brightened edward saw that and turned his own face away and stammered out forget what i said to you i am your friend and always must be for her sake no no i cannot go into that room with you ill go and comfort mamma hardie old fellow we are very unhappy all of us we are too unhappy to quarrel these kind words soothed alfreds sore heart he brightened up and entered the drawingroom he found julia standing in the middle of it the colour of ashes alfred was alarmed you are unwell dearest he cried you will faint what have i done with my ungoverned temper he moved towards her with a face full of concern no alfred said she solemnly i am not the least ill it is sorrow deep sorrow for one i love better than all the world sit down beside me my poor alfred andgod help me to speak to him alfred began to feel dire misgivings yes said she i love you too well to let any hand but mine wound you and here she took his sinewy hand with her soft palm i want to soften it in the telling and ah how can i oh why can i not throw myself body and soul between you and all trouble all sorrow my julia said alfred gravely something has happened to jane yes alfred she met with a terrible accident ah she was struck by an unfortunate man he was not in his right mind struck my sister struck what was there no man by no edward nearly killed him afterwards god bless him alfred be patient it was too late what is she hurt seriously is she disfigured no alfred said julia solemnly she is not disfigured oh far from that julia you alarm me this comes of shutting her brother up may heavens eternal curse light on those who did it my poor little sister how you weep julia my heart is lead i weep for you darling not for her ah that is how they talk when those we love areone word i shall never see my poor little jenny again shall i yes alfred if you will but follow her steps and believe in him who soothed her last hour and made her face shine with joy like an angels while we all wept around oh dear oh dear oh dear he said he had but one true friend in the world alas it is so you have but me now who pity you and love you more than heart can utter my own my beloved my bereaved what could soften such a shock as this it fell and his anguish was frightful all the more so that he ascribed the calamity to his imprisonment and mingled curses and threats of vengeance with his bursts of grief he spurned the consolations of religion he said heaven was as unjust as earth as cruel as hell she cried out and stopped his mouth with her hand she almost forced him to kneel beside her and prayed aloud for him and when at last his agony found vent in tears she put her innocent arms round his neck and wept with him every now and then the poor fellow would almost shriek with remorse oh if i had only been kinder to her if i had but been kinder to her you were kind to her said julia softly but firmly oh no i was always sneering at her and why i knew her religion was sincere but my little mind fixed on a few phrases she had picked up from others and i he could say no more but groaned with anguish and let his remorse be a caution to us all bereaved we all must be who live on and on but this bereavements bitterest drop we may avoid alfred said julia do not torment yourself we girls care little about a few sarcasms it is the cold heart that wounds us you loved jane and she knew it well and joyed in it you were kinder to her than you think and so her dying thoughts were for you it was for you she asked and made your father send for you and poor i hoped you would come and dearest her last act was to write a few words to you and trust them to her who she knew loved you better than heart can utter since it was her wish let us try and read them together the last words of a saint i have never seen them and if they do not prove words of love then i will let you think you were not a good brother to her you and i and poor poor edward have lost he made a sad sign of assent and julia rose and got the enclosure but as janes last written words reappeared on the scene in a somewhat remarkable way i will only say here that both these poor young things tried in vain to read them and both in turn burst out sobbing so that they could not so they held the paper and tried to see the words out of their streaming eyes and these two mourners had the room to themselves till midnight for even mrs dodds hostility respected alfred then and as for julia she was one of those who rise with the occasion she was half wife half angel from heaven to her bereaved lover through all those bitter hours chapter xlviii no life was ever yet a play i mean an unbroken sequence of dramatic incidents calms will come unfortunately for the readers happily for the read and i remember seeing it objected to novelists by a young gentleman just putting his foot for the first time into criticism that the writers aforesaid suppress the small intermediate matters which in real life come by the score between each brilliant event and so present the ordinary and the extraordinary parts of life in false proportions now if this remark had been offered by way of contrast between events themselves and all mortal attempts to reproduce them upon paper or the stage it would have been philosophical but it was a strange error to denounce the practice as distinctive of fiction for it happens to be the one trait the novelist and dramatist have in common with the evangelist the gospels skip fifteen years of the most interesting life creation has witnessed they relate christs birth in full but hurry from his boyhood to the more stirring events of his thirtieth and subsequent years and all the inspired histories do much the same thing the truth is that epics dramas novels histories chronicles reports of trials at law in a word all narratives true or fictitious except those which true or fictitious nobody reads abridge the uninteresting facts as nature never did and dwell as nature never did on the interesting ones can nothing however be done to restore in the readers judgment that just balance of the sensational and the soporific which all writers that have readers disturb nothing i think without his own assistance but surely something with it and therefore i throw myself on the intelligence of my readers and ask them to realise that henceforth pages are no strict measure of time and that to a year big with strange events on which i have therefore dilated in this story succeeded a year in which few brilliant things happened to the personages of this tale in short a year to be skimmed by chronicler or novelist and yet mind you a year of three hundred and sixtyfive days six hours or thereabouts and one in which the quiet unobtrusive troubles of our friends hearts especially the female hearts their doubts divisions distresses did not remitfar from it now this year i propose to divide into topics and go by logical rather than natural sequence of events the lovers alfred came every day to see julia and mrs dodd invariably left the room at his knock at last julia proposed to alfred not to come to the house for the present but to accompany her on her rounds as district visitor to see and soothe the bitter calamities of the poor had done her own heart good in its worst distress and she desired to apply the same medicine to her beloved who needed it that was one thing and then another was that she found her own anger rising when her mother left the room at that beloved knock and to be angry with her poor widowed mother was a sin she is as unfortunate as i am happy thought julia i have got mine back alfred assented to this arrangement with rather an ill grace he misunderstood julia and thought she was sacrificing him to what he called her mothers injustice this indeed was the interpretation any male would have been pretty sure to put on it his soreness however did not go very far because she was so kind and good to him when they were together he used to escort her back to the door of and look imploringly but she never asked him in he thought her hard for this he did not see the tears that flowed for that mute look of his the moment the door was closed tears she innocently restrained for fear the sight of them should make him as unhappy as his imploring look made her mauvais calcul she should have cried right out when we men are unhappy we like our sweethearts to be unhappierthat consoles us but when this had gone on nearly a month and no change alfred lost patience so he lingered one day at the door to make a request he asked julia to marry him and so put an end to this state of things marry you child cried julia blushing like a rose with surprise and pleasure oh for shame after the first thrill she appealed to his candour whether that would not be miserably selfish of her to leave her poor mother in her present distressed condition ah alfred so pale so spiritless and inconsolable my poor poor mother you will have to decide between us two one day heaven forbid said julia turning pale at the very idea but he repeated doggedly that it must come to that sooner or later then he reminded her of their solemn engagement and put it to her whether it was a moral proceeding in her to go back from her plighted troth what had he done to justify her in drawing back from her word i admit said he that i have suffered plenty of wrong for your sake but what have i done wrong undeterred by the fear of immorality the monotonous girl had but one reply to his multiform reasons this is no time for me to abandon my mother ah it is her you love you dont care for me snapped alfred dont i dear alfred murmured julia forgive me im a ruffian a wretch you are my alfred but oh have a little patience dear a little patience i have the patience of job but even his went at last i ought to have said they were in the passage now the encroaching youth had gained an entrance by agitating her so at the door that she had to ask him in to hide her own blushes from the public she now gently reminded him how much happier they were than they had been for months dear me said she i am almost happy happier than i ought to be could be quite so but that i see you discontented ah you have so many about you that you love i have only you and that is true my poor alfred this softened him a little and then she interwove her fingers together and so put both palms softly on his shoulder you never saw a male do that and never will and implored him to be patient to be generous oh said she if you knew the distress it gives me to refuse to you anything on earth you would be generous and not press me when my heart says yes but my lips must say no this melted him altogether and he said he would not torment her any more but he went away discontented with himself for having yielded my lord did not call it yielding but being defeated and as he was not only very deep in love but by nature combative he took a lodging nearly opposite no and made hot love to her as hot as if the attachment was just forming her mother could not go out but he was at the door directly she could not go out but he was at her heels this pleased her at first and thrilled her with the sense of sweet and hot pursuit but byandby situated as she was between him and her mother it worried her a little at times and made her nervous she spoke a little sharply to him now and then and that was new it came from the nerves not the heart at last she advised him to go back to oxford i shall be the ruin of your mind if we go on like this said she sadly what leave the field to my rivals no thank you what rivals sir asked julia drawing up your mother your brother your curates that would come buzzing the moment i left your sick people who bask on your smiles and your sweet voice till i envy them sarah whom you permit to brush your lovely hair the piano you play on the air you deign to breathe and brighten everybody and everything that is near you they are all my rivals and shall i resign you to them and leave myself desolate im not such a fool she smiled and could not help feeling it was sweet to be pestered so she said with matronly dignity and the old julian consistency you are a foolish impetuous boy you are the plague of my life andthe sun of my existence that passed off charmingly but presently his evil genius prompted alfred to endeavour to soften mrs dodd by letter and induce her to consent to his marriage with her daughter he received her answer at breakfasttime it was wonderfully polite and cold mrs dodd feigned unmixed surprise at the proposal and said that insanity being unfortunately in her own family and the suspicion of insanity resting on himself such a union was not to be thought of and therefore notwithstanding her respect for his many good qualities she must decline with thanks the honour he offered her she inserted a poisoned sting by way of postscript when you succeed in publicly removing the impression your own relations share with me and when my husband owes his restoration to you instead of his destruction of course you will receive a very different answer to your proposalshould you then think it consistent with your dignity to renew it as hostile testators used to leave the disinherited one shilling not out of a shillings worth of kindly feeling but that he might not be able to say his name was omitted through inadvertency so mrs dodd inserted this postscript merely to clench the nail and tantalise her enemy it was a masterpiece of feminine spite she would have been wonderstruck could she have seen how alfred received her missive to be sure he sat in a cold stupor of dejection for a good half hour but at the end of that time he lifted up his head and said quietly so be it ill get the trial over and my sanity established as soon as possible and then ill hire a yacht and hunt her husband till i find him having settled this little plan he looked out for julia whose sympathy he felt in need of after such a stern blow she came out much later than usual that day for to tell the truth her mother had detained her to show her alfreds letter and her answer ah mamma said poor julia you dont love me as you did once poor alfred mrs dodd sighed at this reproach but said she did not deserve it no mother in her senses would consent to such a match julia bowed her head submissively and went to her duties but when alfred came to her openmouthed to complain of her mothers cruelty she stopped him at once and asked him how he could go and write that foolish unreasonable letter why had he not consulted her first you have subjected yourself to a rebuff said she angrily and one from which i should have saved you is it nothing that mamma out of pity to me connives at our meeting and spending hours together do you think she does no violence to her own wishes here and is she to meet with no return what are you against me too said poor alfred no it is you who are our enemy with your unreasonable impatience i am not so coldblooded as you are certainly humility and penitence would become you better than to retort on me i love you both and pray god on my knees to show me how to do my duty to both that is it you are not singlehearted like me you want to please all the world and reconcile the irreconcilable it wont do you will have to choose between your mother and me at last then of course i shall choose my mother why because she claims my duty as well as my love because she is bowed down with sorrow and needs her daughter just now more than you do besides you are my other self and we must deny ourselves we have no more right to be unjust to ourselves than to anybody else injustice is injustice alfred you are a highminded heathen and talk morality morality is a snare what i pray to be is a christian as your dear sister was and to deny myself and you make it oh so difficult so i suppose it will end in turning out your heathen and then taking your curate your mother would consent to that directly alfred said julia with dignity these words are harsh andforgive me for saying sothey are coarse such words would separate us two without my mother if i were to hear many of them for they take the bloom off affection and that mutual reverence without which no gentleman and lady could be blessed in holy wedlock alfred was staggered and mortified too they walked on in silence now alfred said julia at last do not think me behind you in affection but wiser for once and our best friend i do think we had better see less of one another for a time my poor alfred and why for a time why not for ever if your heart draws no distinction why not indeed so be it then for i will be no womans slave theres my hand julia let us part friends thank you for that dear alfred may you find some one who can love you morethani do the words choked her but he was stronger because he was in a passion he reproached her bitterly if i had been as weak and inconstant as you are i might have been out of drayton house long before i did escape but i was faithful to my one love i have some right to sing aileen aroon you have none you are an angel of beauty and goodness you will go to heaven and i shall go to the devil now for want of you but then you have no constancy nor true fidelity so that has parted us and now nothing is left me but to try and hate you he turned furiously on his heel god bless you go where you will faltered julia he replied with a fierce ejaculation of despair and dashed away thus temper and misunderstanding triumphed after so many strange and bitter trials had failed but alas it is often so chapter xlix both the parted lovers were wretched julia never complained but drooped and read the psalms and edward detected her in tears over them he questioned her and obtained a lame account she being far more bent on screening alfred than on telling the truth edward called on the other and found him disconsolate and reading a heathen philosopher for comfort and finding none edward questioned him and he was reserved and even sulky sir imperturbable persisted quietly and he exploded and out came his wrongs edward replied that he was a pretty fellow wanted it all his own way suppose my mother with her present feelings was to take a leaf out of your book and use all her power where would you be then come old fellow i know what love is and one of us shall have the girl he loves unless any harm should come to my poor father owing to your blunderoh that would put it out of the question i feelbut let us hope better i pulled you out of the fire and somehow i seem to like you better than ever after that let me pull you out of this mess too pull away cried the impetuous youth ill trust you with my life ay with more than my life with my love for you are the man for me reason is always uppermost with you give me the man that is not passions slave and i will wear him in my hearts core ay oh bother that if you are in earnest dont mouth but put on your hat and come over he assented but in the middle of putting on his coat made this little observation now i see how wise the ancients were yes friendship is better than love calmer more constant free from the heats and chills of that impetuous passion its pure bosom is ruffled by none of loves jealousies and irritabilities solem e mundo tollunt qui tollunt amicitiam oh bother quoting come and shake hands with julia they went over mrs dodd was in the city edward ushered in alfred saying here is the other impetuosity and sagely retired for a few minutes when he came back they were sitting hand in hand he gazing on her she inspecting the carpet that is all right said edward drily now the next thing is you must go back to oxford directly and read for your first class the proposal fell like a blight upon the reconciled lovers but edward gave potent reasons the delays of law were endless alfreds defendant had already obtained one postponement of the trial on frivolous grounds now the oxford examination and doncaster races come on at a fixed date by a law of nature and admit of no postponement swindle you mark my words you will get your class before you will get your trial and it wont hurt you to go into court a firstclass man will it and then you wont quarrel by letter you two i know come will you do what i tell you or is friendship but a name eh mr bombast he ended with great though quiet force come you two which is better to part like the scissors or part like the thread similes are no arguments that is why they convince people so alfred capitulated to the scissors and thread and only asked with abnormal humility to be allowed to taste the joys of reconciliation for two days the third found him at oxford he called on the head of his college to explain what had prevented his return to exeter in the october term twelve months ago and asked for rooms instead of siding with a man of his own college so cruelly injured the dignitary was alarmed by the bare accusation and said he must consider insanity was a terrible thing so is false accusation and so is false imprisonment said hardie bitterly unquestionably but i have at present no means of deciding how far those words apply in short he could give no answer must consult the other officers and would convey the result by letter alfreds pride was deeply mortified not less by a certain cold repugnant manner than by the words and there came over his heart a sickening feeling that he was now in the eyes of men an intellectual leper he went to another college directly and applied to the vicepresident the vicepresident sent him with a letter to the dean the dean looked frightened and told him hesitatingly the college was full he might put his name down and perhaps get in next year alfred retired and learned from the porter that the college was not full he sighed deeply and the sickening feeling grew on him an ineradicable stigma seemed upon him and mrs dodd was no worse than the rest of the world then every mother in england would approve her resolutions he wandered about the scenes of his intellectual triumphs he stood in the great square of the schools a place ugly to unprejudiced eyes but withal somewhat grand and inspiring especially to scholars who have fought their keen and bloodless battles there he looked at the windows and gilt inscription of the schola metaphysices in which he had met the scholars of his day and defeated them for the ireland he wandered into the theatre and eyed the rostrum whence he had not mumbled but recited his latin prize poem with more than one thunder of academic applause thunder compared with which drury lanes us a mere cracker these places were unchanged but he sad scholar wandered among them as if he was a ghost and all these were stony phantoms of an intellectual past never never to return he telegraphed sampson and edward to furnish him with certificates that he had never been insane but the victim of a foul conspiracy and when he received them he went with them to st margarets hall for he had bethought him that the new principal was a firstrate man and had openly vowed he would raise that refuge for the ofttimes phoughed to a place of learning hardie called sent in his card and was admitted to the principals study he was about to explain who he was when the doctor interrupted him and told him politely he knew him by reputation tell me rather said he shrewdly to what i owe this application from an undergraduate so distinguished as mr hardie then alfred began to quake and instead of replying put a hand suddenly before his face and lost courage for one moment come mr hardie said the principal dont be disconcerted a fault regretted is half atoned and i am not disposed to be hard on the errors of youth i mean where there is merit to balance them sir said alfred sadly it is not a fault i have to acknowledge but a misfortune tell me all about it said dr alder guardedly he told it omitting nothing essential that could touch the heart or excite the ironical humour of an academician well truth is more wonderful than fiction said the doctor and i conclude the readers of this tale are all of the doctors opinion so sweet to the mind is cant alfred offered his certificates now dr alder had been asking himself in what phrases he should decline this young genius who was sane now but of course had been mad only had forgotten the circumstance but the temptation to get an ireland scholar into his hall suddenly overpowered him the probability that he might get a firstclass in a lucid interval was too enticing nothing venture nothing have he determined to venture a good deal mr hardie said he this house shall always be open to good morals and good scholarship while i preside over it and it shall be open to them all the more when they come to me dignified and made sacred by unmerited calamity now this fine speech like minerva herself came from the head alfred was overcome by it to tears at that the doctors heart was touched and even began to fancy it had originated that noble speech it was no use doing things by halves so dr alder gave alfred a delightful set of rooms and made the hall pleasant to him he was rewarded by a growing conviction that he had made an excellent acquisition this opinion however was anything but universal and alfred finding the men of his own college suspected his sanity and passed jokes behind his back cut them all dead and confined himself to his little hall there they petted him and crowed about him and betted on him for the schools as freely as if he was a colt the hall was going to enter for the derby he read hard and judiciously but without his old confidence he became anxious and doubtful he had seen so many firstrate men just miss a firstclass the brilliant creature analysed all his aristotelian treatises and wrote the synopses clear with marginal references on great pasteboard cards three feet by two and so kept the whole subject before his eye till he obtained a singular mastery same system with the historians nor did he disdain the use of coloured inks then the brilliant creature drew lists of all the hard words he encountered in his reading especially in the common books and read these lists till mastered the stake was singularly heavy in his case so he guarded every crevice and at this period he was not so unhappy as he expected the laborious days went swiftly and twice a week at least came a letter from julia oh how his grave academic room with oaken panels did brighten when her letter lay on the table it was opened and seemed written with sunbeams no quarrels on paper absence made the heart grow fonder and edward came to see him and over their wine let out a feminine trait in julia when hurd calls she walks out of the room just as my poor mother does when you come that is spite since you are sent away nobody else is to profit by it where is her christianity eh and echo answersgot a cigar old fellow and after puffing in silence awhile he said resignedly i am an unnatural monster oh are you said the other serenely for he was also under the benign influence yes said edward i am your ally and a mere spy in the camp of those two ladies i watch all their moves for your sake alfred forgave him and thus his whole life was changed and for nearly twelve months for dr alder let him reside in the hall through the vacation he pursued the quiet tenor of a students life interrupted at times by law but that is another topic wife and no wife mrs dodd was visibly shaken by that calamity which made her shrink with horror from the sight of alfred hardie in the winter she was so unwell that she gave up her duties with messrs cross and co her connection with them had been creditable to both parties i believe i forgot to say why they trusted her so well i must tell it elsewhere david off her hands she was independent and had lost the motive and the heart for severe work she told the partners she could no longer do them justice and left them to their regret they then advised her to set up as a milliner and offered her credit for goods at cash prices up to two thousand pounds she thanked them like a sorrowful queen and went her way in the spring she recovered some spirit and health but at midsummer a great and subtle misfortune befell her her mind was bent on david night and day and used to struggle to evade the laws of space that bind its grosser companion and find her lost husband on the sea she often dreamt of him but vaguely but one fatal night she had a dream as clear as daylight and sharp as white pebbles in the sun she was on a large ship with guns she saw men bring a dead sailor up the side she saw all their faces and the dead mans too it was david his face was white a clear voice said he was to be buried in the deep next morning she saw the deck at her feet the breeches of the guns so clear so defined that when she awoke and found herself in the dark she thought reality was the illusion she told the dream to julia and edward they tried to encourage her in vain i saw him she said i saw him it was a vision not a dream my david is dead well then i shall not be long behind him dr sampson ridiculed her dream to her face but to her children he told another story i am anxious about her he said most anxious there is no mortal ill the distempered brain may not cause is it not devilish we can hear nothing of him she will fret herself into the grave as sure as fate if something does not turn up her children could not console her they tried but something hung round their own hearts and chilled every effort in a word they shared her fears how came she to see him on board a ship with guns in her waking hours she always said he was on a merchant ship was it not one of those visions which come to mortals and give them sometimes a peep into space and far more rarely a glance into time one day in the autumn alfred being in town on law business met what seemed the ghost of mrs dodd in the streets she saw him not her eye was on that ghastly face she had seen in her dreams it flashed through his mind that she would not live long to part him and julia but he discouraged the ungenerous thought almost forgave her repugnance to himself and felt it would be worse than useless to ask julia to leave her mother who was leaving her visibly but her horror of him was anything but softened and she used to tell dr sampson she thought the sight of that man would kill her now edward himself began to hope alfred would turn his affections elsewhere the house in pembroke street was truly the house of mourning now all their calamities were light compared with this the district visitor while julia was writing letters to keep up alfreds heart she was very sad herself moreover he had left her for oxford but a very few days when she received an anonymous letter her first it was written in a female hand and couched in friendly and sympathetic terms the writer thought it only fair to warn her that mr alfred hardie was passionately fond of a lady in the asylum and had offered her marriage if miss dodd wished to be deceived let her burn this letter and think no more of it if not let her insert this advertisement in the times the whole truthl d and her correspondent would communicate particulars by word or writing what a barbed and poisoned arrow is to the body was this letter to julias mind she sat cold as a stone with this poison in her hand then came an impetuous impulse to send it down to alfred and request him to transfer the other half of his heart to his lady of the asylum then she paused and remembered how much unjust suspicion had been levelled at him already what right had she to insult him she would try and keep the letter to herself as to acting upon it her good sense speedily suggested it came from the rival in question real or supposed she wants to make use of me said julia it is plain alfred does not care much for her or why does she come to me she put the letter in her desk and it rankled in her heart hoeret lateri lethalis arundo she trembled at herself she felt a savage passion had been touched in her she prayed day and night against jealousy but i must now to justify my heading skip some months and relate a remarkable incident that befell her in the said character on the first of august in this year a good christian woman one of her patients asked her to call on mr barkington that lodged above he is a decent body miss and between you and me i think his complaint is he dont get quite enough to eat barkington said julia and put her hand to her bosom she went and tapped at his door come in said a shrillish voice she entered and found a weazened old man seated mending his own coat he rose and she told him she was a district visitor he said he had heard of her they called her the beautiful lady in that court this was news to her and made her blush she asked leave to read a chapter to him he listened as to some gentle memory of childhood she prescribed him a glass of port wine and dispensed it on the instant thus physicked her patient became communicative and chattered on about his native placebut did not name itand talked about the people there now our district visitor was if the truth must be told a compounder she would permit her pupils to talk about earthly affairs on condition they would listen to heavenly ones before she went so she let this old man run on and he told her he had been a bankers clerk all his life and saved a thousand pounds and come up to london to make his fortune on the stock exchange and there he was sometimes a bull and sometimes a bear and whichever he was certain foxes called brokers and jobbers got the profit and he the loss its all the same as a gamblingtable said he the jobbers and brokers have got the same odds the bank has at rouge et noir and the little capitalist like me is doomed beforehand then he told her that there was a crossingsweeper near the exchange who came from his native place and had started as a speculator and come down to that only he called it rising and used to speak with a shudder of when he dabbled in the funds and often told him to look sharp and get a crossing and lo one day when he was cleaned out and desperate and hovering with the other ghosts of little capitalists about the tomb of their money he saw his countryman fall flat and the broom fly out of his hand instantly he made a rush and so did a woodenlegged sailor but he got first to the broom and began to sweep while others picked up his countryman who proved dead as a herring and he succeeded to his broom and it made money by the exchange though he never could still one day he picked up a pocketbook in that neighbourhood with a lump of money which he straightway advertised inno newspapers and now julia thought it time to interpose the eighth commandment the golden rule and such branches of learning he became a favourite of hers he had so much to say she even thought she had seen his face before but she could not tell where she gave him good books and tracts and read to him and ploughed his heart with her sweet voice and sowed the good seed in the furrowsseed which like wheat or other grain often seems to fall flat and die but comes out green after many days one saturday she invited him to dine with the servants next day he came during church time and went away in the afternoon while she was with her mother but she asked sarah who proved eager to talk about him he was a rum customer kept asking questions all dinner time well says i youre good company you are be you a lawyer for you examines us but you dont tell us nothing ye see miss jane she is that simple she was telling him everything and about mr alfreds lawsuit with his father and all julia said that was indiscreet but after all what did it matter who knows miss sarah replied least said is soonest mended if you please miss who is he where does he bide where does he come from does he know hardies i should think not why because im much mistaken if he doesnt then putting on a stolid look she asked does he know your papa oh no sarah how should he there now said sarah miss you are all in the dark about this old man ill tell you something i took him out of the way of janes temper when she began a dishing up and i had him into the parlour for a minute and in course there he sees the picture of your poor papa hung up miss if youll believe me the moment he claps eyes on that there picture he halloes out and out goes his two hands like this here its him says he its him and stares at the picture like a stuck pig forgot i was close behind him i do believe shes his daughter says he in a whisper a curious whisper seemed to come out of his stomack whats the matter now says i just so he gave a great start as if my speaking had wakened him from a dream and says he nothing as quiet as a lamb nothing isnt much says i just so it usednt to be anything at all when i was your age says he sneering but i paid him a good coin says i old man where you comes from do the folks use to start and hallo out and cry its him shes his daughter and fling their two arms abroad like a wiumdmill in march and all fornothing so at that he changed as white as my smock and fell all of a tremble however at dinner he perks up and drew that poor simple jane out a good one but he didnt look towards me much which i set opposite to watch my lord sarah said julia this is really curious mysterious you are a good watchful faithful girl and to tell the truth i sometimes fancy i have seen mr barkingtons face however i will solve this little mystery tomorrow for i will ask him thank you sarah on monday she called on mr barkington to solve the mystery but instead of solving her visit thickened it for mr barkington was gone bag and baggage when edward was told of this business he thought it remarkable and regretted he had not seen the old man so do i for it is my belief edward would have recognised him david dodd the history of a man is the history of his mind and that is why you have heard so little of late about the simplest noblest and most unfortunate of all my personages insanity is as various as eccentricity i have spared the kindhearted reader some of davids vagaries however when we parted with him he had settled into that strange phase of lunacy in which the distant past seems nearly obliterated and memory exists but revolves in a narrow round of things present this was accompanied with a positive illusion to wit a fixed idea that he was an able seaman and as usual what mental power he retained came out strongest in support of this idea all this was marked by a bodily agility somewhat more than natural in a man of his age owing to the wind astern he was enabled to run into portsmouth before the steamtug came up with him and he did run into port not because he feared pursuit but because he was desperately hungry and he had no suicidal tendencies whatever he made for a publichouse and called for some bread and cheese and beer they were supplied and then lo he had no money to pay for them ill owe you till i come back from sea my bo said he coolly on this the landlord collared him and david shook him off into the road much as a terrier throws a rat from him then there was a row and a naval officer who was cruising about for hands came up and heard it there was nothing at all unseamanlike in davids conduct and the gentleman took a favourable view of it and paid the small demand but not with unleavened motives he was the second lieutenant of h m frigate vulture she had a bad name thanks to her last captain and was short of hands he took david aside and asked him would he like to ship on board the vulture david said yes and suggested the foretop oh yes growled the lieutenant you all want to be there he then gauged this jacky tars intellects asked him inter alia how to send a frigates foretop gallant yard down upon deck and to show how seamanship sticks in the brain when once it gets there david actually told him you are rather old said the lieutenant but you are a seaman and so took him on board the vulture at spithead before green began to search the town in earnest nobody acts his part better than some demented persons do and david made a very tolerable sailor notwithstanding his fortyfive years and the sea did him good within certain limits between him and the past lay some intellectual or cerebral barrier as impenetrable as the great wall of china but on the hither side of that wall his faculties improved of course the crew soon found out the gap in his poor brain and called him soft billy and played on him at first but by degrees he won their affection he was so wonderfully sweettempered and besides his mind being in an abnormal state he loathed grog and gave his allowance to his messmates one day he showed an unexpected trait they were lying becalmed in southern latitudes and time hanging heavily each wiled it how he might one fiddled another wrote to his polly another fished for sharks another whistled for a wind scores fell into the form of meditation without the reality and one got a piece of yarn and amused himself killing flies on the bulwark now this shocked poor billy he put out his long arm and intercepted a stroke what is the row said the operator you mustnt said billy solemnly looking into his face with great dreamy eyes you be said the other and lent him a tap on the cheek with the yarn billy did not seem to mind this his skin had little sensibility owing to his disorder jack recommenced on his flies and the bystanders laughed they always laughed now at everything billy said as society used to laugh when the late theodore hook asked for the mustard at dinner and would have laughed if he had said you see me sad i have just lost my poor father david stood looking on at the slaughter with a helpless puzzled air at last he seemed to have an idea he caught jack up by the throat and knee lifted him with gigantic strength above his head and was just going to hurl him shrieking into the sea when a dozen strong hands interfered and saved the man then they were going to bind billy hand and foot but he was discovered to be perfectly calm so they remonstrated instead and presently billys commanderinchief a shipboy called georgie white shoved in and asked him in a shrill haughty voice how he dared do that my dear said billy with great humility and placidity he was killing gods creatures no allowance so ye see to save their lives i was obliged nautical phrase meaning without stint or limit or niggardly admeasurement as there is of grog at this piece of reasoning and the simplicity and gentle conviction with which it was delivered there was a roar it subsided and a doubt arose whether billy was altogether in the wrong well said one i daresay life is sweet to them little creatures if they could speak their minds ive known a ship founder in a fair breeze all along of killing em said one old salt finally several sided with billy and intimated that it served the lubber right for not listening to reason and indeed methinks it was lovely and touching that so divine a ray of goodness and superior reason should have shot from his heart or from heaven across that poor benighted brain but it must be owned his mode of showing his humanity was somewhat excessive and abnormal and smacked of lunacy after this however the affection of his messmates was not so contemptuous now the captain of the vulture was billys cousin by marriage reginald bazalgette twenty years ago when the captain was a boy they were great friends of late bazalgette had seen less of him still it seems strange he did not recognise him in his own ship but one or two causes cooperated to prevent that in the first place the mind when turned in one direction is not so sharp in another and captain bazalgette had been told to look for david in a merchant ship bound for the east indies in the next place insanity alters the expression of the face wonderfully and the captain of a frigate runs his eye over four hundred sailors at muster or a hundred at work not to examine their features but their dress and bearing at the one and their handiness at the other the worst piece of luck was that mrs dodd did not know david called himself william thompson so there stood william thompson large as life on the ships books and nobody the wiser captain bazalgette had a warm regard and affection for mrs dodd and did all he could indeed he took great liberties he stopped and overhauled several merchant ships for the truant and bytheby on one occasion william thompson was one of the boats crew that rowed a midshipman from the vulture alongside a merchant ship to search for david dodd he heard the name and circumstance mentioned in the boat but the very name was new to him he remembered it but only from that hour and told his loving tyrant georgie white they had been overhauling a merchant ship and looking for one david dodd it was about midsummer the vulture anchored off one of the south sea islands and sent a boat ashore for fruit billy and his dearly beloved little tyrant georgie white were among the crew off goes georgie to bathe and billy sits down on the beach with a loving eye upon him the water was calm but the boy with the heedlessness of youth stayed in it nearly an hour he was seized with cramp and screamed to his comrades they ran but they were half a mile from the boat billy dashed into the water and came up with georgie just as he was sinking for the last time the boy gripped him but by his great strength he disentangled himself and got georgie on his shoulders and swam for the shore meantime the sailors got into the boat and rowed hastily towards them now billy was undermost and his head under water at times and georgie some thought had helped strangle him by gripping his neck with both arms anyway by the boys account just as they were getting into shallow water billy gave a great shriek and turned over on his back and georgie paddled with his hands but billy soon after this sunk like a dead body while the boat was yet fifty yards off and georgie screamed and pointed to the place and the boat came up and took georgie in and the water was so clear that the sailors saw billy lie motionless at the bottom and hooked him with a boat hook and drew him up but his face came up alongside a deadly white with staring eyes and they shuddered and feared it was too late they took him into a house and stripped him and rubbed him and wrapped him in blankets and put him by the hot fire but all would not do then having dried his clothes they dressed the body again and laid him in the boat and cast the union jack over him and rowed slowly and unwillingly back to the ship georgie sobbing and screaming over the body and not a dry eye in the boat the body was carried up the side and uncovered just as mrs dodd saw in her dream the surgeon was sent for and examined the body and then the grim routine of a manofwar dealt swiftly with the poor skipper he was carried below to be prepared for a sailors grave then the surgeon walked aft and reported formally to the officer of the watch the death by drowning of william thompson the officer of the watch went instantly to the captain in his cabin and reported the death the captain gave the stereotyped order to bury him at noon next day and the body was stripped that night and sewed up in his hammock with a portion of his clothes and bedding to conceal the outline of the corpse and two cannon balls at his feet and so the poor skipper was laid out for a watery grave and covered by the union jack i dont know whether any of my amorous young readers are much affected by the catastrophe i have just related if not i will just remind them that even edward dodd was prepared to oppose the marriage of julia and alfred if any serious ill should befall his father at sea owing to alfreds imprudent interference in rescuing him from drayton house chapter l law minute study of my fellowcreatures has revealed to me that there are many intelligent persons who think that a suit at law commences in court this is not so many suits are fought and decided by the special pleaders and so never come into court and as a stiff encounter of this kind actually took place in hardie v hardie a word of prefatory explanation may be proper suitors come into court only to try an issue an issue is a mutual lie direct and towards this both parties are driven upon paper by the laws of pleading which may be thus summed every statement of the adversary must either be contradicted flat or confessed and avoided avoided means neutralised by fresh matter nothing must be advanced by plaintiff which does not disclose a ground of action at law nothing advanced by defendant which if true would not be a defence to the action these rules exclude in a vast degree the pitiable defects and vices that mark all the unprofessional arguments one ever hears for on a breach of any one of the said rules the other party can demur the demurrer is argued before the judges in banco and if successfully the faulty plaint or faulty plea is dismissed and often of course the cause won or lost thereby and the country saved the trouble and the suitors the expense of trying an issue so the writ being served by plts attorney and an appearance put in by defts the paper battle began by alfred hardie through his attorney serving on defts attorney the declaration this was drawn by his junior counsel garrow and ran thus after specifying the court and the date middlesex to wit alfred hardie by john compton his attorney sues thomas hardie for that the deft assaulted plt gave him into custody to a certain person and caused him to be imprisoned for a long space of time in a certain place to wit a lunatic asylum whereby the plt was much inconvenienced and suffered much anguish and pain in mind and body and was unable to attend to his affairs and was injured in his credit and circumstances and the plt claims l mr compton conveyed a copy of this to alfred and said it was a sweet declaration what said alfred is that all i have suffered at these miscreants hands why it is written with an icicle mr compton explained that this was the outline counsel will lay the colours on in court as thick as you like the defendant replied to the above declaration by three pleas by statute vic c s the deft by joseph heathfield his attorney says he is not guilty and for a further plea the deft says that before and at the time of the alleged imprisonment plt was a person of unsound mind and incompetent to take care of himself and a proper person to be taken care of and detained and it was unfit unsafe improper and dangerous that he should be at large thereupon the deft being the uncle of the plt and a proper person to cause the plt to be taken charge of under due care and treatment in that behalf did cause the plt to be so taken charge of and detained under due care and treatment c c the third plea was the stinger but too long to cite verbatim it went to this tune that the plaintiff at and before the time c had conducted himself like a person of unsound mind c and two certificates that he was insane had been given by two persons duly authorised under the statute to sign such certificates and the defendant had believed and did bona fide believe these certificates to be true c c the first of these pleas was a mere formal plea under the statute the second raised the very issue at common law the plaintiff wished to try the third made john compton knit his brows with perplexity this is a very nasty plea said he to alfred a regular trap if we join issue on it we must be defeated for how can we deny the certificates were in form and yet the plaguy thing is not loose enough to be demurred to colls who drew these pleas for them mr colvin sir make a note to employ him in our next stiff pleading alfred was staggered he had thought to ride roughshod over defendanta common expectation of plaintiffs but seldom realised lawyers fight hard the pleas were taken to garrow he said there was but one course to demur to no so the plaintiff joined issue on all the defendants pleas and as to the last plea the plaintiff said the same was bad in substance defendant rejoined that the same was good in substance and thus hardie v hardie divided itself into two cases a question of law for the judges and an issue for the mixed tribunal loosely called a jury and i need hardly say that should the defendant win either of them he would gain the cause postponing the history of the legal question i shall show how messrs heathfield fought off the issue and cooled the ardent alfred and sickened him of law in theory every englishman has a right to be tried by his peers but in fact there are five gentlemen in every court each of whom has by precedent the power to refuse him a jury by simply postponing the trial term after term until the death of one of the parties when the action if a personal one dies too and by a singular anomaly of judicial practice if a slippery deft cant persuade a or b judges of the common law court to connive at what i venture to call the postponement swindle he can actually go to c d and b one after another with his rejected application and the previous refusal of the other judges to delay and baffle justice goes for little or nothing so that the postponing swindler has five to one in his favour messrs heathfield began this game unluckily they applied to a judge in chambers for a month to plead mr compton opposed in person and showed that this was absurd the judge allowed them only four days to plead issue being joined mr compton pushed on for trial and the cause was set down for the november term towards the end of the term messrs heathfield applied to one of the puisne judges for a postponement on the ground that a principal witness could not attend application was supported by the attorneys affidavit to the effect that mr speers was in boulogne and had written to him to say that he had met with a railway accident and feared he could not possibly come to england in less than a month a respectable french doctor confirmed this by certificate compton opposed but the judge would hardly hear him and postponed the trial as a matter of course this carried it over the sittings into next term alfred groaned but bore it patiently not so dr sampson he raged against secret tribunals see how men deteriorate the moment they get out of the full light of publeecity what english judge sitting in the light of shorthand would admit jack swears that gill says for legal evidence speers has sworn to no facks heathfield has sworn to no facks but th existence of speers hearsay they are a couple o lyres ill bet ye ten pounds t a shilling speers is as well as im mr compton quietly reminded him there was a direct statementthe french doctors certificate a medical certificut shrieked sampson amazed maidearrsirr a medical certificut is just an article o commerce like an attorneys conscience gimme a guinea and ill get you sworn sick diseased disabled or dead this minute whichever you like best come doctor dont fly off you said youd bet ten pounds to a shilling speers is not an invalid at all i say done done how will you find out how why set the thieftakers on um to be sure he wrote off to the prefect of police at boulogne and in four days received an answer headed information in the interest of families the prefect informed him there had been no railway accident but that the sieur speers english subject had really hurt his leg getting out of a railway carriage six weeks ago and had kept his room some days but he had been cured some weeks and going about his business and made an excursion to paris on this compton offered sampson the shilling but he declined to take it the lie was selfevident said he and heres a judge wouldnt seet and an attorney couldnt been all their lives sifting evidence too oh the darkness of the profissional mind the next term came mr compton delivered the briefs and fees subpoenaed the witnesses c and alfred came up with a good heart to get his stigma removed by twelve honest men in the light of day but first one case was taken out of its order and put before him then another till term wore near an end then messrs heathfield applied to another judge of the court for a postponement mr richard hardie plaintiffs father a most essential witness was ill at clare court medical certificate and letter herewith compton opposed now this judge was a keen and honourable lawyer with a lofty hatred of all professional tricks he heard the two attorneys and delivered himself to this effect only of course in better legal phrase i shall make no order the defendant has been here before on a doubtful affidavit you know mr heathfield juries in these cases go by the plaintiffs evidence and his conduct under crossexamination and i think it would not be just nor humane to keep this plaintiff in suspense and civiliter mortuum any longer you can take out a commission to examine richard hardie to this mr compton nailed him but the commission took time and while it was pending mr heathfield went to another judge with another disabled witness peggy black that naive personage was nursing her deceased sisters childrenin an affidavit and they had scarlatinasurgeons certificate to that effect compton opposed and pointed out the blot you dont want the children in the witnessbox said he and we are not to be robbed of our trial because one of your witnesses prefer nursing other peoples children to facing the witnessbox the judge nodded assent i make no order said he mr heathfield went out from his presence and sent a message by telegraph to peggy black you must have scar yourself and telegraph the same at once certificate by post the accommodating maiden telegraphed back that she had unfortunately taken scarlatina of the children medical certificate to follow by post four judges out of the five were now awake to the move but mr heathfield tinkered the hole in his late affidavit with peggys telegram and slipped down to westminster to the chief judge of the court who had had no opportunity of watching the growth and dissemination of disease among defts witnesses compton fought this time by counsel and with a powerful affidavit but luck was against him the judge had risen to go home he listened standing comptons counsel was feeble did not feel the wrong how could he lawyers fatten by delays of justice as physicians do by tardy cure the postponement was granted alfred cursed them all and his own folly in believing that an alleged lunatic would be allowed fair play at westminster or anywhere else compton took snuff and sampson appealed to the press again he wrote a long letter exposing with fearless irony the postponement swindle as it had been worked in hardie v hardie and wound up with this fiery peroration this englishman sues not merely for damages but to recover lost rights dearer far than money of which he says he has been unjustly robbed his right to walk in daylight on the soil of his native land without being seized and tied up for life like a nigger or a dog his footing in society a chance to earn his bread and a place among mankind ay among mankind for a lunatic is an animal in the laws eye and societys and an alleged lunatic is a lunatic till a jury clears him i appeal to you gentlemen is not such a suitor sacred in all wise and good mens minds is he not defendant as well as plaintiff why his stake is enormous compared with the nominal defendants and if i know right from wrong to postpone his trial a fourth time would be to insult divine justice and trifle with human misery and shock the common sense of nations the doctors pen neither clipped the words nor minced the matter you see reading this the water came into alfreds eyes ah staunch friend he said how few are like you to the intellectual dwarfs who conspire with my oppressors hardie v hardie is but a family squabble parvis omnia parva mr compton read it too and said from the bottom of his heart heaven defend us from our friends this is enough to make the courts decline to try the case at all and indeed it did not cure the evil for next term another malade affidavitaire was set up speers to wit this gentleman deposed to having come over on purpose to attend the trial but having inadvertently stepped aside as far as wales he lay there stricken with a mysterious malady and had just strength to forward medical certificate on this the judge in spite of remonstrance adjourned hardie v hardie to the summer term summer came the evil day drew nigh mr heathfield got the venue changed from westminster to london which was the fifth postponement at last the cause came on the parties and witnesses were all in court with two whole days before them to try it in dr sampson rushed in furious there is some deviltry afloat said he i was in the house of commons last night and there i saw the defendants counsel earwigging the judge nonsense said mr compton such suspicions are ridiculous do you think they can talk of nothing but hardie v hardie maidearr sirrmy son met one of heathfields clerks at dinner and he let out that the trile was not to come off put this and that together now it will come off said mr compton and in five minutes at farthest in less than that time the learned judge came in and before taking his seat made this extraordinary speech i hear this cause will take three days to try and we have only two days before us it would be inconvenient to leave it unfinished and i must proceed on circuit the day after tomorrow it must be a remanet no man can do more than time allows plaintiffs counsel made a feeble remonstrance then yielded and the crier with sonorous voice called on the case of bread v cheese in which there were pounds at stake but no principle oh with what zest they all went into it being small men escaping from a great thing to a small one never hopped frogs into a ditch with more alacrity alfred left the court and hid himself and the scalding tears forced their way down his cheeks at this heartless proceeding to let all the witnesses come into court at a vast expense to the parties and raise the cup of justice to the lips of the oppressed and then pretend he knew a trial would last more than two days and so shirk it id have made that a reason for sitting till midnight said poor alfred not for prolonging a poor injured mans agony four mortal months he then prayed god earnestly for this great postponers death as the only event that could give him back an englishmans right of being tried by his peers and so went down to oxford brokenhearted as for sampson he was most indignant and said a public man had no business with a private ear and wanted to appeal to the press again but the doughty doctor had a gentle but powerful ruler at home as fiery houses are best ruled by a gentle hand mrs sampson requested him to write no more but look round for an m p to draw these repeated defeats of justice to the notice of the house now there was a mr bite who had taken a prominent and honourable part in lunacy questions headed committees and so on this seemed the man dr sampson sent him a letter saying there was a flagrant case of a sane man falsely imprisoned who had now been near a year applying for a jury and juggled out of this constitutional right by arbitrary and unreasonable postponements would mr bite give him dr sampson ten minutes and no more when he would explain the case and leave documentary evidence behind him for mr bite to test his statement the philanthropical m p replied promptly in these exact words mr bite presents his compliments to dr sampson to state that it is impossible for him to go into his case nor to give him the time he requests to do so sampson was a little indignant at the mans insolence but far more at having been duped by his public assumption of philanthropy the little pragmatical impostor he roared with what a sense o relief th animal flings off the mask of humanity when there is no easy eclat to be gained by puttingt on he sent the philanthropical bites revelation of his private self to alfred who returned it with this single remark homunculi quanti sunt dishonest suitors all try to postpone but they do not gain unmixed good thereby these delays give time for more evidence to come in and this slow coming and chance evidence is singularly adverse to the unjust suitor of this came a notable example in october next and made richard hardie determined to precipitate the trial and even regret he had not fought it out long ago he had just returned from consulting messrs heathfield and sat down to a nice little dinner in his apartments sackville street when a visitor was announced and in came the slouching little figure of mr barkington alias noah skinner diamond cut diamond mr hardie suppressed a start and said nothing skinner bowed low with a mixture of his old cringing way and a certain sly triumphant leer so that his body seemed to say one thing and his face the opposite mr hardie eyed him and saw that his coat was rusty and his hat napless then mr hardie smelt a beggar and prepared to parry all attempts upon his purse i hope i see my old master well said skinner coaxingly pretty well in body skinner thank you i had a deal of trouble to find you sir but i heard of the great lawsuit between mr alfred and you and i knew mr heathfield was your solicitor so i watched at his place day after day and at last you came oh i was so pleased when i saw your noble figure but i wouldnt speak to you in the street for fear of disgracing you im such a poor little guy to be addressing a gentleman like you now this sounded well on the surface but below there was a subtle something mr hardie did not like at all but he took the cue and said my poor skinner do you think i would turn up my nose at a faithful old servant like you have a glass of wine with me and tell me how you have been getting on he went behind a screen and opened a door and soon returned with a decanter leaving the door open now in the next room sat unbeknown to skinner a young woman with white eyelashes sewing buttons on mr hardies shirts that astute gentleman gave her instructions and important ones too with a silent gesture then reappeared and filled the bumper high to his faithful servant they drank one anothers healths with great cordiality real or apparent mr hardie then asked skinner carelessly if he could do anything for him skinner said well sir i am very poor so am i between you and me said mr hardie confidentially i dont mind telling you those confounded commissioners of lunacy wrote to alfreds trustees and i have been forced to replace a loan of five thousand pounds that board always sides with the insane that crippled me and drove me to the exchange and now what i had left is all invested in timebargains a month settles my fate a little fortune or absolute beggary youll be lucky sir youll be lucky said skinner cheerfully you have such a long head not like poor little me the exchange soon burnt my wings not a shilling left of the thousand pounds sir you were so good as to give me for my faithful services but you will give me another chance sir i know ill take better care this time mr hardie shook his head sorrowfully and said it was impossible skinner eyed him askant and remarked quietly and half aside of course i could go to the other party but i shouldnt like to do that they would come down handsome what other party la sir what other party why mrs dodds or mr alfreds heres the trial coming on you know and of course if they could get me to go on the box and tell all i know or half what i know why the judge and jury would say locking mr alfred up for mad was a conspiracy mr hardie quaked internally but he hid it grandly and once more was a spartan gnawed beneath his robe by this little fox what said he sternly after all i and mine have done for you and yours would you be so base as to go and sell yourself to my enemies never sir shouted skinner zealously then in a whisper not if youll make a bid for me how much do you demand only another thousand sir a thousand pounds why what is that to you sir you are rich enough to buy the eighth commandment out of the tables of ten per cent and then the lawsuit hardies versus hardies you have spoken plainly at last said mr hardie grimly this is extorting money by threats do you know that nothing is more criminal nor more easy to punish i can take you before a magistrate and imprison you on the instant for this attempt i will too try it said skinner coolly wheres your witness behind that screen peggy came forward directly with a pen in her hand skinner was manifestly startled and disconcerted i have taken all your words down mr skinner said peggy softly then to her master shall i go for a policeman sir mr hardie reflected yes said he sternly theres no other course with such a lump of treachery and ingratitude as this peggy whipped on her bonnet what a hurry you are in whined skinner a policeman ought to be the last argument for old friends to run to then fawning spitefully dont talk of indicting me sir said he it makes me shiver why how will you look when i up and tell them all how captain dodd was took with apoplexy in our office and how you nailed fourteen thousand pounds off his senseless body and forgot to put them down in your balancesheet so they are not whitewashed off like the rest any witnesses to all this skinner yes sir who well your own conscience for one said skinner he is mad peggy said mr hardie shrugging his shoulders he then looked skinner full in the face and said nobody was ever seized with apoplexy in my office nobody ever gave me l and if this is the probable tale with which you come here to break the law and extort money leave my house this instant and if ever you dare to utter this absurd and malicious slander you shall lie within four stone walls and learn what it is for a shabby vagabond to come without a witness to his back and libel a man of property and honour skinner let him run on in this loud triumphant strain till he had quite done then put out a brown skinny finger and poked him lightly in the ribs and said quite quietly and oh so drily with a knowing wink ivegotthe receipt chapter li mr hardie collapsed as if he had been a man inflated and that touch had punctured him ah said he ah said skinner in a mighty different tone insolent triumph to wit after a pause mr hardie made an effort and said contemptuously the receipt if any was flung into the dusthole and carried away do you think i have forgotten that dont you believe it sir was the reply while you turned your back and sacked the money i said to myself oho is that the game and nailed the receipt what a couple of scoundrels we were i wouldnt have her know it for all your money come sir i see its all right you will shell out sooner than be posted here peggy interposed mr skinner be more considerate my master is really poor just now that is no reason why i should be insulted and indicted and trampled under foot snarled skinner all in one breath show me the receipt and take my last shilling you ungrateful vindictive viper groaned mr hardie stuff and nonsense said skinner im not a viper im a man of business find me five hundred pounds and ill show you the receipt and keep dark but i cant afford to give it you for that of course skinner triumphed and made the great man apologise writhing all the time and wishing he was a day labourer with peggy to wife and fourteen honest shillings a week for his income having eaten humble pie he agreed to meet skinner next wednesday at midnight alone under a certain lamp on the north kensington road the interval four days he required to raise money upon his scrip skinner bowed himself out fawning triumphantly mr hardie stood in the middle of the room motionless scowling darkly peggy looked at him and saw some dark and sinister resolve forming in his mind she divined it as such women can divine she laid her hand on his arm and said softly richard its not worth that he started to find his soul read through his body so clearly he trembled but it was only for a moment his blood be on his own head he snarled this is not my seeking he shall learn what it is to drive richard hardie to despair no no implored peggy there are other countries beside this why not gather all you have and cross the water ill follow you to the worlds end richard mind your own business said he fiercely she made no reply but went softly and sat down again and sewed the buttons on his shirts mr hardie wrote to messrs heathfield to get hardie v hardie tried as soon as possible meantime came a mental phenomenon gliding down sackville street victorious skinner suddenly stopped and clenched his hands and his face writhed as if he had received a deathwound in that instant remorse had struck him like lightning and perhaps whence comes the lightning the sweet face and voice that had smiled on him and cared for his body and cared for his soul came to his mind and knocked at his heart and conscience he went home miserable with an inward conflict and it lasted him all the four days sometimes remorse got the better sometimes avarice he came to the interview still undecided what he should do but meantime he had gone to a lawyer and made his will leaving his little all to julia dodd a bad sign this looked like compounding with his awakened conscience it was a dark and gusty night very few people were about skinner waited a little while and shivered for his avarice had postponed the purchase of a greatcoat until christmas day at last when the coast seemed clear mr hardie emerged from a side street skinner put his hand to his bosom they met mr hardie said quietly i must ask you just for form to show me you have the receipt of course sir but not so near please no snatching if i know it you are wonderfully suspicious said mr hardie trying to smile skinner looked and saw by the lamplight he was deadly pale keep your distance a moment sir said he and on mr hardies complying took the receipt out and held it under the lamp instantly mr hardie drew a lifepreserver and sprang on him with a savage curseand uttered a shriek of dismay for he was met by the long shiny barrel of a horsepistol that skinner drew from his bosom and levelled full in the haggard face that came at him mr hardie recoiled crying no no for heavens sake what cried skinner stepping forward and hissing do you think im such a fool as to meet a thief unarmed come cash up or ill blow you to atoms no no no said mr hardie piteously retreating as skinner marched on him with long extended pistol skinner he stammered ththis is nnot bbbusiness cash up then thats business fling the five hundred pounds down and walk away mind it is loaded with two bullets ill make a double entry on your great treacherous carcass its no use trying to deceive such a man as you said mr hardie playing on his vanity i could not get the money before saturday and so i listened to the dictates of despair forgive me then come again saturday night come alone and i shall bring a man to see im not murdered and look here sir if you dont come to the hour and do the right thing without any more of these unbusinesslike tricks by heaven ill smash you before noon on monday ill come ill blow you to mr alfred and miss dodd ill come i tell you ill post you for a thief on every brick in the exchange have mercy skinner have pity on the wretched man whose bread you have eaten i tell you ill come well mind you do then cash and all said skinner sulkily but not quite proof against the reminiscences those humble words awakened each walked backwards a good dozen steps and then they took different roads skinner taking good care not to be tracked home he went up the high stairs to the hole in the roof he occupied and lighted a rushlight he had half a mind to kindle a fire he felt so chilly but he had blocked up the vent partly to keep out the cold partly to shun the temptation of burning fuel however he stopped the keyhole with paper and also the sides of the window till he had shut the wintry air all out still what with the cold and what with the reaction after so great an excitement his feeble body began to shiver desperately he thought at last he would light a footwarmer he had just purchased for old iron at a brokers that would only spend a halfpenneyworth of charcoal no he wouldnt he would look at his money that would cheer him he unripped a certain part of his straw mattress and took out a bag of gold he spread three hundred sovereigns on the floor and put the candle down among them they sparkled they were all new ones and he rubbed them with an old toothbrush and whiting every week thats better than any fire he said they warm the heart for one thing they are my own at all events i did not steal them nor take them of a thief for a bribe to keep dark and defraud honest folk then remorse gripped him he asked himself what he was going to do to rob an angel was the answer the fourteen thousand pounds is all hers and i could give it her in a moment curse him he would have killed me for it then he pottered about and took out his will ah said he that is all right so far but what is a paltry three hundred when i help do her out of fourteen thousand villain then to ease his conscience he took a slip of paper and wrote on it a short account of the receipt and how he came by it and lo as if an unseen power had guided his hand he added miss dodd lives at pembroke street and i am going to take it to her as soon as i am well of my cold whether this preceded an unconscious resolve which had worked on him secretly for some time or whether it awakened such a resolve i hardly know but certain it is that having written it he now thought seriously of doing it and the more seriously he entertained the thought the more good it seemed to do him he got the sinners friend and another good book she had lent him and read a bit then finding his feet frozen he lighted his chafer and blew it well and put it under his feet and read the good words began to reach his heart more and more so did the thought of julias goodness the chafer warmed his feet and legs ay said he men dont want fires warm the feet and the body warms itself he took out the receipt and held it in his hand and eyed it greedily and asked himself could he really part with it he thought he couldto julia still holding it tight in his left hand he read on the good but solemn words that seemed to loosen his grasp upon that illgotten paper how good it was of her he thought to come day after day and feed a poor little fellow like him body and soul she asked nothing back she didnt know he could make her any return bless her bless her he screamed oh how cruel i have been to her and she so kind to me she would never let me want if i took her fourteen thousand pounds like enough give me a thousand and help me save my poor soul that i shall damn if i meet him again i wont go his way again lead us not into temptation i repent lord have mercy on me a miserable sinner and tears bedewed those wizened cheeks tears of penitence sincere at least for the time a sleepy languor now came over him and the good book fell from his hand but his resolution remained unshaken byandby waking up from a sort of heavy dose he took as it were a last look at the receipt and murmured my head how heavy it feels but presently he roused himself full of his penitent resolution and murmured again brokenly illtake it topembroke street tomorrow tomorrow chapter lii mr hardie raised the money on his scrip and at great inconvenience for he was holding on five hundred thousand pounds worth of old turkish bonds over an unfavourable settling day and wanted every shilling to pay his broker if they did not rise by next settling day he was a beggar however being now a desperate gamester and throwing for his last stake he borrowed this sum and took it within a heavy heart to his appointment with skinner skinner never came mr hardie waited till one oclock two oclock no skinner mr hardie went home hugging his five hundred pounds but very uneasy next day he consulted peggy she shook her head and said it looked very ugly skinner had most likely got angrier and angrier with thinking on the assault you will never see him again till the day of the trial and then he will go down and bear false witness against you why not leave the country how can i simpleton my money is all locked up in the bargains no im tied tied to the stake ill fight to the last and if im defeated and disgraced ill die and end it peggy implored him not to talk so ive been down to the court said she softly to see what it is like theres a great hall and he must pass through that to get into the little places where they try em let me be in that hall with the five hundred pounds and i promise you he shall never appear against you we will both go you with the money i with my womans tongue he gave her his hand like a shaky monarch and said she had more wit than he had mr heathfield who had contrived to postpone hardie v hardie six times in spite of compton could not hurry it on now with his cooperation it hung fire from some cause or another a good fortnight and in this fortnight hardie senior endured the tortures of suspense skinner made no sign at last there stood upon the paper for next day a short case of disputed contract and hardie v hardie now this day i must premise was to settle the whole lawsuit for while trial of the issue was being postponed and postponed the legal question had been argued and disposed of the very queens counsel unfavourable to the suit was briefed with garrows views and delivered them in court with more skill clearness and effect than garrow ever could then sat down and whispered over rather contemptuously to mr compton that is your argument i think and admirably put whispered the attorney in reply well now hear saunders knock it to pieces instead of that it was serjeant saunders that got maltreated first one judge had a peck at him then another till they left him scarce a feather to fly with and when alfreds counsel rose to reply the judges stopped him and the chief of the court alfreds postponing enemy delivered his judgment after this fashion we are all of opinion that this plea is bad in law by the common law of england no person can be imprisoned as a lunatic unless actually insane at the time it has been held so for centuries and down to the last case and wisely for it would be most dangerous to the liberty of the subject if a man could be imprisoned without remedy unless he could prove mala fides in the breast of the party incarcerating him as for the statute it does not mend the matter but rather the reverse for it expressly protects duly authorised persons acting under the order and certificates and this must be construed to except from the protection of the statute the person making the order the three puisne judges concurred and gave similar reasons one of them said that if a imprisoned b for a felon and b sued him it was no defence to say that b in his opinion had imitated felony they cited elliot v allen anderdon v burrows and lord mansfields judgment in a very old case the name of which i have unfortunately forgotten judgment was entered for the plaintiff and the defendants ingenious plea struck off the record and hardie v hardie became the leading case but in law one party often wins the skirmish and the other the battle the grand fight as i have already said was to be today but the high hopes and ardour with which the young lovers had once come into court were now worn out by the postponement swindle and the adverse events delay had brought on them alfred was not there he was being examined in the schools and had plumply refused to leave a tribunal that named its day and kept itfor westminster until his counsel should have actually opened the case he did not believe trial by jury would ever be allowed him julia was there but sad and comparatively listless one of those strange vague reports which often herald more circumstantial accounts had come home whispering darkly that her father was dead and buried on an island in the south sea she had kept this report from her mother contrary to edwards wish but she implored him to restrain his fatal openness in one thing both these sorely tried young people agreed that there could be no marriage with alfred now but here again julia entreated her brother not to be candid not to tell alfred this at present oh do not go and dispirit him just now she said or he will do something rash no he must and shall get his firstclass and win his trial and then you know any lady will be too proud to marry him and when he is married and happy you can tell him i did all i could for him and hunted up the witnesses and was his loving friend though i could notbehiswife she could not say this without crying but she said it for all that and meant it too besides helping mr compton to get up the evidence this true and earnest friend and lover had attended the court day after day to watch how things were done and womanlike to see what pleased and what displeased the court the witnesses subpoenaed on either side in hardie v hardie began to arrive at ten oclock and a tall stately man paraded westminster hall to see if skinner came with them all other anxieties had merged in this for the counsel had assured him if nothing unexpected turned up thomas hardie would have a verdict or if not the damages would be nominal at last the court crier cried with a loud voice hardie v hardie julias eyes roved very anxiously for alfred and up rose mr garrow and stated to the court the substance of the declaration to this he said three pleas have been pleaded first the plea of not guilty which is a formal plea also another plea which has been demurred to and struck off the record and lastly that at the time of the alleged imprisonment the plaintiff was of unsound mind and a fit person to be confined which is the issue now to be tried mr garrow then sat down very tired of this preliminary work and wondering when he should have the luck to conduct such a case as hardie v hardie and leaned forward to be ready to prompt his senior a portly counsel whom mr compton had retained because he was great at addressing juries and no point of law could now arise in the case colt q c rose like a tower knowing very little of the facts and seeming to know everything he had a prodigious business and was rather indolent and often skimmed his brief at home and then mastered it in courtif he got time now it is a good generals policy to open a plaintiffs case warily and reserve your rhetoric for the reply and mr colt always took this line when his manifold engagements compelled him as in hardie v hardie to teach his case first and learn it afterwards i will only add that in the course of his opening he was on the edge of seven distinct blunders but garrow watched him and always shot a whisper like a bullet just in time colt took it and glided away from incipient error imperceptibly and with a tact you can have no conception of the jury did not detect the creaking of this machinery serjeant saunders did and grinned satirically so did poor julia and her cheeks burned and her eyes flashed indignant fire and horror of horrors alfred did not appear mr colts opening may be thus condensed the plaintiff was a young gentleman of great promise and distinction on whom as usual in these cases of false imprisonment money was settled he was a distinguished student at eton and oxford and no doubt was ever expressed of his sanity till he proposed to marry and take his money out of his trustees hands by a marriage settlement on this his father who up to that time had managed his funds as principal trustee showed him great personal hostility for some time and looked out for a tool that tool he soon found in his brother the defendant a person who it would be proved had actually not seen the plaintiff for a year and a half yet with great recklessness and inhumanity had signed away his liberty and his happiness behind his back then tools of another kindthe kind that anybody can buy a couple of doctorswere as usual easily found to sign the certificates one of these doctors had never seen him but for five minutes and signed in manifest collusion with the other they decoyed this poor young gentleman away on his wedding morningon his wedding morning gentlemen mark thatand consigned him to the worst of all dungeons what he suffered there he must himself relate to you for we who have the happiness to walk abroad in the air of reason and liberty are little able to realise the agony of mind endured by a sane man confined among the insane what we undertake is to prove his sanity up to the very hour of his incarceration and also that he was quite sane at the time when a brutal attempt to recapture him by violence was made under the defendants order and defeated by his own remarkable intelligence and courage along with the facts the true reason why he was imprisoned will probably come out but i am not bound to prove sinister motives it is for the defendant to prove if he can that he had lawful motives for a lawless act and that he exercised due precaution and did not lend himself recklessly to the dark designs of others if he succeed in this that may go in mitigation of damages though it cannot affect the verdict our principal object is the verdict which will remove the foul aspersion cast on my injured client and restore him to society and to this verdict we are entitled unless the other side can prove the plaintiff was insane call alfred hardie and with this he sat down an official called alfred hardie very loud he made no reply julia rose from her seat with dismay painted on her countenance comptons garrows and colts heads clashed together mr colt jumped up again and said my lud i was not aware the gentleman they accuse of insanity is just being examined for high honours in the university of oxford aside to compton and if he doesnt come you may give them the verdict well said the judge of course he will be here before you close your case on this the three heads clashed again and serjeant saunders for the defendant popped up and said with great politeness and affectation of sympathy my lud i can quite understand my learned friends hesitation to produce his principal witness you understand nothing about the matter said colt cavalierly call mr harrington mr harrington was alfreds tutor at eton and deposed to his sanity there he was not crossexamined after him they went on step by step with a fresh witness for every six months till they brought him close to the date of his incarceration then they put in one of julias witnesses peterson who swore alfred had talked to him like a sane person that very morning and repeated what had passed crossexamination only elicited that he and alfred were no longer good friends which rather strengthened the evidence then giles and hannah now man and wife were called and swore he was sane all the time he was at silverton house mr saunders diminished the effect by eliciting that they had left on bad terms with mr baker and that alfred had given them money since but this was half cured on reexamination by being set down to gratitude on alfreds part and now the judge went to luncheon and in came a telegraphic message to say alfred was in the fast train coming up this was good news and bad they had hoped he would drop in before they were approaching that period of the case when not to call the plaintiff must produce a vile impression the judgeout of good nature i suspectwas longer at luncheon than usual and every minute was so much gained to mr compton and julia who were in a miserable state of anxiety yet it was equalled by richard hardies who never entered the court but paced the hall the livelong day to intercept noah skinner and when i tell you that julia had consulted mr green and that he had instantly pronounced mr barkington to be a man from barkington who knew the truth about the fourteen thousand pounds and that the said green and his myrmidons were hunting mr barkington like beagles you will see that r hardies was no vain terror at last the judge returned and mr colt was obliged to put in his reserves so called dr sampson instantly a very dull trial became an amusing one the scorn with which he treated the opinion of dr wycherley and mr speers and medical certificates in general was so droll coming from a doctor and so racily expressed that the court was convulsed also in crossexamination by saunders he sparred away in such gallant style with that accomplished advocate that it was mighty refreshing the judge put in a few intelligent questions after counsel had done and surprised all the doctors in court with these words i am aware sir that you were the main instrument in putting down bloodletting in this country what made sampsons evidence particularly strong was that he had seen the plaintiff the evening before his imprisonment at this moment three men all of them known to the reader entered the court one was our old acquaintance fullalove another was of course vespasian and the third was the missing plaintiff a buzz announced his arrival and expectation rose high mr colt called him with admirably feigned nonchalance he stepped into the box and there was a murmur of surprise and admiration at his bright countenance and manly bearing of course to give his evidence would be to write hard cash over again it is enough to say that his examination in chief lasted all that day and an hour of the next colt took him into the asylum and made him say what he had suffered there to swell the damages the main points his examination in chief established were his sanity during his whole life the money settled on him the means the doctors took to irritate him and then sign him excited the subserviency of his uncle to his father the double motive his father had in getting him imprisoned the business of the l when colt sat down at eleven oclock on the second day the jury looked indignant and the judge looked very grave and the case very black mr saunders electrified his attorney by saying my advice is dont crossexamine him heathfield implored him not to take so strange a course on this saunders shrugged his shoulders rose and crossexamined alfred about the vision of one captain dodd he had seen and about his suspicions of his father had not richard hardie always been a kind and liberal father to this he assented had he not sacrificed a large fortune to his creditors plaintiff believed so on reflection then did not plaintiff think he must have been under an illusion no he had gone by direct evidence confining himself sagaciously to this one question and exerting all his skill and pertinacity saunders succeeded in convincing the court that the hard cash was a myth a pure chimera the defendants case looked up for there are many intelligent madmen with a single illusion the reexamination was of course very short but telling for alfred swore that miss julia dodd had helped him to carry home the phantom of her father and that miss dodd had a letter from her father to say that he was about to sail with the other phantom the l here mr saunders interposed and said that evidence was inadmissible let him call miss dodd colthow do you know im not going to call her the judgeif you are it is superfluous if not it is inadmissible mr compton cast an inquiring glance up at a certain gallery a beautiful girl bowed her head in reply with a warm blush and such a flash of her eye and mr colt said as my learned friend was afraid to crossexamine the plaintiff on any point but this and as i mean to respond to his challenge and call miss dodd i will not trouble the plaintiff any further through the whole ordeal alfred showed a certain flavour of eton and oxford that won all hearts his replies were frank and honest and under crossexamination he was no more to be irritated than if saunders had been harrow bowling at him or the robin sparring with him the serjeant who was a gentleman indicated some little regret at the possible annoyance he was causing him alfred replied with a grand air of good fellowship do not think so poorly of me as to suppose i feel aggrieved because you are an able advocate and do your duty to your client sir the judgethat is very handsomely said i am afraid you have got an awkward customer in a case of this kind brother saunders serjt sit is not for want of brains he is mad my lord alfredthat is a comfort any way laughter when counsel had done with him the judge used his right and put several shrewd and unusual questions to him asked him to define insanity he said he could only do it by examples and he abridged several intelligent madmen their words and ways and contrasted them with the five or six sane people he had fallen in with in asylums showing his lordship plainly that he could tell any insane person whatever from a sane one and vice versa this was the most remarkable part of the trial to see this shrewd old judge extracting from a real observer and logical thinker those positive indicia of sanity and insanity which exist but which no lawyer has ever yet been able to extract from any psychological physician in the witnessbox at last he was relieved and sat sucking an orange among the spectators for they had parched his throat amongst them i promise you julia dodd entered the box and a sunbeam seemed to fill the court she knew what to do her left hand was gloved but her white right hand bare she kissed the book and gave her evidence in her clear mellow melting voice gave it reverently and modestly for to her the court was a church she said how long she had been acquainted with alfred and how his father was adverse and her mother had thought it was because they did not pass for rich and had told her they were rich and with this she produced davids letter and she also swore to having met alfred and others carrying her father in a swoon from his fathers very door she deposed to alfreds sanity on her wedding eve and on the day his recapture was attempted saunders against his own judgment was instructed to crossexamine her and without meaning it he put a question which gave her deep distress are you now engaged to the plaintiff she looked timidly round and saw alfred and hesitated the serjeant pressed her politely but firmly must i reply to that she said piteously if you please then no another misfortune has now separated him and me for ever what is that pray my father is said to have died at sea and my mother thinks he is to blame the judge to saunderswhat on earth has this to do with hardie against hardie saundersyou are warmly interested in the plaintiffs success juliaoh yes sir colt aside to garrowthe fool is putting his foot into it theres not a jury in england that would give a verdict to part two interesting young lovers saundersyou are attached to him juliaah that i do this burst intended for poor alfred not the court baffled crossexamination and grammar and everything else saunders was wise and generous and said no more colt cast a glance of triumph and declined to reexamine he always let well alone the judge however evinced a desire to trace the fourteen thousand pounds from calcutta but julia could not help him that mysterious sum had been announced by letter as about to sail and then no more was heard about it till alfred accused his father of having it all endeavours to fill this hiatus failed however julia observing that in courts material objects affect the mind most had provided herself with all the pieces de conviction she could find and she produced her fathers empty pocketbook and said when he was brought home senseless this was in his breastpocket hand it up to me said the judge he examined it and said it had been in the water captain dodd was wrecked off the french coast suggested mr saunders my learned friend had better go into the witnessbox if he means to give evidence said mr colt you are very much afraid of a very little truth retorted saunders the judge stopped this sham rencontre by asking the witness whether her father had been wrecked she said yes and that is how the money was lost persisted saunders possibly said the judge im darned if it was said joshua fullalove composedly instantly all heads were turned in amazement at this audacious interruption to the soporific decorum of an english court the transatlantic citizen received this battery of eyes with complete imperturbability silence roared the crier awaking from a nap with an instinct that something unusual had happened but the shrewd old judge had caught the sincerity with which the words were uttered and put on his spectacles to examine the speaker are you for the plaintiff or the defendant i dont know either of em from adam my lord but i know captain dodds pocketbook by the bullethole indeed you had better call this witness mr colt your lordship must excuse me i am quite content with my evidence said the wary advocate well then i shall call him as amicus curiae and the defendants counsel can crossexamine him fullalove went into the box was sworn identified the pocketbook and swore he had seen fourteen thousand pounds in it on two occasions with very little prompting he told the seafight and the indian darkies attempt to steal the money and pointed out vespasian as the rival darkie who had baffled the attempt then he told the shipwreck to an audience now breathlessand imagine the astonished interest with which julia and edward listened to this stranger telling them the new strange story of their own fatherand lastly the attempt of the two french wreckers and assassins and how it had been baffled and so the mythical cash was tracked to boulogne the judge then put this question did captain dodd tell you what he intended to do with it fullalove reverentlyi think my lord he said he was going to give it to his wife sharply well what is it old hoss what are you making mugs at me for dont you know its clean against law to telegraph a citizen in the witnessbox the judgethis wont do this wont do the criersilence in the court do you hyar now what his lordship says said fullalove with ready tact if you know anything more come up hyar and swear it like an enlightened citizen do you think i am going to swear for tew with this vespasian and fullalove proceeded to change places amidst roars of laughter at the cool offhand way this pair arranged forensicalities but serjeant saunders requested fullalove to stay where he was pray sir said he slowly who retained you for a witness in this cause fullalove looked puzzled of course somebody asked you to drop in here so very accidentally come now who was it im god almightys witness dropped from the clouds i callate come sir no prevarication how came you here just at the nick of time counsellor when im treated polite im ile but rile me and im thunder stuffed with pison dont you raise my dander and ill tell you i have undertaken to educate this yar darkiehere he stretched out a long arm and laid his hand on vespasians woolly pateand im bound to raise him to the european model laughter so i said to him coming over westminster bridge now theres a store hyar where they sell a very extraordinary fixin and its called justice they sell it tarnation dear but prime so i make tracks for the very court where i got the prime article three years ago against a varmint that was breaking the seventh and eighth commandments over me adulterating my patent and then stealing it blast him a roar of laughter and coming along i said this old countrys got some good pints after all old hoss one is theyll sell you justice dear but prime in these yar courts if you were born at kamschatkee and the other is hyar darkies are free as air disenthralled by the univarsal genius of british liberty and then i pitched counsellor currans bunkum into this darkie and he sucked it in like mothers milk and in we came on tiptoe and the first thing we heard was a freeborn briton treated wus than ever a nigger in old kentuck decoyed away from his gal shoved into a darned madhousethe darbies clapped on him we dont want your comments on the case sir no nor any other free and enlightened citizens i reckon wal vespasian and me sat like mice in a snowdrift and hid our feelings out of good manners being strangers till his lordship got etarnally fixed about the captains pocketbook vesp says i this hurts my feelings powerful says i this hyar lord did the right thing about my patent he summed up just and now he is in an everlasting fix himself one good turn deserves another ill get him out of this fix any way here the witness was interrupted with a roar of laughter that shook the court even the judge leaned back and chuckled genially though quietly and right sorrowful was every briton there when saunders closed abruptly the crossexamination of joshua fullalove his lordship then said he wished to ask vespasian a question saunders lost patience what another amicus curiae my lud this is unprecedented excuse my curiosity brother saunders said the judge ironically i wish to trace this l as far as possible have you any particular objection to the truth on this head of evidence no my lud i never urge objections when i cant enforce them then you are a wise man to vespasian after he had been sworn pray did captain dodd tell you what he intended to do with this money is massa judge massa captan told dis child he got a branker in some place in de old country called barkinton and he said dis branker bery good branker much sartiner not to break dan the brank of england a howl de captan said he take de money to dis yer branker and den hab no more trouble wid it den it off my stomach de captan say and dis child heerd him yah the plaintiffs case being apparently concluded the judge retired for a few minutes in the buzz that followed a note was handed to mr compton skinner on a hot scent sure to find him todaynb he is wanted by another party there is something curious afoot compton wrote on a slip for heavens sake bring him directly in half an hour it will be too late green hurried out and nearly ran against mr richard hardie who was moodily pacing westminster hall at the climax of his own anxiety to him all turned on skinner five minutes passed ten fifteen twenty all the plaintiffs party had their eyes on the door but green did not return and the judge did then to gain a few minutes more mr colt instructed by compton rose and said with great solemnity we are about to call our last witness the living have testified to my clients sanity and now we shall read you the testimony of the dead saundersthat i object to of course coltdoes my learned friend mean to say he objects at random saundersnothing of the kind i object on the law of evidencea matter on which my learned friend seems to be under a hallucination as complete as his clients about that l colt theres none ever feared that the truth should be heard but they whom the truth would indict saundersa court of justice is not the place for old songs and new law coltreally my learned friend is the objective case incarnate to comptoni cant keep this nonsense up for ever is skinner come he has a mania for objection and with your lordships permission ill buy a couple of doctors and lock him up in an asylum as he leaves the court this afternoon laughter the judgea very good plan then youll no longer feel the weight of his abilities i conclude mr colt you intend to call a witness who will swear to the deceased persons handwriting and that it was written in the knowledge death was at hand coltcertainly my lord i can call miss julia dodd saundersthat i need not take the trouble of objecting to the judge with some surpriseno mr colt that will never do you have examined her and reexamined her i need hardly say mr colt knew very well he could not call julia dodd but he was fighting for seconds now to get in skinner call edward dodd edward was sworn and asked if he knew the late jane hardie i knew her well said he is that her handwriting it is where was it written in my mothers house at barkington under what circumstances she was dyingof a blow given her by a maniac called maxley maxley said the judge to counsel i remember the queen v maxley i tried him myself at the assizes it was for striking a young lady with a bludgeon of which she died maxley was powerfully defended and it was proved that his wife had died and he had been driven mad for a time by her fathers bank breaking the jury would bring in a verdict that was no verdict at all as i took the liberty to tell them at the time the judges dismissed it and maxley was eventually discharged coltno doubt that was the case my lord to the witnessdid jane hardie know she was dying oh yes sir she told us all so to whom did she give this letter to my sister oh to your sister to miss julia dodd yes sir but not for herself it was to give to alfred hardie can you read the letter it is rather faintly written it is written in pencil my lord i could read it sir but i hope you will excuse me she that wrote it was very very dear to me the young mans full voice faltered as he uttered these words and he turned his lionlike eyes soft and imploring on the judge that venerable and shrewd old man learned in human nature as well as in law comprehended in a moment and said kindly you misunderstand him witnesses do not read letters out in court let the letter be handed up to me this was fortunate for the court cuckoo who intones most letters would have read all the sense and pathos out of this with his monotonous singsong the judge read it carefully to himself with his glasses and told the jury it seemed a genuine document then the crier cried silence in the court and his lordship turned towards the jury and read the letter slowly and solemnly dear dear brotheryour poor little jane lies dying suddenly but not painfully and my last earthly thoughts are for my darling brother some wicked person has said you are insane i deny this with my dying breath and my dying hand you came to me the night before the wedding that was to be and talked to me most calmly rationally and kindly so that i could not resist your reasons and went to your wedding which till then i did not intend show these words to your slanderers when i am no more but oh alfred even this is of little moment compared with the world to come by all our affection grant me one request battered wounded dying in my prime what would be my condition but for the saviour whom i have loved and with whom i hope soon to be he smoothes the bed of death for me he lights the dark valley i rejoice to die and be with him oh turn to him dear brother without one hours delay and then how short will be this parting this is your dying sisters one request who loves you dearly with the exception of julias sobs not a sound was heard as the judge read it many eyes were wet and the judge himself was visibly affected and pressed his handkerchief a moment to his eyes these are the words of a christian woman gentlemen he said and there was silence a girls hand seemed to have risen from the grave to defend her brother and rend the veil from falsehood mr colt out of pure tact subdued his voice to the key of the sentiment thus awakened and said impressively gentlemen of the jury that is our case and so sat down chapter liii sergeant saunders thought it prudent to let the emotion subside before opening the defendants case so he disarranged his papers and then rearranged them as before and during this a person employed by richard hardie went out and told him this last untoward piece of evidence he winced but all was overbalanced by this that skinner had not come to bear witness for the plaintiff sergeant saunders rose with perfect dignity and confidence and delivered a masterly address in less than ten minutes the whole affair took another colour under that plausible tongue the tactician began by declaring that the plaintiff was perfectly sane and his convalescence was a matter of such joy to the defendant that not even the cruel misinterpretation of facts and motives to which his amiable client had been exposed could rob him of that sacred delight our case gentlemen is that the plaintiff is sane and that he owes his sanity to those prompt wise and benevolent measures which we took eighteen months ago at an unhappy crisis of his mind to preserve his understanding and his property yes his property gentlemen that property which in a paroxysm of mania he was going to throw away as i shall show you by an unanswerable document he comes here to slander us and mulet us out of five thousand pounds but i shall show you he is already ten thousand pounds the richer for that act of ours for which he debits us five thousand pounds instead of crediting us twice the sum gentlemen i cannot like my learned friend call witnesses from the clouds from the united states and from the grave for it has not occurred to my client strong in the sense of his kindly and honourable intentions to engage gentlemen from foreign parts with woolly locks and nasal twangs to drop in accidentally and eke out the fatal gaps in evidence the class of testimony we stand upon is less romantic it does not seduce the imagination nor play upon the passions but it is of a much higher character in sober mens eyes especially in a court of law i rely not on witnesses dropped from the clouds and the stars and the stripesto order nor even on the prejudiced statements of friends and sweethearts who always swear from the heart rather than from the head and the conscience but on the calm testimony of indifferent men and on written documents furnished by the plaintiff and on contemporaneous entries in the books of the asylum which entries formally describe the plaintiffs acts and were put down at the timeat the time gentlemenwith no idea of a trial at law to come but in compliance with the very proper provisions of a wise and salutary act i shall also lay before you the evidence of the medical witnesses who signed the certificates men of probity and honour and who have made these subtle maladies of the mind the special study of their whole life i shall also call the family doctor who has known the plaintiff and his ailments bodily and mental for many years and communicated his suspicions to one of the first psychological physicians of the age declining with a modesty which we who know less of insanity than he does would do well to imitatedeclining i say to pronounce a positive opinion unfavourable to the plaintiff till he should have compared notes with this learned man and profited by his vast experience in this strain he continued for a good hour until the defendants case seemed to be a thing of granite his oration ended he called a string of witnesses every one of whom bore the learned counsel out by his evidence in chief but here came the grand distinction between the defendants case and the plaintiffs crossexamination had hardly shaken the plaintiffs witnesses it literally dissolved the defendants osmond was called and proved alfreds headaches and pallor and his own suspicions but then colt forced him to admit that many young people had headaches without going mad and were pale when thwarted in love without going mad and that as to the l and the phantom he knew nothing but had taken all that for granted on mr richard hardies word dr wycherley deposed to alfreds being insane and abnormally irritable and under a pecuniary illusion as stated in his certificate and to his own vast experience but the fire of crossexamination melted all his polysyllables into guesswork and hearsay it melted out of him that he a stranger had intruded on the young mans privacy and had burst into a most delicate topic his disagreement with his father and so had himself created the very irritation he had set down to madness he also had to admit that he knew nothing about the l or the phantom but had taken for granted the young mans own father who consulted him was not telling him a deliberate and wicked falsehood coltin short sir you were retained to make the man out insane just as my learned friend there is retained wycherleyi think sir it would not be consistent with the dignity of my profession to notice that comparison colti leave defendants counsel to thank you for that come never mind dignity let us have a little truth is it consistent with your dignity to tell us whether the keepers of private asylums pay you a commission for all the patients you consign to durance vile by your certificates dr wycherley fenced with this question but the remorseless colt only kept him longer under torture and dragged out of him that he received fifteen per cent from the asylum keepers for every patient he wrote insane and that he had an income of eight hundred pounds a year from that source alone this of course was the very thing to prejudice a jury against the defence and colts art was to keep to their level speers crossexamined failed to conceal that he was a mere tool of wycherleys and had signed in manifest collusion adhering to the letter of the statute but violating its spirit for certainly the act never intended by separate examination that two doctors should come into the passage and walk into the room alternately then reunite and do the signing as agreed before they ever saw the patient as to the illusion about the fourteen thousand pounds speers owned that the plaintiff had not uttered a word about the subject but had peremptorily declined it he had to confess too that he had taken for granted dr wycherley was correctly informed about the said illusion in short said the judge interposing dr wycherley took the very thing for granted which it was his duty to ascertain and you sir not to be behind dr wycherley took the thing for granted at second hand and when speers had left the box he said to serjeant saunders if this case is to be defended seriously you had better call mr richard hardie without further delay it is my wish my lud but i am sorry to say he is in the country very ill and i have no hope of seeing him here before tomorrow oh well so that you do call him i shall not lay hearsay before the jury hearsay gathered from mr richard hardiewhom you will call in person if the reports he has circulated have any basis whatever in truth mr saunders said coolly mr richard hardie is not the defendant and flowed on nor would any but a lawyer have suspected what a terrible stab the judge had given him so quietly the surgeon of silverton house was then sworn and produced the case book and there stood the entries which had been so fatal to alfred with the visiting justices suicide homicide selfstarvation but the plaintiff got to mr colt with a piece of paper on which he had written his view of all this and crossexamination dissolved the suicide and homicide into a spirited attempt to escape and resist a false imprisonment as for the selfstarvation colt elicited that alfred had eaten at six oclock though not at two and pray sir said he contemptuously to the witness do you never stir out of a madhouse do you imagine that gentlemen in their senses dine at two oclock in the nineteenth century no i dont say that what do you say then is forcible imprisonment of a bridegroom in a madhouse the thing to give a gentleman a factitious appetite at your barbarous dinnerhour in a word colt was rough with this witness and nearly smashed him saunders fought gallantly on and put in lawyer crawford with his draft of the insane deed as he called it by which the erotic monomaniac alfred divested himself of all his money in favour of the dodds there was no dissolving this deed away and crawford swore he had entreated the plaintiff not to insist on his drawing so unheardof a document but opposition or question seemed to irritate his client so that he had complied and the deed was to have been signed on the weddingday all the lawyers present thought this looked really mad fancy a man signing away his property to his wifes relatives the court which had already sat long beyond the usual time broke up leaving the defendant with this advantage alfred hardie and his friends made a little knot in the hall outside and talked excitedly over the incidents of the trial mr compton introduced fullalove and vespasian they all shook hands with them and thanked them warmly for the timely and most unexpected aid but green and a myrmidon broke in upon their conversation i am down on mr barkington alias noah skinner it isnt very far from here if you will follow me green was as excited as a foxhound when pug has begun to trail his brush the more so that another client of his wanted noah skinner and so the detective was doing a double stroke of business he led the way it was dry and they all went in pairs after him into the back slums of westminster and a pretty part that is now as they went along alfred hung behind with julia and asked her what on earth she meant by swearing that it was all over between her and him why your last letter was full of love dearest what could you be thinking of to say that she shook her head sadly and revealed to him with many prayers for forgiveness that she had been playing a part of late that she had concealed her fathers death from him and the fatal barrier interposed i was afraid you would be disheartened and lose your first class and perhaps your trial but you are safe now dear alfred i am sure the judge sees through them for i have studied him for you i know his face by heart and all his looks and what they mean my alfred will be cleared of this wicked slander and happy with some oneah yes i mean to be happy with some one said alfred i am not one of your selfsacrificing angels thank heaven your shall not sacrifice us to your mothers injustice nor to the caprices of fate we have one another but you would immolate me for the pleasure of immolating yourself dont provoke me too far or ill carry you off by force i swear it by him who made us both dearest how wildly you talk and with this julia hung her head and had a guilty thrill she could not help thinking that eccentric little measure would relieve her of the sin of disobedience after making known to her his desperate resolution alfred was silent and they went sadly side by side so dear so near yet always some infernal thing or other coming between them they reached a passage in a miserable street at the mouth stood two of greens men planted there to follow skinner should he go out but they reported all quiet bring the old gentleman up said green i appointed him six oclock and its on the stroke he then descended the passage and striking a light led the way up a high stair skinner lived on the fifth story green tapped at his door mr barkington no reply mr barkington ive brought you some money no reply perhaps he is not at home said mr compton oh yes sir i sent a sharp boy up and he picked the paper out of the keyhole and saw him sitting reading he then applied his own eye to the keyhole i see something black said he i think he suspects while he hesitated they became conscious of a pungent vapour stealing through the now open keyhole hallo said green what is this fullalove observed coolly that mr skinners lungs must be peculiarly made if he could breathe in that atmosphere if you want to see him alive let me open the door theres something amiss here said green gravely at that fullalove whipped out a tool no bigger than a nutcracker forced the edge in and sent the door flying open the room or den was full of an acrid vapour and close to them sat he they sought motionless keep the lady back cried green and threw the vivid light of his bulls eye on a strange grotesque and ghastly scene the floor was covered with bright sovereigns that glittered in the lamplight on the table was an open book and a candle quite burnt down the grease had run into a circle and as was that grease to the expired light so was the thing that sat there in human form to the noah skinner they had come to seek dead this many a day of charcoal fumes but preserved from decomposition by those very fumes sat noah skinner dried into bones and leather waiting for them with his own hard cash and with theirs for creeping awestruck round that mummified figure seated dead on his pool of sovereigns they soon noticed in his left hand a paper it was discoloured by the vapour and part hid by the dead thumb but thus much shone out clear and amazing that it was a bankers receipt to david dodd esq for l drawn at barkington and signed for richard hardie by noah skinner julia had drawn back and was hiding her face but soon curiosity struggled with awe in the others they peeped at the receipt they touched the weird figure its yellow skin sounded like a drum and its joints creaked like a puppets at last compton suggested that edward dodd ought to secure that valuable document no no said edward it is too like robbing the dead then i will said compton but he found the dead thumb and finger would not part with the receipt then as a trifle turns the scale he hesitated in turn and all but julia stood motionless round the body that held the receipt the soul of the lost cash and still as in life seemed loth to part with it then fullalove came beside the armchair and said with simple dignity im a man from foreign parts i have no interest here but justice and justice ill do he took the dead arm and the joint creaked he applied the same lever to the bone and parchment hand he had to the door it creaked too but more faintly and opened and let out this no barkington nov received of david dodd esq the sum of fourteen thousand and ten pounds twelve shillings and six pence to account on demand for richard hardie noah skinner l a stately foot came up the stair but no one heard it all were absorbed in the strange weird sight and this great stroke of fate or of providence this is yours i reckon said fullalove and handed the receipt to edward no no said compton see ive just found a will bequeathing all he has in the world with his blessing to miss julia dodd these sovereigns are yours then but above all the paper as your legal adviser i insist on your taking it immediately possession is nine points however it is actually yours in virtue of this bequest a solemn passionless voice seemed to fall on them from the clouds no it is mine my story must now return on board the vulture just before noon the bell the half hours are struck on was tolled to collect the ships company and soon the gangways and booms were crowded and even the yards were manned with sailors collected to see their shipmate committed to the deep next came the lieutenants and midshipmen and stood reverently on the deck the body was brought and placed on a grating then all heads being uncovered below and aloft the chaplain read the solemn service of the dead many tears were shied by the rough sailors the more so that to most of them though not to the officers it was now known that poor billy had not always been before the mast but had seen better days and commanded vessels and saved lives and now he had lost his own the service is the same as ashore with this exception that the words we commit his body to the ground ashes to ashes dust to dust c are altered at sea thus we commit his body to the deep to be turned into corruption looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead and the life of the world to come at these words the body is allowed to glide off the grating into the sea the chaplains solemn voice drew near those very words and the tears of pity fell faster and georgie white an affectionate boy sobbed violently and shivered beforehand at the sullen plunge that he knew would soon come and then he should see no more poor billy who had given his life for his at this moment the captain came flying on deck and jumping on to a gun cried sharply avast haul that body aboard the sharp voice of command cut across the solemn words and tones in the most startling way the chaplain closed his book with a look of amazement and indignation the sailors stared and for the first time did not obey an order to be sure it was one they had never heard before then the captain got angry and repeated his command louder and the body was almost jerked in board carry him to my cabin and uncover his face by this time nothing could surprise jackey tar four sailors executed the order promptly bosen pipe to duty while the men were dispersing to their several stations captain bazalgette apologised to the chaplain and explained to him and to the officers but i give his explanation in my own words finding the ship quiet the purser went to the captain down below and asked him coolly what entry he should make in the ships books about this william thompson who was no more william thompson than he was what do you mean said the captain then the purser told him that thompsons messmates in preparing him last night for interment had found a little bag round his neck and inside it a medal of the humane society and a slip of paper written on in a ladys hand then they had sent for him and he had seen at once that this was a mysterious case this lady spoke of him as her husband and skipper of a merchant vessel what is that roared the captain who hitherto had listened with scarce half an ear skipper of a merchant vessel sir as sure as you command her majestys frigate vulture and then we found his shirt marked with the same name as the ladys what was the ladys name lucy dodd and david dodd is on the shirt why didnt you tell me this before cried the captain didnt know it till last night why it is twelve oclock they are burying him yes sir lucy would never forgive me cried the captain and to the pursers utter amazement he clapped on his cocked hat and flew out of the cabin on the errand i have described he now returned to the cabin and looked a glance was enough there lay the kindly face that had been his friend man and boy he hid his own with his hands and moaned he cursed his own blindness and stupidity in not recognising that face among a thousand in this he was unjust to himself david had never looked himself till now he sent for the surgeon and told him the whole sad story and asked him what could be done his poor cousin lucy had more than once expressed her horror of interment at sea it is very hot said he but surely you must know some way of keeping him till we land in new zealand curse these flies how they bite the surgeons eyes sparkled he happened to be an enthusiast in the art of embalming keep him to new zealand said he contemptuously ill embalm him so that he shall go to england looking just as he does nowbytheby i never saw a drowned man keep his colour so well beforeay and two thousand years after that if you dont mind the expense the expense i dont care if it cost me a years pay i think of nothing but repairing my blunder as far as i can the surgeon was delighted standing over his subject who lay on the captains table he told that officer how he should proceed i have all the syringes he said a capital collection i shall inject the veins with care and patience then i shall remove the brain and the viscera and provided im not stinted in arsenic and spices i give you carte blanche on the purser make your preparations and send for him dont tell me how you do it but do it i must write and tell poor lucy i have got him and am bringing him home to herdead the surgeon was gone about a quarter of an hour he then returned with two men to remove the body and found the captain still writing his letter very sorrowful but now and then slapping his face or leg with a hearty curse as the flies stung him the surgeon beckoned the men in softly and pointed to the body for them to carry it out now as he pointed his eye following his finger fell on something that struck that experienced eye as incredible he uttered an exclamation of astonishment so loud that the captain looked up directly from his letter and saw him standing with his finger pointing at the corpse and his eyes staring astonishment what now said the captain and rose from his seat look look look the captain came and looked and said he saw nothing at all the fly the fly cried the surgeon yes i see one of them has been biting him for theres a little blood trickling poor fellow a dead man cant bleed from the small veins in his skin said the man of art he is alive captain he is alive as sure as we stand here and gods above that little insect was wiser than us he is alive jackson dont trifle with me or ill hang you at the yardarm god bless you jackson is it really possible run some of you get a mirror i have heard that is a test mirror be hanged doctor fly knows his business all was now flutter and bustle and various attempts were made to resuscitate david but all in vain at last the surgeon had an idea this man was never drowned at all said he i am sure of it this is catalepsy he may lie this way for a week but dead he is not ill try the douche david was then by his orders stripped and carried to a place where they could turn a watercock on him from a height and the surgeon had soon the happiness of pointing out to the captain a slight blush on davids skin in parts caused by the falling water all doubts ceased with this the only fear was lest they should shake out the trembling life by rough usage they laid him on his stomach and with a bellows and pipe so acted on the lungs that at last a genuine sigh issued from the patients breast then they put him in a warm bed and applied stimulants and by slow degrees the eyelids began to wink the eyes to look more mellow the respiration to strengthen the heart to beat patience now said the surgeon patience and lots of air patience was rewarded just four hours after the first treatment a voice faint but calm and genial issued from the bed on their astonished ears good morning to you all they kept very quiet in about five minutes more the voice broke out again calm and sonorous where is my moneymy fourteen thousand pounds these words set them all looking at one another and very much puzzled the surgeon they were delivered with such sobriety and conviction captain he whispered ask him if he knows you david said the captain kindly do you know me david looked at him earnestly and his old kindly smile broke out know ye ye clog said he why you are my cousin reginald and how came you into this thundering bank i hope you have got no money here ware land sharks we are not in a bank david we are on board my ship the deuce we are but wheres my money oh well talk about that byandby the surgeon stepped forward and said soothingly you have been very ill sir you have had a fit i believe you are right said david thoughtfully will you allow me to examine your eye certainly doctor the surgeon examined davids eye with his thumb and finger and then looked into it to see how the pupil dilated and contracted he rubbed his hands after this examination more good news captain then lowering his voice your friend is as sane as i am the surgeon was right a shock had brought back the reason a shock had taken away but how or why i know no more than the child unborn the surgeon wrote a learned paper and explained the whole most ingeniously i dont believe one word of his explanation and cant better it so confine myself to the phenomena being now sane the boundary wall of his memory was shifted he remembered his whole life up to his demanding his cash back of richard hardie and there his reawakened mind stopped dead short being asked if he knew william thompson he said yes perfectly he was a foretopman on board the agra and rather a smart hand the ship was aground and breaking up he went out to sea on a piano but we cut the hawser as he drifted under and he got safe ashore davids recovered reason rejected with contempt as an idle dream all that had happened while that reason was in defect the last phenomena i have to record were bodily one was noted by mr georgie white in these terms billys eyes used to be like a seals but now he is a great gentleman they are like yours and mine the other was more singular with his recovered reason came his first grey hair and in one fortnight it was all as white as snow he remained a fortnight on board the vulture beloved by high and low he walked the quarterdeck in the dress of a private gentleman but looking like an admiral the sailors touched their hats to him with a strange mixture of veneration and jocoseness they called him among themselves commodore billy he was supplied with funds by reginald and put on board a merchant ship bound for england he landed amid went straight to barkington there he heard his family were in london he came back to london and sought them a friend told him of green he went to him and of course green saw directly who he was but able men dont cut business short he gravely accepted davids commission to find him mrs dodd finding him so confident david asked him if he thought he could find richard hardie or his clerk noah skinner both of whom had levanted from barkington green who was on a hot scent as to skinner demurely accepted both commissions and appointed david to meet him at a certain place at six he came he found greens man who took him upstairs and there was that excited group determining the ownership of his receipt now to david that receipt was a thing of yesterday it is mine said he they all turned to look at this man with sober passionless voice and hair of snow a keen cry from julias heart made every heart there quiver and in a moment she was clinging and sobbing on her fathers neck edward could only get his hand and press and kiss it instinct told them heaven had given them their father back mind and all ere the joy and the emotion had calmed themselves alfred hardie slipped out and ran like a deer to pembroke street those who were so strangely reunited could not part for a long time even to go down the stairs one by one david was the first to recover his composure indeed great tranquillity of spirit had ever since his cure been a remarkable characteristic of this mans nature his passing mania seemed to have burnt out all his impetuosity leaving him singularly sober calm and selfgoverned mr compton took the money and the will and promised the executrix skinner should be decently interred and all his debts paid out of the estate he would look in at byandby and now a happy party wended their way towards pembroke street but alfred was beforehand with them he went boldly up the stairs and actually surprised mrs dodd and sampson together at sight of him she rose made him a low curtsey and beat a retreat he whipped to the door and set his back against it no said he saucily she drew up majestically and the colour mounted in her pale face what sir would you detain me by force and no mistake said the audacious boy how else can i detain you when you hate me so she began to peep into his sparkling eyes to see the reason of this strange conduct cway from the door ye vagabin said sampson no no my friend said mrs dodd trembling and still peering into his sparkling eyes mr alfred hardie is a gentleman at all events he would not take such a liberty with me unless he had some excuse for it you are wonderfully shrewd mamma said alfred admiringly the excuse is i dont hate you as you hate me and i am very happy why do you call me mamma today oh doctor he calls me mamma th audacious vagabin no no i cannot think he would call me that unless he had some good news for us both what good news can he have except that his trile is goin well and you dont care for that oh how can you say so i care for all that concerns him he would not come here to insult my misery with his happiness he is noble he is generous with all his faults how dare you call me mamma sir call it me again my dear child because then i shall know you are come to save my heart from breaking and with this the truth must be told the stately mrs dodd did fawn upon alfred with palms outstretched and piteous eyes and certain cajoling arts of her sex give me a kiss then mamma said the impudent boy and i will tell you a little bit of good news she bowed her stately head directly and paid the required tribute with servile humility and readiness well then said alfred and was just going to tell her all but caught sight of sampson making the most expressive pantomime to him to be cautious well said he i have seen a sailor ah and he is sure mr dodd is alive mrs dodd lifted her hands to heaven but could not speak in fact said alfred hesitating for he was a wretched hand at a fib he saw him not a fortnight ago on board ship but that is not all mamma the sailor says he has his reason mrs dodd sank on her knees and said no word to man but many to the giver of all good when she arose she said to alfred bring this sailor to me i must speak with him directly alfred coloured i dont know where to find him just now oh indeed said mrs dodd quietly and this excited her suspicion and from that moment the cunning creature lay in wait for master alfred she plied him with questions and he got more and more puzzled how to sustain his story at last by way of bursting out of his own net he said but i am sorry to say his hair has turned white but perhaps you wont mind that and he hadnt a grey hair it is not grey like the doctors it is as white as the driven snow mrs dodd sighed then suddenly turning on alfred asked him did the sailor tell you that he hesitated a moment and was lost you have seen him she screamed he is in london he is in the house i feel him near me and she went into something very like hysterics alfred was alarmed and whispered the truth the doctor sent him off to meet them and recommended caution her nerves were in such a state a violent shock even of happiness might kill her thus warned julia came into the room alone and while dr sampson was inculcating selfrestraint for her own sake she listened with a superior smile and took quite a different line mamma said she he is in the town but i dare not bring him here till you are composed his reason is restored but his nerves are not so strong as they were now if you agitate yourself you will agitate him and will do him a serious mischief this crafty speech produced an incredible effect on mrs dodd it calmed her directly or rather her great love gave her strength to be calm i will not be such a wretch she said see i am composed quite composed bring me my darling and you shall see how good i will be there now julia see how calm i am quite calm what have i borne so much misery with heavens help and do you think i cannot bear this great happiness for my dear darlings sake on this they proposed she should retire to her room and they would go for david think over the meeting dear dear mamma said julia and then you will behave well for his sake who was lost to us and is found husband and wife met alone in mrs dodds room no eye even of the children ventured to witness a scene so strange so sacred we may try and imagine that meeting but few of us can conceive it by the light of our narrow experience yet one or two there may bethe world is wide and the adventures and emotions of our race are many one by one all were had up to that sacred room to talk to the happy pair they found david seated calmly at his wifes feet her soft hand laid on his white hair lest he should leave her again and they told him all the sorrow behind them and he genial and kindly as ever told them all the happiness before them he spoke like the master of the house the father of the family the friend of them all but with all his goodness he was sternly resolved to have his l out of richard hardie he had an interview with mr compton that very night and the lawyer wrote a letter to mr hardie saying nothing about the death of skinner but notifying that his client captain dodd had recovered from noah skinner the receipt no for l s d and he was instructed to sue for it unless repaid immediately he added captain dodd was mercifully restored and remembered distinctly every particular of the transaction they all thought in their innocence that hardie v hardie was now at an end captain dodd could prove alfreds soidisant illusion to be the simple truth but compton thought that this evidence had come too late what may we not get up and say here is papa and it is all true cried julia indignant no miss dodd our case is closed and take my advice dont subject your father to the agitation of a trial we can do without him well then they would all go as spectators and pray that justice might prevail they did go and all sat together to hear a matter puzzled over which had david come one day earlier he would have set at rest for ever dick absolom was put in to prove that alfred had put two sovereigns on the stumps for him to bowl if he could and after him the defendant mr thomas hardie a mild benevolent weak gentleman was put into the box and swore the boys father had come to him with story after story of the plaintiffs madness and the trouble it would get him into and so he had done for the best his simplicity was manifest and saunders worked it ably when colt got hold of him and badgered him he showed something more than simplicity he stuttered he contradicted himself he perspired he all but wept coltare you sure you had no spite against him deftno coltyou are not sure eh this candid interpretation of his words knocked the defendant stupid he made no reply but looked utterly flabbergasted coltdid he not provoke you did he not call you an idiot defthe might colt satiricallyof course he might laughter but did he deft plucking up a little spiritno he called me soft tommy this revelation and the singular appropriateness of the nickname were so highly relished by an intelligent audience that it was a long time before the trial could go on for roars the plaintiffs ringing laugh was heard among the rest the crossexamination proceeded in this style till the defendant began to drivel at the mouth a little at last after a struggle he said with a piteous whine that he could not help it he hated signing his name some mischief always came of it but this time he had no option no option said colt what do you mean and with one or two more turns of the screw out came this astounding revelation richard said if i didnt put taff in one he would put me in one the judgein one what deft weepingin one madhouse my lord a peal followed this announcement and colt sat down grinning saunders rose smiling i am much obliged to the learned counsel for making my case said he i need not prolong the sufferings of the innocent you can go down mr hardie the judgehave you any defence to this action certainly my lord do you call richard hardie no my lord then had you not better confine yourself to the question of damages the sturdy saunders would not take the hint he replied upon the whole case and fought hard for a verdict the line he took was bold he described richard hardie as a man who had acquired a complete power over his weaker brother and had not only persuaded him by statements but even compelled him by threats to do what he believed would be the salvation of his nephew will you imitate the learned counsels cruelty will you strike a child in short he made a powerful appeal to their pity while pretending to address their judgments then colt rose like a tower and assuming the verdict as certain asked the jury for heavy damages he contrasted powerfully the defendants paltry claim to pity with the anguish the plaintiff had undergone he drew the wedding party the insult to the bride the despair of the kidnapped bridegroom he lashed the whole gang of conspirators concerned in the crime regretted that they could only make one of all these villains smart but hinted that richard and thomas hardie were in one boat and that heavy damages inflicted on thomas would find the darker culprit out he rapped out mr cowpers lines on liberty and they were new to the jury though probably not to you he warned the jury that all our liberties depended on them in vain said he have we beheaded one tyrant and banished another to secure those liberties if men are to be allowed to send away their own flesh and blood into the worst of all prisons for life and not smart for it in those lamentably few cases in which the law finds them out and lays hold of them but it would task my abilities to the utmost and occupy more time than is left me to do anything like justice to the fluent fiery eloquence of colt q c when he got a great chance like this tonat fulgurat et rapidis eloquentiae fluctibus cuncia proruit et proturbat bursts of applause that neither crier nor judge could suppress bore witness to the deep indignation britons feel when their hardearned liberties are tampered with by power or fraud in defiance of law and when he sat down the jury were ready to fly out at him with l in hand then rose the passionless voice of justice according to law i wish i could give the very words the following is the effect as i understood it lawyers forgive my deficiencies this is an important but not a difficult case the plaintiff sues the defendant under the law of england for falsely imprisoning him in a madhouse the imprisonment is admitted and the sufferings of the plaintiff not disputed the question is whether he was insane at the time of the act now i must tell you that in a case of this kind it lies upon the defendant to prove the plaintiffs insanity rather than on the plaintiff to prove his own sanity has the defendant overcome this difficulty illusion is the best proof of insanity and a serious endeavour was certainly made to fasten an illusion on the plaintiff about a sum of l but the proof was weak and went partly on an assumption that all error is hallucination this is illusory and would if acted on set one half the kingdom imprisoning the other half and after all they did not demonstrate that the plaintiff was in error they advanced no undeniable proof that mr richard hardie has not embezzled this l i dont say it was proved on the other hand that he did embezzle that sum richard hardie sueing alfred hardie for libel on this evidence might possibly obtain a verdict for then the burden of proof would lie on alfred hardie but here it lies on those who say he is insane the fact appears to be that the plaintiff imbibed a reasonable suspicion of his own fathers integrity it was a suspicion founded on evidence imperfect indeed but of a sound character as far as it went there had been a letter from captain dodd to his family announcing his return with l upon him and while as yet unaware of this letter the plaintiff heard david dodd accuse richard hardie of possessing improperly l the identical sum at least he swears to this and as richard hardie was not called to contradict him you are at liberty to suppose that richard hardie had some difficulty in contradicting him on oath here then true or false was a rational suspicion and every man has a right to a rational suspicion of his neighbour and even to utter it within due limits and if he overstep those the party slandered has his legal remedy but if he omits his legal remedy and makes an attempt of doubtful legality not to confute but to stifle the voice of reasonable suspicion shrewd men will suspect all the more but then comes a distinct and respectable kind of evidence for the defendant he urges that the plaintiff was going to sign away his property to his wifes relations now this was proved and a draft of the deed put in and sworn to this taken singly has a very extraordinary look still you must consider the plaintiffs reasonable suspicion that money belonging to the dodds had passed irregularly to the hardies and then the wonder is diminished young and noble minds have in every age done generous selfdenying and delicate acts the older we get the less likely we are to be incarcerated for a crime of this character but we are not to imprison youth and chivalry merely because we have outgrown them to go from particulars to generals the defendant on whom the proof lies has advanced hearsay and conjecture and not put their originators into the box the plaintiff on whom the proof does not lie has advanced abundant evidence that he was sane at the time of his incarceration this was proved to demonstration by friends strangers and by himself here the judge analysed the testimony of several of the plaintiffs witnesses as to the parties themselves it is curious how they impersonated so to speak their respective lines of argument the representative of evidence and sound reasoning though accused of insanity was precise frank rational and dignified in the witnessbox and i think you must have noticed his good temper the party who relied on hearsay and conjecture was as feeble as they are he was almost imbecile as you observed and looking at both parties it really seems monstrous that the plaintiff should be the one confined as a lunatic and the defendant allowed to run wild and lock up his intellectual superiors if he means to lock them all up even you and i are hardly safe laughter the only serious question i apprehend is on what basis the damages ought to be assessed the plaintiffs counsel has made a powerful appeal to your passions and calls for vengeance now i must tell you you have no right to make yourselves ministers of vengeance nor even to punish the defendant in a suit of the kind still less ought you to strike the defendant harder than you otherwise wouldin the vague hope of punishing indirectly the true mover of the defendant and the other puppets i must warn you against that suggestion of the learned counsels if the plaintiff wants vengeance the criminal law offers it he comes here not for vengeance but for compensation and restoration to that society which he is every way fitted to adorn more than thisand all our sympathiesit is not for us to give him but then the defendants counsel went too far the other way his client he says is next door to an idiot and so forsooth his purse must be spared entirely this is all very well if it could be done without ignoring the plaintiff and his just claim to compensation why if the defendant instead of being weakminded were an idiot or a lunatic it would protect him from punishment as a felon but not from damages in a suit a sane man is not to be falsely imprisoned by a lunatic without full compensation from the lunatic or his estate a fortiori he is not to be so imprisoned by a mere fool without just compensation supposing your verdict then to be for the plaintiff i think vindictive damages would be unfair on this feeble defendant who has acted recklessly but under an error and without malice or bad faith on the other hand nominal or even unsubstantial damages would be unjust to the plaintiff and perhaps leave in some minds a doubt that i think you do not yourselves entertain as to the plaintiffs perfect sanity during the whole period of his life as soon as his lordship had ended the foreman of the jury said their minds were quite made up long ago silence in the court we find for the plaintiff with damages three thousand pounds the verdict was received with some surprise by the judge and all the lawyers except mr colt and by the people with acclamation in the midst of which mr colt announced that the plaintiff had just gained his first class at oxford i wish him joy said the judge chapter liv the verdict was a thunderclap to richard hardie he had promised thomas to bear him blameless the old turks into which he had bought at were down to and that implied a loss of five thousand pounds on the top of all this came mr comptons letter neatly copied by colls richard hardie was doubly and trebly ruined then in his despair and hate he determined to baffle them all ay and sting the hearts of some of them once more he would give peggy his last shilling write a line to alfred another to julia assuring them he had no money and they had killed him and with that leave them both the solemn curse of a dying father and then kill himself not to be interrupted in his plan he temporised with mr compton wrote that if the receipt was really signed by his agent of course the loss must fall on him it was a large sum but he would sell out and do his best in ten days from date with this he went and bought a pistol and at several chemists shops a little essential oil of almonds his plan was to take the poison and if it killed without pain well and good but if it tortured him then he would blow his brains out at once he soon arranged his worldly affairs and next day gave peggy his l and told her she had better keep it for fear he should be arrested he sent her on an errand to the other part of the town then with his poison and the pistol before him on the table wrote a brief but emphatic curse for his son and julia and a line to peggy to thank her for her fidelity to one so much older than herself and to advise her to take a tobacconists shop with his money when he had done all this he poured out the fragrant poison and tasted it ere he could drink it one of those quidnunes who are always interrupting a gentleman when he has important business on hand came running in with all manner of small intelligence mr hardie put down the glass and gave him short sullen answers in hopes he would then go away and let him proceed to business and at last his visitor did rise and go mr hardie sat down with a sigh of relief to his fragrant beverage doesnt the door open and this bore poke in his head oh i forgot to tell you the old turks are going up today like a shot and with this he slammed the door again and was off at this the cup began to tremble in the resolute wretchs hand the old turks going up he poured the poison back into the phial and put it and the pistol and all the letters carefully into his pocket and took a cab to the city the report was true there was an extraordinary movement in the old turks the sultan was about to pay a portion of this loan being at six per cent this had transpired and at four oclock the turks were quoted at mr hardie returned a gainer of l instead of a loser he locked up the means of death for the present and now an ordinary man would have sold out and got clear of the fatal trap but this was not an ordinary man he would not sell a share that day in the afternoon they rose to he came home unloaded his pistol and made himself some brandyandwater and with a grim smile flavoured it with a few drops of the poisonthat was a delicious tumbler the turks went up up up to then he sold out and cleared l and all in about ten days with this revived the habits of his youth no more cheating nothing could excuse that but the dread of poverty he went to his appointment with mr compton asked to see the receipt said yes that was his form and skinners handwriting he had never personally received one farthing of the money skinner had clearly embezzled it but that did not matter of course captain dodd must not lose his money send your bill of costs in hardie v hardie to me mr compton said he they shall not be taxed you have lost enough by me already there was an air of dignity and good faith about the man that half imposed even on compton and when mr hardie drew out the notes and said i should be grateful if you would forgive me the interest but for a great piece of good fortune on the stock exchange i could never have paid the whole principal he said warmly the interest should never be demanded through him he called in colls delivered up the receipt and received the l s d from mr hardie o immortal cash you like your great inventor have then a kind of spirit as well as a body and on this not on your grosser part depends your personal identity so long as that survives your body may be recalled to its lawful owner from heaven knows where mr compton rushed to pembroke street and put this hard hard cash in david dodds hands once more love and constancy had triumphed and julia and alfred were to be married and go down to albion villa to prepare it for the whole party tenants no more alfred had bought it the commissioners of lunacy had protected his l zealously from the first and his trustees had now paid the money over alfred consulted by mrs dodd whose pet of pets he now was as to the guests to be asked to the wedding breakfast suggested none but the tried friends of our adversity what an excellent idea said mrs dodd naively dr sampson being duly invited asked if he should bring his emulsion this proposal puzzled all but mrs dodd she was found laughing heartily in a corner without any sound of laughter being detected and pointed out by julia she said with a little crow he means his wife yes certainly bring your emulcentpretending he had used that more elegant wordand then they will all see how well you can behave accordingly he brought a lady who was absurdly pretty to be the mother of several grown young ladies and gentlemen and two shades more quiet and placid than mrs dodd she quietly had her chair placed by dr sampsons and whenever he got racy she put a hand gently on his shoulder and by some mesmeric effect it moderated him as neptune did the waves in the aeneid she was such a mistress of this mesmeric art that she carried on a perfect conversation with her other neighbour yet modulated her lion lord with a touch of that composing hand in a parenthetical manner and even while looking another way this hand soft as down yet irresistible suppressed the great art of healing vital chronometry the wrongs of inventors the collusions of medicine the mad ox and all but drawingroom topics at the very first symptom and only just allowed the doctor to be the life and soul of the party julia and mrs dodd had a good cry at parting of course alfred consoled them reminded them it was only for a week and carried off his lovely prize who in the carriage soon dried her eyes upon his shoulder then she applied to her new lord and master for information they say that you and me are one now said she interrogatively he told her triumphantly it was so at that rate you are julius and i am elfrida said she that is a bargain said he and sealed it on the sweet lips that were murmuring heaven so near him in this soretried and now happy pair the ardour of possession lasted long and was succeeded by the sober but full felicity of conjugal love and high esteem combined they were so young and elastic that past sorrows seemed but to give one zest more to the great draught of happiness they now drank day by day they all lived together at albion villa thanks to alfred he was by nature combative and his warlike soul was roused at the current theory that you cannot be happy under the same roof with your wifes mother that is cant said he to mrs dodd let us you and i trample on it hand in hand my child said poor mrs dodd sorrowfully i am a poor hand at trampling and everybody says a motherinlaw in the house bores a young gentleman sadly if a young gentleman cant live happy with you mamma said he kissing her he is a little snob that is all and not fit to live at all delenda est cantilena that means down with cant they did live together and behold eleven french plays with their thirtythree english adaptations confuted to the end of time creatures so highbred as mrs dodd never fidget one there is a repose about them they are balm to all those they love and blister to none item no stranger could tell by mrs dodds manner whether edward or alfred was her own son oh you happy little villa you were as like paradise as any mortal dwelling can be a day came however when your walls could no longer hold all the happy inmates julia presented alfred with a lovely boy enter nurses and the villa showed symptoms of bursting two months more and alfred and his wife and boy overflowed into the next villa it was but twenty yards off and there was a double reason for the migration as often happens after a long separation heaven bestowed on captain and mrs dodd another infant to play about their knees at present and help them grow younger instead of older for tender parents begin life again with their children the boys were nearly of a size though the nephew was a month or two older than his uncle a relationship that was early impressed on their young minds and caused those who heard their prattle many a hearty laugh mrs dodd said a lady i couldnt tell by your manner which is yours and which is your daughters why they are both mine said mrs dodd piteously and opening her eyes with gentle astonishment as years rolled on dr sampson made many converts at home and abroad the foreign ones acknowledged their obligations the leading london physicians managed more skilfully they came into his ideas and bit by bit reversed their whole practice and twenty years after sampson began to strengthen the invalid at once instead of first prostrating him and so causing either long sickness or sudden death but with all this they disowned their forerunner and still called him a quack while adopting his quackery this dishonesty led them into difficulties to hide that their whole practice in medicine was reversed on better information they went from shuffle to shuffle till at last they reached this climax of fatuity and egotismthe type of disease is changed natura mutatur non nos mutamur o mutable nature and immutable doctors o unstable omniscience and infallible nescience the former may err the latter neverin its own opinion at this rate draining the weak of their life blood was the right thing in cervantes day and when he observed that it killed men like sheep and said so under the head of sangrado he was confounding his own age with an age to come three hundred years later in which coming age depletion was going to be wrong molierein lashing the whole scholastic system of lancet purge and blister as one of slaughtercommitted the same error mistook his century for one to come and sampson thirty years ago sang the same tune and mistook his inflammatory generation for the cool generation as yet unborn in short it is the characteristic of a certain blunder called genius to see things too far in advance the surest way to avoid this is not to see them at all but go blindly by the cant of the hour race moutonuiere va sampson was indignant at finding that these gentry after denouncing him for years as a quack were pilfering his system yet still reviling him he went in a towering passion and hashed them by tongue and pen told them they were his subtractors now as well as detractors asked them how it happened that in countries where there is no sampson the type of disease remains unchanged depletion is the practice and death the result as it was in every age no man however stout can help being deeply wounded when he sees his ideas stolen yet their author and publisher disowned many mens hearts have been broken by this but i doubt whether they were really great men dont tell me lilliput ever really kills brobdignag except of course when brobdignag takes medical advice of lilliput dr sampson had three shields against subtraction detraction and all the wrongs inventors endure to wit a choleric temper a keen sense of humour and a good wife he storms and rages at his detracting pupils but ends with roars of laughter at their impudence i am told he still hopes to meet with justice some day and to give justice a chance he goes to bed at ten for says he jinny us jinny us take care of your carcass and explains that no genius ever lived to ninety without being appreciated if chatterton and keats had attended to this they would have been all right if james watt had died at fifty he would have been all wrong for at fifty he was a failure so was the painter etty the english tishin and then he accumulates examples his last distich bearing on hard cash is worth recording miss julee said he y are goen to maerry int a strange family where th ijjit puts the jinnyus intil a madhus which like most of the droll things this man said was true for soft tommy and alfred were the two intellectual extremes of the whole tribe of hardies mrs archbold disappointed both in love and revenge posed her understanding and soothed her mind with frank beverley and opium this soon made the former deep in love with her and his intellect grew by contact with hers but one day news came from australia that her husband was dead now perhaps i shall surprise the reader if i tell him that this edith archbold began her wedded life a good confiding loving faithful woman yet so it was the unutterable blackguard she had married he it was who laboured to spoil her character and succeeded at last and drove her unwilling at first to other men the news of his death was like a showerbath it roused her she took counsel with herself and hope revived in her strong head and miserable heart she told frank and watched him like a hawk he instantly fell on his knees and implored her to marry him directly she gave him her hand and turned away and shed the most womanly tear that had blessed her for years i am not mad you know said poor frank i am only a bit of a muff to make a long story short she exerted all her intelligence and with her help frank took measures towards superseding his commission of lunacy now in such a case the lord chancellor always examines the patient in person what was the consequence instead of the vicarious old wolf who had been devouring him at third and fourth hand frank had two interviews with the chancellor himself a learned grave upright gentleman who questioned him kindly and shrewdly and finding him to be a young man of small intellectual grasp but not the least idiotic or mad superseded his commission in defiance of his greedy kinsfolk and handed him his property he married edith archbold and she made him as happy as the day was long for the first year or two she treated his adoration with goodnatured contempt but as years rolled on she became more loving and he more knowing they are now a happy pair and all between her first honest love and this her last seems to her a dream so you see a female rake can be ameliorated by a loving husband as well as a male rake by a loving wife it sounds absurd and will offend my female readers and their unchristian prejudices but that blackbrowed jade is like to be one of the best wives and mothers in england but then mind you she had alwaysbrains i do not exactly know why horace puts together those two epithets just and tenacious of purpose perhaps he had observed they go together to be honest i am not clear whether this is so on the grand scale but certainly the two features did meet remarkably in one of my charactersalfred hardie the day the bank broke he had said he would pay the creditors he now set to work to do it by degrees he got the names and addresses lived on half his income and paid half away to those creditors he even asked julia to try and find maxley out and do something for him but dont let me see him said he trembling for i could not answer for myself maxley was known to be cranky but harmless and wandering about the country julia wrote to mr green about him alfreds was an uphill game but fortune favours the obstinate as well as the bold one day about four years after his marriage with julia being in london he found a stately figure at the corner of a street holding out his hand for alms too dignified to ask it except by that mute and touching gesture it was his father then as truly noble natures must forgive the fallen alfred was touched to the heart and thought of the days of his childhood before temptation came father said he have you come to this yes alfred said richard composedly i undertook too many speculations especially in land and houses they seemed profitable at first too but now i am entirely hampered if you would but relieve me of them and give me a guinea a week to live on i would forgive all your disobedient conduct alfred bit his lip had a wrestle with the old adam and said gently come home with me sir he took him to barkington bag and baggage and his good christian wife received the old man with delight she had prayed day and night for this reconciliation finding his son so warm and being himself as cool richard hardie entrapped alfred into an agreement to board and lodge him and pay him a guinea every saturday at noon in return for this alfred was to manage richards property and pocket the profits if any alfred assented the old man chuckled at his sons simplicity and made him sign a formal agreement to that effect this done he used so sit brooding and miserable nearly all the week till guinea time came and then brightened up a bit one day alfred sent for an accountant to look after his fathers papers and see if matters were really desperate the accountant was not long at work and told alfred the accounts were perfectly clear and kept in the most admirable order the cash balance is l said he and many of the rents are due it is an agent you want not an accountant what are you talking about a balance of l alfred was stupefied the accountant however soon convinced him by the figures it was so alfred went with the good news to his father his father went into a passion that is one side of the account ye fool said he think of the rates the taxes the outgoings you want to go from your bargain and turn me on the world but i have got you in black and white tight tight then alfred saw the truth and wondered at his past obtuseness his father was a monomaniac he consulted sampson and sampson told him to increase the old mans comforts on the sly and pay him his guinea a week its all you can do for him then alfred employed an agent and received a large income from his fathers land and houses and another from his consols the old gentleman had purchased westward of hyde park square and had bought with excellent judgment till his mind gave way alfred never spent a farthing of it on himself but he took some for his fathers creditors all justice is good said he even wild justice some of these unhappy creditors he found in the workhouse the misses lunley that survived were there alas he paid them their four thousand pounds and restored them to society the name of hardie began to rise again from the dust now while richard hardie sat brooding and miserable expecting utter ruin and only brightening up on guinea day julia had a protege with equally false views but more cheerful ones it was an old man with a silver beard and a machine with which he stamped leather into round pieces of silver in his opinion nothing could have shaken that notion out of his mind julia confirmed it she let it be known that she would always cash five pieces of round leather from mr matthews mint per day and ten on friday when working men are poorest she contrived this with diabolical no angelical cunning to save the old man from ridicule and to do his soul much good all souls were dear to her what was the consequence he went about with his mint and relieved poor people and gratified his mania at the same time his face began to beam with benevolence and innocent selfsatisfaction on richard hardies all was cordage and deep gloom sat on his everknitted brow of these two men which was the rich man he who had nothing yet thought he possessed enough for himself and his neighbours or he who rolled in wealth but writhed under imaginary poverty one reflection more do not look to see providence dash the cup of prosperity from every dishonest hand or you will often be disappointed yet this if you look closer you shall often see such a man holds the glittering cup tight and nectar to the brim but into that cup a shadowy hand squeezes some subtle ingredient which turns that nectar to wormwood richard hardie died his end being hastened by fear of poverty coming like an armed man and his guinea a week going matthews met with an accident and being impervious to pain but subject to death was laid beside his poor mistress in st annes churchyard julia buried him and had a headstone put to his grave and when this was done she took her husband to see it on that stone was fresh carved the true name of the deceased james maxley i have done what you told me said julia her sweet voice trembling a little even she did not quite know how her husband would take it or bear it i know it said alfred softly i saw who your matthews was but i could not speak of him even to you he looked at the grave in silence julias arms were round his neck in a moment and her wet cheek consoling his you have done right my good christian wife i wish i was like you my poor little jenny richard hardies papers were found in perfect order and among them an old will leaving l to edward dodd on this being announced to edward he suggested that it was a fraud alfred had been at him for a long time with offers of money and failing there and being a fine impetuous fellow had lost his temper and forged a will in his edwards favour this scandalous defence broke down the document was indisputable and the magic sum was forced down master edwards throat nilly willy thus rose the hard cash a second time from the grave all this enabled the tenacious alfred to carry out a deeplycherished design hardies late bank had been made into a shop but it belonged to mrs dodd he bought it of her and set up the bank again with edward as managing partner this just suited edward who sadly wanted employment hardie co rose again and soon wiped out the late disgraceful episode and looked on to the past centuries of honour and good credit no creditor of richard hardie was left unpaid alfred went in for politics stood for barkington was defeated by seventeen took it as a matter of course told his friends he had never succeeded in anything at first nor been beaten in the end stood again and became m p for barkington whence to dislodge him i pity any one who tries for a long time mrs dodd was nervous and used to wake with a start at night and put out her hand to make sure david was not lost again but this wore off for years the anniversary of that fatal day when he was brought home on the stretcher came back to them all as a day of gloom but that wore off sometimes the happiness of her family seemed incredible to her remembering what they had all gone through at first their troubles were too terrible and recent to be discussed but even that wore off and they could talk of it all and things bitter at the time became pleasant to remember one midsummer day they had all dined together rather early at albion villa and sat on the lawn with mrs dodds boy and julias boy and girl playing about these ladies knees now after a little silence mrs dodd who had been thinking quietly of many things spoke to them all and said if my children and i had not been bosomfriends we never should have survived that terrible time we have passed through my dears make friends of your children my child ah that i will said julia and caught up the nearest brat and kissed it impetuously for wifehood and maternity had not unjuliad her it wasnt only our being friends mamma said edward it was our sticking together so in looking back on the story now ended i incline to mrs dodds conclusion almost my first word was that she and her children were bosomfriends and my last is to congratulate them that it was so think of their various trials and temptations and imagine what would have become of them if family love and unity had not abounded their little house was built on the sure foundation of true family affection and so the winds of adversity descended and the floods came and burst upon that house but could not prevail against it it was founded on a rock
